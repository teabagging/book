George MacDonald later published some children's books of his own including &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and many others which are fantastic and every child should read them.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book.

The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works.

Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk? Because it can produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front. That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares.

I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N.

I had always thought these were just short childrens books, I was surprised when I found out how big they were! I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'.

Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician).

My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths. These are not so well known."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Its hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this brilliant book. Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

She incounters many people and creatures along the way. She is told many stories and riddles while she travels through wonderland. My favorite thing throughout the story, was when Alice kept saying that she would have to write a book about this place when she got home.

Recently, I stumbled upon the book and started skimming it and I was completely blown away!!! There are so many brilliant layers of wit and humor between the lines which I never noticed as a kid. There are twists and turns and endless puns and word games with every turn of the page. This is as much a novel for adults as it is for kids, maybe even more so! Lewis Carroll was a creative genius and I can't think of another writer who has ever created characters more colorfully endearing and comically puzzling at the same time.

When I first read this novel, I wanted to go through the same thing Alice went through in the story. Following a rabbit, going down a rabbit hole, drinking a potion that makes you either larger or smaller, meeting such wonderful and strange creatures just seems as such an amazing and unforgettable experience.This book is a must read novel for everyone, and it shall continue to be a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"My first exposure to this classic children's story was when I watched the 1951 Disney version, \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" I remember as a kid, loving it, but actually feeling a bit scared by it. As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are. Do not miss it, as this is a timeless piece of literature that everyone should definitely read at least once."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion.

The movies are based on a combination of elements from both books, includnig quirky poems with imaginary words.There were a lot of concepts that aren't in any movies I've seen, such as the talking chess pieces.

I just LOVED the characters that Alice encounters on her adventures and I also loved the story's word-play and witticism.Out of the two stories, Through the Looking Glass, although less famous, is the more linear and I think entertaining but both are amazingly creative and bizarre stories and are both short enough so that they should be read together."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I really like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel because it is so whimsical. The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time. Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original! Truly a classic for the child in all of us!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I would argue that this text offers more than WONDERLAND.

To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work.

I reread this with some trepidation as I remembered reading and enjoying it several times as a child, but was pleasantly surprised to find it just as magical as I did then.I won't bore anyone with the details of the story as I'm sure that most who are reading this review are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed.

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page. Overall this book could use a better plot, but it keeps the reader interested with great characters and odd twists."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"i think this book is very good for girls in my age..because sometimes i also would like to flie out of this stressy world and alice is able to.."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Puchased for my teenage daughter who loves the classics.Book as described - good seller"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school.

If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing.

This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Oh, how I long for those days of innocence, when I could trust in all that I held dear and holy. When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really. Um... so... anything you want to tell me about \\"The Jungle Book\\"?[The review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine, Issue 2.]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I'm going to assume that we've all read and loved Alice's Adventures, and focus instead on reviewing this gorgeous edition.

One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel's classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice's adventures there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Of course the story is fun but I don't like the way the ebook is formatted and there's no Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This is a book that seems to stay with what Lewis Carroll wanted these books to be.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter.

I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself.

You will always enjoy these for your family and pass on to future generations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice in Wonderland begins as a questioning, youthful girl named Alice tumbles down the rabbit hole to follow a white rabbit wearing a vest and watch. Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues). The drawings by Tenniel are brilliant and add the right flavor to the story. The book is well-written, surreal with bizarre, fascinating characters (whom a little girl has to figure out), unique situations, word play, puzzles and a mocking irreverent tone towards high society. Whenever as an adult I'd hit a snag and couldn't read, I would always pull out this one and it would put me back on track again. Another I will treasure for the memories of sharing it with my kid."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This book was an interest in my eyes. It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I read the book, \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" This is a very good book to read but it can also get very confusing if you don't read it thoroughly. The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up. This book is really good, give it a try it will take you into a magnificent world and you will never want to come back!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"THE ULTIMATE FAIRYTAIL.

This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland HTML Editionis a POOR CHOICE - 2 stars. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice. Her travels through Wonderland are still lots of fun."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"My son stayed at home \\"sick\\" and I said he couldn't watch TV or play computer but he could listen to this audio book.

The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago.

There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story.

The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far. (The movie leaves out alot of the best parts.)I suggest you pick up a copy. It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a classic that all young spirited people should read. It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"One gets very bored for something good to read. This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him. I always saw the movies but this was the first I actually read the book. I thought it quite better than any of the movies.

The characters created be Lewis Carroll are fantastic, you can see people of all shapes and sizes. You can see many people such as the King and Queen of Hearts and the Duchess, but mostly you see many creatures roaming around. There is the white rabbit who wears a waist coat, or the caterpillar who sits on a mushroom, or the beloved Cheshire Cat: a cat who causes mischief wherever he goes, he also has the talent of dissapearing and reapearing.

But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again. I am glad to have read them, though, as Alice's tale is a classic one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I have been reading some chapter books with my preschooler and she has really enjoyed it.

Alice was getting tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, when the White rabbit with pink eye's runs by saying \\"Oh Dear! Oh Dear!

I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader. Either that or all of the underlying things were topical and with the book being written in the late 1800's most of those things would have been lost on me.The Good: It was an easy read the characters were quite unusual and Carroll definitely had an imagination.The Bad: besides my thinking it was going to be better than it was not much. It was somewhat confusing at times.Overall it was an Ok read however with all the hype and rumored greatness surrounding the story I was slightly disappointed.Through the looking Glass. The less known second story about Alice is which she enters a looking glass (Mirror) world where you must move in the opposite direction to get where you desire to go. The world is divided into a grid like a checkers or chess board with the ultimate goal is to make it to opposite side of the board and to become a queen.The Good: Same as the first, lots of imagination and unique characters.The Bad: not too much, like the firs it was a little confusing at times.It was Similar to the first with regard of craziness and characters however slightly inferior to the first."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained.

My teacher said it would be a great one to read. If it wasn't so confusing, it would be a great book for younger children. I really didn't enjoy it though, because the lot seemed a little too young for me. Anyone over the age of twelve, might not be interested in it. Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing. On her adventure, she walks through a series of rooms and can't find her way out. Will she ever make it out? Read the boook to find out."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was required reading for one of my present classes, if this had not been the case, I'm certain I would not have finished it for the sake of enjoyment. I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"The stories in this book are familiar to most, but are incredible to read nonetheless.

I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought.

According to Charles H.

This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book.

It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body.

It's much more complicated than that. It looks inside dreams. It's all just a big trip. And everyone knows about the Caterpillar with his hookah...... Good but easy read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Both books are very good. I read both of these when I was 11. The story is fun and it really makes your imagination go wild. All though the story is about strange creatures and people, it is also about real life things. At some points the story was boring, but never for long, because something un-expected would always happen. This is a wonderful book, that everyone who can read English should read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"\\"Sublime nonsense\\" - is the nutshell that this book is. It's not cleverness - its just randomness disquised as cleverness. It just tosses a bunch of nothing together, shakes it up, mixes in a curious and rude little girl who's rudeness pales next to the characters she encounters in Wonderland. Those thousand monkeys at typewriters would produce something along these lines before getting to Shakespeare. For some reason, I never read this when I was discovering Narnia or Oz. Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to. Wonderland isn't even a world much less a persuasive daydream. Nothing there matters. And Alice just skips off at the end, leaving her sister to forecast a bit of standard drivel about the day when they will be grownups but always have their childhood inside. Meh."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking glass are two interesting stories. When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story. I found both stories a challenging read, and was relieved when the book was finally over!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I ordered the Penguin Classics version of this book, and the seller shipped me the Signet Classics version."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Ugh, I found both \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" & \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" to be thoroughly frustrating and painstaking to read.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me. The only point I got from it was an internal conflict of whether to take one road or not, like whether to take and drink certain things and what she should do with the moment."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure.

It can be read and enjoyed by all ages, but I think the subtleties can be best enjoyed by those who are a bit older e.g. the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, the croquet game featuring the Queen of Hearts etc. I was reminded of how much the tea party reminded me of a previous job that I had involving a variety of board members.I guess there is only only one word to describe this classic, 'timeless'."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"THIS IS A BOOK WICH ONE SHOULD ANALYSE FOR ONESELF!And NO, one cannot overanalyse this book, the symbols in it are like the branches of a tree.

And to those who say it was confusing and full of nonesense, I have an explanation. The story was made up by Carroll on a boat ride to Alice Liddell and her other two sisters. Alice wanted to hear a story with lots of nonesense, and that's what Carroll did. If you still do not get it, I can't put it any more clearly.

The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows?

Still, the wordplay is ingenious and the book is an all around treat."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Believe it or not, there was a time when the world was seen as a place where imagination had no place. It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns. A good read if you're tired of the machinization of any age and need to have some good old fashion unpredicatable fun!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I must confess I had never read the account of Alice's adventures before. As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before. This is the sign of marvelous talent and proves that he is one of the best authors and story tellers ever."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"The book ''Alice in Wonderland Through The Looking Glass'' was an interesting book.

The ending was nice because it was just good to know she got what she wanted. This book is good and confusing but it is worth while."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I loved Alice in Wonderland growing up.

So much going on its hard to keep up, but it does a great job at keeping one's attention. Both stories were great, but i liked the original one a little better than the sequel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I first read theAlice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)books as a child, armed with my own library card. Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around.

Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland.

The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

The order came in time and was brand new as I expected it to be.If you havent read it, you should do so."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Lewis Carroll's Alice stories are two of my favorite stories of all time. I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words.

This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book. So if you like fantasy and like to have a few laughs, this is the book you have to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book. It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting. The unorthodox type setups (such as the mouse's tale) are mostly preserved and the illustrations look good. One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book. And I noticed the table of contents link in the item menu does take you there. I never thought to look for a table of contents at the back of the book. My error. The poetry lines breaking in the middle of words persisted throughout the whole book. This was distracting and disappointing."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel! This edition includes all of them and the quality of the reproductions on the pages are excellent. Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This threadbare bargain-priced edition may seem like a deal, but consider before purchasing that it has no table of contents, no introduction, no forward, no illustrations, and no bibliography. Adding insult to injury, the layout of this edition is easily one the worst ever for a reprint, with all words that originally appeared in italics for emphasis printed here in big block caps, as if the typesetting was done by an abrasive kid trying to get attention in an on line chat...IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN.If you really want to explore and experience Lewis Carroll's classic, getThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition-- for the price on Amazon, it's the real bargain. I also highly recommendAlice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland. Both of these books are a must for serious Alice fans as well as those just getting into Carroll's classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven because I thought that I might be missing out on something if I didn't. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland kind of boring but still good. Then I read Through the Looking Glass, and I loved it! I memorized all of the poems (jabberwocky being my favorite poem in the world), read it about a million times, and recomended it to people. Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book. The poem at the very end of the book was so sad in way. it really summed up about how I feel about the magic of childhood."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares!

Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Communities of Dissent: A History of Alternative Religions in America (Religion in American Life)","review":"This book was a joy to read. I recommend it to anyone who wants a brief history of alternative religions/cults in America. The author does a great job of giving the reader a feel for the orgins, ideas, and impact of many different religions.Now what this book does not do is provide an indepth look at religions. All religions are covered in brief.The one glaring flaw of this book is that the author sees virtually all religions and cults through rose colored glasses. He does a great job of showing the positive aspects of various religions/cults but ignores the down side.An additional book I recommend is THE NEW BELIEVERS by David V. Barrett. It provides a more contemporary account of America's and Britian's alternative religions and cults. It tends to focus more on the beliefs and practices of various religious movements rather than their history."},{"Title":"Communities of Dissent: A History of Alternative Religions in America (Religion in American Life)","review":"The book mentions and breifly describes many alternative religions or new religious movements (NRMs) that started in the United States, from the colonial period through modern times.For my taste, too much time is spent providing many examples, just to support the few main points the author is trying to make. I would like more depth. There just wasn't enough information about any of the NRMs. And the author sounds like he wants us to respect, honor and love them all as if they were each beloved children. Hogwash. He is right to try to provide understanding, and show that there is no reason to hate these NRMs or anyone involved in them. But he just goes farther than I think he should, and farther than anyone should. After all, some of these NRMs have proven to be downright tragic, if not evil. And personally, I extend that all religions, old and new, big and small, aminstream and alternative.Also, he almost completely ignores one of the biggest NRMs ever - the Mormons. Why? Were they too successful? Or are they now too mainstream, even though they still cling to modern prophets like NASCAR fans to Dale Jr.But if you want an easy to read pamplet that will give you some idea of the number and basic characteristics of most of the new religions created in America, then this book is worth a read. You can have my copy."},{"Title":"Money for Nothing: Politicians, Rent Extraction, and Political Extortion","review":"Fred McChesney here develops his original idea of rent extraction -- and it's an idea that renders understandable much of what the government does.

Toai became a National Liberation Front (NLF, Viet Cong) supporter as a high school student and rose to be an important student leader in the Saigon University during the late 1960's. He published a student magazine Tu Quet, (Self Determinination) and unswervingly followed the Viet Cong's highly-attractive propaganda line, \\"Peace, Freedom, Independence, Neutrality, and Social Welfare.\\"Toai never formally joined the Viet Cong, but, for nationalistic and idealistic reasons, he served it superbly. He led takeovers of the Vietnamese National Assembly and the Cambodian Embassy in Saigon, and lectured at Berkley to American anti-war activists (who thought his views too tame). After the North Vietnamese Army imposed peace in 1975, he became a senior official of the Ministry of Finance under the Provisional Government. He soon disagreed on purely professional grounds with a superior official and was quickly and unceremoniously tossed into jail.Toai had previously read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago and dismissed its substance as propaganda. When arrested, he vividly recalled Gulag's chapter 2, entitled \\"Arrest,\\" in which the freshly arrested victim invariably thinks, \\"Who me? What for? It's a mistake, they'll clear it up.\\" Toai consoled himself that the Gulag was in \\"old\\" Russia, and that he was in the \\"new\\" Vietnam. It turned out that there was no significant difference. He lived through two and a half years of horrors that may seem unbelievable to those who have not read Solzhenitsyn's works.Toai was never charged with any offense, and was thus jailed for no reason at all. His wife, a French citizen, managed to return to France and from there won his freedom. As he was being released, the fact that there was no official reason whatever for either his arrest or his release caused bureaucratic gyrations that would have been hilarious had the issue been less serious.During much of his time in prison, Toai was befriended by Nguyen Van Hien, an old and often-jailed Vietminh cadre from before the time that Ho Chi Minh left the Soviet Comintern and returned to Vietnam. Hien asked Toai to recall the NLF's program, a shining beacon - promulgate all democratic freedoms, amnesty to all political detainees, abolish all concentration camps, and strictly ban all illegal arrests and imprisonments. \\"What do you make of all that now,\\" asked Hien, and his expression suggested, \\"We've all been taken in...Look around you stupid, what do you see?\\"Incredibly, despite his sufferings and disillusionment, Hien remained a loyal communist. Like uncountable thousands of other idealists before him, he still grasped his lifelong ideal although he probably understood that he had been purged purely because he knew too much. \\"I've never eaten chocolate,\\" he said. \\"I'll probably never know what it tastes like.\\"Toai eventually spoke again to former anti-Vietnam war activists in the U.S., thinking that he had something important to tell them. He was wrong. Most of them didn't want to listen.(Published in a local newsletter in 1987.)"},{"Title":"The Vietnamese Gulag","review":"This is a well written book, very compelling story, but that title does not do justice to the story. This book is no more about the gulags of Vietnam than it is about the cu chi tunnels of the Mekong delta.The story is a case of mistaken identity; Mr. Toai is mistaken for another Ngo Vuong Toai and apprehended by the communist authorities as they swept thru Ho Chi Minh City after reunification in 1975. As a result of this mistake, Toai is witness to the brutality of the prison system and the indifference of the communist cadre.He has a very captivating narration style which is refreshing in the prison gulag genre. This is not the ivan denisovich day by day account of prison life. Toai cleverly weaves his whole entire biography into the story to illustrate the various stages in the takeover of south Vietnam in the post reunification period.The problem is that Toai is incarcerated in couple of Prisons in Ho Chi Minh City and at no point does he go to the actual gulag. His observations are limited to accounting some new arrivals that had come from the reeducation camps, the Vietnamese euphemism for work camps where prisoners are worked to death.The book doesn't even go into any detail about these prisoners returning from the gulag. There is scant mention of the camps, no details on their names and locations, and does not go into vast network of work camps and new economic zones.What is most fascinating about this book is the portion where Toai recounts his visit to California in the late 60s. Toai was semi famous in the student movement groups as an agitator against the South Vietnamese Regime. However, personally he was not communist, or anti-communist, but a real nationalist.His disillusion upon meeting the American student organizers in Berkeley was very intriguing. The students were blindly pro communist, and were disappointed that Toai was not more virulent in his support of communism.This book is a great way to learn about the history of Vietnam in the post reunification period. A period of time that does not get much attention as the American social conscious evaporated out when our military involvement stopped."},{"Title":"The Vietnamese Gulag","review":"I read this right after reading HO CHI MINH by Duiker. Toai presents himself as a naive, idealistic student swept into the 1960s radicalism in South Vietnam. He worked with people he says he didn't know were communists, cadres from the NLF who manipulated people like Toai in their objective of undermining the government of the south while also attacking the United States and American involvement in the war started and run by the north under Ho et al.After some years of enjoying the ego-gratifying celebrity status as a leading activist and seeing his face and name on tv and in the papers, once the NLF and NVA marched into Saigon he quickly took a job in one of their administrations. The sinecure was not to last however, and he found himself unexpectedly tossed into prison as a political risk for a couple of years. Once released, he used his wife's French citizenship to get to France - another country whose policies and involvement in Indochine he had been attacking for so long - and thence on to the USA where he still retained some celebrity status with anti-war left activists and the university system.Toai acknowledges that the Hanoi takeover was/is not a bowl of cherries. But, his great omission is not taking sufficient responsibility for his own actions in helping that reality come to pass. I accept the idea of according youth a certain level of mitigation in their escapades but surely even someone like Toai must have grasped what was going on. Unless he was a complete and utter fool he would surely have known the nature of the system in Hanoi and what it would install in Saigon. His working to help the NLF/NVA take over the south made the extension of that communist system an obvious foregone conclusion as he must surely have known that at least some of his fellow activists were undercover cadres. At any rate, I don't wholly buy the 'I was young, naive, idealistic...' explanation.The worst thing about his case is that he is allowed into France and then into the United States to take up permanent residence, after all those years of working against both countries. He did what he could to bring about the nightmare in his native Vietnam, and my feeling is that such people should be required to live with what they helped create. Instead of giving these people sanctuary from their own follies, they really ought to be deported back to Nam and its socialist paradise. Perhaps taking along Joan Baez, Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Bill Ayers, and all the rest to enjoy the socialist heaven along with Toai. Perhaps Comrade Obama would care to accompany?"},{"Title":"The Vietnamese Gulag","review":"I've read alot about the American Vietnam Era, but always by Americans, about the Americans.

Thanks to one of my clients who decided to call the Los Angeles information directory and found Thomas Griner phone number, I now know that the technique is actually very simple yet very effective. I have to say from personal experiences that the technique actually works. I have to give the book a five star rating, because of this. I do not think that it is the only technique that can solve the problems discussed in the book, but I believe it is one of the many ways that you can use to help your clients or people you know, or even yourself to achieve greater health. This is not a relaxation massage technique, it is an actual &quot;therapeutic&quot; fix-me up technique. Your clients will probably not crave it like they crave relaxation massage, but if they have pain, this is a good way to relieve their pain.

Why is the answer from the Chiropractors always herniated discs, slipped discs, subluxations, etc., etc. and utilize the one-size-fits-all treatments including the standard and continuous \\"cracking\\" of the neck and twisting the spine? I happen to feel that all this \\"cracking\\", twisting, pulling...the moving tables, et al causes MORE spasm which is probably the root problem to begin with and not the other way around.If the spasm could be alleviated then the spine can straighten out due to the fact that the pain is cortorting you. I've been through the pain with the femoral nerve that goes down the side of the leg to the knee and to the foot being so inflamed, that the pain manifested itself only in the knee and I reached the point where I wanted to cut my leg off to get rid of the pain! I had to hold my leg up - favoring it - because I could not walk with it. (Most people in pain tend to favor different areas of the body when in pain.) I finally found a chiropractor that insisted that he had a different treatment and could help me. He pressed deep into the buttock and released the spasm that was causing the nerve to be pinched....but this is after 3 prior chiropractors made my pain worse!Mr. Griner, I would definitely say, has something here and I WISH that more Chiropractors, Osteopaths, Physical Therapists and Massage Therapists would learn this technique and truly help their patients alleviate their pain!Unfortunately some prior reviewers found issue with some of the illustrations, which may or may not be correct, but I think when reading this book, the whole picture should be taken into account...that is what Mr. Griner's main point is."},{"Title":"What's Really Wrong with You?: A Revolutionary Look at How Muscles Affect Your Health","review":"A Revolutionary Look at How Muscles Affect Your Health, by Thomas GrinerA great alternative to chiropractic manipulation, neuro-soma may intrest you greatly!

As for multiplayer, DukeNukem 3d is much more fun to play against others. If I were you, I'd test it out at a friend's house first."},{"Title":"Quake","review":"Quake is a fast-paced, first person combat game that combines animproved Doom-style system and monsters with unimproved Doom-styleweapons and storyline.Four &quot;dimensions,&quot; or gamesections, each divided into five to eight levels, comprise the worldof Quake. These sections, &quot;Dimension of the Doomed,&quot;&quot;Realm of Black Magic,&quot; &quot;Netherworld,&quot; and&quot;The Elder World,&quot; are dungeon-like settings infested with awide variety of monsters, traps, secret areas, and hazards. Playersmust locate keys, typically two per level, in order to progress to thefinish. No &quot;action&quot; button(e.g., the space bar in mostDoom-style games) is required to open doors or push buttons; suchfeature are automatically activated when the character is inproximity. Looking and shooting in all directions, including up anddown, and swimming are some of the improvements upon the Doom-stylesystem.A unique interface at the start of a new game allows aplayer to select different hallways for &quot;Easy,&quot;&quot;Medium,&quot; &quot;Hard,&quot; or &quot;Nightmare&quot;difficulty levels (although the entrance to the latter is actuallyhidden, so people don't wander into it accidentally). Once difficultylevel is selected, the player can enter any of the dimensions. Whileit is recommended that the dimensions be played through in order, thissort of interface essentially allows players to switch difficultylevel in between levels, if desired.Characters start off with anaxe--decidely less dramatic than the Doom chainsaw--and a shotgun with25 shells, and rapidly acquire an arsenal of progressively deadlierweapons, including a double-barrelled shotgun, a &quot;nailgun,&quot;a &quot;perforator,&quot; a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a&quot;thunderbolt,&quot; as well as ammunition, armor, and variouspower-ups, such as health, protective suits, rings of invisibility,pentagrams of protection, and a rune that temporarily quadruples yourdamage, turning you into even more of a killing machine. When a newdimension is entered, your character once again starts off with ashotgun and 25 shells (and the stupid axe).Monsters includerottweilers, grunts and enforcers (basic soldier types), knights anddeathknights (heavily armored, sword-wielding fiends), rotfish (tomake the water hazards even more hazardous), zombies that won't staydead, scrags (sort of like flying worms), ogres (armed with chainsawsand grenades), spawns (big ugly bouncing blobs), fiends (demonicwerewolves), vores (spidery monsters), and shamblers (huge beasts thatsling lightning). According to the manual, grunts are &quot;goons withprobes inserted into their pleasure centers, wired up so that whenthey kill someone, they get paroxysms of ecstasy.&quot; Gratefully, noevidence for this is provided in the game.Unfortunately, for allthat it has going for it, many aspects of Quake also suffer from amarked unoriginality. &quot;You get the phone call at 4 a.m. and by5:30 you're in the secret installation,&quot; the introduction to thegame begins. Oh no, not 4 a.m.! Horrors! It then goes on to explainhow you are a top notch government agent that must keep some evilbeing from opening the gates of hell and overrunning the world. Soundfamiliar? It should, seeing as it is the plot for fully half theDoom-style computer games on the market, including Doom. For a gamethat clearly required many months of work to produce, it is a bit sadthat only about 20 minutes went into developing the background.Andwhile the weapons are pretty neat, they are not overlyoriginal. Essentially, you get two types of shotgun, two types ofmachine gun, two types of grenade launcher, and an energy weapon. Oh,and that damned axe, which does not even go &quot;swish&quot; or&quot;chunk.&quot; In short, a selection that does not measure up tothe weapons arrays of Doom or Strife. And some of the monsters, suchas the grunts and enforcers, seem repackaged from earliergames.Overall, however, Quake is a very worthwhile, challenginggame that is certain to be a hit with most people who like this styleof game. Its hackneyed elements do not really detract from play; a bitmore originality, however, might have made this game even moreenjoyable.--Michael Varhola for Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine"},{"Title":"Quake","review":"(whenever I finally got around to sleeping, anyway)It's the creepiest/scariest game of it's time.

A second edition was published in 1959, with a preface attributed to Dora Russell (they married in 1921, for a while). It's not clear what differences were made from the first edition - the preface is worthless trivia and amusingly comments on the 'communist blaock' and 'spirit of free enterprise' despite the fact that book shows that even in 1918 there were huge American trusts. I'm pretty sure I once read the first edition - I remember a phrase something like 'men desire sexual intercourse with all women', which is missing from this version. Unfortunately, Russell was not averse to a bit of editing of his own past - his book 'Which Way To Peace?' published just before 1939 was never reprinted. Dora Black, 'daughter of a senior civil servant', studied Greek, Latin and German, before going to Cambridge where she got a first in Modern Languages. The details seem hard to find - but anyway after her degree she researched in France, so one assumes French was one of her languages. It's not clear to me whether she knew Russian. One has to assume she had something like zero awareness of science, technology, and industry, and I'll assume in what follows that Russell wrote most of the book, despite the claims that it was a joint effort. It seems she loved the Bolsheviks, but, with almost insane hypocrisy, disliked the 'machine age'.First, the title and presentation. It's necessary to spend a little time on these. The title in fact is misleading. The book is in two parts, roughly speaking (1) a retrospective view of industrialism so far, and (2) a theoretical look at ethics and what a good society should be. There's a certain amount on prospects, but not much. Russell unfortunately made little attempt to knit his essays together or signpost them. Thus a number of chapters are subdivided - I, II, and III style - but it's left to the reader to try to deduce the reasons for these subdivisions. So this book leans towards being an atomised collection of essays rather than a unified argument - his 'Human Society in Ethics and Politics' a quarter of a century later has the same rather bitty style.Although I have a high opinion of Russell, this book is so bad that I wonder whether it has any value at all. There are some acute-ish comments, for example comparing cells of a body with individual single-celled creatures (p34 - pagination taken from the Routledge edn) though obviously this sounds Hobbesian. There's a good comparison of Calvinism with industry- for example with inheritance as something like predestination. But a lot is very weak. I'll go through bullet-point fashion---[1] One of Russell's tricks, perhaps taken from set theory, or from Marx on classes, is to start on some topic - generally a buzzword of the time - and then, rather than define it in sufficient detail to be useful, to split it into two parts, and describe those instead, generally in some mutually hostile way. Thus (p18) two growing forces 'stand out .. Industrialism and Nationalism'. He doesn't say why these 'stand out'. He was writing soon after the 'Great War'; one might have thought that Militarism would 'stand out'. Or, in view of the Empire, race issues. Anyway, he describes 'Industrialism' as something like (p19) an extension of normal tools - Russell means the use of huge, expensive, temporarily unproductive factories and installations. He then says 'Industrialism' must be, or is, of two types - 'capitalist' or 'socialist'. And 'Nationalism' has two forms (p25) - one for the bosses, Imperialism; one for the underdogs - Self-determination. This technique is often Russell's way of smuggling in various assumptions.[2] Russell had little feeling for technology and science; and Dora presumably even less so. Russell never quite got the feeling for the difference between description and analysis. All his material on 'Industry' was based on Britain, the USA, and Europe, including steam-powered engines, the cotton cloth industry, coal, and iron. Why did he pick these? He had no predictive technique - if he'd been born in 1700 he could have predicted none of these. His material relies on other peoples' having decided to try these things, and get them to operate. This means all his pontification is somewhat pointless, because he seems to have no way to suggest how it ought to have been different. His mental model of 'Industrialism' is of spoil heaps, muck, sweat, labourers, huge factories, and top-hatted capitalists. (Stalin had a different scheme - on behalf of his foreign controllers, to import factories and arm the USSR for all-out war against Europe. This is 'industrialism' of a sort, too.) Apart from the aims oligrachs might have, there's the issue of techniques: for all Russell knew, simple methods for extracting food and water and heating and clothing, and making tools, might have been on the point of being invented. This thread runs through the entire book, as does his view that there are significant numbers of 'idle rich'. He dislikes these as much as militarists who want to kill people cheaply.[3] Russell tended to regard ideas, and groups of ideas, as purely psychological, and independent of the physical world. To use his own style of commentary, we might divide ideas, or ideologies, into two parts. One part is the set of ideas imposed by ruling groups. The other part is ideas which reflect the actual world. For example, on sexual attitudes, Russell says little about the realities of pregnancy and disease and economics, but treats beliefs purely as though they are tokens which can be altered. A very important mistake in Russell is the assumption that religious beliefs are pure superstitions. He has no feel for the way Christianity may have acted as a 'politically correct' glue binding together assorted groups, as were found in the Roman Empire. This may apply to the Russian Orthodox Church after about 1600 - I don't know; but nor does Russell. And he has no feel for the way tribal cults, notably Judaism and Islam, and also Hinduism, don't permit instant change or conversion.[4] Russell included quite a few Darwinian themes as evidence for some aspects of human behaviour. He thought people had genuine spontaneous friends becuse they were people who would help the befriended person have a maximum number of children. (p151) - 'Our instincts, in the main, are such as would be likely to achieve [a large number of descendants] in a rather uncivilized community.' This contrasts oddly with his comments on nearly-static white populations. He thought there is an instinct of hostility to remote people - and yet how could an instinct evolve in any creature, for creatures so far away it couldn't even know they existed?[5] Russell was rather naive about newspapers. Continuing the previous theme, how can anyone know about faraway places, other than by being told about them? If a genuine instinct for war exists, why is there any need for propaganda at all?[6] Russell had no idea of the influence of Jews, or, if he did, it shows in none of his books. He doesn't mention the 'Federal Reserve'. He notes President Wilson and the 'American' (meaning USA's) entry into the Great War (p180), but has no mention of the Balfour Declaration. He quotes from a 1918 investigation into US meat packing (pp 176-81) - on similar lines to Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle' - but not on US credit and money.[7] Quite an important part of Russell - which I hadn't understood until I read this book - is how Freud's idea of the unconscious was used by Russell to excuse Jews and others. This is how it works: Russell knew the USSR after the Jewish coup was run by Jews - he met a number of them, in fact. They told him they were bringing about socialism, or some other lie, correctly perceiving Russell as a stupid goy. (Russell in this book quotes quite a chunk of writings by Lenin (Ulyanov), pp 92ff, and Trotsky (Bernstein - p74 in a 1922 newspaper letter) In both cases Russell shows no awareness they might be lying.) Russell writes that Bolsheviks, and other more or less autocratic types, are 'unconscious' of the fact that their idea of the State just happens to give them a key position in it! How could this possibly apply to a group that spent years of planning against the Tsar?[8] Russell's idea of 'justice' is spelt out (p 233): '.. no one will inherit money, no one will own more land than he can cultivate himself, no one will be supported in voluntary idleness if he is physically fit for work. ....' It's clear that, though Russell expects progress, he has no reliable way to ensure it will happen, or happen in the right direction. However he says (pp 234-5) '.. Socialism.. is only possible .. if the population is stationary... the less prolific races will have to defend themselves against the more prolific by methods which are disgusting even if they are necessary. In the meantime our aspirations .. have to be confined to the white races.. perhaps with the inclusion of the Japanese and Chinese..' The second part of the book is clearly largely rhetorical. Incidentally this book was published only about a year after his 'The Problem of China' - in my view a better book. Russell found the Chinese loveable, and civilized, and part of his idealism section in this book was clearly based on traditional China, then in its transitional state.[9] Throughout the book there are flickers of such problems as 'the crisis of overproduction' and whether capital equipment should be exported to areas which currently have cheap labour. Russell quotes a book by Lord Leverhulme (who controlled manufacture of soap and other products; his 1918 book was 'The Six Hour Day') and Myers 'Mind and Work' (1900). The first says that, provided there's machinery, six hours a day is enough. The second drew attention to fatigue and stated in effect that productivity was pretty much the same with shorter hours, a lesson reinforced by wartime arms production. It seems to follow that strenuous people would end up running unproductive bureaucracies, fake charities, or frauds of the NASA type, but Russell only notices weapons production in this theoretical result of industrialism. Rather oddly he says nothing of the possibility that 'developed' industrial countries could help other countries build their own machines, something the Bolsheviks were in effect secretly funded to do.The 1996 edition has an introduction by Louis Greenspan, who unfortunately appears to be involved with the large team editing Russell's papers. He comments that Russell's book was published in same year the 'Frankfurt School' was established by Horkheimer. He presumably thinks he's a Jew; the introduction is a disgraceful piece of hackery ignoring the mass murders by 'Jews' in the Soviet Union regime of so-called 'socialism'. The bias is so extreme it casts doubt on the accuracy of the entire McMasters University project on Russell."},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"Willie Garvin, Modesty's loyal partner, makes the above statement just as he and Modesty are about to set out on what becomes an incredibly harrowing and dangerous caper. Willie makes this statement to Modesty (who he calls \\"Princess\\") at a time when he and Modesty have already been dealt a severe blow - they have just discovered that they are not only fighting for themselves and the need to save the world, but must fight for the life of an innocent child who is dear to them. This makes it of utmost importance that they have to defeat the bad guys.\\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is the second book in the Modesty Blaise series of books and was written by Peter O'Donnell in 1966. It is a direct sequel to the first book, with Sir Gerald Tarrant of the British Foreign Service sending Modesty and Willie out on another dangerous mission.As usual for a Modesty Blaise adventure the bad guys are bigger than life and extremely nasty. Karz, the huge Mongol who has assembled an army of mercenaries in northern Afghanistan, is totally ruthless, but still not the most fascinating of the villains.That honor must go to \\"The Twins\\", a grotesque pair of killers who hate each other's guts but must endure each other's constant proximity to avoid insanity. This is because The Twins were once Siamese twins, and even though they were successfully separated, the separation was not viable due to a mutual psychological dependency. Now The Twins wear a harness that joins them at the shoulders, and they spend every minute of their lives linked together.The high point of \\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is the fight to the death between Modesty and The Twins. How can Modesty, completely unarmed, survive in a fight against a four-legged, four-armed, two-headed killing machine?The plot of \\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is fascinating, especially seen in retrospect after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Peter O'Donnell's premise was that oil-rich Kuwait was a plum for the taking, and that in 1966 Kuwait's military defenses were such that they could not withstand a surprise attack by an army of ruthless mercenaries with the amazing firepower of modern weapons.The story of how Modesty and Willie infiltrate Karz' army of mercenaries and their attempts to derail the attack on Kuwait is developed with a sure hand. Peter O'Donnell shows himself once again to be a master storyteller.In this book we are introduced to the American businessman John Dall, a recurring figure in many of the later Modesty books. Willie Garvin's fondness for obscure English words is also presented, another recurring element in the series.In my opinion \\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is one of the best books in the Modesty Blaise series, and well worth five stars. The unique and powerful relationship between Modesty and Willie is presented in a wonderful way, and their forcefulness and drive in the face of huge odds is also great.If I had to mention a couple of negative factors it would have to be the minor inconsistencies that a good editor should have caught. For example, Mr. Vaubois, head of the French secret service, is referred to as L&eacute;on Vaubois in the first half of the book and as Ren&eacute; Vaubois in the last half. Similarly, one of the bad guys is referred to as both \\"Chief Recruiting Officer\\" and \\"Chief Security Officer\\" - on the same page, no less.A few more negatives: Modesty and Willie spend so much time smoking that they come across as nicotine addicts. And the book, like all of the Modesty books, is too short.Highly recommended; both this book in particular and the Modesty Blaise series in general, especially the first six or seven books in the series.Incidentally, you may wish to take a look at my \\"So You'd Like To\\" guide about books by Peter O'Donnell. It includes a link to my MSN group about Modesty Blaise where you can find more information about this whole series of books and an article entitled \\"Why I love the Modesty Blaise books\\".Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"Peter O'Donnell's Modesty Blaise books are, in their way, elegant. They are, of course, thrilling, but the real attraction for me is the relationship between Modesty and Willie Garvin. Some might call Willie Modesty's right-hand man, but that description's not entirely accurate. They are equals who work extremely well together (the escape from the villa in Lisbon in this novel is a suspenseful example) and who care for eachother deeply, but not in a romantic way.Sabre-Tooth is the second in the series. In it, many of the world's most notable mercenaries have disappeared off British Intelligence's radar. Modesty and Willie are enlisted to infiltrate and destroy the organization which has employed the mercenaries. First, though, they have to make it seem as if the master criminal Modesty Blaise has fallen, lost her fortune and is desperate for work. There are several great action set-pieces, some great banter between the leads and more of the exploration of Modesty's past, before she was a free-lance secret agent. In all an excellent read, and I'm looking forward to getting caught up to the four or five I haven't read."},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"Reading Modesty Blaise can be a dreamy experience, then you end up immersed in what you could call close combat porn, almost, with am amazing descriptive level of detail. O'Donnell is the master of this, easily, I think. Modesty and Willie are looking for an angel to help destabilise a small army looking to take over Kuwait, when things get nasty and personal. This Kuwait Liberation Army wants them as section commanders, and to this end, kidnaps their ward as leverage.They have no option but to go along, and things get nasty."},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"I purchased the first two books in this series (Modesty Blaise & Sabre-Tooth) to see how I'd like the characters and writing. After having read both, I'm going to get the other books in the series.I enjoyed the stories, even though it's definately written from a British point of view, and some of the terms used aren't familar to me. Based on context I understand what's meant - and I find it interesting.This series reminds me a lot of the James Bond series, except with partners rather than a solo character lead. It's a good escape into fiction, and I like that!"},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"This is #2 in the series of Modesty Blaise's adventures-- start with the eponymous #1 for her origins and first mission. Here she and Willie, her anima/animus soulmate, take on as nasty a group of bloodthirsty mercenaries as you'd ever want to meet. It's fun all the way.If you like the Bond books, try these-- you'll like them as well. They have the same tongue-in-cheek sense of absurdity/reality, the same slightly-outrageous bad guys with odd physical qualities, bright action sequences, and a real sense of style-- author O'Donnell can't resist telling us what Modesty's wearing (or not wearing) every few pages. This is solid spy genre writing from the sixties, before it got old. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Modesty Blaise","review":"To betray Modesty Blaise is to, at minimum, risk the wrath of Willie Garvin and, at most, to lose everything you hold precious. In SABRE-TOOTH, Modesty and Willie follow up on a hunch of Sir Gerald Tarrant's which turns into a horrific reality. When Jack Fraser tries to intervene in the midst of their infiltration, he is summarily ousted. The stakes are jaw-droppingly high as Modesty and Willie are pushed to their not-inconsiderable limits. The amount of damage done to and by them is enormous, but Peter O'Donnell never loses sight of Modesty and Willie's greatest asset: loyalty to each other. SABRE-TOOTH is a razor-sharp trip into the world of Modesty Blaise!"},{"Title":"Imperial Brain Trust: The Council on Foreign Relations and United States Foreign Policy","review":"Shoup & Minter's devastating research on the planning behind the U.S. Empire is finally back in print 27 years after its 1977 publication by Monthly Review Press! The CFR, the Council on Foreign Relations, was formed by the international wing of U.S. capital after the League of Nations fell apart and inter-imperialist collaboration proved ineffective, leading to WWII. The farsighted few took measures to see that such a debacle did not recur. The CFR, the \\"imperial brain trust\\" of the title, carried out research concerning the optimal strategy for the U.S. in the war. They identified a minimum and maximum \\"Grand Area\\" that the U.S. needed to control, based on an assessment of factors including raw materials, and decided long before Pearl Harbor that the U.S. would need to control the Pacific Basin. War with Japan was the plan, with or without Pearl Harbor. Everything that happened in Europe was secondary to this consideration. The CFR Grand Area planning team was imported wholesale into FDR's State Department -- it became the State Department and directed the war strategy. So the U.S. was not in the war to defend itself, or to fight for Freedom, or to liberate anyone, cherished propaganda to the contrary. The goal was to seize as big a chunk of the globe as possible along with its raw materials and markets. This proved quite successful, of course, and with a few pesky holdouts that were encircled and attacked with variations on containment and rollback over the years, the U.S. Empire replaced the 19th century British Empire, with an unprecedented military reach and military bases everywhere. Since 1945 the sun has never set on the American Empire.The name Noam Chomsky is much better known than Shoup & Minter, and Chomsky's analysis draws heavily on their groundbreaking research. The original source material from the CFR's study project is archived in the library of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, just north of Chicago. It goes without saying that this book is just as timely as ever. For anyone still hypnotized by the sugar-coated lies about the reasons for the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, thinking that we are the selfless Caped Crusaders for Justice, this book is the wakeup call. No, there is no Santa Claus, and no, the U.S. is not \\"doing God's will\\" when it continuously invades country after country. It is the most powerful Empire in history, currently taking action to secure control of the remaining and fast-diminishing reserves of OIL.This is why, all the fulminations of lobotomized Republicans to the contrary, there is such strong bipartisan unity in U.S. foreign policy. The disagreements are all over tactics -- the basic imperial strategy is never in question, and any presidential candidate who does question it, whether from the Right (Buchanan) or the Left (McGovern, Dean) is preemptively defeated by the united efforts of the American ruling class. Of course there was that exception, JFK, and for that there are other methods..."},{"Title":"Imperial Brain Trust: The Council on Foreign Relations and United States Foreign Policy","review":"&quot;Imperial Brain Trust&quot; is one of the most authentic books I have read on this topic. As it was originally an acedamic thesis of the writer, beside it's convincing approach, it does not leave the reader wondering for resources, it gives all bibliographic details to check the sources and matters. Reading this book was a pleasure for me and I am fully agreed with the writers point of view."},{"Title":"Imperial Brain Trust: The Council on Foreign Relations and United States Foreign Policy","review":"This is a MUST read for those wanting to understand the real power structure behind the United States government.The authors provide an excellent historical overview of the Council on Foreign Relations and its original purpose, but the most important contribution that this analysis has to offer, is to reveal how the CFR not only influences but determines US foreign policy.Through their extensive research the authors quote directly from CFR memorandums, publications and speeches, revealing many instances where the Councils own recommendations have become official government policy. While the Council on its own official website portrays itself as an 'independent, non-partisan think tank' it should be obvious after reading this book that it is far from 'independant' as many government officials have been active members of the CFR during their time in office.For example, the authors list the key government decision makers on American Foreign Policy in South East Asia between 1940-1973 (p.246-247) and discover that of the 25 top decision makers, 18 of them were members of the CFR.'But so what?' Some may reply. 'Surely the CFR is only doing what it thinks would be best for the national interest.'And you see, this is where the problem lies. As the authors go on to explain, the interests of the lower classes differ wildly from those of the upper classes (the power elite). The CFR which embodies the upper classes, are concerned with policies that are most helpful in promoting their own interests.This is why perpetual war has been the norm in American history, because those that are pushing for war stand to gain immensely. In order to achieve the ultimate goal of a 'new world order' it is necessary for the CFR to cultivate the right political, economic and strategic conditions, and by engineering one crisis after another, the power elite are in a prime position to establish 'order out of chaos'.By reading this book, you will understand who the invisible rulers are, how they operate, and what their ultimate agenda is. And everytime election season comes around, you will realise why your vote doesn't count as the CFR effectively controls both political parties."},{"Title":"Where Girls Come First: The Rise, Fall, and Surprising Revival of Girls' Schools","review":"I loved this book! It's stuffed full of fascinating historical tidbits, and beautifully written. The history is interleaved with the modern story of the founding of Julia Morgan School for Girls, so it never gets boring. You're always wondering if they'll succeed in creating the school -- it's a page-turner, really (with a happy ending). My favorite kind of book. Thanks Ilana!"},{"Title":"Where Girls Come First: The Rise, Fall, and Surprising Revival of Girls' Schools","review":"Although I did not attend a girls' school myself, I found this book very interesting and thought-provoking.

It is also beautifully written, so it is a just a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Where Girls Come First: The Rise, Fall, and Surprising Revival of Girls' Schools","review":"Enjoyed reading some of this book. There is a lot of information here. The author has taken a great deal of time and effort to share her research into why girls need separate educational facilities. That said, there are still many people for whom, regardless of 'facts', single sex schools cannot be the right answer. Just as in politics and religion, many people have their set of beliefs which no facts or research will ever change. I don't expect this book to win converts, but I do believe it can help people who are attempting to determine the best path for their own child's education."},{"Title":"Yaksas","review":"A classic text on yaksas, fertility goddesses, vegetation spirits, makara, lotus and other elements of Hindu (and Buddhist) iconography written by one of the greatest of Indian art historians (1877-1947) and a former Curator of Indian art in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Its references and bibliography will lead scholars to a treasure chest of important original and secondary sources. Plates with excellent text illustrate the points discussed. Yes, some points have been surpassed by newer findings and research but this brilliant text is basic to understanding Indian art.

While I loved FIRST LAW, THE OATH, and THE HEARING, this one is my all-time favorite. Well-drawn characters, a plot with just the right amount of twists and turns, and an excellent writing style make this one of the most enjoyable reads you'll come across for this genre. Yes, it does take a bit of time to build, but just wait--you won't be disappointed. And why shouldn't Lescroart take his time? He is, after all, miles above your average mystery/thriller writer. You can't go wrong with this one.Also recommended: THE FIRM by Grisham, McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and SPLIT SECOND"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Dismas Hardy is the new managing partner of his reorganized law firm after his former partner was gunned down. A new associate to the firm, Amy Wu, is grieving over the recent loss of her father. She brings the firm a high-profile case in which Andrew Barlett, the seventeen-year-old son of a prominent family is charged with the murder of his pregnant girlfriend and drama coach. Wu tries to keep Andrew in juvenile court where his maximum sentence is eight years as opposed to adult court where it would be life without parole. At first Wu is convinced that Andrew is quilty and pushes him to accept the plea bargain offered by the D.A. in which is admits to his guilt in order to stay in the juvenile system. The problem is he adamantly protests his innocence despite all the evidence against him. With the firm's reputation is on the line, Dismas agrees to sit second chair at the trial.John Lescroart writes one of the best legal thriller series if not the best. His characters are fully realized, emotionally complex people that grow with each book. If you have never read this series, it is not a bad idea to start from the beginning. It would be worth it because most of the books in the series are excellent.Lescroart is able to draw on the reader's emotions regarding his characters. I strongly disliked the Wu character in the beginning of the story. She had this boy's life in her hands and she was just trying to ramrod him through the system because she thought he was guilty. She was busy feeling sorry for herself: drinking, picking up men, overall irresponsible behavior. She was just not a very sympathetic character. In the course of the story, you really get to see her evolution. By the end you can understand why she was acting the way she did and even sympathize with her.Abe Glitsky, another mainstay from the series is also present in a parallel storyline. There is not quite as much interaction between Dismas and Abe this time out, but the storylines do tie together in the end.John Lescroart fans will enjoy this entry in the series and new readers will become fans."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"In San Francisco, Laura Wright and her drama teacher Mr. Mooney are killed in his apartment. Laura's lover, Andrew Bartlett, the father of her unborn child is arrested two months after the double homicide and charged with special circumstances murder. Amy Wu, an associate in the law firm in which Dismas Hardy is the managing partner, takes the case even though she believes her client is guilty.With his parents' permission, Amy plea bargains for her seventeen year old client so that he will plead guilty if he's charged as a minor. She explains to Andrew that he will be remanded to a juvenile youth facility for eight years and then would be a free man. Andrew agrees to Amy's suggestion since the evidence against him is so overwhelming, but at the last minute he declares his innocence. Dismas takes a more active role in the case, seeking evidence, interviewing witnesses and acting as THE SECOND CHAIR in Andrew's upcoming hearing.No doubt about it, Dismas Hardy is the twenty-first century's Perry Mason only more personable since the audience sees his interactions with his employees, friends, wife and children. THE SECOND CHAIR is a great legal thriller with a cast of characters easy to like. The intrinsic workings of the California judicial system especially when it comes to the rights of a juvenile is fascinating to observe. John Lescroart's latest work, THE FIRST CHAIR is definitely heading to the New York Times bestseller list.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Correct me if I am wrong, but a mystery is suppose to be a \\"mystery\\". It is suppose to be hard to figure out for the reader, not impossible, but hard. This was not hard to figure out. Even the good reviews admit, there was not much mystery in this book. If you like MYSTERY, do not touch this book!!He is a good writer, and most of the characters were developed well. (Except for Wu, who was a shallow stereotype.)Halfway thru the book, i am thinking \\"Are these characters stupid?\\" A blind man could see the connections. It was an insult.Wu is suppose to have an IQ of 150, so she is trusted with her FIRST murder trial with no help? That would NEVER happen!!! NEVER EVER!And she makes stupid comments to Hardy, asking him why would the judge not let their client go free? it is the right thing to do. Hardy, then lectures her on how the system works. LOL. It was laughable.Andrew's story? \\"i made it all up!\\" Give me a break!! And the cowel that he wore, just happened to be the same. LOL. And the eye witnessess could not tell the difference between a black guy and a white guy!?!Did anybody notice. That all the victims just happened to be the one who answered the door, even when others were at home.The ending had ONE small surprise. But most of Part 3, was a waste of time. Brandt just happened to guess who the executioner was??? What a stretch!His ability to write good prose and give details, and create a degree of confusion by overloading the story with too many characters is what helps him. But you have to suspend any rational thinking to think this was a good mystery."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"I wasn't certain, in the beginning, that I liked this book as it started off very slowly and I didn't particularly care for Amy. But once Hardy was introduced, as well as Abe Glitsky, the pace picked up and the story became much more interesting. There was a fair amount of back story, which helped me being a new reader, but might have been annoying had I read the previous books. I'd not read Lescroart before, but would certainly read him again."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Those of us who have reveled in the discovery of this author and his Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky novels have been with these two old friends for a long time and through some hair raising and heart breaking times. Hardy, who once was a San Francisco cop is now the managing partner of his San Francisco law firm. Glitsky who was a homicide detective for the SFPD is now a Deputy Chief. Yet, for all their lofty current positions, they are dragged into a compelling drama by the events that are going on around them.Amy Wu is an associate in Hardy's firm. She is dealing the the four month old death of her father by looking for love in all the wrong places when she receives a call from a wealthy couple who's son she has represented in a minor juvenile matter to inform her that &quot;Andrew is in trouble again.&quot; That, it turns out, is an understatement.It seems that Andrew was rehearsing for the school play with the teacher who was directing the play and with his girlfriend. The play is &quot;Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf.&quot; Andrew and his girlfriend have the leads. While taking a break from rehearsing, Andrew takes a break to go for a walk to work on his lines. When he returns he finds them both shot to death.Two months later the police have decided to charge him with murder. His parents (actually Mom and Step-Dad) are horrified. &quot;He said he didn't do it,&quot; says Mom. &quot;I know he didn't do it.&quot; ...&quot;Andrew is not that type of person.&quot;After reviewing the police evidence Amy Wu is not so sure. It turns out that in the past Andrew expressed jealosy of Mr. Mooney, the teacher and his relationship with his girlfriend. He even wrote a short story entitled &quot;Perfect Killer&quot; in which he details how a young man who is jealous of his girlfriend and a teacher plots to murder them and how he does it in such a way as to avoid guilt. He shares the story with his best friend at school. He even starts to bring his step father's gun to school with him in a knapsack. Then there is the yelling and arguing that those living over Mr. Mooney's apartment hear along with crashing and banging down below. When they look out of the window to see what is happening, the husband sees a person he later idetifies as Andrew fleeing the apartment. He then goes down and discovers the vitims. Doesn't look so good for Andrew.Especially after the police find a spent 9mm shell in his car. Especially after he admits to throwing the gun he had been carrying around off the Golden Gate Bridge.In fact, it looks so bad to Amy that she tries to get him to plead guilty to the offense as a juvenile. He will be in jail for only eight years under California law if convicted as a juvenile. She convinces the parents that this is the best way to go and she convinces herself. The one little detail that she fails to cover is convincing her client. Her next error is to tell the Assistant DA that he will plead before she has gotten that nailed down. It all becomes unraveled in juvenile court as the client maintains his innocense and Ms. Wu quickly finds herself in the cross hairs of an angry judge and a furious district attorney. The matter is quickly calendared for a hearing on whether he should be tried as a juvenile or an adult and the outcome looks forgone. Her client, instead of facing eight years will likely be facing life.Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Glitsky is having his own problems with his new job and is embroiled with a high profile decision not to take a known murderer off a bus, but to wait until the passengers disembark and arrest him then. Quick and easy. Except the target smells the police and takes the passengers hostage, killing several before his demands for a helicopter and transportaion are met. He is killed by a sniper on the way to the copter, but the media is merciless in pursuing the matter.As a part of his job, Glitsky becomes aware of a murder where a woman without an enemy in the world is gunned down as she answers her front door. The husband is the only possible suspect, but that is going nowhere. Glitsky decides to talk to him and is also convinced that the husband is innocent. The only thing out of the ordinary that the woman ever did in her life was be a part of a jury many years ago who had convicted a person for murder.Shortly thereafter, the District Attorney is found murdered in the parking lot outside of his office.Dismas Hardy feels that he is responsible for the mess that Amy Wu has created by failing to mentor her properly and decides to sit &quot;second chair&quot; in the deternmination hearing that has been ordered to go forward in five days.To tell more about the story line would be to spoil the fun of reading a master story teller at the top of his game. Suffice it to say that the stories converge and the ending is all that a reader of this type of novel could ask for. I look forward to Lescroat's novels and if you have not discovered him yet, it is high time you did."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Voice performer David Colacci gives a vital, arresting reading of John Lescroart's legal thriller &quot;The Second Chair.&quot; As with previous works by this author there are dramatic courtroom scenes, and easy to relate to characters. His setting is the City by the Bay.Once again lawyer Dismas Hardy and his detective buddy, Abe Glitsky, are paired. Now Glitsky is the Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau and Hardy is managing partner in what seems to be a soon-to-be-successful law firm.Amy Wu, a promising young attorney in his firm, brings him a challenging and headline grabbing case. The son of an upper level San Francisco family, Andrew Bartlett, has been arrested in the double murder of his girlfriend and teacher. He's 17 and the District Attorney is determined to try him as an adult. Wu is equally determined to take the case to juvenile court. However, she needs some help to do this and so she turns to Hardy, asking him to sit second chair.Evidence against young Bartlett seems sound. But there is chaos to come when a string of murders chills San Francisco. Citizens are shot in what are apparently random killings. Thus both Hardy and Glitsky are pitted in challenges that may change their lives - one must try to save a client, the other must stop a psychotic killer.Lescroart just keeps getting better and better.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"I have enjoyed all the series, and thought this one was one of the best. The story is well developed, and the courtroom scenes very readable. However...1) Most any reader figures out the connection between the murders long before the experts do. They weren't as smart as we are, right?2) The coincidence of who the shooter turns out to be is a little much, don't you think?3) And a minor note. Mr. Lescroart must not know Southern Baptists. He has the aged, very conservative Southern Baptist minister wearing A COLLAR (!!!), and living in a rectory! An editor should have caught that gaffe very quickly.All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Attorney Dismas Hardy and his friend Abe Glitsky, Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau, are dealing with mental sequelae from their participation in a murder (in a previous book), which is beginning to have physical effects on both of them.

Both moving down separate avenues which eventually meet.John Lescroart is a mainstay in the courtroom thriller arena and once more delivers an interesting, provocative read. Although it was disconcerting the manner in which Amy Wu assumed her client's guilt and pushed hard for him to cut a deal with the DA, I'm sure this is something fairly common in our legal system.

It took me 2 weeks to read it! UNDOWNPUTABLE! This is his best book by far. A rare accord to say the least. I really got engrossed in it. well done and what a cast of characters! His writing is what readers find in every book he writes."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"John Lescroart is one of those writers who is able to grab the reader's imagination with his first sentence: &quot;Only four minutes remained in sixteen-year-old Laura Wright's life as she came out of the bathroom of the small apartment on Beaumont Street in San Francisco.&quot; From this high-pitched beginning, his new book, THE SECOND CHAIR, wends its way through a zigzag plot that is littered with dead bodies, blind alleys, red herrings, courtroom drama and a denouement sure to keep pulses racing.Andrew North is the privileged son of rich self-centered parents: Linda, his biological mother, and Hal, his stepfather. Andrew, a popular high school student, and his girlfriend were the leads in the school play and had made a habit of rehearsing in the evenings at the home of their teacher, Mr. Mooney. One fatal night, when Andrew goes for a walk to rehearse his lines, Mooney and the ing&eacute;nue are murdered.Each time the police question Andrew, they assure the family that he is not a suspect. Thus, he talks to them without the benefit of counsel. He and his parents know he's innocent, but approximately two months into the investigation, he is arrested. Nobody is more surprised by this event than Andrew.When the Norths finally contact Amy Wu, an attorney they had used years before when Andrew had gotten into a small scrape, Andrew was being held at the Youth Guidance Center (YGC) charged with double murder. He was booked into juvenile hall because, although he was seventeen, for the purposes of this arrest he was still technically not considered an adult ... yet. When Amy gets to the house and begins asking the elementary questions a lawyer called into a double murder case always asks, she is appalled by the naivet&eacute; the parents had displayed in the pre-arrest of their son. These successful, rich and presumably savvy parents &quot;knew&quot; Andrew was innocent and believed that he was lucky to have been out of the house when the murders occurred. Their belief in their son's innocence could cost him his life. Up until he was taken away in handcuffs, the family felt that none of them had to worry.After listening to all of the reasons and rationalizations the parents had devised in their attempt to &quot;protect&quot; Andrew and convince themselves that their son was innocent, Wu, who is flabbergasted by what she is hearing, asks why the police decided to arrest him two months later after talking to him several times. Linda explains that in the early stages of the investigation, the police asked if they owned any guns. Hal responded in the affirmative, but was unable to locate it. The police later found a casing in Andrew's car --- the gun had disappeared, but it was the same caliber as the murder weapon.Amy Wu is an associate of Dismis Hardy, Lescroart's &quot;regular attorney.&quot; THE SECOND CHAIR comes on the heels of his last blockbuster, THE FIRST LAW, in which David Freeman, Hardy's mentor, is murdered and the people who truly loved him &quot;took care to see that 'justice' was carried out.&quot; All of them are still reeling from what they did and are trying as best they can to cope with his death. Each in his/her own way is haunted by the part they played in making sure his killer paid with his life. Amy is not doing too well in the emotional stability arena, either. Her father died a few months ago and she is drinking too much, indulging in one night stands and has cut herself off from any help or support friends might offer.Nevertheless, she takes the case. Based on her belief that all or most of her clients are guilty, her approach to a case is to plead down and get as little time as possible for the perp. In Andrew's case she takes the same route and rationalizes a defense of sorts in her mind. She will do what she does best: fight for the best deal she can get, and then hope she can sell it to the Norths and then to Andrew. Her plan is to have him plead guilty to the murders, even if he is innocent, as he claims. If he agrees, he will get eight years of incarceration as a youth offender. If he goes to trial, it will be as an adult and he could go to prison for life. The cliffhanging tension while Andrew, his family, Wu and Hardy try to decide his fate is both heartwrenchingly realistic and perfectly pitched.THE SECOND CHAIR is a compelling novel. It is timely and not so far fetched that readers won't identify with the painful situation facing the characters. John Lescroart brings to the courtroom thriller a mix of anecdotes that explain the law, an ensemble of characters who are fully limned and struggle with the human problems that beset all of us. The ability to shape and reshape them lends verisimilitude, which allows them to mature. This is Lescroart's fourteenth book and it is clearly one of his best. He is such an accomplished storyteller that a reader can pick up any of his books in or out of sequence and miss none of the nuances between his characters or get lost in a panoply of references to earlier novels.This author crafts his tales with due diligence, and that is what makes his work stand tall among the plethora of lawyer-writers whose books line shelves everywhere. This one is a keeper!--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Once again, Lescroart proves he is the master of this genre. While lesser authors cling to rehashed story lines and stale continuing characters Lescroart pushes the envelope.In this story, after falling into a deep malaise following the events of the FIRST LAW, Dismas Hardy resurrects himself by sitting &quot;second chair&quot; to his young protege Amy Wu, who is dealing with some demons of her own. Miss Wu has gotten herself hopelessly entangled in a case where everyone: her client, his parents, the judge have turned on her. Hardy decides that rather than fire her he will sit second chair. This is an interesting plot device similar to that which Lescroart has used in the last several books, that of moving the legal story along in a setting other than the actual trial courtroom. Here all of the legal action takes place in the hearing to decide if the defendant should be tried as a juvenile or adult.There are several secondary stories running throughout this book, most of them dealing with the hubris the other major characters who were involved with the FIRST LAW are carrying and their ultimate reconcilliation with that trama.Lescroart continues to grow and strengthen his characters as they go about the business of life, keeping them vibrant and interesting.This is the 12th Dismas Hardy book and it is as fresh and vibrant as the first!"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"John Lescroart's \\"The Second Chair\\" is one of his best legal thrillers in years. It features a fascinating character, Amy Wu, who is a thirty-year-old associate in Dismas Hardy's San Francisco law firm. Wu has been on a downward spiral since her father died four months earlier. She is drinking heavily, picking up strange men in bars, and doing shoddy legal work. Dismas Hardy, a recurring character in Lescroart's novels, knows that Amy is in trouble, but he has problems of his own. Since a series of tragic events changed his life, he has been reluctant to get emotionally involved in his work.However, Dismas has to intervene when Amy's client, Andrew Bartlett, a seventeen-year-old rich kid, is arrested on a charge of double homicide. Amy tries to manipulate the system to guarantee Andrew a light sentence, but her plan backfires, leaving Amy and her boss with egg on their faces. To save his firm's reputation and extricate Amy out of the legal trouble that she has created for herself and her client, Dismas decides to take \\"second chair\\" in the Andrew Bartlett case.Dismas's close friend, Abe Glitsky, is also suffering from burnout and stress. Glitsky has been promoted to Deputy Chief of Investigations, and he the hates the bureaucracy and politicking that go with his job. He also despises the vultures in the media who are always second-guessing his every move. Abe yearns to do what he does best--solve homicides. He has his chance when a series of mysterious murders rock the city, and he is once again called upon to use his investigative skills to find the murderer dubbed the \\"Executioner.\\"\\"The Second Chair\\" is complex, fast-paced, and suspenseful. The dialogue is sharp and realistic and the plot is complex without being convoluted. As always, Lescroart has done his homework, and the engrossing legal details add immeasurably to the book's appeal. Lescroart also effectively explores the shortcomings of our criminal justice system and how politics and the media too often pervert the truth.However, what I like best about this novel is its heart. Lescroart takes the time to get inside the minds and personalities of all the major characters, and this gives the reader an emotional investment in the outcome of the story. All in all, \\"The Second Chair\\" is a winner, and if you love legal thrillers as much as I do, you will put it at the top of your list."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"I just happened to pick this book up and read it without the preceding works in this series as a foundation. It might be that after reading all of his earlier books Lescroart's 'Second Chair' might be comfortable territory for the initiated. But as a stand alone book, this is pretty tired fare. The plot is far fetched and does not gel into the remotest idea of cohesion. The story bumps along from one character to the next like a bad auto accident. The characters are cardboard cut outs that are painful to imagine. And lastly the ending is a disaster of major \\"saw that coming\\" proportions.The writing style itself is not too shabby, though Lescroart could have whittled down the story by a hundred pages and lost nothing.Plainly, this is just a sub par Grisham."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Like many serial productions, picking up this volume and being transported back into the lives of Glitzky and Dismas (not to mention Diz' amazing black skillet) was like slipping on a favorite pair of houseslippers, comfortable -- familiar -- engrossing. I had the advantage of having read all the previous novels in this series, so it was with pleasure I snatched up Second Chair. Now there are only two questions to be answered: When do we get the next Lescroart epic ...... and how do you pronounce Lescroart, anyway?"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"I thought this book would be a very long legal trial, but it wasn't, and I enjoyed it very, very much. It had me turning the pages as fast as I could, and was very difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Not too many book are actually page turners, but this one is. But aside from that there are myriad things that make this not only entertaining, but miles ahead of most other books on the market now.The Characters are all well-developed and multi-faceted, the dialogue is believable, and the descriptions are beyond compare. All-in-all this is a great read. I especially came to like some of the characters towards the end of the novel--ones that I didn't care so much for at the beginning. &quot;Wu&quot; comes to mind, as do a few others.Lescroart is really a master at giving us more than just a good story, and if you're interested in a book that should be on every bestseller list, this is it.Also recommended: The Da Vinci Code, Bark of the Dogwood, Life of Pi"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"I like this writer and thought The Second Chair:A Novel was a terrific addition to this series."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"See storyline above.This was an average novel for Lescroart. It moves at a steady slow pace and sometimes seems a little dry. Though the story was good, it just didn't pull me in like some legal thrillers can.If you liked the previous Dismas Hardy novels you'll probably like this one."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"I have followed Dismas and Glitsky since their birth and always look forward to the next installment of their adventures together and after reading this latest I had to find fault with the main plot, that of the killing of the teacher and pupil. In the resolution to the book the killings were for revenge yet an innocent person was killed in the process. That wasn't in tune with the character of the guilty party who wanted revenge against those who had done him wrong yet was an intergral part of the plot of which Hardy was brought into the case for. Why would the murderer put himself in a position to require him to kill a witness when such elaborate steps were taken to remain anonymous otherwise?And did Hardy agree to take the second chair to appease his conscience after being guilty of compounding a felony? Fictional lawyers have always skirted the lines of legality but Hardy seems to have jumped over the line with both feet mirroring what the legal system in the United States has become.And is Hardy liable for his stolen ski equipment and his broken window when the legal profession is responsible for the escalating crime rate. Punishment for a crime was supposed to be so severe as to deter future violators from copying that wrongful act yet has become the cost of doing business.One can only hope that Hardy will become the lawyer that every layman hopes exists in the real world, that of one working for Mrs. &quot;Blind&quot;, that blindfolded lady holding the scales of justice."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Having read all his last six books Lescroart disappointed me with this one. I was able to guess both the Executioner and how the two stories involving Glitsky and Hardy were going to converge half way through the book. The next 200 odd pages were then difficult to get through.Lescroart still retains his captivating style and warm characters but this book is living off the success of his last couple with constant references to events from the First Law. If I hadn't read The First Law before this one I would have struggled to understand what all the references to the previous year was about.I would only recommend this book to his die hard fans."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"THE SECOND CHAIR is an excellent addition to the series of legal thrillers by John Lescroart featuring San Francisco lawyer Dismas Hardy and his good friend Abe Glitsky, recently promoted to Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau. While the novel is adequate as a standalone story, I don't believe that I would have rated it as highly without the detailed background knowledge of Abe's and Diz's experiences that formed the basis of Lescroart's previous book, THE FIRST LAW ( 2/9/2003 review), which I strongly suggest be read prior to this book. (Since the events in THE FIRST LAW in some ways represented a crucial divide in the lives of all participants, perhaps the numbers incorporated into these titles indicate the author's intention to make it easy for new readers to understand the order of the subsequent books in the series. If so, his fans will be glad to see that he has left himself unlimited possibilities for additional sequels whereas the author Sue Grafton is already more than halfway through the alphabet.)In contrast with the two most recent novels somewhat deviating from the typical format of this series, this book much more closely resembles the earlier stories. FIRST LAW had been about the failure of the justice system and the emotional and physical damage that the episode described caused to everyone in Abe's and Diz's circles of friends and families. Prior to that THE OATH (9/11/2002 review) had basically been a story that cast Diz in the role of a detective with very little courtroom action and with Abe having only a very minor role. This story combines what initially seem to be unrelated murder investigations by Abe and Diz with legal maneuvering, courtroom drama, and more than the usual quota of psychological stress and character development. While supposedly recovered from the psychological trauma which he recently endured and now managing partner of a successful law firm, in reality the deep scars which Hardy received are far from healed. He has essentially switched from being a litigator defending the innocent to the highly lucrative legal business of negotiating deals for the guilty. And Glitsky has become enmeshed in the political pressures brought on by a recent wave of violence.The parents of Andrew Bartlett, a seventeen-year-old who Hardy's young associate Amy Wu has previously represented for a minor offense, contact her when he is arrested for the double murder of his girlfriend Laura Wright and his well loved high school drama teacher Michael Mooney. Amy ( who is introduced in a manner which suggests that she will be a new addition to the continuing cast of this series) believes the evidence against Andrew to be overwhelming and thus arranges a deal with the DA to accept a plea bargain in return for Andrew being sentenced as a juvenile offender rather than being tried as an adult. When the deal falls apart and Amy incurs the wrath of both the DA and the judge assigned to the case, Hardy concludes that it is necessary for him to sit as THE SECOND CHAIR with Wu (psychologically numb from the recent death of her father) and help in the preparation of Andrew's case for trial. As further apparently random murders occur and increasingly terrorize the city, a tenuous link finally appears between Glitsky's investigations and Andrew's case. The complex plot is ingenious and the conclusion satisfying. And fans of the series will be glad to see the inclusion of a strong legal element as an integral part of this story.I downgraded my rating from a full five stars for three reasons. First, the book certainly does not deserve five stars on a standalone basis, yet to make the background understandable to new readers it dwells on the events in the previous book in excruciating detail for readers already familiar with that background. Second, I thought that although Amy's self-destructive behavior and preoccupation with her own problems was a totally integral element of the plot, it was carried to such an extreme level that it made her behavior even more frustrating than was necessary. Third, in a few cases the perspective of the narrative made certain elements of the case clear to the reader well before it was obvious to the participants, which somewhat lessened the suspense.On a final note, this book also includes a strong negative perspective regarding the current childrearing practices and self-centeredness of many professional and upwardly mobile parents. In addition to the lack of communication between Andrew and his parents, we are introduced to two wonderful minor actors in this drama. First is Jeri (Honey) Croft, an actress in the play which starred Andrew and Laura, and whose wisdom and sensitivity contrast fiercely with her punk look and outward demeanor of disdain, Second is Catherine Bass, who is an attorney suffering from CDD (the well known but often misdiagnosed affliction Chocolate Deficit Disorder) but more importantly for this story is Mr. Mooney's former wife who specializes in areas which make her very knowledgeable regarding the troubled lives of psychologically estranged teenagers. So, if you enjoy literary series which employ plots with a lot of interwoven threads and that take the time to leisurely provide the necessary details for continuing character development, THE SECOND CHAIR is a very worthwhile addition to the Diz and Abe show.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"I have read all the Dismas / Abe books, and it seems like I can usually figure out &quot;who done it&quot; before the characters. I guess this is because the author plays fair with the clues in the books, but it tends to lessen the enjoyment compared to other authors.The &quot;plot hole&quot; of the bystander did not bother me too much, but given the skill of the perp it does make you wonder how this could have happened.I would warn first-time Lescroart readers to get the books in order, there is a LOT of back-story in this book that would spoil the previous novel for you if you read them out of order. Again, I didn't mind this as much as some - as I read a LOT and for enjoyment, not to remember every detail of the novel. So having a refresher of what happened before was OK for me.The highlight of the book for me was Dismas' new car! He now drives a Honda S2000 convertible - since I have one too this added to the read.Another solid entry in the series, but if you pay attention you will figure it out."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Attorney Diz Hardy's inexperienced partner, Amy Wu, tackles her first murder case, even though she believes her client, high school student Andrew Barlett, to be guilty as charged. Someone has shot Andrew's girlfriend, Amy, and the drama teacher, Mr. Mooney, during play rehearsals at his home. The police believe they have Andrew dead to rights, especially because he's been toting a gun to school and is known to be jealous of their relationship. He's also been caught out in some pretty blatant lies. When Wu's strategy, to plead guilty to keep Andrew within the juvenile tier of justice, backfires badly, Diz steps in as second chair. While Andrew is in custody, someone else begins shooting victims with legal connections all around the city.As a courtroom drama, this novel is slow-moving, falling somewhat flat, and he personalities of Hardy and Glitsky are rather blunted this time around. On the other hand, Lescroart does a great job at presenting a thought-provoking array of ethical issues as they pertain to the responsibilities of the defense attorney. Amy commits some serious errors, which cause Diz to second guess some of the professional choices he has made in the emotional wake of the murder of one of his closest friends (see The First Law. Amy is definitely in need of a refresher course, as she skirts dangerously around the edges of ethical boundaries. There are also some interesting glimpses into the workings of the juvenile courts, and the factors that are considered in determining whether a teen defendant should or should not be tried as an adult.Wonder if Lescroart is doing an Evanovich with his titles, inserting \\"first\\", \\"second\\", etc into the series."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"This is my first Lescroart novel, and I found it entertaining and compelling. Lescroart weaves an intricate web of murder, guilt, revenge and human weakness. How the varying storylines eventually come together is excellent and the ending provides a twist that I half expected, just got the wrong \\"one\\".The main plot revolves around a young teenager accused of murdering his girl friend and their drama teacher. We also have a killer called \\"The Executioner\\" who is killing random victims with no apparent connection.The author maintains a tight pace, although slow initially, and affords us empathy with the book's many characters.It has led me to seek out others in the Hardy series."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Fairly good. Suspense is maintained, though perhaps drawn out too long. And the characterizations of the main players are well done, plus there's some sharp, witty dialogue.But the ending seems to be written for Hollywood, garishly melodramatic. And I'm not one who usually can predict endings (my wife can), but in this one I could see where the plot (the pattern and motives for the killings) was heading from about the midpoint of the novel--tho I didn't know the identity of the killer, which seemed to come out of the blue.I'll probably try another Lescroart."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Something about The Second Chair by John Lescroart just did it for me. I have been reading the Dismas Hardy/Abe Gilsky series since very early and have experienced a lot along with this clever and entertaining pair. I have been there for judges accused of murder, wrongfully accused individuals fighting for their lives in the legal arena, political scandals, police misconduct, murder, mayhem and a huge gun battle that left not only my head spinning, but the collective heads of our protagonists and their friends and family about to explode. Now all seems well on the legal landscape of Lescroart's San Francisco. Hardy is now the managing partner of a profitable law firm, Abe is in a real position of power in the police force, the DA and police chief are both friends of our hero's and most importantly, no one is shooting at them. Yet, what may seem fine on the surface is decidedly not fine underneath. Hardy is now a &quot;fixer&quot; wielding influence for clients he never would have touched before and in-between his fixing sessions slipping a few nips from the ole' wet bar. Abe is frustrated by the seemingly futile nature of politics and dealing with the press, and becoming more and more concerned about the burning pain in his gut. To add to Hardy's troubles, one of his associates, Amy Wu, sick with grief over the death of her father, is taking on her first real murder case, and not doing that good of a job with it.Oh, and somebody is going around killing people too, for apparently no reason.Lescroart does something with The Second Chair that just really amazed me. Here Lescroart the writer and Dismas Hardy the Lawyer become one and find a way to solve their mutual problems. Lescroart's problem is a series with growing tension with each edition, bordering on getting out of control. Hardy's problem is a lost faith in the Law. So Lescroart steps back and goes to the root of his story telling, by letting Hardy go back to his roots, a murder trial. Gone are the corruption and conspiracies, the ever escalating cycle of violence. Lescroart takes us back to a human tale, a tale of flawed individuals working in a flawed system, yet good intentioned and honest. Here the lawyers aren't battling a corrupt DA or biased cops, but their own prejudices and problems. This is simply good story telling at it's core without cheap stunts or gimmicks. While this may not be a perfect book, it is the perfect tone for this edition that just might save a series."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Having recently read The First Law, I decided it was time to go back for more. With the Second Chair, Lescroart spins a intriguing tale - one that is clearly better than The First Law. Perhaps my familiarity with some of the characters this time around helped. Throughout the story, Dis Hardy and Abe Glisky continue to search for their way in life in the wake of the action in the First Law, adding an extra dimension for those who have read the previous book. That said, my sense is that, while the exposure to the previous work was beneficial, the plot here was simply more compelling. The Second Chair is clearly a page turner that grabs the reader early and keeps him guessing. Prepare for some level of sleep deprivation as you stay up too late in order to read \\"just one more chapter.\\""},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Once again the author has come up with a great cast of characters and each one contributes significantly to the plot and ones' enjoyment of the read.

He has several story lines in each book and then weaves them all together to surprise me at the end.

He claims at the last minute that he is innocent. Despite very strong circumstantial evidence to the contrary, his attorney must suddenly work on a \\"soddit\\" defense (some other dude did it).I am nearing the end of the Dismas Hardy canon and I have been finding it difficult or impossible to be sure if this is the first one I had read. Yet I think it might be.I remember that rush of pleasure that a reader feels upon realizing this is going to be a good book--and perhaps it was also because I had discovered a new writer, or one new to me.At the start, I was not all that pleased with protagonist Amy Wu. She was reputedly extremely clever but kept making sloppy errors. She supposedly was suffering from low self esteem which had flared up recently because her father had died and she felt she had never pleased him. Why this happened is left a little vague, even when it is enlarged upon somewhat as the book goes along. It could account for several of her mistakes, but the extent of her indifference seems a little out of character with the nature of a true workaholic.True, there is the factor of her booze binging and the nightly prowl through bars looking to be picked up...There is a lot to be said about knowing the characters, which makes the reader more comfortable with personal foibles while several red herrings are tossed into the mix. Perhaps a professional really familiar with police procedure could find holes in the plot, but to me it just moved along briskly because that was my expectation.I do, however, think if I were the Hardys I would be unable to countenance the nightly search for a parking spot within walking distance of home. We used to live on a popular street with inadequate parking and one of us had to end up parking on that street (usually me) and my car was occasionally broken into or vandalized (my daughter claimed it was from frustration as they didn't like my dowdy driving gloves, my moth-eaten maps, or my ancient taste in music cassettes). But I was very happy when we built a home with ample underground parking. I suppose this is why when the Hardys did have the opportunity to provide parking and did not I was shaking my head. Yes, off track, but when deeply immersed in a story, these thoughts are distractions that affect the reading, if briefly.Some readers claim they figured out early who the killer was. I myself read for pleasure so do not perform what professors call a \\"close reading.\\" But even when I began to suspect, I still enjoyed how the writer tied up the various threads.My one criticism is a relatively mild one but should be easy to correct. Some of Lescroart's Spanish is a little shaky here and it seemed he once confused Spanish with French.However, if I ever needed a lawyer and could call Dismas Hardy, I would--in any language. People in real life should be as thorough as Hardy and his friend, deputy inspector Abe Glitsky"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"According to Wikipedia, \\"The Second Chair is 8th in the Dismas Hardy series.THE SETUPAmy Wu is an associate in Dismas Hardy's law firm. Hardy is actually the protagonist, even though he does not appear until well into the novel. Amy is hired to defend 17 year old Andrew Bartlett on the charge of murdering his pregnant girlfriend Laura Wright and their drama coach Mike Moony. Superficially, the evidence against Andrew is overwhelming, so Amy tries to get Andrew to plead guilty as a juvenile rather than face adult court, but Andrew balks at the last minute. Amy herself is engaging is self-destructive behavior following her father's death, and is endangering both her client, and the firm's reputation, so Hardy steps in as second chair.DEVEOPMENTS---may contain spoilersWell into those plot lines (the murder charge and Amy's self-destructive trajectory) the action abruptly changes, and five (5) new unrelated plot lines are introduced in rapid-fire order. Various additional plot lines are introduced at subsequent points. Most of these eventually converge with the main plot line.There are also various other story lines--mostly the personal stories of various characters. These are introduced/supported by a detailed summary of the preceding novel in the series (\\"The First Law\\")--which could be interpreted as introducing a dozen plot lines, with the implication that some or all will continue in this novel. However, as far as I can tell these story lines are completely irrelevant to the current story. These details undoubtably enhance the experience for fans of the series, but not so for new readers.CAVEATSI counted about 93 NAMED characters in the novel, most with at least some character development. Of course, many are minor, such as court bailiffs. However, this is allegedly a mystery--so the reader is forced to assume that any named character may later emerge as a significant character (i.e., \\"the butler did it\\"). So many named characters is patently absurd, unnecessary, and abusive to the reader. I doubt that anyone new to the series (like myself) could manage a few pages without being totally lost. Indeed, one-third or so into the novel, I had to stop, and go back to the beginning, and start again from page 1, writing down the name and description (e.g., \\"attorney\\", \\"friend of the accused\\") of every character as he/she was introduced. I had to consult the list frequently when characters returned.If I was a bit more cynical, I'd describe Lescroart's style as the \\"Agatha Christie\\" school of mystery-writing --confuse the heck out of the readers, then pull a rabbit out of the hat. In fact in this case, THE BUTLER DID DO IT--or more precisely, a very minor character in a subservient role, whom we know NOTHING about except his profession and last name.Lescroart seems to have become oddly enamored of the term \\"sepia\\", referring to several interiors of rooms as being in \\"sepia tones\\". Sepia is an ugly yellowish-brown stain, which could accurately be described as shxx-brown, and really is a form of excrement (squid ink). Sepia is used to tint black and white photographs to make them look old. I have never seen a \\"sepia toned\\" room, and hope never to.VERDICT\\"The Second Chair\\" is filled with interesting characters, and is a good read"},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"The Second Chair, by John Lescroart, is the 10th entry [site is incorrect] in the excellent series featuring defense attorney Dismas Hardy and his longtime friend San Francisco Police Department Homicide Investigation Specialist Abe Glitsky.

In this book, Hardy, the new boss at his law firm, sits second chair for Amy Wu who is defending a 17-year-old accused of murdering his girlfriend and a high school drama teacher. Wu makes several pivotal mistakes in her handling of the case which may prove costly for her client. Hardy comes in to try and pick up the pieces.

I wanted to read some of this author's older books because he has a new one coming out in February that I want to read. I figured some background knowledge might help me with the new book."},{"Title":"Second Chair, The (Dismas Hardy)","review":"This book begins and ends as a perfectly competent, trial-centered mystery thriller. The plot is like a finely made cuckoo clock. Once wound up, it clanks and whirrs, doors open up at just the right time and things pop into sight exactly when they should. In a book that is a part of a better than average series, it is well and good that they should do so.However, the heart of the book is not given to the series protagonists, Dismas (named after the \\"good thief\\" on the cross beside Jesus) Hardy and Abe Glitsky, but to a young lawyer named Amy Wu. Ms. Wu is very bright and very competent, so bright and so competent that she makes thoroughly boneheaded errors, one after another, in entirely convincing ways. The middle of the book is given to Ms. Wu's slow realization that she has made a mess of things and her attempts to crawl out of the pit she has dug for herself. This is not the stuff of a well-constructed mystery. This is, rather, something that looks very like--dare I say it?--literature.A couple of hundred pages of this 454 page book are more like a novel than a mystery story. Overall, this has a slightly negative effect on the mystery story, hence the four stars.

Lily is a woman after his own heart. Lily is forever trying to put her wild past behind her. Though she still loves adventure, her family refuses to see her for the grownup she has become. ***This starts out as a short-term affair but Logan has his hardest work ahead of him with Lily. She isn't sure she can go the long haul but she doesn't want to let Logan go either. ***Free Fall has the sexual tension and chemistry that is off the charts. Lily and Logan are an awesome couple in and out of the bedroom. They were a joy to read."},{"Title":"Free Fall (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Lily Harmon is a woman with a mission-live life to the fullest, enjoy every second, and have no regrets. She's always been wild, as every single one of her family members will tell you. A rebellious teen who was sent to live with her grandparents at their resort, Bay Moon, when she was sixteen to supposedly \\"straighten her out,\\" at the age of twenty-five Lily hasn't really changed all that much. She's still doing things her own way, still resenting the intrusion of her two older sisters, Gwyneth and Sarah, and attempting to keep her head above water while running the resort that she inherited after her grandparents' deaths.For Logan White, living on the edge is about more than just the adrenaline rush. As a search-and-rescue expert, he gets to rappel down the side of mountains, fly helicopters-and occasionally dangle out of them, and basically do whatever is necessary to rescue people from the decidedly stupid situations they get themselves into. Not one to focus on the lack of female companionship in his life, Logan is wary to accept a free trip to a Lake Tahoe resort from his friend Wyatt. Sure, he might need the rest and relaxation, and skiing down dangerous mountain slopes is definitely one of his ideas of heaven, but just because Wyatt is getting married doesn't mean that Logan needs a woman in his life.But when Logan arrives at Bay Moon Resort and aides Lily Harmon in her rescue of a wayward skier, sparks fly in instantaneous attraction. A short-term dalliance isn't out of order, since both Logan and Lily are adults with no attachments. The only thing neither of them bargained for is the desire-the need-to take their relationship deeper. Sex might be good for the body, but love and commitment are definitely better for the soul.I have to admit that I fell in love with Ms. Shalvis's search-and-rescue heroes with her story PERILOUS WATERS in theMen Of Courage II: An Honorable Man\\\\Blown Away\\\\Perilous Waters (Signature Select)anthology. FREE FALL is another book that takes you into the lives of people who risk it all for others, only to overlook what's missing in their own lives. Lily and Logan are both thrill-seekers, there's no doubt about it, but underneath their tough exterior they're simply a man and woman who have learned to distrust deep emotions and entanglements. Watching their struggle to learn to love and trust in this story was a joy, and I look forward to reading about some more yummy SAR characters in the near future."},{"Title":"Free Fall (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Although the snow and the weather in the mountains is cold, the steam between these two ski devils is H-O-T!

What he finds is a woman with the same passion for skiing and Search and Rescue.Another great book by Jill Shalvis!!"},{"Title":"Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865-1920","review":"Charles Reagan Wilson's work brilliantly describes the civil religion (as described by Geertz) of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; that was pervasive in the Reconstruction and Early Modern South.Wilson argues that this civil religion was a combination of Christian and Confederate symbols. According to Wilson this civil religion was formed out of Confederate ministers attempts to reconcile defeat in the war with the Will of God and (as the ministers believed) Confederate righteousness.Significant in this study is Wilson's look at the role that White Supremacy played in this civil religion. He looks extensively at the role of racism as embodied in groups such as the KKK.All in all, the work is a brilliant look at ideas pervasive in the reconstruction and early modern south, ideas which have been influential in formation of the modern New South."},{"Title":"Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865-1920","review":"Wilson's Baptized in Blood is a brilliant book, one of which I was required to read for a graduate history course on religion in the American south. Although I was born and grew up in the south, I nevertheless was a foreigner there. There was much in the psychology of southerners which made no sense to me. Reading Baptized in Blood was an extraordinary eye-opener! Though I am yet and always will be a stranger in the land of my birth, through the cogent narrative Wilson provides, I understand more deeply now the mythic, psychological origins of the many peculiar and bizarre thoughts, feelings and behaviours of southerners. Southerners REALLY and TRULY BELIEVED that GOD was on their side, in the prosecution of the civil war, and have had to reconcile their defeat as best they could. The inability to let go of that loss goes far in making southerners what they are.Baptized in Blood is well worth the reading of anyone who seeks to understand the post-civil war period, and/or the social and political psychology of the American south."},{"Title":"Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865-1920","review":"I have been curious for awhile about some of the cultural issues intrinsic in the South and found this book.

Norman VickersPensacola, FL"},{"Title":"Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865-1920","review":"The story of the Lost Cause is the untold story of the aftermath of the Civil War. It is the key to understanding the hold of white supremacy in the South for the last 150 years. Charles Reagan Wilson describes and documents the hold that this philosophy still has on our history, and the distortions that have become a belief system for hundreds of thousands of people, who learned this \\"white-washed\\" history from kindergarten through university. It is the tragic story of the struggle of our country to come to terms with the slaves who were brought here in chains. They have been part of our history since slave ships first arrived in Jamestown in the 1690's.The book is riveting. The scholarship is meticulous. I could not put it down. I recommend it without reservation to anyone who wants to understand the history of our country."},{"Title":"Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865-1920","review":"This book discusses the theological basis of southern slave society.

Mark Hammer gives a slow, judicious impression to the story of Will Henry Lee's career as police chief, the long period of racial tensions, the election of Lee's son to governor and the appointment of the South's first black police chief, who ultimately solves the earlier disappearances."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I am currently searching for Stuart Woods' early novels in hardback.

Very happy with it and the price is great!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I enjoyed the mini-series in the '80s, and decided to read the book. Its an epic thriller following generations of police chiefs trying to solve a series of murders. Its set against a backdrop of the segregated South between the '30s and '60s, which provides color and depth to what could otherwise be a fairly routine story. While the villain might seem obvious, the \\"innocence\\" of previous generations makes the plot believable. Incidentally, I understand the mini-series has not aged as well as the book, though I haven't seen it myself."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I enjoyed reading this book several years ago &amp; and still tingle when I remember the boy opening the chest, up in the attic and discovering the worn Sheriffs Star for the first time."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Stuart Woods hit a home run with this book. Much deeper than his stock Stone Barrington series (which is pretty good, for what it is). Woods does an excellent job of following the lives of three Chiefs of Police over the first 45 years a small Georgia town's existence.His characters, dialogue, culture, etc. from 1919 forward are very believable and offer something more to the reader than just a 'mystery.'I haven't read Woods latest book yet, but I intend to soon. I just hope it has the richness and body of &quot;Chiefs.&quot;"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Though Chiefs is the first, it is without doubt the best of the Stuart Woods books. I have also been well pleased with his later books that follow with descendants of Will Henry Lee and other characters from his fictitious town of Delano. I have been less pleased with his Stone Barrington books; it is almost as if they were written by a different author. They were certainly written with lesser craftsmanship."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I am from a small town just 30 miles from the place in the book.

I am hooked on his style of writing and can't wait to begin to read it.I'm sure it will be every bit as well-written as his many other books."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"&quot;Chiefs&quot; is the story of three police chiefs in a small Georgia town: one was the town's very first Chief of Police in the 1920's, the second in the 1940's, and the third in the 1960's. The common thread among the three is a series of disappearances of teenage boys who were traveling through the vicinity of the town when they disappeared.The book isn't really a mystery, since the reader knows the solution to the crime fairly early in the book. What sets the book apart is the well-drawn characters and the unerring and evocative portrayal of the evolution of a small Georgia town from the 1920's up to the middle of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's.Woods has perfect pitch when it comes to dialogue. Every conversation, every confrontation, every characterization rings vividly true. Politics, on a local, state, and national level, is a sub-theme of the book, and the author has obviously done his homework on those topics as well. But the book's most noticeable strength is in its ability to transport the reader almost physically into a sultry Georgia town. Even if you read this during a winter in North Dakota, you'll feel the heat, the tension, the passion, and the fears of a sleepy Georgia town during the mid-20th century for as long as you're reading &quot;Chiefs&quot;."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I got Chiefs after reading all the Amazon 5-star reader reviews. Usually, I'd walk on by a book about small town Georgia cops, never imagining it could be this enthralling. The author is masterful at drawing the reader into this little world; I found myself talking out loud to the characters. He doesn't rely on the graphic gore and language of the typical modern shock thriller, hence making the terror more real. What makes the southern authors so good!? This belongs with &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Prince of Tides.&quot; As a serial killer story, it belongs with the best of Lawrence Sanders."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"The characters in Chiefs are without a doubt some of the most interesting and well-developed characters that have ever surfaced in any novel to date. Woods does a great job creating such a diverse group of people all the while keeping them realistic and life-like. He paints a very accurate picture of what the south was like in the early 1900's and the 1950's. Since he created such life-like and believable people, I found myself either hating or loving the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. The three Chiefs that are the focal point are all very different, and they all have amazing qualities that make them come alive. Aside from holding the same position at one time or another, they also were committed to solving one of the worst series of crimes the south had ever seen."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Essentially, this novel is about three generations of police chiefs in Delano, Georgia, who attempt to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of several young men, and capture the elusive serial killer who victimizes them.However, Edgar Award-winning novelist Stuart Woods has written not only a riveting mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat, compulsively turning pages, he has described the history and culture of a small Georgia town from 1919 through the 1960s, and created such a realistic a populace that, at times, it is difficult to believe this is a work of fiction. Woods' characters are well defined and complex. There are many good moral people who live in Delano, but there are also the corrupt and perverse, those who have many secrets to hide. The story of the town's growth, as well as that of its inhabitants, over the years is absolutely fascinating, as are the details and intrigues of Georgia's state politics. And the history of the tense race relations during the entire period recalls a time of gross injustice that most of us would like to forget.This is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long, long time, and, to my mind, Stuart Woods' best novel.JANA"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"One of Woods' earlier works, CHIEFS, reads like the work of a veteran author. Woods is one of the masters at pacing and it is obviously a skill he possessed early in his career. If you are a fan of his more recent books like THE RUN or DEAD IN THE WATER, you will surely not be disappointed by this one.A serial killer exists virtually unsuspected over the span of three generations of police chiefs in the small farming community of Delano, Georgia. CHIEFS is divided into three separate books, one for each police chief, but the divisions are more complex than merely who is running the department. Delano, the town itself, experiences its own changes in each phase of the story. We see the town flourish in times of economic prosperity, and then struggle as its farming inhabitants grapple with the blight of the boll weevil which destroys their cotton fields. There is the ever-present race clashes, the black and the white fighting for their dignity and place in the rural desegregated South. And Delano's proudest son aspires to establish himself as a viable candidate for the Governor's seat in Georgia.All this provides an intricately textured backdrop in front of which the killer is defying both time and the law. Each new chief of police stumbles across clues left behind by his predecessor, but will the third one figure it out? The killings and the killer's ability to go undetected so long are certainly the focus of the narrative, but the reader becomes just as fascinated by the political, industrial, and cultural development of Delano as well.Once you get into it, you can't help but get hooked. You can read CHIEFS in a weekend's time, because you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I found this book many years ago and recently recommended it for my book club to read and then re-read the book again myself. Wow!!!!! I had forgotten how much I really enjoyed the book. In fact, I have several copies in paperback to lend to friends to read. It is suspenseful and gripping. This is Mr. Woods first novel I believe and was made into a mini series (which I own also) and a can't put down book. My book club throughly enjoyed the book and wanted me to recommend more of Mr. Woods work. If you read his books in order of publishing with the first being Chiefs you will always find a reference to one of the characters or Delano, Georgia in his subsequent books. Totally a GREAT read and I highly recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Chiefs is a rare, not so distant past mystery, which accurately and credibly qualifies as true historical fiction.It predominantly chronicles the small Georgia town of Delano and the three generations of police chiefs who deal with the mundane, the dull, the ridiculous and the demoralizing intimidation of everyday life in the deep South. The story centers on a succession of disappearances of teenage boys and how each Chief attempts to solve the crime and uncover the identity of this baffling killer. It is utterly masterful how Woods seamlessly weaves the individual personalities of his three main characters from different eras into the unraveling of the arcane felony.What is amazinlgy refreshing about Chiefs is its total and complete lack of political correctness. The dialogue is gritty and raw. The politicians are players, corrupt, yet with their own morality. There are no 'pretty' words for African-Americans. Yet, there is no offense here. The words ring with the truth of the tension between the races and the echo's of the early civil rights movement.Woods' has filled his novel with tense moments, an uncommon plodding wittiness, history, culture and best of all a great story that keeps you flicking pages so quickly a bookmark isn't even need...you can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I had seen the tv mini-series several years ago and liked it very much. When I started reading Chiefs, parts of it came back to me (the mini-series was extremely similar) but I was still held in suspense. Once in a while a book comes along that I can't stop thinking about even when I'm not free to read--I can't wait to get back to it. This is one of those books. There are several characters and plots all leading into one major plot; yet, it never gets confusing or boring. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is a haunting book. The kind you think about days and weeks after reading it. It's really a story about the racial journey of Delano - a small southern town - from hardcore bigotry (i.e Ku Klux Klan) to slow mutual acceptance and integration of the black and white communities. Some passages of intimidation and torture of Delano's black citizens are downright chilling.Delano's three Chiefs are all interesting, well-developed characters. Their pursuit of a serial killer over 40 years provides a creepy backdrop and keeps the story moving at a fast pace.I recommend this book for anyone interested in race relations, the old south, or just a creepy murder story.I listened to Chiefs unabridged on audio tape, narrated by Mark Hammer. Hammer does a fine job, his southern drawl adding a nice complexity to the story and characters. Only downside is his limited vocal range. Even the female characters sound like old men."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"While I have not seen it mentioned here, I think it is important to note this book won a Edgar Award in 1982. After having read the book I can see why it did as well as the high comments provided by others here. A few additional comments follow.I often find books spanning several generations such as this one to be very entertaining. The development of the characters as well as the community in which they were set was particularly well done. A few of the characters along with the common theme that spanned the length of the book gave additional depth to the story. After reading the last line in the book I came away with the feeling, \\"Well done\\"!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. From the very beginning it held my interest.

I thoroughly enjoyed the characters. A good beginning coming full circle to an ironic ending, I couldn't put it down.

Also an excellent 1983 CBS miniseries"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"My God! Is this the same Stuart Woods who writes the Stone Barrington books? I have read some of his other novels and enjoyed them all, but this book (Chiefs) is far and away his best yet. An absolute page-turner, my heart actually raced over and over again as I read! I don't know if my ticker can handle another one of this quality, but I can't wait to find out."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is Woods' first published novel and one of his best. It begins with someone running through the woods, trying to get away from someone. They are caught and killed. Jump to the story which begins with the chosing of a new chief in the town of Delano, Georgia. A farmer, William Henry Lee is chosen. He is the first chief to investigate the murder of a teenage boy. He never solves it. In later years it is investigated by a cop who may be even more disturbed then the killer. Then, Georgia's first black chief, who holds a devestating secret. Even though the killer is pretty much figured out near the middle of the book, it is still thrilling to find out how it will all end. The pace is amazing and it is no wonder that it won an Edgar Award."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I am a Broadcast Journalist in Portland, Maine. I am primarily a storyteller and frequently write stories about my childhood in Somersworth, New Hampshire on a web site devoted to that City. I also maintain a website where I tell Franco-American stories. My favorite writer until I saw the Made for TV movie \\"Chief's\\" in 1983 had been Willa Cather (Pioneer, My Antonia etc.) Now Stuart Woods joins her. My co-workers will tell you I can recite from memory the entire \\"Chief's\\" screenplay...almost. Patiently waiting for it to come out on DVD I delight in the paperback while waiting for that big day. I select chapters at random and enjoy the extra detail cut from the movie. I always wondered how Foxy Funderburke lived with no visible means of support. It's all in the book. Writer Stephen King, though a magnificent benevolent person, sometimes reveals his social awkwardness in his writing..(Kingdom Hospital is a good example)..Stuart woods reveals his social savvy. Billy Lee's proposal to his British War bride epitomizes what I mean. If all these characters lived for real...they would walk and talk as scripted by Woods."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"The audiobook of this award-winning novel is superbly read by Mark Hammer. While his manner is slower than most narrators, it lends to the story, by making a listener impatient, as one just can't wait tio hear what happens next!(no skipping paragraphs on an audiobook) Woods does an excellent job of portraying small-town southern life stretching across four decades that not only changed the face of Georgia and the south, but the nation as a whole. His understanding of the attitudes of the times is reflected in Hammer's narration.Highly recommended-a story that will stay with you!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I have great news and bad news. The great news is that the book is superb! The bad news is that the print is so small in this edition that it's almost unreadable. We're talking TINY! Spring for the hardback or buy a magnifying glass."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This book was read after watching the TV mini series. I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is the story of a succession of police chiefs in Delano, Georgia, a small town. It reminds me of a James Michener novel in that the main characters change as time progresses, but the story continues on in the same locale. This novel is also the story of race relations in rural Georgia from the 1920s to the 1960s.The characters are very good - there's a wide variety of characters here. One of the sherrifs is especially vile, but you root for him as he is tracking down a serial killer that stalks, rapes and kills young men over the course of 40 years.Stuart Woods is sort of a hack nowadays, writing formulaic detective thrillers, but this is undoubtedly the best of his that I've read. Here is the highest praise I can give it - this book is a book that I wish I had written - it has heart, danger, loyalty and a host of other qualities that make it great."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is one of Stuart Woods' earlier works. I read it after about 15 of his later books.I was enthralled at how he crafted together three different stories to trace the growth of a small Georgia town from 1920 to 1963.Along the way he creates segments with FDR and JFK that were wonderfully done.The spine for the story is the Lee family who are chronicled in several of Mr. Woods' books. It was delicious to go back and see the ancestors of Will Lee, the hero of one series of books.As will all of Stuart Woods' books, it is a fast, engrossing experience that challenges one to find ways to sneak in a couple of chapters."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"A wonderful depiction of what life was like in a Southern Town from the 1920s to the 1960s. The cast of characters which includes both fictional and real people is incredible and while parts may seem stale the book never stays dull for long. Told through the eyes of three different town sheriffs who are as dedicated to their job as they are complex in personality this is a book that never left me feeling disappointed. One of the best thrillers I have read in years."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This was without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. It is more a combination of history and mystery. Very interesting story along with some interesting charactors. I saw the TV movie many years ago and really liked it. The book was better and more detailed. I have read many Stuart Woods books and this was by far the most believable as it was somewhat based on a real life situation. I will read both books that follow this one. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for something a little different to read. Nice change from the typical who done it books."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"THIS BOOK IS INTENSE AND SUSPENSEFUL IT KEEPS THE READER IN THE STORY,ALWAYS WANTING TO READ MORE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.I ALWAYS HAD TO KEEP READING EVEN THOUGH I WOULD FEEL MY EYES GETTING HEAVY. IT FEELS LIKE YOUR IN THE ACTUAL STORY. IF A BOOK CAN MAKE YOU FEEL THAT YOUR ACTUALLY IN THE STORY THEN IT IS A GREAT ONE."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is the second book by Stuart Woods that I've read. The first being Orchid Beach which was paced like lightning. This one was a bit slower.It reminded me of a Ken Follett book in that it spans over the course of many years, decades even, intermingling a central location and all the characters who populated that location over the years.I thought the dialogue was a bit on the dry side. Everyone had their own voice and I got the feeling from the style Woods used that people were indeed southern, but there wasn't that much personality to the characters. In other words, I didn't get that much feeling of emotion from their words as I do other books.The book is only about 427 pages long but it seemed like it was alot longer than that.I liked the theme overall..I found the premise of the story very interesting. But the pacing and the lack of focus or time spent on the 'main event' of the book (the common theme that drives the whole story and its characters through the years) kind of killed it for me."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This was a well written book thar made an excellent movie as well.You have the history of three police chiefs in the state of Georgia that covers a 45 year period.You also have a long time mystery of missing young boys.This is a mystery passed on over the ages from chief to chief.It remains a huge mystery as to who is behind the dissapearance of the young boys.The true identityof the kidnapper-killer is shocking. The cultural and racial differences in the community are well covered in this book.If youread this book you will become a Stuart Woods fan. The movie is excellent as well."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"THIS BOOK IS PHENOMINAL! AND THE TELEVISION MINI-SERIES IS JUST AS GOOD. I AM LOOKING FOR A COPY OF IT. THIS IS MY APPEAL TO AMAZON TO FIND THIS VIDEO!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I have always enjoyed Stuart Woods' stories. I thought this one started out more slowly, butenjoyed how it developed and crossed over several generations. The characters, as usual,were well developed. Always a great ending."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Lent my paperback copy of this years ago and never got it back. Have waited for it to be available for Kindle. Reading it again, it does not disappoint. There is such rich character development and detail about the town - something Woods got away from in later years. It's expensive for a Kindle book - but it's longer, with great historical detail, and is far better written than most of the \\"cheapies.\\" That said, I almost took away a star for some of the editing mistakes - but it's just too good a book!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Just recently started the novels by Stuart Woods, and what a pleasant experience. CHIEFS is the first book in a set of storys that make up a string. CHIEFS cover fifty years of police chiefs in a small Georgia town, Delano. The work is above extraordinary as the first book of a series. It hits you and draws you in making you want the next book in this series. It is very close to perfect. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I have been hooked on all the Lee family novels after reading Chiefs. Woods paints such vivid characterizations that you feel like you know these people. I was all in after the first few pages of this novel. I love the dialog and the characters, the plot and the pacing. Just a wonderful page turner."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I really enjoyed this book.Having never read this author before, I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. The main character was very likable and made me want to read more Stuart Woods books. Unfortunately,the other books in the Lee chronicles were not as well written and didnt have the character developement that this book had."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I have read many of Stuart Woods novels. This is his first novel, and was very hard to find in print version, I was glad that Amazon.com had it. It was very entertaining and the pace was such to keep one wanting to turn one more page. This book has no central character as some of his other books and therefore I thinks it makes it unique. A very good read."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"INTERESTING TO READ THIS BOOK AND TO THEN TO READ HIS \\"BARRINGTON\\" BOOKS AND SEE HOW THE MONEY CORRUPTS.WHAT STARTS OUT WITH SUCH PROMISE OF FINE WORKS TO COME BY WOODS BECOMES SUCH PULP LATER."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Chiefs was Woods' first and best effort. It is an epic tale set in the Georgia that is the home of the Will Lee series. The story travels through time as a progression of police chiefs for the town struggle with the changing times and the solving of a crime that remained unsolved for years."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I read this book a long time ago and purchased to share with friends. It is an awesome book! Great prices, quick ship"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Stuart Woods is a consummate tale teller. Chiefs is a prime example of his talent. The plot has as many twists and turns as a California hillside street. Very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"A wonderfully-written entertaining book.Since it is divided into three major sections, it is also an easy one to actually read over three separate days and not have to stay up all night on the first day to finish it!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I've read many of Woods books. This is the best and since it was the first, you can see the loving care that went into the writing. Too bad Woods sold out and is just turning out potboilers now!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I finally found the video of this (from the mini series) at videoflicks.com."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"If you bought Chiefs to read the style you know of Stuart's writing you would be disappointed as I was. I am glad his writing improved to the style we see him in his more current work. Chiefs was not what I expected. The publisher said \\"this volume will be a collector's treasure for all fans of Stuart Woods\\" and I could not agree less. If this had been the first Stuart Woods book I read I would not have read all is other more current works. The Stone Barrington books and the stories in new Mexico and good well written thrillers with some goos associate to reality in them. The Chiefs just did not have that for me. Thank goodness I found his more likeable work in current issues."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Great person to do business with! Replies to your questions & is very helpful! Would definately do business with them again!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This was my first Stuart Woods book. It has a great pace, keeps you interested and gets you involved with characters. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Chiefs is a great introduction to the Stuart Woods' novels. After I read Chiefs, I have been hooked on all his books. You have to read Chiefs to get the history of the characters that you will met in all his other novels. The opening chapters gets you interested in the mystery, but overall you care about the people. This is the first book I recommend to anyone interested in a good story."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is a compelling read. Well written on several levels.

I think the plot was a bit scattered and the dialogue shift between some of the characters was over used and clich&eacute;, but for the most part the book was okay.The authors slips a bit of sociology in there too. You see a circle of events but you also see the answer to questions that, as adults, we see in kids. \\" How can anyone hate like that?\\" Well, the family may be part of the reason and in this story, you get that. A racist father, a racist son and so one. The progression makes sense. The honest father, the honest son."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This was a decent read.

I thought it was one of his more current books, only to find it was written some time ago. I must say I enjoyed the book very much. I love the character development and the speed of the action. I would recommend this book to anyone who even thinks they like Stuart Woods."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I generally don't review a book I fail to finish. I figure it's a decent thing to do if I warn you as I did in my Title line.Stuart Woods has been reviewed as inserting his own left wing liberal politics in his books before. Here he does it again causing me to abandon this book within the first 50 pages. I don't doubt it's a well written crime demi-novel (fiction based on fact - my word) but the supposed attitudes of the characters in rural GA circa WWI here are impossible to take.The first 40 pages or so are a diatribe against personal ownership of firearms and how those who claim to use them well are to be dismissed with a laugh. That may be your politics. Clearly, it's not mine. However, I don't care how Woods votes, but I do care about buying a book from Amazon here at most of retail only to find myself subjected to a left wing liberal rant which would embarrass Ted Kennedy.If you can stomach that, perhaps the rest of the book works out to be a fine read. I'll never know."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This novel seems to capture the politics and society in the South during the time. As usual Stuart Woods gives the reader both suspense and entertainment."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Many, many years ago I watched a made for TV movie based on this book.

Police Chiefs, City Leaders and Town Folk a like have their time in the spotlight, for better or worse. You'll be surprised at the people who deserve to die and Don't. The hero's who deserve to live and Don't and the people who just need some sense knocked In to 'em!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I am currently getting caught up on the works of Stuart Woods, and purchasing them here is proving to be an affordable way to do this."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Chiefs: was very good, but not what I expected.

So glad for the opportunity to get to know the Will Lees. Hope more Will Lee wil follow. Love the series."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I thought it was very interesting and well written. It is the introduction to the character Will Lee. My 2 favorite characters in the Stuart Woods novels are Will Lee and Stone Barrington. Keep up the great work, Stuart."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I loved this book. It was interesting and exciting. But then, anything by Stuart Woods is a winner.His books are thought-provoking and real."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I read Stuart Woods novels when they come out. This one I missed originally. I think it shows Wood's talent as a writer. He takes a multigenerational crime, follows it and it's influence through time and snares the reader throughout with his interesting character development."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Truly this is Woods' most wonderful novel, based on a true story from his own past. The first William Henry Lee is based on a story about Woods' own grandfather who was shot and killed as sheriff of his community. It is equal to the crowning achievement of THE STAND by Stephen King, and will hook you into the books that follow about the Lee descendants. The only book in the Lee line that I really didn't enjoy was THE RUN, but it's still worth the read for the continuation of the Lee family. GRASS ROOTS is next, and it too is excellent. Woods is a prolific writer and this is his best. I do enjoy all the Holly Barker and Stone Barrington novels. I must say Woods has become one of my favorite authors and I have many....ahhhh...sooo many books, so little time. If you listen to this book on tape, the reader is stupendous...he's got it down pat. I do hope you'll buy and read this excellent and enjoyable novel. Whether Democrat liberal or Republican conservative, you'll love Will Lee and his descendants."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This book does not read as easily as other books that I have read by Stuart Woods, but it is a classic. It's hard to believe that the same person who wrote this, wrote Palindrome. That is a different review all together. The plot in Chief's was believable, the writing excellent. I highly recommend it. I'm so glad they reprinted it in hardback."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This novel is the first in a line of many for Stuart Woods.His characters move from novel to novel and you follow them through the course of their lives.In this as in all of his books a reader can see the depth he goes to in his research be it law, police procedures, medical, etc. Stuart Woods novels are hard to put down once you begin reading. I own all of his books with the exception of one and eagerly await the next."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I guess we all change along the way, Woods included. I absolutely loved \\"CHIEFS\\" when I read it eons ago. I have tried many of his Stone Barrington novels and none seem even remotely close to CHIEFS. Obviously there's a market out there for his Barrington books: he keeps getting them published. In my non-scholarly opinion it seems the literary world would have been better off if \\"CHIEFS\\" had been his first and last novel, ala Margaret Mitchell. (But I don't wish Mr. Woods to share Mitchell's fate!)"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I am in the midst of reading Richard Kluger's dense and well written book on Brown v. Board of Education \\"Simple Justice\\" when I picked up Chiefs. Kluger explains the Jim Crow south and the justice system in measured prose. Woods makes it come alive. I could taste and feel the injustice of the JIm Crow South. Woods in his later books proves that he can tell a good story. The Chiefs adds to the story telling ability a meaningful plot and interesting characters. Although as in other Woods books the good are all good and the bad are all bad which is a weakness, I enjoyed the Chiefs. This reminds me of Grisham whose first book was a gem and as he became more successful he adopted a formula which was enjoyable but never reached the first effort."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This was Stuart Wood's first book and he did a wonderful job on it. The book is well written, has an excellent plot and a good start at character development. The final chapters make sense and are certainly surprising. I enjoyed the book a great deal and looked forward to reading more of his workI'm sorry to say, however, that while this book seems to be the work of an author with a great deal of literary future, Wood's later books show that he has sold his soul to pulp fiction - for the money. I have now read five of his later books, hoping upon hope that one of them would be as good a \\"Chiefs.\\" None are. They are predictable, boring, repetitive, poorly written. In each book many of the events are highly improbable and Woods stretches far, far too much to make the story continue into another smellable volume. Don't be fooled. They all get boring. Don't buy them. This is the only good one."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I have always enjoyed books written by Woods. I placed this one last on my list in great anticipation since the author writes it is his best work. I tend to disagree. I thought it was good but some of his other books are better"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is definitely one of Stuart Woods' best books ever. Three different stories overlap and become an excellent portrayal of the time and the history in Georgia and the U.S. The characters are so well-developed and well-written you think they are real. Excellent saga of a book that men and women would love."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This is a novel that I have been wanting to read for quite sometime, and it was well worth the wait. Stuart Woods has managed to incorporate a history lesson about civil rights with a fantastic mystery. Woods develops Will Henry and Billy Lee's characters remarkably well, and ties father and son together in the history of the town of Delano. This novel also shows just how delicate racial tensions were in the south."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Stuart Wood's mastery of plot weaving was never so evident as in his first novel, Chiefs. Woods has successfuly woven fact and fiction together to produce one of the truly great novels of the 20th century. The TV mini-series exemplifies in the mind of the reader the brilliance of the author in skilfully bringing his story to a powerful and conclusive ending. Most certainly the very best book of its type I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Col Bailey, Tasmania; Australia."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I've read this book many times, spurred by the release of the mini-series, which was also excellent. I could swear that I watched this video several years ago (as a rental from a video store)....it must be out there somewhere, right? If anyone should be able to get it, Amazon should.I would highly recommend this novel as one of Wood's best (and earliest)...while his later books are good, this one is exceptional. Like John Sanford, he knows that above all, story is everything."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Great book and mini series. I am looking for the video of Chiefs"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"The novel \\"Chiefs\\" by Stuart Woods was made into a 3 part mini-series in the early 80's. I remember being on the edge of my seat every night. This is one of my all time favorite movies. I have been trying to purchase this movie in it's entirety for the past ten years. I have tried just about every venue available online. I want the original movie in excellent condition, updated in DVD format. I am very cautious about all the listings going for $60 to $200. It is some foreign situation going on that I do not understand. Anyhow, I had never thought about a book, until trying to purchase the movie on Amazon. I just happened to see the section that says, \\"What Other Items Do Customers Buy After Viewing This Item?\\" I saw the book and ordered it immediately. Not exactly what I wanted, but am I ever glad I am reading it. It has some interesting little snippets that were not in the movie. Most people read the book before they see the movie. I can attest that the movie truly mirrors the novel. Woods did an excellent work on \\"Chiefs.\\" If you saw the movie, read the book. It is excellent reading."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Always enjoy Stuart Woods work.This was no exception.

No offense to anyone"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I first read this book years ago and have read it several times since.

I recommand them all."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I understand this is Stuart Woods' first novel and, as a fan of Mr. Woods, one who has read several scores of his more recent books, I looped back to read Chiefs when it became available in a Kindle edition. This book is enthralling and kept me turning the pages into the late hours of the night. The novel has three distinct stories that are expertly interwoven through the appearance of several key and ancillary characters...expertly written, a real joy to read."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I always enjoy Stuart Woods. These stories were completly different from most of his. Really enjoyed reading. Chiefs was a great book. Chiefs - three books in one."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Although this was a fictional account of a small town in the south I felt as though I was reading the real history of honest heroes in the battle for early civil rights. The characters through the generations were wonderfully defined. I found myself entrenched with each family as they fought hard for their fellow man."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I have read most of Woods books and have a strong preference for the Stone Barrington books. However, Woods ability to develop all the major characters in \\"Chiefs\\" in a very in depth manner has made this read fantastic.

Affter reading the back cover as to what it was about, I realized I had never read it. This is the first book James Patterson ever wrote, and could not believe I had not read it as I am a James Patterson fan. This was such a good book that I could not stop reading it. I would encourage all fans of James Patterson to get this book and read it. Since I found it, I am going back to some of his older books to see if I might have missed others. I would highly recommend reading this book. My brother was at my home visiting. He started reading it and could not put it down. When he was finished with it, I then read it. I have no idea where I got this paper book version, but plan to get back on Amazon to research other books he has written."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Great book. Have read it 3 times over the years and enjoyed each time. Having read the original, I prefer it to this 25th Anniversary Edition, but still a great read and one I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This was a different novel for Stuart Woods, almost a historical piece as it took us back an earlier time and followed the Chief's life and then his children in follow up novels. Made me rush to buy the next books."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I am a fan of Stuart Woods. Chiefs is a wonderful book about real life people. The color and theme is super. I have never read such a book. It was homey as well as frightening in places...kept you on the edge at all times...."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Loved this book, first saw mini series years ago. What I did NOT like were the typo errors, factual errors, i.e.Tucker Watts retired Dec 2, was to take job Dec 15. After the traffic stop, Nov 15 is mentioned as his first day. Errors made for a great deal of confusion. WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO REVIEW THIS FOR MR WOODS. One would think these errors would have been corrected BEFORE publishing a 30 yr anniversary edition of this book."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"Chiefs is wonderful, as was the miniseries. This book tells the stories of three police chiefs in a small town who recognize that a serial killer is torturing young boys and men. The first town chief. both literally and in the book,Chiefs (Will Lee Novel)gathers information about killings that seem linked and has them hidden in his desk. He is killed before he can learn more about the killer. The second chief is selfish and uses the position as police chief for personal gain. He learns the identity of the killer. The third is an African American chief who finds the lost papers of the first chief and eventually has enough evidence to arrest the killer. Chiefs is well-written, including great characters, atmosphere and descriptions as the town grows and addresses racial issues, and the slow, fascinating search and arrest of a serial killer of many young men over years."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I first read Chiefs when it was new - and since the publisher didn't know whether it would sell, printed only 200,000 of them. So, now they're scarce, and I was fortunate to receive this book. It's my favorite of Stuart Woods books, and it was his first. They made a movie series of it as well - shown on TV, and it was excellent, and true to the book. Why couldn't it be released again? Both the book and the movie? It covers a few generations in a small Georgia town with a series of Police Chiefs, and it interested me since I live in Georgia. The fictitious name of Delano is a clever name for the small town, since FDR had connections here at Warm Springs, Ga. - and his middle name was Delano. There is a running mystery throughout - which keeps one on the edge of the seat. Strange. John Grisham's first book, \\"A Time to Kill\\" was his best, too. I highly recommend this book as very excellent reading."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I can not begin to put into words how much I LOVED this book !!!I found myself being so INTO the characters of the book and felt like I knew them personally, at times I laughed and at times I was so mad ( i wanted to throw the book out the back door) lol because of the way some people were treated...do not miss this book!One of the best I have ever read...."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"After reading all of Woods' other books, I started Chiefs. At first, I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it, but the characters grew on me and the plot began to hold my attention.I'm glad I finished it because it proved to be a very good read."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"I do not like books set back in time but this book was one of Woods 1st and I think best. I could not put it down!!!!!!!! I have loved all of Woods books! Some more than others but this is definately one of his best!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"WOW! What a way to start a series! One of Stuart Woods' best!"},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"CHIEFS by Stuart Woods illustrates why this mystery/suspense author continues to fascinate readers of mystery fiction. CHIEFS was his first in 1981 and it is still a good read. The time period may date the novel, but the story line is still fresh. Many things do not change in the south and small town politics is a major example.Who wields the power behind the scenes is always the person to know and watch.A serial killer with a perchance for young boys haunts the lives of three chief's of police in the fictional town of Delano. Like all small towns lives cross and intertwine as generations come and go.A fine read at any date.Nash Black, author of HAINTS snd WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS now available in Kindle editions."},{"Title":"Chiefs","review":"This story is about a small town in Georgia called Delano. The story takes you from Delano's founding in 1919 and centers around it's Police Chiefs in 1920, 1946, and 1963. Oh yeah, there is also a serial killer involved.Stuart Woods is a great story teller who I enjoy reading as I do John Grisham. Woods takes you there into that small Southern town and you feel the moods of the people and the ways of the times. He really does a good job in telling the way a town is formed and goes about getting it's first Police Chief. You also feel the hopes and the fears that a policeman would feel.There is political intrique and the suspense of a murder mystery. I did enjoy reading this one, but throughout I was left sadden by how cruel people can be to one another."},{"Title":"Easy Hebrew;: A first-year course in conversation, reading, and writing","review":"Not for a total beginner, but once you know the characters of the Hebrew alphabet and their sounds, this little book quickly plunges you into short, easy lessons containing stories with sentences 1-2 words long to start. Ten or less new words are introduced with each lesson, easily learned in the context of simple, repetitious dialogue. Each lesson also includes some basic grammar and exercises to practice reading, writing, and speaking. Sephardic pronunciation of vowels and alphabet, including script, are given in the back; I love it that practice reading and writing the script is included from the second lesson on. I also love it that there is no distracting transliteration, but the student is expected to be reading simple words from the get-go. Hebrew-English and English-Hebrew dictionaries in the back are only 9 pages long, so the book is slim, easy to carry around, and very accessible. A good foundation for more complex language learning later."},{"Title":"My grandma is a pilot","review":"This was an awesome book and in extremely good condition that was just as described. In fact, it was better than I had anticipated. The story is heart warming for any \\"grandma\\" pilot who wants to share her love of flying with her grand child. I strongly recommend the book and the shipper."},{"Title":"Arts and crafts in the middle ages;: A description of mediaeval workmanship in several of the departments of applied art, together with some account of special artisans in the early renaissance,","review":"The title belies the facinating history surrounding art in the Middle Ages. While there is some information on \\"how did they do it\\", there is even more on the life and living in Medieval Europe. There are things like the origin of surnames (\\"I smite\\" becomes \\"Smith\\") to what happened to Charlemagne's right arm. One definite drawback is the failure of the Kindle to download illustrations and examples. If they had been present, even in a black and white format, the book would probably have rated 5 stars."},{"Title":"Arts and crafts in the middle ages;: A description of mediaeval workmanship in several of the departments of applied art, together with some account of special artisans in the early renaissance,","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!"},{"Title":"Two Novels","review":"First the bad news: I could never get all the way through _Imaginary Speeches_, and what I did read I didn't like all that much. On the other hand, _You Didn't Even Try_ has been, for a long time, one of my favorite novels. It relates the story of a group of California friends, all intellectual or pseudo-intellectual types, and their shifting relationships over a period of about ten years. This is one of the most pleasantly paced novels I have ever read. Whalen has done a rare thing, which is to write a novel that unfolds so casually, so realistically, that you feel you could be reading about your own life. It's strange. I don't like Whalen's poetry, and _Imaginary Speeches_ is, in my opinion, more or less worthless. But _You Didn't Even Try_ is a small, quiet masterpiece."},{"Title":"Shanghai Girl","review":"This is the kind of book that you will start and finish in a few hours. Fast, dynamic, intense and exquisitely written.Yang introduces a new theme that many have yearned for. She gives the reader a glimpse of the glorious Shanghai days before the Cultural Revolution, through the eyes of Sha Fei, the daughter of one of the long forgotten aristocratic families of the old Shanghai:&quot;Images of the house remain in my head like snapshots- the red tiles on tapered roof, the gray steel window frames shipped in from Lyons when the house was built, fourteen foot ceilings, French windows opening to a verandah, the fenced in garden with Chinese parasol trees and a rose bush.&quot;I particularly enjoyed the first part of the book in which Yang explores old and new Shanghai in great detail.Bund bound...Great work."},{"Title":"Shanghai Girl","review":"I have just finished reading Vivian Yang's, Shanghai Girl, and am amazed that it is the first novel of a young woman for whom English is a second language! Her use of idioms and slang are remarkable. She also has an excellent grasp of life, customs and politics in America. It is a very good read which opens the eyes of its readers to the incredible struggle that immigrants to our country must face when they leave their homelands to seek &quot;a better life&quot;.

I didn't pay much attention to the cover, only the title \\"Shanghai Girl.\\" I began to read the book and was shocked. I completed the book all the while I questioned why mention girl in the title with a picture of a female on a bicycle. After reading, I enlarged the cover picture on my kindle app to notice the female is wearing high heel shoes.What I like the most about this female's story, it the first time I heard a female Chinese character say her reason to feel loved. I appreciated the writer's insight in sharing the character's thoughts on American love to be treated like a lady from a gentleman. This thought helped me understand my past friendships/encounters with Asian females.The writer created a character as they say love to hate. He was a disguisting person. The characters she written were believeable characters, people everyday and made the novel read like an actual true account of someone's life.The reason for the four stars, because a few times the chapters skipped in time and I had to back track and catch up. I didn't like the adult intimate interactions. I thought all but one of the scenes were not believeable."},{"Title":"Shanghai Girl","review":"This booklet never really got off the ground for me.

From the moment I opened the cover till the very last page I could not stop reading this magnificent book about the nightmarish American immigrant experience as experienced by these two sisters. The story starts in 1937 and is full of the cultural richness of that era of history when time stopped with the sound of a rickshaw and its tiny laborer running through the streets with loose flapping shoes.Twenty one year old Pearl Chin and her younger sister, May, are having the time of their lives. Both are beautiful, modern,and carefree --until the day their father tells them that he has gambled away their wealth and that to repay his debts, he must sell the girls as wives to suitors who have traveled from Los Angeles to find Chinese brides. As Japanese bombs fall on their beloved city, Pearl and May set out on the journey of a lifetime, from the Chinese countryside to the shores of America.Though inseparable best friends, the sisters also harbor petty jealousies and rivalries. Along the way they make terrible sacrifices, face impossible choices, and confront a devastating, life -changing secret, but through it all the two young women of this astounding new novel hold fast to who they are--Shanghai girls.

The authors believe that mathematics is less about an ideal world of forms and more emergent from daily work. For this reason they reference their examples to practical examples of the sort popular in the Soviet Union in the 1960s taken from heavy industry.The section on computer technology, of course is useful primarily to the antiquarian.Because the authors are not excessively formal in the Western mode the student has to do extra work to derive results they illustrate with physical metaphors in some cases.There's also a certain motivation here to sing the praises of Russian mathematicians which is fortunately subordinated to the truth. As such, the book is a document from a period when Russia's greatness was based on its prowess in science and mathematics, prowess based on a universal availability of public education. This resource has been sold to Western investors for pennies on the dollar with no plan to reproduce it for the next generation, which is rather sad."},{"Title":"Mathematics: Its Content, Methods, and Meaning - 2nd Edition","review":"This is a huge brick of a book. As other reviewers have pointed out, it is comprised of three volumes on pretty much all undergraduate math, bound into one. Other reviewers have correctly pointed out that the material is exhaustive, and although one or two chapters are a bit dated, reading this work and studying it carefully is a very rewarding endeavour. I am a social scientist, and studying this book in depth has made me conversational in pretty much all the math an engineer would be expected to know at the end of his undergraduate studies. This is to stress that although this book is accessible to the motivated amateur, the knowledge you can gain from it with dilligent study carries quite a bit of weight.Although I think the content of a book is more important than its physical composition, I would like to point a few things out because they have not been mentioned by other reviewers and may be useful if you are considering buying this edition, or the separate three volumes.Like I said, it's quite a tome, and not something you can easily carry around in a backpack on a day to day basis. In this sense, or if you are only interested in particular topics, you are better off buying one or all of the separate three volumes.However, note that this edition has an index which covers ALL three volumes, which makes looking things up and using this book as a reference text very useful.I know keep this book handy, precisely to use as a reference texte. The index makes it easy to find what I am looking for, and the treatment of the topic always strikes a nice balance between being accessible and yet in enough depth to have practical value."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"This book will probably get a better response if it's made into a movie. It reads like a screenplay with all the usual suspects: Nazis, Italy and WWII. The author spends most of the book detailing minor battle sequences of boys destroying tanks and picking off Nazis-scenes best left for the big screen special effects studios. I was barely able to get behind our hero-Connors-the sole American orchestrating much of the Neapolitan insurrection.My favorite part was when the boys of Naples ask Connors where in the US he was from. They explained that they knew only of California and New York and asked if Kentucky was in New York. Connors incredulously said it was somewhat near Chicago, \\"surely you've heard of Chicago\\" he asked. They responded with laughter saying they couldn't believe the US had a city names Chicago, which in Neapolitan means \\"The place I [poop].\\" It was the same response I got when I was visiting Naples after telling a waiter in Sorrento that I was from Chicago."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

(In fact, the same story in a different setting already WAS a terrific movie back in 1981, &quot;Taps&quot;)The book reads as though it was fleshed out from a screenplay. There is little exposition, back-story, plot intersection. It's your basic, linear white-hat vs black-hat war story, the twist being that the white-hats are teenagers and the black-hats are adults."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"This nearly became one of the handful of books I've put down before finishing it. I stuck it out, but it really wasn't worth it. The idea is a fantastic one, and as a lover of WWII fiction I was really looking forward to something different. But the language and events are all over the place. The action is very hard to follow and in just about every battle I had a hard time telling what was going on. It also could have benefitted from a map of Naples--I've never been to Naples, and his descriptions of locations left me baffled. One moment some kids are chasing a tank down an alley, the next moment they're in a castle. Huh? Where did a castle come from? I was lost. He also builds up some major character only to have them fizzle out later, as if they were never really imporatant.On top of all that, the Germans are portrayed here like the bumbling idiots that chase down Indiana Jones. Everybody knows the German's were horrible and intelligent, and there's no way they would have gone out like they did in this book. True, a fight in the streets of Naples did take place, but many lost thier lives. I think only two kids die in the book, at least that you witness. That's just not realistic.Anyone who wants a good WWII story should read The Good German by Joseph Kannon.

Street Boys is an inventive tale of the events of those riveting four days, but why stray so far from the truth? Heroes of the past deserve a just tribute, and in this case the truth is far more gripping. There was no American star that taught these poor boys to fight, and moreover, the bravest of the boys who did on their own were each awarded Gold medals of Honor for valor, an all-empowering fact that Carcaterra seemingly overlooked in his fiction.An enthralling depiction closer to the truth can be found in the 1980 book and now audiocassette title &quot;Four Days of Naples&quot; or the 1963 Academy Award nominated film of the same name by Nanni Loy. It will be interesting to see if Carcaterra's 2002 tale receives as much acclaim.

Corporal Steve Connors is separated from his two companions, but meets up with an underground army of two hundred orphans, whom are the only local occupants of the eerily deserted bombed out Naples.Steve and his new allies begin fighting the much more powerful German Panzer Division led by Colonel Von Klaus. The battle is intense as lives are lost on both sides. The outcome should be obvious, but is not possible for an army of children and an American law student turned Commando to hold back the mighty Nazi war machine, but at what cost and for how long?The action never slows down as STREET BOYS matches pace with the blitzkrieg of France. However, the characters including the hero, some of the resistance who kind of stand out in the crowd, and Von Klaus seem like one dimensional depictions of Captain America vs. the Red Skull. Still, fans of World War II action dramas will enjoy Lorenzo Carcaterra's tale, but wish the heroic Connors was developed as much as Lee-Kirby did Rogers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"Blessed are peacemakers, for they say things like, \\"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy?\\"Gandhi was right, of course, but what if the orphans and the homeless fought back?That's the premise of Lorenzo Carcaterra's new novel, \\"Street Boys,\\" in which a ragged brigade of children rises up against a cold-blooded enemy in World War II.\\"Street Boys\\" is a departure from Carcaterra's engaging but darker stories about crime and punishment on New York's meanest streets. But like the best-selling \\"Sleepers,\\" \\"Apaches,\\" \\"A Safe Place\\" and \\"Gangster,\\" it's bound by the threads of survival and rootless youth.This isn't Hell's Kitchen or the Bronx, though. It's no man's land: bombed-out Naples in 1943. Among the last people in the evacuated city are lost, abandoned children whose only goal is to survive another day.Survival transforms them into fierce commandos, facing a Nazi tank division sent to demolish the ancient Italian city before Allied armies arrive. The sadistic orders from Hitler himself: If the city can't belong to the Fhrer, it will belong to no one.When Cpl. Steve Connors, a 25-year-old American soldier assigned to scout the city ahead of Gen. George Patton's advance, gets cut off from his own unit, he finds new comrades among Naples' young resistance fighters.Armed with salvaged guns, unexploded German bombs and their own ingenuity, Connors and his army of children are determined to deflect the Nazis and save the city -- or die.But Carcaterra has seldom made conflict easy. His good guys are often a little bad, and his bad guys are sometimes gifted with endearing, even redeeming, qualities. In our real world, such complexities are a fact of life; in commercial fiction, it's rare.Carcaterra's ambitious cast of characters is deftly drawn. Vincenzo Soldari, a 16-year-old history buff determined to follow in his ancestors' footsteps, is the real leader of the children's army. He's helped by Carlo Maldini, a middle-aged drunkard desperate to redeem himself, and his daughter Nunzia, a ferocious guerrilla who falls in love with the American GI who comes to their aid.Carcaterra is working on the screenplay of \\"Street Boys,\\" to be directed by Oscar-winner Barry Levinson. The book lends itself to good cinema: intricate characters, underdogs facing insurmountable odds, a desperate mission and lots of explosions -- the stuff of our best American war movies, from \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"No less complex than World War II novels by Norman Mailer and James Jones, \\"Street Boys\\" explores a different perspective on the war, and rides a fast-paced plot toward a heroic ending. The end of the war and the Allied invasion of Italy are well-known, but it is the transformation of characters along the way that defines the quality of historical fiction.In \\"Street Boys,\\" Carcaterra paints a vivid portrait of children at war, not as its helpless victims, but fighting back."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"Lorenzo Carcaterra latest novel \\"Street Boys\\" is not just another WWII war story, Carcaterra's narrative is heart-wrenching nonstop action and the best I have read.

This is one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"Let's recognize some basics: In September 1943, a small number of people, most of them young orphans, fought a pitched street battle with German tanks and soliders in the dying days of the war in Naples. Quattro Giornate is an historic event; \\"Street Boys\\" is not. Some will say the book reads better as a screenplay; the Italians already made the movie, forty years ago. Books need to be copy edited for spelling, accuracy and consistency; \\"Street Boys\\" is missing some of this. Some want the book to be truer to the history or at least more realistic; \\"Street Boys\\" has battle scenes that read like a cross among \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"The Little Rascals\\", and the Hardy Boys.Enter 'Quattro Giornate' along with 'Napoli' and '1943' in a Google search and you can find enough history to judge the relative accuracy of this book. If you're looking for historical accuracy, this book is not it. Men and women were more of a presence in the battle; the Germans were not the pathetic, Keystone Cops portrayed in the book. Naples was crushed, literally and figuratively, by petty, evil, vengeful Germans, but not without a fight, however small and however late.The characters are cardboard. Picture Colin Farrell as the one-man American army. Select any llithesome, nubile, dark-haired, olive skinned starlet du jour to play Nunzia. Or a young Leonard DiCaprio as the partisan child leader, Vincenzo. But the scenery and weather are pretty, no matter how much desolation brought on by the war. The events are heroic and ripe for Hollywood over-the-top scenes, e.g., menancing Germans shot by amazingly accurate fire from untrained youths at the last second.\\"Street Boys\\" could be a whole lot better. The story deserves better. But I would not dismiss this book, if only because the basic story should be remembered and writing your own screenplay in your head from a mediocre book is a much better exercise then watching a bad or even mediocre movie."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"I kept thinking, while I was reading Street Boys, that this book is a terrible insult to the actual street fighters who held off the nazis and their panzers in the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland, only to be lost in the end.The author, to compound the error, makes every action scene uninteresting and unbelievable, and every emotional scene (death and love) devoid of emotion. Episodes of dying children are smarmy or corny, or both at once. Children outsmart and overwhelm seasoned soldiers who have far superior firepower at every turn.Even the most egregious mistakes supposedly made by the Germans would not have enabled outnumbered and overmatched children to destroy a panzer division and hundreds of enemy troops, along with a German tanker.I hope no one buys this book. I hope no one pays to see the movie. I hope people read Mila 18 by Leon Uris instead."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"This is the third Carcaterra book that I have read (Sleepers, Apaches) and by far the worst. The scenes in this book are so unbelievable, I found myself stressed about finishing the final 1/3 of the book. There is a stead-fast rule in this book: If a character has a name, he/she is probably not going to die. I feel Carcaterra realized this in coming to the end of writing, so he kills off several characters in a matter of pages.I also feel that Carcaterra remembered that he introduced the idea of conspiracy from the other street boys in the late rounds of writing and realized that he had to kill their leader before moving forward.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone. I regretfully picked this book up in an airport bookstore based on my past experience with Carcaterra novels. This will be my last based on the fact that I felt he was whoring his writing out and begging for a movie deal with his latest work."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"While waiting to board on my last flight from Houston to Europe, I bumped into this last work by Carcaterra. I did not read \\"Sleepers\\", so this was my first experience, but, regretfully, I am not going to account as a memorable one.I am Neapolitan and the memory of the stories told by my Grandma of the famous \\"Quattro Giornate\\" (the four days of Naples)are still vivid in my memory.Maybe my expectation was different, maybe to high, considering how sacred is this event in our minds: the conclusion was rather disappointing.I noticed several criticisms already (the confusing geographical description, the mispelled Italian words) and I share this view, although I do not account for these to be crucial points in the assessment of the value of this book.However, everything is so artificial and fake. I accept the romance between Nunzia and Connors, but the real story is a story of misery, starvation, blood and (how many) tears.The Nazis look like puppets, falling under the shots of the clever Neapolitan kids: that is not true! How many died because of the ferocity of the German soldiers!The whole plot seems to be taken from a Travel Guide. Only the most historical and touristic places are mentioned in the book. And how many common sayings about Neapolitans: the truth is the opposite; we hide our virtues and talk mainly of our flaws!And then, it was not just kids: let's be realistic! There were several adults still around and, absolutely not mentioned in the book, the fundamental role of women (the mammas) was absolutely neglected: they were the logistic supply and the field hospitals at the same time.There is a lot to say about the 4 giornate: Carcaterra scratched just the top rusty part of the lid ....."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"When I read somewhere that Mr. Carcaterra was the author of the book on which the film \\"Sleepers\\" was based, I thought that I would at the very least get a well-structured, exciting story about one of my favorite topics, WWII. Boy was I wrong! Instead the novel turns out to be something akin to a script for a Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay production. Here's why:1. The characters are hollow and one-dimensional. I felt no attachment to any of the lead characters, and the one most interesting to me is never fleshed-out and is wasted three-quarters of the way through.2. There are so many inconsistencies, I had to force myself to finish the book midway through. Unless everyone in Naples, from the American to the Neopolitans to the Germans, all spoke one language, how were they able to understand everything and communicate so clearly to one another? How exactly did those street boys in the zoo understand what was said between the two German snipers?3. Most of the action is ludicrous and so cliched. The setups, I swear, seem like they were lifted from some Bruce Willis action flick. Am I really to believe that an army of 200 tykes could actually take on one of Germany's lauded Panzer divisions, who were both feared and respected as the best fighting armored army of the war, and affect as much damage as they did? And the way Carcaterra writes the Nazi soldiers is straight out of a propaganda action flick during the war.4. The romance between Steve and Nunzia feels tacked on and is incredibly formless and dull.5. The dialogue is as cheesy as it gets. I'm talking groan-inducing. And everyone sounds the same; I had a hard time distinguishing the voices of each character.To sum it up, the book is lazy, phony and sloppy. It starts out okay, but by the halfway point it becomes a struggle to get through without thinking of that other book you could have been reading instead. I can't really recommend the book to anyone, especially to fans of WWII historical novels or to those of the action genre."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"During WW II, when the Nazis realized their fate was sealed, the city of Naples became a target for their frustration and maniacal tenets of supremacy and destruction. Realizing they would no longer be able to use Naples as a strategic offensive locale, the orders were given to raze it to the ground.There were 200 children orphaned and abandoned in the city they identified as their home. STREET BOYS is the story of their tenacious and magical efforts to prevent the Nazis from achieving their goal.The universal theme of Good vs. Evil is depicted throughout the book, many times unfortunately, in vignettes that defy belief. Carcaterra's weakness in this book is his inability to abut the edge of absurdity but never cross it. Instead, the important scenes are so incredible even the most gullible reader will struggle to swallow without choking. Several times the youth, untrained and out-manned, engage the evil Nazis in battle and emerge victorious. The \\"kiddie guerrillas\\" manage to initially arm themselves with rifles previously jettisoned in 40 ft of water which they retrieve, dry out, and learn to expertly shoot. The youthful combatants also recover machineguns, ammo, grenades and tanks with minimum casualties while maximizing the kill of the trained but inefficient enemy.I have liked Carcaterra's previous work but STREET BOYS falls short of his past excellence. It is very difficult to recommend but if you must read it, use the library."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"I purchased this book because it was about two of my favorite topics, Naples and WWII. The author lured me into thinking this was a historical novel, but that is not true. He has no sense of geography. Anyone standing in Naples and facing the sea will have Vesuvio to their LEFT, not the right. Salerno is SOUTH of Naples. There were many errors in the Italian phrases in the book. The story seemed based on early sixties war films. Connors jeep apparently had a bottomless fuel tank. In spite of fierce battles all around, he and Nunzia find time for a &quot;quickie&quot;. The German Colonel reacts to everything by slamming his fist on something. Charecters appearing in one part of the city, then another part of the city without the benefit of public transportation.There are countless true stories about the bravery of the Sgunnizzi [street boys] that need to be told. Perhaps another author will do them justice."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"Mr. Carcaterra, your mistakes were so evident in the text that I hardly feel a need to reveal them. However, for the sake of the public, here they are:1. Do you even know what you are doing with the history of this event? You have taken this battle of guts and courage from cowering, left behind children and made into into Helms Deep. The cleverness and cunning of your characters, while cute, was a complete insult to their legacy of ultimate destruction against an overwhelming force of perhaps the mightiest soldiers of their era. That said, I disagree with the reviewers who have only skimmed the text and say that only two kids die. In truth I could count maybe twenty deaths of children in your almost fantastical story.2. You made me want to cry. And cry and cry and cry. And after I got done crying, cry some more. Your battle scenes were HORRIBLE! In every one you have kids come out of buildings like Gorillas, pull grenades and Molotov cocktails from their butts, kill 100 Nazis and under fire run to the enemy lines to steal their guns before retreating back into the buildings and sewers with their newly acquired weaponry. You made the German army out to look like impotent fools touching their weapons for the first time, when in fact they were trained and able men who had fought for years, who had superior weaponry and an entire division of tanks. I remember in one battle scene you have your character Vincenzo lure unsuspecting Germans into a castle courtyard to be picked off and all but slaughtered by a few kids who had managed to lay Mines just before the soldiers bust into the courtyard. First off, the Germans would have either beaten the kid into submission for information when he approached them, or better yet, they would have shot him. And secondly, THIS IS NOT AN EPISODE OF \\"HOME ALONE!\\" The Germans would have spotted Mines roughly laid by the hands of Neapolitan children. Even with superior position on the Germans, the tank that the Germans had brought into the courtyard with them would have crumbled the structure from the inside out in a matter of minuets, taking the children with the rubble to the jagged floor below. Those who didn't die on impact would have found themselves alone, weaponless and outnumbered by battle-hardened German soldiers that would have taken their lives without uncommon consequence. Frankly, Mr. Carcaterra, these kids were fighting a lost cause that would consume all of their lives before liberation and it wouldn't have been a single American bomber that took out an entire panzer division.3. All impracticalities aside, your writing and plot structure was ill developed. You obviously didn't take that much time planning out the succession of events. About 100 pages before the \\"immoral\\" snipers got in a firefight with the children that finally took their lives, you introduced them in the middle of the conflicts moving into the central city. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE. NEVER! Didn't you go to college, because your preliminary English teacher is shaking his head in sorrow. You need to spend more time thinking about your writing before sending it off to be published on a gimmick, simply because you're a best selling author!To conclude, you are an excellent writer and I am sure a great person, but you blew it with this one. Disappointing, yes, but still another addition to the library. Suggested only to those few brave who are willing to be a bit experimental with history.Mat Perrin, esq."},{"Title":"Street Boys","review":"Having been somewhat of a fan in the past, I thought I'd get a bit of a lift out of Carcaterra's latest work. Unfortunately, the only lift out of this made-for-the-screen tripe is what Carcaterra took from earlier and vastly better renditions of the historic boys uprising in Naples over those four days in 1943. He says in the opening that the locations and scenes are wholly new and what he created for \\"Street Boys,\\" but it was all done before in much better, truer, and heartfelt books. A few earlier reviews list some, but one in particular that comes to mind is a book called \\"Four Days of Naples.\\" Not to mention, the Italians made a movie as well, and it was up for an Academy Award. I wonder if Carcaterra read or saw any of those.

He describes Newton as not only a scientific genius, but as the person who revolutionized science, and thus influenced the way of thinking, and indeed the way of modern life.Newton, to be sure, was not an easy person to live with, nor was he a perfect human being. All this however pales in comparison to his superior intellect and deep understanding of nature. The book gives ample accounting of Newton's two great works \\"Opticks\\" and \\"Principia\\" and how these two have influenced the world he lived in, and the effects they left forever since.This book is a necessary reading not only for those interested in science, but for all who want to have a glimpse into the way of life in the 16th and 17th centuries, and especially the way science and philosophy spread throughout the world.Read it!Shab LevyPortland, OR 2002"},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","review":"Westfall's \\"Life of Isaac Newton\\" is everything the other reviewers say in regards to it being a good ABRIDGED biography of Newton. True, it is based in thorough scholarship and has served for the basis for many other Newton biographies to follow. But I would strongly caution any historian, whether by hobby or profession, to solely consult this book when referencing or discussing Newton. Westfall's abridged version lacks any mention of references (unless you count the very incomplete bibliographical essay at the end) in either footnotes, endnotes, or a comprehensive bibliography. In order to trace his references, one must consult his much more complete \\"Never at Rest\\", which is, altogether, a much more academic book. Don't get me wrong, \\"The Life of Isaac Newton\\" is easy to read and a good foundational text but should not serve as an authority on Newton, but rather a companion to a more authoritative text on Newton.Aside from the historiographical issues in this book, if it is to serve as an introduction to early modern science, it might also help readers to know that they should read, at some point, some sort of text that deals with British history from the Sixteenth through Eighteenth centuries, as Wesfall provides no historical or political background in which to understand Newton. Based on my own reading of books to suit this purpose I would recommend Simon Schama's \\"History of Britain, vol. 2\\"; \\"Leviathan and the Air-pump\\" by Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer; \\"Leviathan\\" by Thomas Hobbes, or \\"The Scientific Revolution\\" also by Steven Shapin (which would be less of a cultural or political history but a good introduction to the issues with history of science in the seventeenth century).As an alternative to Westfall's abridged version, I would also suggest (though he is not an academic, he is a pretty well-regarded science journalist with a very readable style) James Gleick's \\"Isaac Newton\\" which is a little shorter and more in depth in some regards (and does completely cite references)."},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","review":"The Life of Isaac Newton, by Richard Westfall, addresses the life and work of one of the greatest scientists of all time. Indeed, many consider Isaac Newton to be the greatest scientist of all time, because his work was the culmination of the Scientific Revolution. Westfall covers Newton's unhappy childhood, from which he escaped to Cambridge University where he emerged as a solitary, studious individual. Newton's genius found expression during the anni mirabilis, 1664-1666, when Cambridge was closed due to the plague. During these years, Newton explored a wide range of scientific issues, including mathematical physics, optics, mechanics, and celestial dynamics. He expanded upon Descartes' geometry, to develop the calculus. He conducted experiments with light, concluding that white light is made up of a series of colors. Newton also pursued studies of the movement of objects, following up on the work of Gallileo. Westfall covers Newton's lengthy career at Cambridge, where he devoted his life to his studies, avoiding most relationships and incurring animosity and resentment among many of his fellow scientists, including Robert Hooke. Newton's masterpiece was the Principia, in which he laid out his three laws of motion: inertia; acceleration; and action and reaction. Newton also presented the laws of universal gravitation. Westfall was compelled to write this biography - which is a shortened version of his larger, more technical study - to share the unfolding of the amazing genius who discovered so many of the laws underlying the physical world. This book is worth reading because it provides in an accessible form insights into the discoveries in the fields of mathematics and physics that ushered in the world of modern science."},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","review":"This book is an abridged version of the author's much larger full biography, Never at Rest, published in 1980. In the preface the author notes that this is very much an abridgement rather than a rewrite, because his interests have changed and he could not do justice to the research on Newton that had gone on in the intervening years to 1993. This makes the work 28 years out of date, although in historical terms it is hard to know if this is an issue.The perceptible difference is in the tone. Early on in the book, especially, Westfall adopts an almost sycophantic attitude to Newton's genius, constantly assessing each event in terms of whether it demonstrates the great man's ability, and nudging us knowingly when other thinkers have not recognised this towering intellect before he has published anything. I'm not sure a (non-revisionist) writer setting out to write Newton's biography today would adopt such an attitude, and would hopefully be more inclined to tell the story and let the events speak for themselves.Happily, as the book goes on and Newton's talent is recognised we are given a glimpse of the man himself, and it truly is a fascinating vision. I found Newton's obsession with alchemy and the Holy Trinity (which, for him, represented the Beast of Revelation) even more fascinating than his work on optics and gravitation. Newton comes across as a man of almost aspergic obsessiveness and aversion to engage in normal social interactions, one who set terrifyingly high standards, both intellectual and moral, which only he, working prodigiously in a position many treated as a sinecure, could ever hope to aspire to.I can see why the author was asked to produce this book: it is about the right length for someone peripherally interested in Newton, and without the mathematics, which many would find off-putting. In the 20th century Einstein is generally portrayed as the quintessential genius, tousle-haired and absent-minded, but anyone reading this biography of obsession and single-mindedness would be forced to pass the mantle to Newton."},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","review":"Newton has been a fascinating figure for me, ever since I read a condensed history about him in one of those INTRODUCTION TO series, I think that one was on Quantum Physics. What fascinated me about Newton was his singleness of mind, a genius who devoted himself almost entirely to the pursuit of knowledge.Westfall's book is a condensation of an earlier book _Never at Rest_ which I have not had the pleasure of reading. Westfall presents the life of Newton warts and all. It describes his rise to prominence in the scientific world of his time and all the events leading to his most significant publication, the Principia.What was new to me was Newton's arguments with Hooke and his behavior toward Flamsteed which diminish the man's greatness, in my mind at least. What may be interesting to readers of Newton, the man, rather than the Scientist, are his \`latter years' in public service at the Mint.Overall, I think Westfall kept the proper balance between presenting the works and person of the life of Newton. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","review":"It would be hard to find fault with the genuis of Newton's creations in mathematics, physics and the reflecting telescope. In deed, the only thing that could eclipse this genuis would be his own dark character demons. 'The Life of Isaac Newton', by Richard Westfall should be praised for a balanced reporting of both sides of this icon. Having previously read 'The Curious Life of Robert Hooke' by Lisa Jardine, I required some mention of Newton's shabby treatment of this fellow genius. Westfall adequately covered this mistreatment, along with Newton's unforgivable treatment of the Royal Astronomer, John Flamsteed, who provided 30 years of dedicated celestial measurements and Roger Cotes who proofread and corrected much of Newton's later work.So divisive was Newtons leadership at the Royal Society, that there was a consistant 25% of Anit-Newton vote on every issue, even if there was unanimity prior to and after all votes. This un-need Anti-Newton-Newton rift tainted the Society for years after Newton's death. Only under recent research have these facets of human fraility become known. It is sad that Newton's behavior tarnished his well earned credits. This and 'Robert Hook' by Jardine are must reads to understand the origins of the Royal Society and the development of the English Scientific Method."},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","review":"This is a well documented, well written biography of a powerful intellect who nevertheless had his idiosyncrasies and insecurities. Isaac Newton is an admirable figure to read about due to his high degree of honesty. He was searching for truth and found a good deal of it. Mr. Newton's search was related not only to the mysteries of natural phenomena but into the origins and authentic teachings of Christianity which led him to make discoveries that his church-dominated society would have found threatening to say the least. After all, if established religion is shown to have a grossly erroneous concept of the God of the Bible, whom they profess to worship, then they constitute a public spiritual hazard. Nevertheless this was the situation and Newton recognized it. He did not choose to publicize it though, apparently in order to retain his access to the levers of scientific progress.The author does Newton a service by not introducing his own opinions in telling of this although there are other areas where the story must be inferred from meager documentation. When the author's opinion does enter, at least the reader is provided sufficient factual information to either agree or disagree.For example, calling Isaac Newton an 'Arian' is a bit of a stretch. Newton's conclusion that God was not a Trinity did not depend on the teaching of Arius, but as the author explains, on his personal scrutiny of many Bible manuscripts, translations, copies, and primarily by accumulating a substantial list of relevant scriptures.It is a fascinating story of a man grappling with monumental issues and can be richly enjoyed even by those tempted to skim over the more demanding parts where concepts of Newton's 'Opticks' and 'Principia' are explained."},{"Title":"The Life of Isaac Newton (Canto original series)","review":"&quot;The Life of Isaac Newton&quot; written by the brilliant Richard Westfall is a masterpiece.

An interesting change from the pace of most other authors is the use of rhetorical outlining in which the letter finds structure in a parallel fashion to the great speeches and writings of contemporaneous Rome. I have no idea how accurate this assesment is and it adds little to the overall thrust, but it is interesting nonetheless.Donfried does an adequate job of showing all the major themes of the letter - election, suffering, parousia, etc. - as well as the more mundane place and date. He then goes on to relate such things to the Pauline corpus as a whole and then to our situation today.2 Thessalonians receives nearly identical treatment. Everything written for both letters is all just okay. Perhaps it is because these first letters of Paul are not as gripping as his later work or perhaps it is because Donfried continues to draw in Paul's later work too much and thus distract from looking at just these letters, but I did not find myself fully engaged while reading through his exposition. If anything, his only sin is being uncreative in his presentation and bland in his analysis, but both are solid.The survey of Philippians by Marshall which follows is even more bland. Instead of the basic four chapter structure, he uses an outline that is both more cheesy and less helpful by using the metaphor of building a &quot;church&quot; building. His look at preformed material, christology, etc. are all just as bland as Donfried's but it is set in the context of a jarring metaphor that I cannot disenage from. I feel as though I missed out on getting a better idea of Philippians' theology because of the ridiculous allegory.Finally Philemon is covered and is much better than Philippians, but there is so little attention given to it that it is hard to enjoy it.Overall, the ideas presented are neither shocking nor dull which makes the book just mediocre. For an introduction to these letters this book will serve just fine as it makes solid arguments and gives it in a clear (if uninspired) manner."},{"Title":"Wo Die Wilden Kerle Wohnen","review":"As I'm working on learning German, I thought having some children's books in that language would be helpful, so I ordered this one.

This and his strong Creationist convictions lead him to present a view of the natural world that is diametrically opposed to mainstream evolutionary theory. He arrives at this position via a series of misconceptions.For example, in chapter 1 he says:&quot; BURGESS: The genetic code is analogous to a complete set of engineering drawings&quot;In this, Biologists will recognise shades of the &quot;Homunculus (little man)&quot; model that their discipline dispensed with in the 18th century and the Author's subsequent arguments demonstrate that he really believes this to be true:&quot;BURGESS: The fact that the knee joint must be grown in the developing embryo adds further complexity to the design. As well as specifying all the characteristics of the knee joint, the cell must also specify how the knee will grow and become assembled.&quot;Genetic information is NOT analogous to a set of engineering drawings, and many 19th/20th century biology books regard some variant of the recipe idea as being much more appropriate. Modern biology books emphasise how misleading it is and that DNA information is \\"Generative and not Descriptive\\".The difference here is fundamental and many of the factual and conceptual errors in &quot;Hallmarks of Design&quot; can be traced back to this.Information that determines what biologists call &quot;development&quot; and Dr. Burgess calls &quot;growth and assembly&quot; is entirely sufficient and &quot;Engineering Drawing&quot; information does not exist in the DNA of any living organism. ( For a fascinating account of current concepts in this area see &quot;The Art of Genes by Geneticist Enrico Coen).Rather ironically, if Dr. Burgess COULD find a Homunculus in ANY living organism then he would have a devastating argument against evolutionary theory which would not be able to explain it. A point he seems to have missed.Instead he goes on to argue that Evolution by Natural Selection is an &quot;absurd deception&quot; because organisms exhibit exquisite levels of adaptation to their environment. He is apparently oblivious of the fact that it was just this that led Darwin to think of the idea in the first place.Dr. Burgess doesn't see it that same way that Darwin did:&quot;BURGESS: Such reasoning is absurd for several reasons. Firstly, if a random change is made to the information on a drawing of a motorbike steering system, this will at best cause no change the in basic functions and at worse have fatal consequences. &quot;Here we see the consequences of the false &quot;Engineering drawing&quot; analogy in full flight. He obviously fails to recognise that a single random change to a development recipe could result in the duplication of the whole motorbike to produce a viable &quot;organism&quot; that had four wheels instead of two. Mutations of this kind are induced in fruit flies on a routine basis in biology labs. At a level, the genes that control development are analogous to Subroutine calls in computer programming. If a call is mistakenly duplicated by a single mutation then the functionality of the subroutine is reiterated and another complete copy of the corresponding structure is produced.Dr. Burgess cites \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" as a reference . In this book, Richard Dawkins says on this point:DAWKINS: It is easy to believe that individual snakes with half a dozen more vertebrae than their parents could have arisen in a single mutational stepThis mechanism allows evolution to neatly circumvent the Author's second reason for supposing that evolutionary theory is an &quot;Absurd and shallow deception&quot;:&quot;BURGESS: Secondly, there are no intermediate mechanisms between a motorbike steering system and a car steering system whereas evolution would require hundreds of fully functional intermediate forms.A simple duplication of a call to a development subroutine could deliver a four wheeled organism in a single step. Intermediate forms between two wheels and four wheels are therefore unnecessary. In &quot;Climbing Mount Improbable&quot; Richard Dawkins speculates that the shovel nosed lobster &quot;Scyllarus&quot; acquired its odd shape by just this mechanism.It is easy to see where the analogies used by Dr. Burgess fail and, in consequence, he is led seriously astray. Consequently, the evolutionary concepts depicted in this book and described as an \\"Absurd and shallow deception\\" bear little or no relationship to the theory that any competent evolutionist would recognise as the modern Theory Of Evolution. Dr. Burgess is therefore simply attacking a simplistic and fictional little world of his own design."},{"Title":"Essential Windows XP Commands Reference","review":"I bought this reference because I liked Stanek's book &quot;Windows XP Professional Administrator's Pocket Consultant.&quot; I was disappointed.

Slowly, it becomes apparent as John finds himself the target of gun wielding thugs and the center of a political mess in Cuba and at home. Survival, not money becomes paramount as John Deal struggles to escape the island alive.This is not the normal John Deal series book that I have grown accustomed to reading over the years. Missing is the humor, the occasional witty comment, that served as additional background in the other novels of the series. In fact, the human element is all but lost in this novel that spends so much time in regards to family connections.Instead, the reader is told that one should feel emotion over various things throughout the novel, but that emotional connection to the reader is never made. There is a certain distance to the writing, which is especially surprising considering some of the various personal events in John Deal's past that are covered. Considering the obvious storytelling possibilities, this lack of emotion is amazing and can't be discussed further without giving away major portions of the novel.This book also hardly answers the many questions that it raises. One question is answered at the end, but most are left dangling in what appears to be nothing more than a setup for the next novel of the series. With so much unfinished business, it leaves this reader feeling just a bit cheated. Les Standiford has taken his readers off on a tangent and the question remains whether he will return them to the main highway or crash in a dead end."},{"Title":"Havana Run","review":"Somehow I just picked this novel up last month. Do you read every Florida Keys Mystery/Action you can get? I do and I have a scale of favorites. Corcoran, Hall, and White in that order plus a few lesser lights. Of course in the well known writers' works the standard wicked crew, developers, pols and tee shirt moguls plus the mob have become a bit too wearing on the beleagured &quot;conchs.&quot; Thus it is a pleasure to read the adventures of John Deal and his Dealco development corporation, dedicated to making a buck but not vast sums of bucks by doing condos right. (If there is any way to do them right.)In Bone Key, Deal and sidekick fell into the Key West scene as potential developers of a &quot;martello&quot; tower centered resort. His inherited and endangered development corporation was just recovering from the suicide of his less environmentally dedicated father's suspicious &quot;dealings.&quot;(Yep, puns appear now and then.) This novel continues the tale and expands upon it, bringing into the picture his father's early ties to Cuba and plans for post CAstro development.Who these developers may be (off shore banks and all) their ties to on island dissidents and off island exiles and the U.S. Government's desires to snoop on everyone (gives new meaning to the U.S. Interest Section) is the heart of this book. Given current state of boat traffic between the Keys and Cuba,rumors, speculation over future development in Cuba and the general murkiness of ownership of those luxury villas popping up along island edges, there's more than a bit of reality here.Then too, it's kind of fun to see a hero developer. Talk to anyone in the Keys and they will tell you that's kind of like the tooth fairy. It would be nice.Finally, this novel reads a bit faster than Bone Key. I thought there was just a bit too much repetitious complication in that earlier one. (Read it during a long airport wait, so I might misjudge it a bit. It does give some background which helps here.)"},{"Title":"Havana Run","review":"Since his father's suicide and manufactured evidence of his corruption, John Deal has been forced off the police force and struggled to recover his father's once-thriving construction business from the financial problems his father's death had created. When wealthy hispanic businessman Fuentes offers Deal a million dollars as a retainer and invites him to Havana, Deal initially resists. He doesn't believe in things being too good to be true--he can't afford the hidden costs. But when the government asks him to cooperate with Fuentes, he agrees to play along.Once in Havana, life becomes complicated. In addition to the government, at least two groups seem to want Deal's cooperation. An adventure of chases through the jungle, into Ernest Hemmingway's old boat, and through the streets of Havana ensues. What Deal learns is that there are secrets within secrets and tha everything he had believed is a fabrication.Author Les Standiford offers a well written and interesting adventure story. Despite the implausibility of much of the story, Standiford's adventure-telling draws the reader in. Deal is largely unsympathetic and emotionally uncompelling as his cynical nature refuses to let him believe anyone (probably wise since everyone has been lying to him). HAVANA RUN does raise a number of important questions--the role of the mob in post-Castro Cuba, the trigger-happy nature of both the Cuban and American militaries, and whether the U.S.'s current restrictions on contact with Cuba truly serve anyone's interest."},{"Title":"Havana Run","review":"Les Standiford's \\"Havana Run\\" lives up to the high standards set the initial seven John Deal novels.Deal (the \\"last honest builder in South Florida\\") reluctantly accepts the promise of an extensive rebuilding project in post-Castro Cuba from the shady Antonio Fuentes. Fuentes represents a \\"consortium\\" and has a $1 million retainer.Prior to departing, Deal is coerced by a Justice Department op to plant miniature listening devices throughout the island.Once in Cuba, Deal sees he was lured there for a sinister purpose: to break an American prisoner out of a Castro jail...a man who holds secrets that many factions would kill to learn---others to keep them concealed.But who is pulling the strings: underground freedom fighters, the consortium, the US government, double agents, Castro partisans?From Miami to Key West to Cuba Deal discovers not everyone can be trusted and figuring out who is trustworthy is nearly impossible.Les Standiford is the most underrated Florida mystery writer. \\"Havana Run\\" is part crime fiction, part spy thriller...filled with intrigue, realistic action, suspense, betrayal and an ending that will knock you down.Top drawer reading!"},{"Title":"Havana Run","review":"Thirteen years ago, police officer John Deal learned that his father committed suicide. His face was so badly damaged that his son couldn't recognize him. The police find papers proving John was supplying his father with information that he used in his business dealings. Unable to demonstrate he was set up, the brass allowed him to retire. John took over Deal Co, the construction company his father ran into the ground.In the present, Deal Co. is breaking even when Antonio Fuentes asks him to accompany him to Cuba. Fuentes represents a consortium who want to rebuild Cuba after Castro is gone and they want Deal to be their point man. Deal is about to turn him down when a government agent asks him to go along with Fuentes and in return they will give him proof that he was framed thirteen years ago. Deal goes to Cuba intending to play the spy but finds someone that has to be smuggled out of the country at any cost, making his deal with the government null &amp; void.Readers get an inside look at the Cuba of today in HAVANA RUN and although the country is in a holding pattern different forces are ready to take control once the present leader is gone. Les Standiford raises the bar of the suspense thriller in the latest installment of his John Deal series. Though one must wonder about a government that hides the truth that would exonerate someone, this fits right into the story line and Justice, American style. Readers will take to the protagonist right away because of the vulnerability that shines above this tough guy persona.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Outspoken: Free Speech Stories","review":"How fortunate for us that during the reign of Bush/Cheney/Ashcroft and Ridge this humane, intelligent and compassionate book should be available! Ms. Levinson writes with clear and heartfelt dedication to the subject and to the individuals who have been subjected to infringements on their First Amendment rights. The stories are lively and accessible; the insights wise and deeply considered. I would recommend this book anytime, but especially now when our secretive and self-assured government repeatedly threatens our delicate liberties--often abusing the tragedy of September 11th to do so. There is nothing stiff and dusty here. The topic is current and the reader is reminded that our quiescence allows self-interested corporations, government agencies and moral prigs to dictate limits on our precious freedom. &quot;Outspoken&quot;, though not preachy in tone, is an inspiration to wake up and defend that which is ours to lose. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Modern Library edition is a nice choice for the adult reader, featuring all the wonderful original illustrations (by British political cartoonist John Tenniel), a thoughtful forward by A.S. Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading. AIW and TTLG are must-haves in anyone interested in fantasy/sci-fi, along with Chronicles of Narnia and other great classics."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll.

This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at.

There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was one of the first English novels I read, and I loved it. I went on to read Through the Looking Glass and loved it just as much.

Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent.

Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her. If you sometimes feel that things are not going your way, you might want to pick this book up. It may work, just like for me and that professor."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"These books work on so many different levels. My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths. These are not so well known."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Its hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this brilliant book. Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

From the beginning when Alice falls down the Rabbit hole and leaves Dinah, it captivates the reader and enchants the reader. Carroll was a master of outlandish and imaginative fiction and this statement is proven when you read this book.Dont listen to any of the 'nonsense' that Alice in Wonderland is based on LSD trips etc. This is nothing but people trying to take away Carroll's genius from him.Great Book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"'Alice in Wonderland', by Lewis Carroll, is an excellent book for both adults and children. It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read. If you you're read it already, why not read it again?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Nice presentation of the two books with the classic illustrations.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school. Reading it as an adult was no better. It was possibly the most warped and perverse story I have ever read in my life.

It's quite clever to design a deck based on the classic &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Would have rated this deck higher except that it does NOT comes with an instruction book, but rather a quick-and-to-the-point pamphlet that truly simplifies the meanings of the cards. If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing. Due to the whimsical nature of the card, you might want to use it for more whimsical readings.

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page. Overall this book could use a better plot, but it keeps the reader interested with great characters and odd twists."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"i think this book is very good for girls in my age..because sometimes i also would like to flie out of this stressy world and alice is able to.."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Puchased for my teenage daughter who loves the classics.Book as described - good seller"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

I reread this with some trepidation as I remembered reading and enjoying it several times as a child, but was pleasantly surprised to find it just as magical as I did then.I won't bore anyone with the details of the story as I'm sure that most who are reading this review are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed.

The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time.

To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work. The Signet paperback contains all the Tenniel illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Lewis Carroll's 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' are part of our culture.

As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are. Do not miss it, as this is a timeless piece of literature that everyone should definitely read at least once."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion.

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts. To find out what actually occurred pick up the book and read it. Alice is a young girl who wishes there were more things in life and one day when she was out side with her sister she spots this white rabbit with a coat on and a pocket watch. She starts to follow it. She followed it through a rabbit hole and as she hit a soft spot on the ground Alice falls into a hole.

And perhaps it's folly to even try.I grew up with a hard backed copy of Alice in Wonderland and remember going through the pages countless times, gazing at the magnificent pictures--especially the Jabberwock--and giggling at the poetry. \\"Father William\\" and \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" still occupy parts of my brain as snatches and shards that want to pop out at awkward moments.That battle worn, orange backed book, handed down I'm pretty sure from my Dad, and read by him with equal enthusiasm when he was a kid, is long gone, and now that I'm armed with a Kindle I downloaded a copy to enjoy a fine book from my youth. If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself. As an eco-friendly Kindle purchase, however, I strongly recommend it, and if you've never read it before, well, what are waiting for?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"So glad to have this book for my library - not sure if I ever read it as a child, but I'm looking forward to reading it this summer at the beach!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland, the classic, thrilling fiction book, by Lewis Carroll, is a story that has intrigued and captivated readers for more than a hundred years. In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from.

These are some of the nonesense things; Drinks make you shrink, cakes make you grow, cats can dissapear, and flowers can sing.

Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

I'm going to order a different one right now."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In my english class we had to pick a foreign author and a book to read. I choose this book because I'd never read it before, I've seen the Disney version of this story but never got around to reading the actual book. I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes. I also enjoyed the poems throughout the story and when characters speak in riddles and ryhmes. The Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter would have to be my favorite characters in this whole story (besides Alice herself). Its a great book and I'd be happy to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I love the Alice books, but this was the first time I read all of them. I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover. Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover.

It is also notated throughout the book, with the explanations of each notation categorized in the back by Book:Chapter:Notation #.The thing that, for me, makes this particular pressing stand out, is not just that everything is all neatly bound together, but I absolutely ADORE the stylish new COVER!

In the first part where she's in Wonderland she goes through a world of nonsense and is trying to find a way out. In Through the Looking Glass she goes through a mirror into a backwards world. I would encourage anyone to read this book because it encourages people to use their imagination and to learn that stuff happens you just have to find the correct way to deal with it.My favorite character was the Duchess in the first part because she was very annoying and didn't even know it also she has a very comical cook who's obsessed with pepper.

It's a wonderfully funny fantasy I love it!! and so does my granddaughter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is a classic that every person should read. What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life! I strongly recommend getting this version of Carroll's classic story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass hold a special place in my heart. After my father died almost ten years ago, I purchased a copy for my mother. I suggested she read it and see that Alice, no matter what she went through, how bizarre and disturbing, always found a way to come out on top. She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source. This version is wonderful for the young or the old, as it's LARGE PRINT. I really can't say enough good things about this book. (On an interesting side note, there's a camp of thought about it actually being written by Queen Victoria...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It appears that many of the reviewers of this particular edition of the book are not actually reviewing the product. Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child. Taking this perpective, readers will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This Book Brings out the best of both words.

I haven't read the added features, just the Advenures and Looking-Glass stories, so I cannot comment on their content. The illustrations were very nice.

It's about a girl who found a little doorway, went in and can't find her way back."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I first read Alice's Adventures when I was about nine or ten years old, and you know what? I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book. The edition to get is one with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"'The Annotated Alice' with annotations done by Math and Games writer, Martin Gardiner may be the first, and is certainly the best known annotated edition of a popular classic, followed by annotations of other major popular classics such as the complete Sherlock Holmes and 'The Hobbit'.It is especially interesting to compare the Alice stories with Tolkien's novels, as both series of works are enhanced by their authors' love and professional involvement with language studies. The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you long to be carried away to a world of nonsense and magic, talking beasts and flowers then Alice is the best tour guide you can employ. This is a book that will find a place close to the heart of a reader of any age that has a place inside reserved for whimsy and childlike wonder. As Alice travels through Wonderland and meets many unexpected characters your imagination will soar. Run a race with a dodo bird. Have tea with the doremouse and his friends the mad hatter and the march hare. Thrill at the &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. Alice proves to be a very level headed young lady indeed as she encounters things that become &quot;curiouser and curiouser!&quot; The story meanders through forests and chessboards that are life size never ceasing to amaze the reader with charm and wit.

The book is truly a gift to any one who hopes to hold onto childhoods magic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful, lovely dust jacket, interesting illustrations, it is almost too big to casually read and is more of a coffee table book. It was bought as a companion to a collectable given as a Christmas present. The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have grown up watching Disney's Alice in Wonderland, and knowing what liberties Disney is known to take in their movies, I wanted to read the original story for myself.And I'm glad I did. Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk? Because it can produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front. That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares. And those monstrous ear worms.-carli"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

In fact, I once tried to read a copy from the 1980's but I couldn't go on with it because the pictures were bothering me. Luckily, there's really only one freaky illustration in the original version, and that's the picture where Alice's neck is very long. It's a bit disturbing.But the book is well written and a good adventure story, too.I love the characters. They're very interesting.\\"'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\\"- \\"The Chesire Cat\\", Alice In Wonderland, by Lewis CarrollCome to think of it, the Chesire cat illustration is actually quite creepy as well. But it's not a big deal or anything.The whole book's just weird fun. Where in the world did Mr. Carroll think of all this? The Mad Hatter? The Queen of Hearts? The Duchess and her pig baby?Alice herself is a considerably strange character.All in all, aside from a couple of creepy illustrations, the book is wonderful.

Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It's amazing that many people have never read this book. After all, it's virtually impossible to find an American unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and the instantly recognizable illustrations. Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats. This is an adult fable. Carroll invites us into his dream, and we share his fantastic experience through the clarity of a writer's genius.

Alice wanted to hear a story with lots of nonesense, and that's what Carroll did. If you still do not get it, I can't put it any more clearly.

When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me. The only point I got from it was an internal conflict of whether to take one road or not, like whether to take and drink certain things and what she should do with the moment."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S. Lewis on cheap drugs. The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth. I know it is considered a classic but I just do not see it, and if I did not have to read it for school I would not have bothered to finish it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)Through the Looking GlassThough this book is not much better than Alice's Adventures, the chess motif and theme does make the book much more interesting. With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure. I also appreciated the linking of the cat at the beginning and end of the story.It does still feel like Carroll did way too many opium pipes in his time.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am sure this book must be beautiful but I never received it from this seller.

It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body. Carroll also included illustrations of the important scenes of the story, so the reader would be able to understand them better. This story perfectly explains the racing imagination of a child in a light-hearted and imaginative way."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The pink flamingos are adorable, which makes it all the more disappointing when they start rubbing off from the second you remove the price sticker."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews.Alice is an inquisitive, and very brave girl, who observes the world around her, and attempts to understand what is happening and how to handle it.

That said, I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan and certainly don't have a lack of imagination, even at 27. Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M.

It's not cleverness - its just randomness disquised as cleverness. It just tosses a bunch of nothing together, shakes it up, mixes in a curious and rude little girl who's rudeness pales next to the characters she encounters in Wonderland. Those thousand monkeys at typewriters would produce something along these lines before getting to Shakespeare. For some reason, I never read this when I was discovering Narnia or Oz. Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to. Wonderland isn't even a world much less a persuasive daydream. Nothing there matters. And Alice just skips off at the end, leaving her sister to forecast a bit of standard drivel about the day when they will be grownups but always have their childhood inside.

This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland HTML Editionis a POOR CHOICE - 2 stars. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice.

The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago.

There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story. Are you willing to go tumbling down the rabbit hole?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Everyone has been rating this book as a children's book... It was written by an astute mathmatics doctorate Oxford professor. It is a fantastic book for adults to understand the mind of a child."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"WOW!!! never read this book as a kid or even seen the movie, but as an adult i absolutely loved it. So much going on its hard to keep up, but it does a great job at keeping one's attention. Both stories were great, but i liked the original one a little better than the sequel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I first read theAlice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)books as a child, armed with my own library card. Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around.

Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland.

Still, the wordplay is ingenious and the book is an all around treat."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Believe it or not, there was a time when the world was seen as a place where imagination had no place. It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns. A good read if you're tired of the machinization of any age and need to have some good old fashion unpredicatable fun!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I must confess I had never read the account of Alice's adventures before. As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before.

In rereading the book, I laughted loudly at times of the cleverness with which it was constructed. As a very 'mature' reader I had remembered such from my youthful reading of it. Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence!

The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows? If you haven't read this book yet then pick it up and read it no matter how young or old you are in age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book everyone has heard of but relative few have read.It's amazing how film versions, including Disney's, mix up elementsfrom either book like it doesn't matter -- or they didn't really understand what they were doing.But one of the most thoughful yet unsentimental moments I've ever read occurs in the closing paragraphs of &quot;Wonderland,&quot; as Alice's sister dreamily muses on the innocence of childhood and lazy summer days, and how we grow up and take on new cares. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In this book you find out about a little girl named Alice who falls down big holes, eats strange mushrooms, and shakes a chess piece so hard that it turns into her kitten.

It also makes you wonder and wish this could happen to you. Take a walk through Alice's imagination and read this book.(I'm so cool.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of the most clever and entertaining books yet written. The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

The order came in time and was brand new as I expected it to be.If you havent read it, you should do so."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Lewis Carroll's Alice stories are two of my favorite stories of all time. I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel! This edition includes all of them and the quality of the reproductions on the pages are excellent. Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This threadbare bargain-priced edition may seem like a deal, but consider before purchasing that it has no table of contents, no introduction, no forward, no illustrations, and no bibliography.

I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland kind of boring but still good. Then I read Through the Looking Glass, and I loved it! I memorized all of the poems (jabberwocky being my favorite poem in the world), read it about a million times, and recomended it to people. Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book.

Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book. So if you like fantasy and like to have a few laughs, this is the book you have to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book. It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting. The unorthodox type setups (such as the mouse's tale) are mostly preserved and the illustrations look good. One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book. And I noticed the table of contents link in the item menu does take you there. I never thought to look for a table of contents at the back of the book. My error.

You will always enjoy these for your family and pass on to future generations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland begins as a questioning, youthful girl named Alice tumbles down the rabbit hole to follow a white rabbit wearing a vest and watch. Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues). The drawings by Tenniel are brilliant and add the right flavor to the story. The book is well-written, surreal with bizarre, fascinating characters (whom a little girl has to figure out), unique situations, word play, puzzles and a mocking irreverent tone towards high society. Whenever as an adult I'd hit a snag and couldn't read, I would always pull out this one and it would put me back on track again. Another I will treasure for the memories of sharing it with my kid."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was an interest in my eyes. It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics.

The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter.

I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself.

When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really.

One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel's classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice's adventures there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Of course the story is fun but I don't like the way the ebook is formatted and there's no Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a book that seems to stay with what Lewis Carroll wanted these books to be.

There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused.

The book allows the reader to enter into Alice's mind and travel along with her through the worderful and mysterious Wonderland. Alice is a curious and questioning little girl traversing a land where nonsense is the common-sense, where right is wrong and where wrong is not always right (but can be sometimes!). This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book. Moreover, all this is presented by the most unusual characters in a rich text, often mixing prose and verse and sometimes toying with typography in a e. e. cummings-like nature, which makes the book quite unique."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book Alice in wonderland starts when Alice finds a white rabbit.

It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought.

According to Charles H. Sylvester (editor of Journeys through Bookland): \\"One day . . . he took three of his little friends, Alice and Edith and Lorina Liddell, for a trip up the river, and on that afternoon he began telling them about Alice and her Wonderland, continuing the story on other occasions. He had no intention of making a book, but the story pleased little Alice and her sisters so well that they talked about it at home and among their grown-up friends, who finally persuaded the author to have it printed.\\" Note: Songs are composed by Field, although the opening poem \\"All in the Golden Afternoon\\" is missing from this recording.

It's sadly missing a good part of the charm of the other editions I read and have owned. I currently have a lovely complete works of Lewis Carroll leather bound which includes Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass, with the original drawings which I've had in every edition I've ever had including other paperback versions, but sadly not this one, if I'd realized that this one was missing such an essential ingredient as the drawings, I wouldn't have bought this particular edition. I bought it with the assumption that it had the usual charming Victorian drawings that every other edition hardback or paperback has it, but as my other copies of Alice have disappeared, and the leather bound edition is too frail to sit down and read, I'll make do with this one, but I'm not happy with it.I think may well send it back, and get another with the drawings."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I thought Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was what the Disney movie was based on, and Through the Looking Glass was another adventure she had. But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again.

I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader.

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained.

Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing.

I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read and in my opinion, the Disney movie does not do justice to it.

I could read it many more times because the author paints a vivid picture in your mind that places you in Wonderland along with all of the delightful characters including Alice. The description in the book starts out strong and ends up even stronger. The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him.

This set of priorities has to be balanced, and a lot of ink has been spent on this &quot;theology of the laity.&quot; Wolfteich offers a fascinating new approach to the issues, by examining how some Catholic public figures have balanced the private and public selves--notably, John F. Kennedy, Mario Cuomo and Cesar Chavez. Wolfteich concludes that the easy division between a private religious self and a pluralistic public self, made famous by Kennedy, is not theologically satisfactory. Chavez is a better example of someone who successfully blended social commitments and religious faith. Wolfteich also offers a lot of food for thought on more narrowly theological questions about the place of the laity in the Catholic church today. Her book shows once again the value of &quot;hybrid&quot; scholarship, as opposed to the narrowly enclosed vision that often afflicts both Catholic and Protestant theology. Theology, ethics, and social and political thought are beautifully blended here."},{"Title":"The Potemkin mutiny","review":"There are only a few books available about the famous \\"Potemkin Mutiny\\" of 1905 and this one is excellent for anyone looking for the core of those events. Despite its small number of pages, it contains many details about the Potemkin, the Odessa visit and revolt and the final pursuit to Romania and Feodosia. Especially interesting are the descriptions of the personalities involed and how the changes of fortune (and a treasonous act from a medical officer) condemned the mutiny to failure. The book loses the fifth star only because it doesn't contain any map or photograph."},{"Title":"The Greatest Guitar Songbook","review":"I bought this book as a teaching tool for some of my beginning students, since I have one that wants to go rock, one classical, and one jazz. The arrangement for Fur Elise was a nice piece for a quick-learning beginner to study accidentals, and the arrangements for \\"All the Things You Are\\" and \\"Misty\\" have been helpful in beginning some jazz studies. Otherwise, I agree that a lot of the arrangements are off, and while there is a large variety of songs, I find that there are a lot of them that I would not have chosen for a book that presumes to call itself \\"The Greatest\\".

Given the current situation in the Middle East, The Crusades should really be required reading for anyone who wants to understand Arabs and Muslims and their relationship with the West."},{"Title":"The Crusades (The whole story of the Crusades. Originally published in 2 vol. as Iron Men & Saints and The Flame of Islam)","review":"This book is dense with events but except in the concluding chapter sparse on analysis and concrete detail. It is virtually impossible for the casual reader to keep the history, events, people and locations in mind, excepts for the sense (which is valuable enough in its own right) of ebb and flow, back and forth, hostility and exchange, that transpired over centuries of contact between the eastern (Muslim) and western (Latin Christianity) cultures.I also listened to this on audio but disagree with the other reviewer's assessment of the reader. This Brit should be chewing the scenery in a third rate production of Hamlet somewhere. Not only does the material-- which is not exciting-- call for a more matter of fact tone, but as a rule the reader's exuberant rhythms and placement of stress do not conform to the meaning of the text.

Newhall takes a much broader look at the Crusades, tracing their origins to early conflict with the Muslims in Europe and ending with the reconquista in Spain. He postulates that the beginning of the European slave trade in Africa was an indirect result of the Crusades, and happened when the Portuguese and others sought to sail around Africa and flank Muslims who were invading Europe.I listened to the audiobook version.

Many of the portraits have appeared in exhibitions and magazines during the course of the project; now that the work is finished, TASCHEN brings it all to you in one volume.

Everyone I know is reading this book! It's especially good for people who are just undergoing recovery, those who will recognize and nod with wonder at the pain Lane describes at just waking up and experiencing the little things, the color of your bedroom walls, the feel of the cotton pillowcase under your cheek, as if for the first time, without the sheltering batting of cocaine or alcohol. He thinks of the American poet Weldon Kees who, fueled by despair and drink jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in the early 1950s, and of Kees' famous zen riddle, \\"Whatever it is that a wound remembers/ After the healing ends.\\"Lane finds the courage to remember the years before he fell into heavy drinking, and what a dreary lot of memories he dredges up! Okay, there were some happy moments too--a sensuous description of lovemaking at age 16 with the girl who would become his first wife--but mostly he grew up in Canada, a misbegotten part of the world with more casual brutality, sexual violence, and abuse against childred than you will find in Ghana or Sierra Leone. For pocket money he sold himself to pedophiles, for a quarter here or a dollar there, allowing them to buy him forbidden ice cream sundaes in depressing town dessert joints. At another time he watches from between parked cars as three white men brutally rape and torture a native Indian woman. For Lane, youth is an unusual place, marked by the absence of his dad during World War II and by the remarkably hard-earned wisdom of a lovely mother, with a caustic wit which, who knows, might have contributed to Lane's own dexterity with words.I don't like his poetry very much, and it's a shame that he feels he has to quote from it in this book, but as a memoirist he really shines. After getting out of the treatment clinic, he goes to work on his garden, like Candide, but even there memories of different things that happened to him sometimes leap up and assault his senses so that he'd do anything to have just one drink! And sometimes he finds bottles of vodka hidden around the house, and garden too. Malcolm Lowry probably said just as well and earlier to boot everything that Patrick Lane has to say about the sadnesses of Western Canada, the glittering allure of drink, and the repentance of women's arms, but Lowry (author of UNDER THE VOLCANO and one of Lane's literary heroes) has been gone a longtime, the victim of his own alcoholism, and Lane lives on, triumphantly speaking of a new marriage to another of Canada's notable literary figures, a woman who he calls \\"Lorna\\" here. Maybe her real name is Lorna too, but in any case you get the idea he's trying to protect the innocent and to lacerate only himself and his people.I predict a long future for this book if only more people knew about it besides people in recovery."},{"Title":"What the Stones Remember: A Life Rediscovered","review":"This memoir by one of Canada's best-known poets follows Patrick Lane's first year of recovery from a lifetime of alcoholism, a recovery that unfolds almost entirely in his Vancouver Island garden. The narrative weaves between his present-tense garden and the struggle and brutality that was Lane's past. His poetic voice permeates his storytelling, compelling us to see how the honesty and enchantment of the natural world can save us from our nightmares, our addictions, our terrible losses - if only we will let it.Originally published a year and a half ago in Canada as There Is a Season: A Memoir in a Garden, the book won the 2005 BC Award for Canadian nonfiction. It is not at all disingenuous for Lane to re-release his memoir under a new title - What the Stones Remember - as there really are two stories folded into the one book. This new title summons the story of Lane's turbulent past as a wayward child, an absentee father, a fledgling poet, a failed husband, a triumphant writer, and ultimately a recovering addict. We follow him deep into his personal history and come to understand, along with him, that it is a miracle he is still alive. This story is rich with personal intrigue, gossip, sentimentality and curiosity. I think it's rare that we look even into our own lives so intimately.The second story is the simple unfolding of the seasons in his suburban garden, and it mirrors Lane's journey of recovery and self-redemption. His garden is his sanctuary and the midwife of his rebirth as a sane and sober person. He delves into the ecology of his garden with the same studied depth as he digs through his personal history. The carefully documented hours of observation are underscored by a book knowledge of plant and animal classification, behaviour and habitat.This being said, Lane is first and foremost a poet, and his garden ramblings are never dry or dense. How can they be when he periodically unearths old vodka bottles in the woodpile or under a bush? Or when he stops to watch a hermit thrush dance and mourn beside its dead mate? Or sees his mother, long decades dead, kneeling in the corner under the plum tree?What the Stones Remember contains equal parts beauty and horror. Patrick Lane describes a past that many people would be inclined to leave buried in the furrows of time. But in bringing forth the dead, the wounded, the lost, this poet carves a path of healing and new life."},{"Title":"What the Stones Remember: A Life Rediscovered","review":"As a 60 year old male recovering from my own life of addiction, I was somewhat resentful when I first read the reviews for this wonderful book -\\"how dare someone write my life's story!\\" was my first thought. Having read the book, however, I am glad that Patrick Lane took the time to write such a moving and poignant story. His skills as a poet echo throughout every chapter of the book. The peace he finds in his garden stands in total contrast to the chaos he put himself through for forty five years. As a member of a 12 Step fellowship who followed almost the exact same path (minus the gardening skills), I have told all the other men in my program that this book will help them find a piece of themselves - and ultimately peace for themselves. Lane's book will be a cornerstone for the foundation I am building in my own recovery."},{"Title":"What the Stones Remember: A Life Rediscovered","review":"\\"I circle my father's death for a means to get close. I remember my Uncle Jack pushing my head into my father's coffin. The taste of lipstick and powder will stay on my lips forever. Kiss him, he cried, Kiss your father goodbye.\\" So Patrick Lane in What the Stones Remember. There is a cruel courage in how Lane dwells on the memory of his murdered father and voices pain and grief. In the breathtaking, breath giving tradition of Derek Jarman's Modern Nature, What the Stones Remember turns to nature and gardens for healing from the hurtful, painful wonder of life. With this savage, soothing book, Lane, fulfilling a promise he made in an early father poem, \\"Fathers and Sons,\\" reaches \\"down into the heavy earth\\" and sings his father \\"back into the day,\\" and himself free of the poisons of drugs and alcohol. What the Stones Remember is a lyrical masterpiece to be treasured by all recovering alcoholics, avid gardeners, and passionate lovers of Annie Dillard and Thoreau.Andre Gerard.Editor of Fathers: A Literary Anthology"},{"Title":"What the Stones Remember: A Life Rediscovered","review":"This is one of most beautifully written memoirs I have ever read (and I read a lot). Lane's poetic language, his mastery of scene, the dance between concrete detail and lyrical lushness all work together to create a moving journey for the reader. If you appreciate language and the healing lessons of nature and can respect the courage it takes to back at your life with honesty and acceptance,you will love this transcendent,important book."},{"Title":"What the Stones Remember: A Life Rediscovered","review":"This is a book that is too good to not write about. It's too good to be left unread. It's the story of one of Canada's best poets and his journey to clarity after giving up his addictions to alcohol and cocaine. This is a painterly book filled with vignettes of people and landscapes across the artist's lifetime. As most addictions are an attempt to soothe the pain of trauma, this book goes back in time and shows us the origin of Mr. Lane's demons: his 'salt of the earth' and flawed parents, a difficult and poor childhood, and the coming of age in hard times. As Mr.Lane works in his garden, he keenly observes the plants and the animals he finds there. He takes the reader back through time and space to his life in Western Canada, women and drinking and friendships and beautiful landscapes. We meet the people and the events that shaped his life and also caused him to want to be numb. There is no self cherishing. Mr. Lane's eye is unflinching and clear. That Mr. Lane was a such a gifted writer despite his drinking, we can only look forward to even better work now that he has bravely faced his demons and decided to move forward. I applaud this book and this author and I wish him a long life in his garden as he continues to heal. -Brian David Mansfield"},{"Title":"What the Stones Remember: A Life Rediscovered","review":"DEPRESSING BUT HOPEFUL BOOK ABOUT RECOVERY FROM DRUG AND ALCOLHOL ADDICTION AND RETURN TO NORMAL, SOBER LIFE."},{"Title":"Novel & Short Story Writer's Market: 2,000+ Places to Get Your Fiction Into Print","review":"As the editor of this book, I think I have to make a slight correction to the comments of littleredheadsmom.

You won't find every agent listed here, nor will you find every literary magazine and book publisher.

As always, you'll find a run-down on manuscript mechanics and how to submit your work.In recent editions, the editors have realized that novelists can't rely solely on listings since many publishers only consider manuscripts from agents, so they have a solid section with information on agents.

These assesments create the impression that southerners were backward people who should have known that the society they created was not maintainable. Joyce Chaplin argues that during the period from 1730 to 1815, the region was in actuality a dynamic and innovative place that fell victim only to its own success. To do so, she has compiled an enormous amount of evidence, based on sources ranging from specialized secondary literature on economics, philosophy, and culture, as well as primary documents such as period newspapers, public records, and private correspondence.Chaplin begins her study with a treatment of the predominant economic and political theories of the late 17th century, arguing that southerners accepted the theories of the Scottish school that a commercial society was most conducive to individual wealth creation, and thereby a stronger and more harmonious society. To find products that would create the most wealth, southerners experimented and innovated with various crops and productive means, reflecting the Enlightenment values of scientific pursuit and rationality. In the process, they created a culture that celebrated the right of the individual to pursue prosperity, but that relied upon government aid and regulation, as well as black slavery. Both of the latter aspects were seen as potentially disruptive to their fragile new society, but also unavoidable if individual (and thereby societal) betterment was to be achieved. Even as southerners came to fear the potential of government and slaves (who Chaplin shows to be far from powerless) to challenge their authority, they found that they could not do away with them without undermining the culture of white achievement they had fostered.Chaplin shows that southereners were not hostile to manufacturing, engaging in it on a small scale particularly during times of market disruption, such as during the Revolution and the War of 1812. Cotton and rice production returned as the dominant economic activities of the South because they were by far the least risky and most profitable, not because of any intellectual opposition to non-agricultural forms of capitalization. Chaplin believes that if only the region had continued its economic diversification, the South would not have been so heavily tied to slavery, and would not have experienced its eventual economic and social stagnation."},{"Title":"An Anxious Pursuit: Agricultural Innovation and Modernity in the Lower South, 1730-1815","review":"As the title implies, Joyce E. Chaplin has a dual purpose. She describes slave agriculture in the colonial to the pre-antebellum period and studies the Lower South's notions of Western modernity and innovation. While southern whites were aware of and tried to apply modern ideas and innovations, they could not, in the end, disassociate themselves from being slaveholders. In a nutshell the Lower South was characterized by continuity as well as, in Chaplin's words, change and persistence. It was anything but static.In her analysis, Chaplin found that whites frequently used Scottish enlightened thought as an historical framework for assessing their own chances of achieving socio-economic improvement. The Scottish school, Chaplin proposes, is a way to show how whites' were informed of modern contemporary theory from newspapers, books, and local authors. The Reverend Alexander Hewitt wrote a 1770s account of the rise and progress of the Lower South and David Ramsey, a physician and early North American historian, modeled the Scottish statistical efforts of Sir john Sinclair.Landholders were keeping up with the times and not at all languishing in the backwaters enjoying mint juleps on verandahs. Still, while they adjusted to national and world events and adapted their crops, capital and labor, they did not, in the end, relinquish their reliance on slavery. Chaplin's tries to understand this aspect of slavery in order to discover why racism is so persistent.Chaplin offers a cautionary comment in the preface. She says she doesn't want to come across as cynical toward humanity's ability to overcome racism. She succeeds in adhering to her scholarly purpose until, interestingly, at the end of her book she expresses some skepticism. While whites in the Lower South adopted notions of modernity, they adhered to slavery in order to achieve their own ends. In doing so they rejected an opportunity to use their wealth, resources and leadership for reform. Instead they chose to avoid the instability that would be necessary to move beyond slavery."},{"Title":"An Anxious Pursuit: Agricultural Innovation and Modernity in the Lower South, 1730-1815","review":"As someone who professionally studies the history of the rice industry in the South Carolina Lowcountry, this book filled out the bigger environmental picture beautifully."},{"Title":"You Are Somebody","review":"Every chapter is a unique lesson in personal and spiritual growth.

Trotsky wrote this book at the request of Lenin who edited it. They saw fighting against those who wanted to impose a so-called \\"proletarian\\" culture as the official culture of the Soviet Union, as a threat to a real Marxist understanding of culture. Judging culture by its explicit politics, rather than by its expression of human life, Trotsky explains, is as far from Marxism as you can get. Trotsky explains that even some of the most reactionary minded writers have create some of the most stirringly real and vibrant literature, how to road to real socialism will come by giving working people full and free access to the best and the worst of the literature and art that capitalism has produced. No one who reads this book will think that the garbage that passed for cultural theory in the Soviet Union under Stalin and his successors or under Mao and his successors has anything to do with socialism or Marxism"},{"Title":"Literature and Revolution","review":"Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality, in a sense, it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. What Marxism aims for, and Trotsky defends here, is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development should flourish. That is the thought that underpins Trotsky's work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. In short, Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness.You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. Quite the contrary. Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected (or not affected) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends. Mainly, at the time of writing, the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends. He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature, like futurism constructivism, and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive.The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here, however, was the fight against the proponents of \`proletarian culture'. The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should, in the interest of cultural development, be given special status and encouragement (read: a monopoly on the literary front). Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that, in theory at least as its turned out, the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting \`proletarian culture' would have time to develop. Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development.One of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals, particularly Western intellectuals, based some of their sympathy for Trotsky, the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write. This was particularly true during the 1930's here in America where those who were anti-Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him. A few, like James T. Farrell (Studs Lonigan trilogy), did this mostly honorably. Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. Such is the nature of the political struggle.A note for the politically- inclined who read this book. Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin's death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the close of the rising tide of the revolution. Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. Given his political position why the hell was Trotsky writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time?"},{"Title":"Literature and Revolution","review":"This book written decades ago is still alive ,fresh, and vibrant. One can't be a serious critic without reading it. It's funny how that 'old time Marxism/ Trotskyism' is still terribly RELEVANT."},{"Title":"Literature and Revolution","review":"Trotsky's approach on the subject of literature, culture and art, is a typical Marxist one with the usual class analysis and the base - superstructure relationship that dominates most Marxist texts. However, \\"Literature & Revolution\\" is a rare historical application of Marxism on culture, with the advantage of being written by such a talented writer as Trotsky.The analysis of Trotsky focuses around the Russian Revolution of 1917, as he compares pre-revolutionary literature, post-revolutionary literature, and the possibilities of the future art, culture and literature of society, discussing the possibility (or not) of a \\"proletariat culture\\" emerging in the Soviet Union. Of course, \\"Literature & Revolution\\" concerns itself with other subjects, such as criticism of literature trends during the early 20th century, and a Marxist interpretation of the history of culture. The central point, however, that Trotsky is coming back to, is the Russian Revolution of the Bolsheviks, and its implications for the future, as well as its undeniable relevance to the Marxist theory of history.For Trotsky, the Russian Revolution of 1917 was a proletariat revolution, establishing the proletariat class as the ruling class of society by enforcing the dictatorship of the proletariat and driving society towards Socialism. It was undoubtedly in his eyes the new stage of history and human development that had been advocated by Marx in the previous century.And here lies the problem with Trotsky's analysis. The Bolshevik Revolution established neither \\"the dictatorship of the proletariat\\" nor the new historical stage of Socialism. Rather, it established the rule of a new bureaucracy, based on the centralized state and party apparatus, the use of political terror, and the absence of any political freedoms to the people of Russia. The Revolution itself was a direct contradiction to the Marxist theory of history, which advocated that a Revolution would break out in developed capitalist countries with a proletariat majority population such as Germany and Britain. In contrast, Russia was neither a developed capitalist country (rather, an agricultural one), nor did it had a large proletariat population (in fact 85% of Russia's population belonged to the peasantry and only 2-3% of the total population was part of the proletariat working class). By the 1920s, the Soviet Union had already become a dictatorship of a new ruling class, the political elite of the Communist party, with the Communists, whose members were only a tiny fraction of the proletariat class (which in itself was only 3% of the total population) monopolizing every instrument of political power and enjoying a luxurious lifestyle in the residences of the old regime's upper classes.Therefore, the disillusionment of Trotsky with the situation in the Soviet Union, in my opinion, renders his critique and analysis useless and bankrupt in itself. Such an absence from reality can be justified for people such as John Creed or prince Kropotkin, but not from a man that played a central role in the events of the Bolshevik Revolution and the Russian civil war.One would argue that I am becoming technical and loosing the point. However, Trotsky bases his analysis on the Marxist theory of the development of history, which he was convinced that its predictions were been unfolded in-front of him. When the theory of the development of history is in direct contradiction with reality, a Marxist analysis which is based on it simply falls apart - and such is the case with \\"Literature & Revolution\\". And while other Marxist works, such as those of Marx and Lenin, had a tremendous impact in world history, Trotsky's works, with perhaps \\"The Revolution Betrayed\\" being the exception, are historically of no significant importance. Their influence is limited to ideological discussions of the far-left.This book apparently belongs to where its thinker's ideas are, in the dustbin of history.I am giving this book 2 stars only because of the outstanding edition of this book. The effort put by the publisher in the book is impressive. The absence of any significant historical impact of the book and the historical inaccuracies that directly affect the author's argument do not justify the book for a higher rating."},{"Title":"Ode to the West Wind and Other Poems","review":"This inexpensive Dover edition, Selected Poems - Percy Bysshe Shelley, offers a good introduction to Shelley's wide ranging poetry. These thirty-seven poems, arranged chronologically from 1814-1822, span about 125 pages. The large font makes for easy reading. No footnotes are provided.I have read this Dover edition several times in the last several years as well as two other short selections of Shelley's poetry. Despite my growing familiarity with his poems, I still find Shelley to be decidedly more challenging than Keats, Wordsworth, Coleridge, or Byron.This increased difficulty is especially evident in Shelley's longer poems. Like me, many readers are likely to become initially disoriented and confused by Shelley's layered and embedded metaphors. Fortunately, with a bit of persistence, careful attention, and multiple readings, most readers will become proficient in unraveling, and appreciating, Shelley's intricate patterns of connected imagery.This Dover edition includes six of these longer, more challenging poems (even the titles are lengthy): Lines Written among the Euganean Hills (1818), Julian and Maddalo: A Conversation (1818), The Mask of Anarchy - Written on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester (1819), Letter to Maria Gisborne (1820), Epipsychidion (1821) - Verses Addressed to the Noble and Unfortunate Lady, Emilia Viviani Imprisoned in the Convent of -----, and Adonais - An Elegy on the Death of John Keats, Author of Endymion, Hyperion, etc.The remaining thirty-one poems range from a dozen lines to a couple pages. I suggest that the reader new to Shelley focus on shorter poems, reserving the longer excursions for later. The four poems Ozymandias, The Cloud, Ode to the West Wind, and To Night make a good starting point."},{"Title":"Ode to the West Wind and Other Poems","review":"This is a wonderful collection of Shelley's greatest poems.

Pianist Lauren Brownly hears her own death ordered when mob boss Carlo realizes she hasn't left the nightclub. She reports the killing to the Denver PD believes she's Carlo's mistress. Now the FBI steps into the case, planning to keep Lauren safe until she can testify. Agent Sam Grey Wolf Rowlins is assigned to the case.Sam sets aside his previous investigation into an insider turned rogue to assume care of Lauren. The Bureau has been investigating Carlo for years, but every time they got close, something went wrong from tapered evidence to dead witnesses. Extreme coincidence suggests the truth to lie with a corrupt agent. When a plane crash-lands Sam and Lauren miles from civilization and obviously pursued by FBI agents gone bad, they must hike through knee-deep snow and blizzard conditions to reach safety. As they learn to rely upon and trust one another, the ember of attraction lead to a fiery passion even the deepest snows can't drown.Sam's antagonism and aloofness toward Lauren, unfairly earned, can initially alienate the reader, but the feelings his ill humor conceal will sway even the hardest of hearts in THE WITNESS. This richly textured plot keeps the pages turning quickly, as Lauren and Sam's traitorous emotions and survival skills keep them alive. The vividly realized characterizations, including fascinating secondary characterizations, give THE WITNESS a fascinating depth. Further, Lauren's path to learning independence as she redefines her immediate past and her immediate future leads to terrific character growth. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Witness","review":"Lauren Brownley enjoys playing the piano at Denver's Club Classico. However, her gig abruptly ends when she sees her employer Carlo Giovessi kill Frank Pappano, a drug runner who stole some of the illegal gains from him.

Agent Sam Grey Wolf Rawlins vows to keep the frightened rabbit safe until the Carlo's trial, but knows he must get her out of town to do so because someone on the Feds' rolls works for Carlo. Soon the duo is isolated in a mountain blizzard with thugs on their trail and their only hope is the growing love and trust between them.THE WITNESS is a powerful romantic suspense novel that works because readers will feel the fear and mistrust between the lead characters that gradually changes into love and faith. Though the plane escape from the mole seems too uncertain of a venture, the nasty crash, nastier weather, and the nastiest hoodlums enhance the story line. The audience will witness a strong tale with a fine cast that testifies that the only gray area in this author's writing is her name.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Witness","review":"I've always enjoyed her work, but this one I simply could not put down!

You'd think that hanging around highly educated people (you know, the ones who attend piano concertos) would have rubbed off on her. She's also completely unaware that her mentor Carlo is a crime boss, which is a plot point so ludicrous that it defies explanation.

This is a new edition of earlier ones, starting with a French one, then a first translation, and now this expanded version. There is lots of new material, covering new developments, both with regards to theory and applications. The authors communicate the main points in a clear and attractive way, and it stresses lucid presentation of ideas over formulas. And with an infectious enthusiasm! The presentation is especially refreshing, in that the authors do not hide behind excessive technicalities and mathematical jargon. It is the central idea that shines through. And yet the mathematically sophisticated reader is paid his dues,-- in some cases via the appendices. At that point, the technical mathematical points have been well motivated. The emphasis of the book is the mathematics behind the many algorithms that emerged from the wavelet trends since the 1980ties. And lots of new stuff added (for example JPEG-2000), right up to the present. The book is rich in applications, many of which are not found elsewhere. The inclusion of motivation and historical remarks is welcome, and makes the book enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Wavelets: Algorithms & Applications","review":"Although this book emphasis is on algorithms and applications, the general presentation of wavelets for signal processing is great.

After one reads a wonderful book like Boys of Summer and hears stories about the Bums, you can't help but believe it. However, the Last Good Season brings some balance to the stories and memories. He honors the men who played a boys game in a decaying old stadium. He does not villify O'Malley, but does Robert Moses who was not a great force for good. The book is not a pure baseball book, but as a self-styled historian (using the term very loosely), I enjoyed the views of the Brooklyn and the large social change. Shapiro does not make the Dodgers more than they are. If anything, he is understated in his discussions of the power of baseball. It works beautifully. The book is engrossing and by the end, you can't help but the love Dodgers more. Once you have read this (and you must read Boys of Summer first) go read The Sandy Koufax book, A Lefty's Legacy which really is a nice a bookend to the Dodgers glory years of the 1950s and 1960s (to say nothing of the '70s and '80s)."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"The conventional story of the Brooklyn Dodgers' demise is largely familiar to most baseball fans by now. The Borough of Brooklyn saw the working-class white families who had supported the Dodgers flee en masse in the decade after World War Two, replaced by blacks, Puerto Ricans and others of different customs and values. Meanwhile, greedy Dodger owner Walter O'Malley, after making a pretense of wanting to stay in Brooklyn, quickly packed his bags for the more lucrative territory of Los Angeles. If this is the storyline you cling to, be prepared to re-think it. In &quot;The Last Good Season,&quot; Michael Shapiro provides a thoroughly-researched, gracefully-written account of the Dodgers' final pennant race and the transformation of Brooklyn.&quot;I see the boys of summer in their ruin,&quot; Dylan Thomas had written in a poem that would forever become linked to the Dodgers. Roger Kahn's masterpiece was still in the future in 1956, but the great Dodger team that had dominated the National League for a decade was clearly approaching the end of the line. Age and injuries were taking their toll on men like Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Carl Erskine and Pee Wee Reese. Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax were on hand, but were still untested youngsters, not the dominant pitchers they would become on the west coast.Shapiro interweaves an account of the 1956 season with the story of Brooklyn's transformation in the postwar years. Yes, many whites were fleeing to the suburbs, but Ebbets Field was still filled with fans. In fact, he suggests, it was a wonderful, if brief period when black, brown and white fans came together for a common purpose.What seems abundantly clear from the archives Shapiro has mined is that far from looking for a quick exit, O'Malley was seeking every opportunity to stay (although on his terms.) All he wanted--reasonably enough, in his view--was the city's help in securing the site for a new stadium. Here, though, he came up against the most powerful man in New York--Robert Moses. It was a battle he was destined to lose. Interestingly enough, while Shapiro refuses to condemn O'Malley as a carpetbagger, he does conclude he never should have owned a baseball team. Why? He simply didn't understand the game, or its true meaning to its fans. O'Malley was the kind of owner who could maximize the bottom line, and knew how to successfully market his product--but that's all it ever was to him. A product. As Shapiro's book makes clear, for millions of fans, the Brooklyn Dodgers represented so much more.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"This is not your typical sports book. It is more in that it effectively juxtaposes the athletic and social issues facing the players, owners and fans during a specific moment in time.

But I learned much more than I expected from this book about the politics that led to the team's move to California. It's too bad the franchise couldn't have remained in Brooklyn, but the reasons they left were different than I would have imagined. The book also paints the picture of a post-World War II New York that was rapidly changing. As a lover of baseball, history and baseball history, I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Michael Shapiro manages to find a new, informative, and well-argued story in the timeless tail of 1950s baseball in New York. His argument shows the changes in NYC during the time period, with the growth of the suburbs leading Robert Moses to believe that the future of pro sports and high society in general are outside the cities. But this only leads to Brooklyn having one of its few identities ripped away, while the likes of Shea Stadium (Moses' master plan) portends one of the more dismal eras in stadium building and location.On the other hand, Shapiro discusses how even after the Dodgers became in interested in moving, their dream deal at Chavez Ravine could easily have collapsed.Meantime, there is a game on the field and Shapiro details how the Dodgers, despite the age/physical breakdown of most of their stars, and all sorts of other problems, fight for one more National League pennant, leading to the last and probably best of the Subway Series'.Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"And here you thought Walter O'Malley was just a greedy bum (small \\"b\\")out to get rich, and that's why he moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn to LA. The real bum, though, was Robert Moses, who since the 1950s had been eyeing Flusing Meadows as the place to put a ballpark, which he kept pretty much a secret until the Dodgers had left town. (Think Shea Stadium.) O'Malley really wanted to stay in Brooklyn, but he needed a new ballpark to replace the decrepit Ebbets Field; Moses, who controlled all development in NYC, refused to accomodate him. Thus, when LA came calling with all kinds of incentives, O'Malley felt he no longer had a choice. Shapiro is a good journalist and writer, and delves into the inner dealings of all concerned thoroughly and with gusto. Like THE BOYS OF SUMMER, he also writes about the players, but not nearly as distinctively as Kahn did. He also spends too much time on the changing face of urban New York versus the booming suburbs of the 1950s, an important element to the story of what was happening to Brooklyn, but Shapiro hammers away at it too hard and long. Although slow in spots, the book tells a major story well: the writing is better than you will find in most sports-oriented books.Note: O'Malley had an architect from Princeton design a domed stadium that he just might have built in Brooklyn if given the chance.

A SUPERIOR JOB OF WRITING AND VERY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Michael Shapiro, a journalism professor at Columbia, grew up hating Walter O'Malley for moving the beloved Dodgers from the borough of Brooklyn to the sprawling wasteland of Los Angeles. Shaprio was only 4 at the time the Dodgers and Giants abandoned their fans for the West Coast and nutured a long and virilent hatred of O'Malley for most of his life. &quot;The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together&quot; not only tells of the story of the only season the Brooklyn Dodgers ever played as defending World Champions, but reexamines the economics and urban planning issues that compelled O'Malley to make the big move.The pennant race was a pretty good one, with the Dodgers clinching the the title on the final day of the season after battling off the upstart Cincinnati Reds of Frank Robinson and Wally Post, and the Milwaukee Braves of Henry Aaron, Ed Matthews, and Walter Spahn. The Dodgers indeed became the World Champions, finally defeating their cross-town rivals the New York Yankees when young southpaw Johnny Podres pitched a shutout in the deciding 7th game, but they were also getting old. Jackie Robinson would be playing his final season. The Dodgers would make it back to the World Series but lose again to the Yankees and fall victim to Don Larsen's perfect game.But while the baseball season had plenty of on field drama, behind the scenes O'Malley wanted to build a new domed stadium designed by visionary architect R. Buckminster Fuller of Princeton at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues in Brooklyn. Ebbets field had lots of character, but it was old and it was small. Consequently, O'Malley told Mayor Robert F. Wagner and New York City's powerful urban planner Robert Moses that unless the city helped him build a new stadium for the Dodgers, the team was going to have to move. If you saw the Ken Burns documentary on &quot;Baseball&quot; you may well recall that Ebbets Field was built on a part of Brooklyn known as &quot;Pig Town.&quot; O'Malley wanted to build his new stadium on the site of a meat market and needed the city to condemn the property so he could afford to buy it. However, Moses was planning yet another housing project for the same piece of land.Of course, we know that no domed stadium grew in Brooklyn, but it still hard to shift the presumption of guilt from O'Malley to Moses. Shapiro points out that ever since he forced out Branch Rickey from the Dodger ownership in 1950 O'Malley had pushed for a new stadium. But O'Malley looked and talked the part of the villain in this story. The simple explanation, offered by Dodgers vice president Buzzie Bavasi, was that O'Malley &quot;loved money too damn much.&quot; However, Shapiro provides ample evidence in &quot;The Last Good Season&quot; that O'Malley loved other things, such as his wife Kay, and that while he cannot be forgiven for the great sin of abandonment, there are mitigating circumstances that should be taken into account. More importantly, Shapiro is able to point to correspondence between O'Malley and Moses that showed O'Malley wanted to stay in Brooklyn but that Moses had already made up his mind.But just as it is impossible to talk about the Brooklyn Dodgers team of 1956 without going back in history, the story of O'Malley and Moses goes back earlier as well. The most horrible revelation in the book for Brooklyn fans is that in 1953 Moses was apparently willing to let O'Malley build a new ballpark near the Pratt Institute. Moses then offered instead an unattractive site in Bedford-Stuyvesant and as the two exchanged letters it becomes painfully clear that the Brooklyn Dodgers, the heart of the borough, would not be allowed to build anywhere near its geographical center.In the end, while the Dodgers played out their final season on the field, it is Moses whose dream of a modern stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens, would end up with the creation of the New York Mets. But O'Malley became rich moving the Dodgers to Los Angeles and that ends up being the biggest sign of guilt in the public consciousness. Ironically, Shapiro makes a case for, if not forgiving O'Malley, then at least understanding that his greatest sin was that he could not see baseball as ever being more than a business. As such, O'Malley was certainly the most blatant owner to be hungry for money, but he was certainly not the only one in baseball.As a Yankee fan I bear no love for the Dodgers, whatever coast they were playing on, but I certainly extend them the same sort of respect that Achilles had for Hector, Grant had for Lee, and Johnson and Bird had for each other. I picked up this book wanting to read about Duke Snider, Gil Hodges, Roy Campanella and the other great ballplayers we see on the cover, safe in the knowledge that the Yankees would win the World Series. But instead what was captivating was the doomed dance between O'Malley and Moses as the days of the Dodgers in Brooklyn were numbered. As both a fan and a journalist, Shaprio's book provides both passion and objectivity. Those who love baseball should make a point of reading about these boys this summer."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"THE LAST GOOD SEASON, by Michael Shapiro, earns itself a provisional rating of FIVE STARS in my mind, based primarily on the quality of the writing (which is uniformly excellent) and the depth of the research (which, within limits, is exhaustive). Yet the book deserves, like Roger Maris' \\"61*\\", to be only a qualified ***(**) success.Much of that qualification comes from Shapiro's heavily touted and slanted thesis that Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley was not responsible for the Dodgers' departure from Brooklyn in 1957, after Robert Moses refused to build a replacement for the aging Ebbets Field.Shapiro's grasp of the facts regarding Brooklyn is somewhat fuzzy. He says, \\"Jews went to Midwood [High School], poor blacks to Jefferson.\\" Yet in the Dodger era, Brownsville was predominantly (70%) Jewish. It was not until later that Brownsville became a black neighborhood. Shapiro waxes rhapsodic about Midwood (his childhood home?) but slights the rest of Brooklyn. He admits that by the time he became aware of the Dodgers they were gone. Ironically enough, even while granting O'Malley absolution in absentia he makes and supports every argument as to why the man did not deserve it.Shapiro blames, among other things, \\"white flight\\" for the Dodgers' relocation, but then argues that fans come in all colors. It's as if, in pardoning O'Malley, he is trying to convince us of something he really doesn't believe himself.According to Shapiro, \\"Robert Moses is the bad guy in this story.\\" This is an incredibly strong statement, particularly since Shapiro admits in many places that O'Malley was mendacious, that he was arrogant, that his plans for a new Buckminster Fuller-styled stadium seemed, at best, to be for public consumption only (O'Malley stole the scale model from the actual designer, Billy Kleinsasser, and used it without permission or recompense at public events), that he dealt with player and staff salaries in increments of hundreds and thousands of dollars not hundreds OF thousands of dollars (i.e., star pitcher Preacher Roe claims his highest Dodger salary was a paltry $28,000.00 in 1955), that he did not understand the \\"Little People\\" who were Dodger fans, that he once (as a youngster) traded a stack of Dodger baseball cards for one Giants' Christy Mathewson, that he fined employees who mentioned Branch Rickey's name in his presence, and, in short, that he was not really a fan of the team he owned.Shapiro wants to paint horns on Robert Moses' head, and in some sense they do belong there, but not necessarily in the sense that Shapiro would prefer. Like the Master Builders of Ancient Egypt he had virtually unlimited power in his sphere. The ironically-named Moses was a man with a vision for New York, and he set about creating that vision of shining, rising buildings (such as Lincoln Center), vast bridges (the Throgs Neck, the Whitestone, The Triborough, and the frighteningly huge Verrazano are all his), and endless parkways (as a sampling, the Cross Island, the Belt, the Northern State, the Southern State, the Meadowbrook and the Wantagh) linking New York City and its expanding suburbs in a net of urban development. Yet this visionary had pathological flaws. Monomaniacal in his sphere, he had no compunction about unilaterally razing hundreds of city blocks, evicting tens of thousands, and altering the neighborhoods and neighborhood patterns of New York without a thought. Such changes brought other, unanticipated changes---the \\"through\\" expressways of The Bronx relegated it to a kind of backwater status accelerating its descent into slum conditions, and Moses' chopping up of neighborhoods in Brooklyn balkanized the Borough into a patchwork of disconnected rich and poor enclaves. Moses was more successful on sparsely-settled Long Island and in Westchester, where his road network created rather than changed demographic patterns.When these two prima donnas met head-to-head, they treated each other with barely-concealed contempt. Although Moses was at first favorably disposed to a new stadium in downtown Brooklyn, this agreement soured within days. Without access to O'Malley's papers (which he was refused by the O'Malley family), the reason for this sudden souring is unknown, and ripe for speculation. Moses pressed, at first, for a new stadium in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a declining neighborhood; O'Malley refused. Moses promised him a new stadium in Flushing Meadow, Queens (the future Shea); again, O'Malley refused, declaring that the team was to remain in Brooklyn---he countered with an offer to build in Brooklyn, on the site of a ramshackle meat market. Moses refused to condemn the property (a first for him).This bickering was never about questions of civic-mindedness, fan appreciation, nor humanitarianism. This was strictly a personal issue between the two men that affected millions of people.While this was going on, the 1956 Dodgers struggled successfully through their World Champion season. Shapiro's snapshot of the team is far more detailed than his portrait of the politics, and is a joy to read. Shapiro is at his best as he describes the dynamic tensions that existed between the various Dodgers, the great negotiator of personalities, Pee Wee Reese, and their fanbase. It is clear that Ebbets Field was no longer a suitable home, at least without major modifications. Parking was very poor, a serious concern in the emerging era of the suburban commuter fan; the stadium itself needed to be revamped, the plumbing fixed, the seating rearranged. Still, Ebbets Field was only 45 years old, and was a solid structure, despite its flaws.If O'Malley was indeed \\"desperate to stay in Brooklyn\\" as Shapiro posits, then why weren't his efforts directed toward staying? Why was he engaged in a stalemated battle of wills with Moses over a new stadium? Perhaps O'Malley simply wasn't \\"desperate\\" enough. Certainly, Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park still stand in less than desirable locations, but they draw dedicated fans nonetheless. Had O'Malley spent a part of his considerable fortune buying up some surrounding properties and building a parking complex, and then incrementally improved Ebbets Field with better seating and new amenities, the Dodger fanbase would have continued to travel to Flatbush.O'Malley did not do this. He wanted land, and a lot of it, on the cheap---had Moses condemned the meat market, O'Malley would have bought the property for pennies on the dollar, a very attractive possibility to a man who squeezed a penny hard enough to put a permanent wave in Lincoln's beard. Los Angeles offered him that and he jumped, literally across a continent, to get it, taking his team about as far from Brooklyn as it was possible to go in his desperation to stay. Yet, if he'd REALLY wanted to stay, Flushing Meadow beckoned. And despite the fact that Flushing is not Brooklyn, the New York football Giants play in New Jersey's Meadowlands and still remain a New York team (the O'Malley-inspired move of the baseball Giants from Manhattan to San Francisco is another issue). In 1957, many of Brooklyn's fans were Long Island transplants, and more would be as time passed. Queens, while not the best of all possible worlds, would have been a convenient waypoint for fans from the old and new neighborhoods.For that matter, had either O'Malley or Moses given a damn about Brooklyn, they would have cooperated in building a new stadium and reinvigorating Brooklyn. Neither cared to.\\"Walter O'Malley was not a bad man. He was devoted to his wife and his children loved him,\\" Shapiro points out. That's nice to know. But O'Malley was also an S.O.B. in business. The two are not mutually exclusive. \\"Only a sentimental man,\\" Shapiro writes, \\"would have stayed.\\" Maybe so. But the Dodgers and the Dodger fanbase needed a sentimental man, they needed a fellow fan, they needed a man who loved the team and who loved Brooklyn. What they had was Walter O'Malley, who saw the team merely as a moneymaking concern. O'Malley's actions speak for themselves, regardless of Shapiro's revisionism. And if O'Malley was \\"not unique\\" among team owners but merely \\"so obvious\\" about his profit motives, the blame is still his for eroding the spirit of The Game, and beginning the slide to where we are today in baseball with its overly mobile nonentity franchises, bloated payrolls, stars on steroids, cupidity and stupidity, and fan disinterest.In the face of necessity, sentiment oft-times does not serve. But in circumstances of choice, such as faced by the Dodgers, sentiment can be a hedge against callousness.What O'Malley (and Moses) failed to grasp is that a ball team is more than an agglomeration of men in uniform standing around in an open field. He (they) failed to grasp that a baseball game is more than just nine innings and a cold toting of runs, hits, and errors. It is a conversation at a water cooler, a friendly argument over lunch, an invitation to meet at the ballpark on Saturday afternoon for dogs and beer and a chance to see The Duke of Flatbush. It is a sense of neighborliness, a sense of pride, and was---still is---an important part of Brooklyn's special identity.As Roger Kahn says inThe Boys of Summer, \\"In the best of all possible worlds the Dodgers would be in Brooklyn and Los Angeles would have the Mets.\\"That's as it should have been."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"This is a great sports book and a great book about Brooklyn.

This is a beautifully written and engaging history of the Bums last year in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Michael Shapiro does a superb job not only of capturing the excitement of the Brooklyn Dodgers' last pennant-winning season but also of explaining just what the Dodgers meant to so many Brooklynites. Set against the background of the Walter O'Malley-Robert Moses negotiations that would determine the fate of the Dodgers, Shapiro provides logical proof that it was not O'Malley's intention to move the ballclub but that Moses kept making a fool of him to the point where remaining in Brooklyn would have been rather humiliating for O'Malley.Though never elected to any office, Robert Moses was the most powerful official in New York City in the late 1950s. His power was further enhanced by the fact that the Mayor at that time, Robert F. Wagner Jr. was both lazy and indifferent, and would not have gone far in politics except for the fact that his namesake father was a very popular U.S. senator. If O'Malley was going to get the land and permits to build a new ballpark, he was going to have to go through Moses and Moses couldn't have cared less as to what became of the Dodgers.O'Malley tired desperately to be taken seriously by Moses and the NYC politicians to where he even had the Dodgers play seven \\"home\\" games in Jersey City in 1956. In the end, the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, not because O'Malley plotted to take them there but because L.A. politicians eagerly and actively courted O'Malley to move to their city while their New York counterparts, especially Moses, gave him the brush-off.O'Malley wanted to build a ballpark at the junction of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, where multiple subway lines and the Long Island Railroad converge. Moses at first wanted O'Malley to build a ballpark in a hard-to-reach part of Bedford-Stuyvesant and later proposed having the city build a ballpark on the site of what is now Shea Stadium. Anyone familiar with Brooklyn knows that if you're riding the subway, it's easier to get to Yankee Stadium from Brooklyn than to go out to Flushing Meadows, where Shea Stadium is.In any case Los Angeles made O'malley an offer he couldn't refuse--300 acres in the heart of the city, where multiple freeways converge. New York officials made no effort to compete as Brooklyn didn't count for much in their eyes. When the Mets were created a few years later there was no question in their minds that they should represent New York and use the orange \\"NY\\" logo formerly used by the New York Giants, rather than the Brooklyn Dodgers' \\"B.\\"50 years have now passed since the Dodgers moved, and Walter O'Malley has been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The ballpark he built and paid for (which opened in 1962) remains one of the most beautiful and popular in major league baseball. Shea Stadium, on the other hand, built by Robert Moses with taxpayers' money and opened in 1964, will soon be torn down. What is more, New Jersey Nets owner Bruce Ratner is currently trying to arrange to move his NBA basketball team to that same junction in Brooklyn that O'Malley originally wanted.Michael Shapiro is an excellent writer and his book is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"This book probably doesn't get the sales or the attention it deserves, because the title and the cover make it look as if it's intended just for baseball junkies. But it's far more than that. In just 332 pages, Shapiro tells four stories:1. The story of the National League pennant race in 1956.2. The story of why the Dodgers (and therefore the Giants as well) decided to move to California in 1958.3. The social, demographic, and economic changes that Brooklyn (and, by extension, much of urban America) experienced in the post-World War II era.4. Thumbnail sketches of the personal lives of the core players in the Brooklyn Dodger lineup from 1947 through 1956.None of these four themes is given short shrift. Furthermore, Shapiro has organized this book beautifully. He seems to have done a perfect job in choosing exactly where to break the narrative of the Dodgers' wins and losses, and insert a section about the changing character of a neighborhood in Brooklyn.Not only that, but Shapiro's writing is superb. Here is his account of the last pitch of the last Dodger game of the regular season - a game they had to win in order to clinch the championship, with Dodger Don Bessent pitching to Pittsburgh's Hank Foiles:*****Don Bessent went into his windup. The last thing he thought before releasing the ball was, he later said, \\"Tight, keep it tight.\\"Hank Foiles swung. The next thing he heard was the thud of the ball in Roy Campanella's mitt.*****You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this book. You just have to enjoy good writing and a wonderful story, wonderfully told."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"This book goes beyond just a detailed view of the Dodgers' last great year in Brooklyn, it also provides a nice historical snapshot of the legendary borough and the changes that were taking place. This is a well researched book with a lot of great information on Dodger greats such as Reese, Snider, Newcombe, Robinson, etc. I definitely enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Not that either one of the two men most responsible were saints, but Shapiro's book justly lays the discredit for the Dodgers move to California on Robert Moses' egotistical head. All these years O'Malley has been looked upon as the villain when it was Moses who was the real culprit. Shapiro's book is a mash up of Brooklyn Dodger 1950's history, and Brooklyn post war history with the changes in demographics that led to the Dodgers decline at the turnstiles. More importantly it is a study of how one tyrant with unelected powers was able to prevent the Dodgers from building a new stadium in a choice part of the borough as the politicians stood by pathetically impotent. A sad story but one I couldn't put down. And a greatly warranted revision to Robert Moses' legacy. A must for all Brooklyn Dodger fans."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Author Michael Shapiro captures the flavor of baseball circa 1956 with this informative look at the Brooklyn Dodger's last pennant. The author aptly describes both the play on the field and the team's ownership moves that occurred behind the scenes.I liked reading of the down-to-the-wire pennant race, where the defending world champions overcame age, injuries, and challenges by the upstart Milwaukee Braves and Cincinnati Reds. We get an inside look at many players; aging leaders Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese, garrulous Roy Campanella, sulking slugger Duke Snider, volatile hurler Don Newcombe, etc. Readers feel almost inside the clubhouse as the talented players fight for another pennant.Interwoven into the pages is an informed look at the seamy business moves of owner Walter O'Malley. Declining attendance had O'Malley looking for a new stadium while also secretly negotiating with the city of Los Angeles. The author indicts city planning czar Robert Moses for blocking a new Dodger stadium in downtown Brooklyn - but the greedy O'Malley was hardly blameless. In the end, of course, O'Malley callously deserted to California, leaving thousands of broken hearts in Brooklyn.This book is informative, engaging and well-researched (if too easy on O'Malley).

I have many Dodgers books, & this is one of the best. I would just like to call attention to something that is lacking in all the previous reviews, & that is the fact that Neil J. Sullivan wrote a book called \\"The Dodgers Move West\\" in 1987. In a lot of detail & with dozens of references, Sullivan explored the Robert Moses factor (in terms of the Dodgers not staying in Brooklyn). I was reminded of this omisssion after recently watching the HBO special, \\"Brooklyn Dodgers: The Ghosts of Flatbush,\\" in which author Shapiro is (appropriately) interviewed, but again, this special program makes nary a mention of Sullivan's earlier, pioneering work in this area.

Elegantly vivid sentences like the one describing how at one point the politicos had a plan for a Jetson-like Brooklyn; the author said it could have been something that Robert Moses and Josef Stalin drew up together on a cocktail napkin."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Even though I was only five years old when the Dodgers left Brooklyn, I always had a fond spot in my heart for the team. I collected Brookyn Dodger yearbooks over the years. This book, by Michael Shapiro, brought out many interesting facts which I did not know, such as it was only at the end of the season did the Dodgers actually sell out any games. Even though Ebbets Field only held 32,000 I assumed there were several sell outs during the season. Yes,the Dodgers were profitable but O'Malley was a business man and saw (like the Braves) he could make significantly more money. Knowing that area of Brooklyn, that if the stadium was built in 1957 and the teams which would have included Koufax and Drysdale they would have succeeded greatly. Also, the book points out the relationship between Robinson, Campenella and Newcombe. I was not aware of the relationship between the three. I could not believe Newcombe left Ebbets Field, after getting knocked out of the 7th game of the World Series. Yanks start Johnny Knucks against the leagues MVP and Cy Young winner and Newcombe gets knocked out and leaves the Field. I found it incredible that the day after the World Series the team leaves for Japan. I wonder how todays players would react. I wonder why Rachel Robinson declined to be interviewed by the author, I believe she could have added greatly to experiences at Ebbets Field and Brooklyn in the 1950's. I enjoyed the part when Sal Maglie first came to the Dodgers and his reception in the clubhouse. The best part was describing Brookyn in the 1940's and how it was transforming in the 1950's. I read the Boys of Summer many years ago, but this book by Michael Shapiro is clearly superior. I would recommend this book to any baseball fan from that era, especially Brooklyn Dodger fans. Both O'Malley and especially Robert Moses are the real villians here."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Books relating to specific years have been popular over the past several years with mixed results. Author Michael Shapiro has provided us with an outstanding portrait of an aging Brooklyn Dodgers' team going down to the wire in the 1956 season to eek out a pennant over the Milwaukee Braves during the final days of the season. The book is really two separate stories. One involving a lot of politics between Dodgers' owner Walter O'Malley and Robert Moses, an appointed New York official, over the location of a new playing site for the Dodgers. Moses wanted a site located on the present site of Shea Stadium while O'Malley wanted one nearer to Ebbets Field. Shapiro labels Moses as the villain in the move of the Dodgers while O'Malley needed help in acquiring a new stadium, but was not going to get it. Los Angeles promised him more than New York would even consider, so Walter made the move. The one thing O'Malley and Moses shared in common, according to Shapiro, was an ignorance between the team and its fans. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed with the politics involved between both sides in trying to get the deal each wanted, but Shapiro is very thorough in his research. The book's chapters are divided into each month of the baseball season and what took place during each month. A separate chapter is provided for the last week of the season and the World Series. Interesting stories about players such as Robinson, Campanella, Erskine, Reese, Furillo, Newcombe, Labine, and an early season pickup of Sal &quot;The Barber&quot; Maglie from the Cleveland Indians make for very interesting reading even if you are familiar with the Dodgers of this era from other books. It is ironic that former Giant and Dodger rival, Sal &quot;The Barber&quot; Maglie, was to be very instrumental in bringing the Dodgers home with the 1956 pennant. Interesting details of the deal that sent Maglie to the Dodgers from the Indians are provided. Maglie also authored his only no-hitter during the final week of the '56 season, before being victimized by Don Larsen's perfect game in the 5th game of the Series. For the most part America wanted the Milwaukee Braves to win the '56 pennant just to have a new team in the Series, but the St. Louis Cardinals snuffed out the Braves' hopes in St. Louis while the Dodgers were beating the Pirates in Brooklyn. If you feel you have read enough of the Brooklyn Dodgers in previous books, you owe it to yourself to read about this storied team during their Last Good Season."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Michael Shapiro has done a fabulous job of bringing the 1956 National League pennant race to life. Reading this book makes that season as vivid as if it were this year's season. His telling of the machinations of Walter O'Malley and Robert Moses gives a great look at New York in the Fifties. Although long time Brooklyn residents may disagree, Shapiro points to Moses as the real villain behind the Dodgers' exit from New York. His reasoning is sound and he does a great job of showing O'Malley to be the conniving businessman he was."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"I was just 3 years old the last time the Brooklyn Dodgers went to the World Series. In 1956 the Dodgers were an aging team and were probably not even the best team in the NL (that being the Milwaukee Braves). Ironically by picking up old enemy Sal Maglie, Brookyn won the pennant on the last day of the season. They lost the World Series to the Yankees in 7 games (Game 5 was Larsen's Perfect Game) and it was a credit to them that they were able to take a superior Yankee team the distance.The next year the Dodgers finished third and were a team that was \\"past it's prime and past its time.\\" Walter O'Malley was not a nice man by any means. He was devoted to his family and had a great sense of business but as Michael Shapiro points out, should not have been a baseball owner. O'Malley was strictly a bottom line owner - he counted how many butts were in the seats at Ebbets Field. If you went to one game a season but followed the Dodgers passionately over TV, the radio and newspapers, and argued about them in the luncheonette, then by O'Malley's reckoning you were not a real fan. O'Malley missed the mystical connection between team and fans. However as Shapiro makes known, the real villain was the ubiquitous and dictatorial Robert Moses and the notorious way that business was done (and is still done) in New York. Moses refused to condemn land (something he loved doing - condemning land) to build a new stadium. At heart Moses (as was O'Malley) was not even a baseball fan and had little connection to the average Joe Sixpack who followed the team. Shapiro's book as well as being a great account of the 1956 season, is in ceratin ways a sociology and urban history book of New York in the 1950's as well. It is apparent that as beloved as the Dodgers were, they have been romanticized by people such as Roger Kahn way out of proportion. Jackie Robinson comes across as a fierce competitor whose will to win was unmatched, but as not such a nice person. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to follow the ups and downs of a legendary team and have the truth revealed about the 1958 move to Los Angeles."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"I found this book gripping in its remarkable story line. It is indeed much more than a baseball book in its insights into the social history of the time and place. The depictions of the team and its season made thrilling reading even though I knew the end of the tale. I was surprised,resistant, but ultimately convinced by the author's careful marshalling of documentary evidence that O'Malley really wasn't the evildoer that I had always pictured. It's a terrific read and a marvelous book."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"I was born in Brooklyn about four years after the Dodgers left for Los Angeles, so I never had the opportunity to experience the Brooklyn Dodgers firsthand, but Michael Shapiro does a wonderful job capturing the Dodgers final years in Brooklyn, and the struggle between Dodger owner Walter O'Malley, who wanted a new stadium in Brooklyn, and New York' master builder Robert Moses, who had other plans for the Brooklyn site and wanted (and eventually did) build a stadium in Queens.Shapiro tells the story of the fight between O'Malley and Moses, and he truly captures how important the Dodgers were to Brooklyn. Although the team in their last few years in Brooklyn did not draw particularly well, they were still beloved, and an important part of the borough -- with stars such as Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, and Gil Hodges living in Brooklyn during the season, their wives shopping in local stores, and their children attending the local schools.To a certain extent I'm sure many of the Brooklyn fans thought their team would never leave. The book illustrates, however, that the teams' fate was in the hands of O'Malley, a businessman only interested in turning a profit, and Moses, a planner who virtually ruled over New York for decades, was more powerful than many mayors, and literally changed the face of the city as well as the state. The fans, caught in the middle, counted for nothing.Shapiro also portrays the personalities of many of the Dodger stars, with insight into clubhouse relationships and why they performed so well as a team.In many ways this book is a study in urban politics and baseball. He shows how one affected the other in a profound way, and ultimately, with the move of the Dodgers and Giants to the West Coast, brought baseball into a new era.If you like baseball or have an interest in New York politics, then this book is for you. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"The three stars I will give for what Shaprio tries to do in recreating the story of the last Brooklyn pennant drive. But this book deserves no more than that for its promotion of an appalling bit of revisionist history that tries to take the blame off Walter O'Malley for moving the Dodgers, and transferring it instead to Robert Moses. Neal Sullivan in \\"The Dodgers Move West\\" was the first to push this idea, but Shapiro takes it to new heights, declaring boldly that \\"Robert Moses is the bad guy in this story\\" for not in effect giving O'Malley what he wanted at an Atlantic Avenue site.One could say that Shapiro's analysis is really the flip-side emotional argument against Moses, the same way so much of the old arguments against O'Malley from Brooklynites were rooted in emotion. And in Shapiro's case, the blunt facts are that on an emotional AND economic level, his attempt to paint Moses as the real villain has absolutely no validity.On an emotional level, the argument fails because O'Malley was ultimately the one who had to make the final call, and it was O'Malley who failed to understand the depth of meaning the team had to a community that made it ethically dubious (though perfectly legal) to decide he, a man who had owned the team outright for only seven years, had the right to take a 67 year civic institution 3000 miles away for his own personal edification. If O'Malley suffered from a genuine financial hardship case (which he did not), then he should have sold the team. The argument that Shaprio makes \\"O'Malley had not spent all his time and energy and divested himself of all his holdings but his baseball team in order to take Robert Moses' on-the-cheap-deal in Flushing Meadows\\" is somehow designed to make us feel sorry for O'Malley in the sense that as a businessman he had no choice but to do what he did. That is simply nonsense.Fortunately, Henry Fetter's \\"Taking On The Yankees\\" written after Shapiro's book, has offered some much needed post-revisionism to this story by offering the kind of full-blown economic analysis of O'Malley's Atlantic Avenue plan that one will not find in Shapiro's book. What Fetter points out, and what Shapiro neglects to do is note that O'Malley was only prepared to pay the city $1 million for the land he expected the city to condemn at Atlantic Avenue in order for him to build his stadium. The true value of the land, given the costs of relocation of a major meat market and a rail terminal though, would have been more on the order of $9 million, meaning in effect O'Malley wanted a sweetheart deal of a kind that would have represented civic extortion at its worse. Robert Moses offered a perfectly legitimate site in Flushing Meadow that would in time prove to be a profitable draw for the ex-Dodger fanbase who became Met fans, and which answered all the concerns over parking and transportation access that supposedly made Ebbets Field obsolete at this point (though Fetter's analysis notes that the complaints about Ebbets Field were almost identical to ones being sounded a decade later about Fenway Park in Boston, and Fenway as we know, still survives in a bad neighborhood and the same low capacity that Ebbets Field had). O'Malley rejected the offer because he wasn't going to get a big cash cow for himself, which he tried to paper over with the dubious argument that moving the Dodgers to Queens would be no different than moving to Los Angeles.O'Malley might have been a man who loved his family, but as a sports owner, he was as ethically dishonest as Art Modell was to Cleveland Browns fans a generation later and as such, should not be given Hall of Fame recognition, ever. It's really a sad comment that because of the impact of Robert Caro's \\"The Power Broker\\", Robert Moses has become a convenient whipping boy for revisionist authors like Shapiro and Sullivan who believe in rehabilitating O'Malley no matter what. But while Moses was a man whose faults should be duly documented, he is totally blameless on the matter of why the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"Wow. First let me say that I'm not a Brooklyn resident or a Dodger fan and picked this book up without knowing anything about it. The book turned out to be one of the best baseball books I've read in quite some time.I was drawn into the book immediately. It is clear in the Prologue that Shapiro is a very good writer and that the book is as much about the fifties and Brooklyn as it is about a pennant race. The book is enjoyable on both fronts.Shapiro does a great job of weaving a portrait of the changes going on in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties and giving younger readers a good idea of what it was like to grow up in that era. It is clear that Shapiro has done quite a bit of research and I think the reader really gets a good look into the personalities of the players and other characters in the story.Any fan of baseball history will do himself a favor in buying this book. It truly deserves more acclaim than it has received."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"This is an amazing book. Less about baseball and more about life. It takes a reader from the end of the 1955 season, when the Dodgers won the World Series through the 1956 National League Chapionship to the dark days of 1957, when the Dodgers left for Los Angeles.What's special is that few books tell the story as Shapiro did. To get the understanding of Shapiro, one would have to read volumes on the iconoclastic Robert Moses and on baseball. He tells the plight of the Dodgers as few have, laying the blame squarely on Robert Moses, public works czar of New York City, who failed to see the virtue in a Dodgers stadium while conspiring to build a dull monolith of his own in Flushing, which became Shea Stadium.In between, we find a well-researched, well-thought-out view of the Dodgers, aging and all. About Pee Wee and Jackie's future, about Furillo and Hodges. The people we learned about in \\"The Boys of Summer,\\" become \\"The Men of Late Autumn.\\"A tremendous read, especially in conjunction with \\"The Lords of the Realm,\\" which discuss the business side of baseball."},{"Title":"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers, and Their Final Pennant Race Together","review":"This is a gripping and well-written account of the last days of the Brooklyn Dodgers, their final pennant race in 1956 and the battle to keep the team in Brooklyn.If you've read The Boys of Summer, this is a good companion because that book focuses on the early 1950s teams and then the players in later life. This fills in some of the gaps in that narrative.Shapiro is an outstanding writer and historian. If he has a weakness, it's that he's not a baseball writer per se, and his descriptions of some of the game action can be a bit disjointed. But he more than makes up with it in his accounts of the social fabric of Brooklyn and the political wranglings that eventually led Walter O'Malley to move his team from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. His profiles of the key players, both on and off the field, are also exceptional.This is a book that will make you yearn both for the start of a new baseball season and a simpler day when the fans felt a sense of kinship with the players."},{"Title":"Blag","review":"beautiful and stunning layout and design. taking hip hop and graphic arts combined to the next level."},{"Title":"Since at Least Plato--","review":"Ms. Devaney's book is a thorough and lucid dismantling of the naive philosophical assumptions and blatant non-sequiturs which too often inform &quot;postmodern&quot; thought. This book is required reading for both practitioners and critics of postmodernism. Beginning with a demonstration of postmodernism's misunderstanding and misappropriation of classical formal logic, she proceeds to show how postmodern thinkers have misconstrued, among other things, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, Bohr's theorem, and Einstein's theory of special relativity. Her charges are levelled mainly at postmodern rather than post-structuralist critics, but they are equally telling against the latter. DeVaney successfully unravels the sophistry of Derrida's reading of Plato in his &quot;Plato's Pharmacy&quot;, thereby depriving deconstruction of one of its paradigm examples of the virtues of the deconstructive method. Moreover, DeVaney questions the validity of the post-structuralist appeal to Saussure's linguistic theories. On her reading, Saussure's system demonstrates how words take on meaning and not what they mean, thus reducing the post-structuralist contention that words don't refer to an external reality to utter nonsense. Ms. DeVaney's book is without question the most well-informed critique of the pretensions of postmodern thought that I have encountered. In one sense, it is too well-informed. Her arguments are so compelling that postmodern theorists are likely to ignore them altogether; for sustained reflection on their implications will reveal that Ms. DeVaney has utterly demolished an entire genre of literary theory."},{"Title":"Since at Least Plato--","review":"This book is a very good read for students. All who are tired of the new intellectual orthodoxy can acquire a trove of swift and mighty swords if they will master this book. There are weapons and armor of every shape and size here, something for about any fight one may join in the swamps of postmodernism.Devaney takes on the entire rhetoric involved in calling logic binary. She devastates the typical Hegelian errors PoMo theorists make about the law of noncontradiction. Her prose is lucid and swift. The book is of appropriate length, i.e, not too long, I would say. I did want more. I have seen no other book of work like this from a competent logician.Devaney is very fair minded. For example, she separates Derrida from the pack who moralize the young over the bogey of 'binary logic' and 'binary thinking' and 'binary' everything else. That discussion is most valuable for anyone up against it in a hall full of irrationalists. Their paradoxes and stuff are usually just confusions. The chapter on the politics of the Logic of Both/And is superb. Derrida says all kinds of irresponsible stuff, and those who support him just moralize and politicize. Devaney has it that the myth of the 'Logic of Both/And' -- which is alleged to be true only when the law of non-contradiction is false--is not really Derrida's. It is a gift to Derrida from his followers -- the underlings made it up in his name.Those who master this whole book will have a field day in the battle against the swelled and bloated croakers in the backwaters of the hatred of logic and science. So far as I know, this is the best logician's handbook against the current nonsense in existence. As a tour of the madhouse where logic is postmodernized, it is unsurpassed as well."},{"Title":"Since at Least Plato--","review":"This is an extraordinary attack on the sloppiness, imprecision, and general vacuity of &quot;poststructuralist&quot; theory as it has come to dominate American literature departments. There are lots of books out there bemoaning the state of literary studies today, and the surrender of literary studies to identity politics, etc. But Devaney moves in with a tremendous command of several important points in symbolic logic, cogently shows how the failure to take certain logical distinctions -- elementary to a first-year college logic student -- has turned most English department &quot;theory&quot; into a species of grandiose nonsense, and then proceeds to obliterate, one by one, a succession of &quot;theorists&quot; holding forth in their fuzzy way about &quot;the logic of either/or,&quot; &quot;binary logic,&quot; etc. She leaves the &quot;real&quot; poststructuralists (Foucault, Derrida, et al) strictly alone, presumably because she thinks they're a lot more rigorous than their American followers, but the job she does on the Theory Wannabes is breathtaking. I once saw an entire house being treated for cockroaches. They totally sealed it off, closed every crack and pore in the plastic covering, and then proceeded to pump in a thousand gallons of pesticide spray. The pesticide rendered itself harmless after a few hours, and when the house was unsealed every cockroach was dead. Reading Devaney on contemporary literary studies is a bit like that experience."},{"Title":"Since at Least Plato--","review":"_\`Since at Least Plato...'_ is exceptional and lucid, a necessary tonic in these times, but in case someone has the impression that anyone writing on these matters does so with a cold eye, I would like them to think otherwise.Ms Devaney writes with a passion for truth, for intellectual honesty, and for literary works, and passion is considered out of place in the overripe (hence, on the verge of death) cool ironic mode prevalent today in much literary theory. It is as refreshing to see a heart ablaze as it is to witness a mind relentlessly examining what is regarded as critical thought in the areas of cultural studies and the humanities.If Ms Devaney's words only burned through faddish arguments, then there would be little beauty present; but she restores, with vigor, and in clear terms, logical thought as the centrepiece of respectable theory. She is to be commended not only for her forthright remarks, but for her belief that a sustained, intelligent, and intelligible, dialogue with readers will result in a better understanding of many theorists so popular today.Their popularity is up and down, but the strength of mind and conviction of soul in Devaney's work are constants which distinguish her book from so many others in this field."},{"Title":"The Absentminded Fellow","review":"This is the absolute masterpiece of Russian poetry for children.

Ausmus contends that the logical consequence of Niebuhr's thought is nihilism, a rather serious charge to lodge against a Christian theologian and preacher.Why has this work, published in 1990, been ignored?I suspect that Niebuhr scholars and others fear that accepting the challenge to examine Ausmus' thesis may just disclose some nihilism in their thought."},{"Title":"An interpretation of Christian ethics","review":"From the book's back cover:Explores the conflict between the Christian ideal of unlimited love and the pride and injustice of human society. Against both secularists and the pessimism characteristic of continental neo-orthodoxy, the author emphasizes the ideal of love as an actual possibility. Against secular and Christian liberalism he reaffirms the impossibility of perfect love being realized by essentially finite and willful creatures.

The section on how to negotiate your salary is also very good.What the title refers to, the tough interview questions you may be asked and how to answer them, are pretty much the same as in other job seeking books.

It reveals the Agency indeed has &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; capabilities equal to those dreamed up by thriller genre authors who lack the personal experience of Antonio and Jonna. I was a bit upset by the negative tone of some of the reviews here, from people who obviously had been so influenced by trashy fiction they were unable to recognize &quot;the real thing&quot; when they saw it.Antonio and Jonna were highly-specialized technicians supporting the operations of other case officers, operations whose complexity often requires the orchestrated participation of dozens of other Agency officers, and coordination with many different &quot;desks&quot; at Headquarters and field stations in other countries. In this sense, during their careers they probably enjoyed a higher level of job satisfaction than most case officers, who have the difficult, mostly frustrating task of finding and recruiting foreigners to spy for them. Most thriller authors have no idea of the amount of planning and preparation these real operations involve, and how easily things can go wrong. SPY DUST is a welcome eye-opener in this regard.Because of their specialization, Antonio and Jonna contributed to more interesting operations every year than most case officers see in a lifetime. My hat is off to their obvious expertise, and I fully understand (which some reviewers did not) why they were unable to include more nitty-gritty details on exactly how some of their amazing technical tricks were performed.Former CIA employees find a realistic true-life book such as SPY DUST extremely difficult to write, because it must be cleared (some would say censored) by the CIA Publications Review Board. Despite that, it is amazing how much informative detail and &quot;been there, done that&quot; personal experience the authors were able to reveal.I never met the authors while we were all still &quot;on the job,&quot; but SPY DUST has given me a deeper appreciation of their technical colleagues I encountered overseas."},{"Title":"Spy Dust","review":"Like Antonio Mendez' first book, Master of Disguise, this excellent entry in true espionage is filled with the nuts and bolts of daily intelligence work. As described in the book, it is a life that is messy, frustrating, and in the odd rare moment, filled with coincidences that are all the more satisfying because they are true. The tone is light, crisp and clear. As one would expect from Bruce Henderson, the story is narrative-driven, providing a human element and strong sense of place within the events described. The book offers no &quot;dirt&quot; on the CIA - Mendez is a loyal company man - but there is much insight into the workings of the organization during tumultuous and key years. The glossary is thorough without being exhaustive. Non-fiction fans and those interested in espionage will be pleased. David R.

The love story adds a human element to the tale in a world of characters usually thought to be as ice cold or as sensual as ... Galore. Real world spying without the cliffhanger made for movie scenes. Great read."},{"Title":"Spy Dust","review":"This book, by Antonio Mendez and his wife Jonna, is an intriguing memoir of two CIA employees at work during the closing years of the Cold War. Like most Cold War memoirs and histories, Spy Dust offers an insight into a small portion of the overall struggle between the USA and the USSR. As loyal CIA retirees, they don't really allow us to see all that much, but by pulling the curtain back just a little, the insight is fascinating.The book reads more like a spy novel than a non fiction book, and the parallels made me wonder how much in current spy fiction is actually fact. I have heard others say that the truth would actually be stranger than fiction, and this book makes me believe that that statement is actually true.One statement that I found particularly telling was at a conference after the end of the Cold War where the current and past CIA Directors shared the podium with the former KGB Director of Foreign Counterintelligence, General Oleg Kalugin. In scoring the success of American vs. Soviet Human Intelligence efforts, he rated the U.S. successes as five times that of the Soviets, an amazing admission from a former enemy.I think any reader will find this book very interesting and easy to follow and enjoy."},{"Title":"Spy Dust","review":"I found this book to be an engrossing look at the real world of espionage. While reading the book I felt like I was reading a script for a spy movie. It's hard to believe that people actually use some of the techniques that you see on the big screen. I'd like to disagree with some of the other reviews about the book. The love story actually is a minor part of the overall structure of the book. I think it makes the authors seem more real and human rather than your usual stereotypical super spy that can leap buildings in single bound. Although I wouldn't consider the book a pinnacle of literary prose, it is very readable and, in general, well written. I particularly enjoyed their detailed decriptions of the actual operations. I felt like I actually got a taste (at least on a superficial level) of the tension, planning, stress, and adrenaline rush that must go on during an operation. I also found Jonna's version of events more enjoyable than Tony's. As to the reviewer who said that there weren't gadgets, well he must have been reading the wrong book. I found plenty of mention of various techniques, but of course they couldn't describe it in detail. I'm sure alot of it is still being used in the field and is still classified! At any rate, this book gives you a good sampling of what the life of real life spies are like and I highly recommend it for a quick informative read."},{"Title":"Spy Dust","review":"While reality is sometimes said to be stranger than fiction, leave it to CIA veterans Tony and Jonna Mendez to create a memoir of their overseas adventures that truly boggles the mind.

It couldn't have happened to two better people.With so many autobiographies out there by ex-CIA operations officers, \\"Spy Dust\\" offers a distinct perspective on Cold War espionage history in that it was written by a husband-and-wife team of disguise artists, thus giving it that playful, creative flavor that makes this book all the more appealing.

I have read other, similar, accounts of life in the espionage field, but have never found a book that gave you a real look at the personal side of the business. This couple stated in their Smithsonian talk, shown on C-Span, that they hoped to &quot;undemonize&quot; the idea of the CIA, to put a human face on it. They have done that. I caught their book launch at the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. and was hooked. If you ever wondered how scarey the work is, they will clarify that for you. How hard does your heart beat in the middle of an operation, in the middle of a polygraph? It is all here, plus a couple of operations that will cause you to hold your breath, or at least caused me to.

The couple explains in alternating chapters how their separate missions starting in the mid-1980s converge into saving the lives of American moles inside the KGB. If nothing was done, the plants would have eventually fallen victim to the danger caused by the actions of Soviet moles (American traitors) inside the CIA.What makes this spy chiller even more exciting besides the true espionage thriller angle is that it reads like the spy duo falls in love with one another as their two projects commingle. Their feelings add depth to a true adventure that already feels more exciting than most espionage novels. The spots where the writing team conjecture and fill the gap of someone else's efforts seem weaker than the insider thrill when the writers talk directly about themselves. This book is a winner for the genre audience and will do a lot more to sell clandestine operations than donning the cone of secrecy demanded under the guise of homeland security by the Attorney General.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Spy Dust","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because I had heard the authors discussing it on the Book Channel on TV. However, reading the book was like seeing a movie in which all of the interesting acting and action is in the trailer.Specifically, while there is constant reference to the clever disguises the authors' used in various situation there was virtually no discription of what those disguises were or what was so clever about them. Since the events described took place 16 years ago and the Soviet Union no longer exists, national security is not a credible excuse for these omissions.In addition, there are many internal inconsistencies and improbable scenes. For example, there is a detailed discription of the clever way one of the authors got into a Soviet facility in SE Asia in order to case it for later surruptitious entry. Then the next paragraph or so we are told that much earlier the place had already been internally cased and described in detail by the guys making the incursion. So what was all of the secretive photographing of the compound after that. Why was that necessary.Problems like this make it difficult to believe the reliability of other events they describe, even if they didn't show up as internal inconsistencies.In addition to all of this it was very poorly written in both book structure and sentence structure.

It's descriptions of foreigncountries are very good, since you can get a feel for those places without visiting them.

The book shows teamwork within the CIA, not some lone CIA NAC who brushes her teeth with barbed wire every morning.The bad points:1. The chances of beating KGB surveillance as described in this book are zero, especially since this particularscenario is set in Russia. Hence the title of this review: 'Condescending'.2. Mendez really should not be going into details about his personal life, especially when everyone knows thatCIA agents with a public profile have no family.3. While I realize that every state practices propaganda, they at least try to make it interesting. Mendez'sdescription of his workaholism and crashing his 300ZX are plain wrong. First of all, on the first day ofCIA training, agents are told: This is not a crusade (Meaning they should have some balance in their life).Secondly, within the first month of CIA training, agents are put through enough sleep deprivation tomake sure they do not crash their 300ZX, or whichever car they are assigned."},{"Title":"Spy Dust","review":"I personally know these people and would recomed both books as a good read.

The authors spend many, many pages interweaving their personal love lives into the narrative. Personally, I was not that interested in reading how the female protagonist fell in love with her boss and left her husband (in that order).

It is rather a collection of loose narratives of spies walking or driving around cities overseas in the Cold War era. There's nothing new or of interest to historians or anyone interested in surveillance techniques.

C'mon, is \\"Goldfinger\\" a textbook in the CIA Academy? I doubt so. A lot of ink is wasted on the author's middle age love affair no one is interested about.

This book is very different. The author brings up concrete examples of mistakes which are routinely made by inexperienced engineers. He explains clearly which distribution is reasonable for various types of applications. The book is interesting to read, for the most part. (Okay, it still has a few boring chapters at the start, which I recommend skipping.) He even uses the example of human mortality to clearly illustrate concepts of &quot;failure rate&quot; in a way which gets rid of confusion. Finally, the book concludes with a case study for qualifying a high-reliability laser for use in undersea fiber optic communication links. While Franklin Nash's short course is the best I've ever taken, short of seeing him in person, reading this book is the next best thing. (In fact, I'd recommend the book even if you were going to attend the short course.) I've read it several different times in my job as a reliability engineer, and have obtained an understanding of the field that I haven't seen explained as well anywhere else. I give this book my strongest recommendation."},{"Title":"Estimating Device Reliability:: Assessment of Credibility (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This is a practical book that teaches the \\"how-to\\" on device reliability. Before reading this book, I thought \\"Applied Reliability\\" by Tobias and Trindade was the best introductory book in this field. Similar to Tobias and Trindade, this book is short and straight-forward. There are absolutely no fillers and it provides a lot of original concepts (e.g. AT&T; Tech J vol64), industrial practice (e.g. chap 8 device qualification), and intuitive thinking that are hard to find in other similar books. Books like \\"statistical methods for reliability data\\" by Meeker and Escobar or \\"Accelerated Testing: Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analyses\\" by Nelson tend to be dry and contain too much information that may confuse readers. Reading Nash first may help clarify the confusion and reinforce the fundamentals before exploring other alternatives.I also find this book supplements well with \\"Reliability and degradation of semiconductor lasers and LEDs\\" by Fukuda and \\"Reliability and Degradation of III-V Optical Devices\\" by Ueda.

The writing is much clearer than many Asian master's first works in English. The layout is extraordinarily well done with outstanding photos and illustrations that really augment the text. Content includes budo (martial arts) history, jujutsu, kenjutsu, and samurai tradition. The nito-ken (two-sword) techniques included herein are not widely taught and rarely described in other texts. Basic, intermediate, and advanced Honmon Enshin Ryu applications are well laid out, with many okuden (secret) mastry level techniques portrayed. The focus is primarily on sword to sword applications though there is also a small section on sword vs. yari (spear), naginata (halberd), bo (staff), and shuriken (throwing star) as well. There is also a bit of muto dori (no sword) techniques covered as well.The author really knows his stuff and communicates it effectively. Tanaka sensei has been studying martial arts since 1956, achieving an 8th dan black belt in kobudo, 7th dan in jujutsu and kyoshi iai suemonogiri kenpo, 5th dan in Bojutsu, and 4th dan in kendo among other accomplishments. While you cannot learn any martial art solely from a book, this work is an excellent place to learn about these systems or augment your dojo training.

While the play retains conventionalities that resonate in his other comedies, Shakespeare had obviously nudged the play to a direction that is redolent of a religious overtone. The main plot concerns Rosalind, a woman who disguises as a man but pretends to be the woman she actually is so she can woo the man by teaching him to court her. A streak of melancholy runs through the play from the beginning when Orlando is bitter at his brother Oliver who has deprived him of a genteel education and retains him at home. The melodrama of the brothers presages a possible tragedy as Oliver proposes to burn the lodging where Orlando customarily lives and with Orlando in it.Diversion away from the city and court somewhat mitigates the tension. Far away in the fairyland-like Forest of Arden (allusive to Eden) resides a banished duke whose crown and lands his brother Frederick has usurped. Duke Senior, in his landmark opening speech in Act 2, which introduces the allegorical Arden, duly expounds the pastoral philosophy. He articulates the monologue so well that the phrases become proverbial and the speech a sermon. Most of the actions then occur in Arden and in which almost all of the characters converge. Arden in a way represents a religious ideal and a converging ground for everyone to renew their identity and spirituality.As Orlando flees from his villainous brother, Rosalind's venomous uncle Duke Frederick banishes her from the court to be with her father. Rosalind enters Arden disguised as a young man Ganymede and teaches Orlando about wooing. Whereas the woodlands of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM are genuinely magical and populated by fairies, the Forest of Arden is like a fictitious realm that represents an ideal in which social values, love, marriage, and identity are renewed and re-examined.Shakespeare contrived to make a tale of redemption or some sort of a moral lesson out of AS YOU LIKE IT, preaching the ideal pastoral philosophy through the de-emphasizing of the plot. The story does not seem to matter as much as the underlying moral theme Shakespeare determined to convey. While Rosalind plays a leading part of the play and peremptorily takes charge of the play's situation (which facetiously involves entangled love among multiple parties), she extorts the necessary promises from all concerned and ties the right knots. Her preponderating overshadows Orlando despite the initial stress on his manliness and valor.AS YOU LIKE IT is predominantly in prose: the opening scene that delineates Orlando's pent-up agony proceeds in verses so does the scene in which the usurping Duke dismisses Orlando and that in which he banishes Rosalind. The scenes involving the banished Duke, who delivers a tirade on pastoral philosophy in Arden, are all written in prose. It is not a coincidence, but rather a meticulous choice that the sober and solemn parts of the play are penned in prose.Variation of theme that manifests in different plays again surface in AS YOU LIKE IT. Rosalind, whose disguise is already a Shakespearean convention, in teaching Orlando how to woo, speaks about the caprice of human heart, the failure of lovers' to keep in pace with emotions, and the conflict between impulse, feeling, and truth.AS YOU LIKE IT could be easily one of the most canonical plays in the repertory owing to the fact that readers can lay claim to the text on their own behalf. The endless possibilities to interpret the play also ironically invite misleading account from focusing on only selected features. The famous line \\"sweet are the uses of adversity\\" cunningly sums up how in most comedies a near tragic crisis at which disaster or happiness may ensue could be overcome by such overriding force of goodwill."},{"Title":"As You Like It (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"Out of all the great Shakespeare's plays, \\"As You Like It\\" is undoubtedly... the fluffiest. This is cotton candy. Fortunately, cotton candy isn't too bad as long as you don't eat too much of it. And while the ending is excessively tidy, \\"As You Like It\\" is a charming little play with the full array of Shakespearean tropes -- transvestitism, love triangles, and mass confusion.Backstory: The cruel Duke has deposed his far nicer brother, and the ex-Duke has run off into the Forest of Arden. At the same time, a young man named Orlando has been cast out by his cruel brother Oliver.Then the Duke decides to exile his niece Rosalind, despite the pleas of his daughter Celia. So Rosalind (disguised as a boy), Celia and the jester Touchstone run away into the Forest of Arden the following night, and soon encounter the exiled Duke and his followers. So does Orlando and his faithful servant Adam.Because of a previous meeting, Rosalind and Orlando are already in love. But not only does he not recognize her, but because she's disguised as a boy she's attracted the amorous intentions of a local shepherdess. And to make matters even more complex, Touchstone is in a love triangle of his own, and Oliver has stumbled into Arden as well. Is everything going to end well?The biggest problem with \\"As You Like It\\" is the fact that the ending is just a little too tidy -- while it's plausible that the romantic tangles would be smoothed out, there's an conveniently-timed twist that stretches believability to the point of snapping. Fortunately, the rest of it is a pleasantly fluffy little story filled with Shakespeare's sparkliest, sunniest storytelling.Shakespeare's plot floats along in a heady cloud of sunlit forests, poems pinned to trees and languid outlaws who hang around singing all day. His lines are filled with clever, sometimes bawdy jokes (\\"praised be the gods for thy foulness! sluttishness may come hereafter\\") and some nicely evocative imagery (\\"Between the pale complexion of true love/And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain\\").The funniest parts involve the love quadrangle between Rosalind, Phebe, Orlando and Silvius, as well as Orlando's wretched poetry and Touchstone's mockery of them (\\"Winter garments must be lined,/So must slender Rosalind\\").And it has a likable cast of characters, most of whom are amiable and likable (although I'm still not sure why Orlando and the ex-Duke don't recognize Rosalind!). Celia and Rosalind are fun and sprightly heroines, Orlando is an endearing underdog (if a rotten poet), and there's also the sharp-tongued Touchstone, dour Jacques, and the rather beyotchy Phebe.\\"As You Like It\\" is a puffy little wisp of a play, compared to Shakespeare's other works -- but it's still a nice little romantic diversion. Think of it as an Elizabethan romantic comedy."},{"Title":"As You Like It (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"One of William Shakespeare's comedy 'As You like it' has a lesson that a good will must be a praiseworthy thing and villainous intention is something always discouraged by the justice. It is something that we were able to learn from the fables and parents during the childhood. Duke Senior who living in banishment done by Duke Fredrick who is rascal in this comedy, and Duke Senior's daughter Rosalind disguied as a Ganymede searching for her father shows intriguing scene for the readers. True problem is that, Duke Fredrick's daughter Celia escaped with her cousin Rosalind because they are truly the confidant for each other. Therefore, Duke Fredrick displayed sense of resentment toward what his daughter and niece has done, and decide to go to wood to penalize his brother the Duke Senior. However, his attitude experiencing sudden transformation and repentant about his previous behaviors. Duke Fredrick's rapid psychological revolution should be awkward factor in this play. But we as a reader should interpret this as charater's assimilation to the nature. It means that the 'Nature' is place where has an innocent spirit and the castle, where deteriorated by human's negative will. I recommend this masterpiece, becuase there is a lesson implied in this comedy inculcate us that our human's mind has been deteriorated because of dwell in a city and surrounded by various artifact circumstances, it contradict to the 'Nature'which has a universally respectable tranquility."},{"Title":"Garden of the Sphinx: 150 Challenging and Instructive Puzzles","review":"This unique puzzle book is filled with 300 puzzles that not only challenge but teach new methods for problem solving.

I own Paul Zazarine's book on restoring GTOs and liked it as well.I can see two types of people for whom this book will perform a useful service:1) \\"Musclecar appreciation\\" types who have a general interest in the restoration process and who might later engage a professional shop;2) Someone who plans to restore what I would call a \\"second-tier\\" musclecar, e.g. any Pontiac without the words \\"Ram Air\\", \\"Super Duty\\", or \\"Judge\\" in their name (or a convertible), which would cost more to restore professionally than it could ever fetch on the market.Where I see this book failing is for the people who somehow own a restorable top-shelf musclecar, such as a Yenko or a Superbird, and who want to save a few dollars by doing the restoration themselves. I hope that such people will take the book's advice and research their vehicles thoroughly. By then they should conclude that a professional restoration - whether concours or \\"correct\\" - would be money well spent -- or that maybe their baby deserves a better home.As for me, the owner of a relatively common '68 GTO HT (with an auto), it makes more sense to take the Pro Touring route.

Through this fantastic work, we can understand how the political theatre is made and used not for the protection and guarantee of the people's interests, but for the political elite, the minority interests instead. Concepts like: clientelism, corruption, power image, caucus, ring, whip, dark horses... are only but some of the many examples that show how actual and important the knowledge and understanding of that work remains until today. The study and analysis pursued by Ostrogorski, the problems he was able to found and the construction he made of the British (1st Volume) and American (2nd Volume) societies and civilizations remain actual, and we can find today the repetition of the majority of the \\"difficult\\" situations that are able to exist (even) in a \\"democracy\\". Its a fundamental and prioritary author for those interested in understanding how the world goes on, and through what kind of rules... Good not only for those with interests in political science subjects, but to all citizens in general.It was for that reason that I have been studying Ostrogorski's thought and all his work, and I have already written a book on it, which is entitled, in portuguese, \\"A F&oacute;rmula do Poder.

Jusserand's \\"English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages\\" was first published in English by Ernest Benn Ltd., in 1889, as translated by Lucy Toulmin Smith. The last revised edition was published in 1920, by which time it was already showing its age, as the occasional attempts to bring it up to date reveal. Despite a nineteenth-century flavor of antiquarian curiosity-collecting, it retained a following, and was reprinted soon after World War II (1950). I have a University Paperback reprint (Methuen & Co., Ltd., London, and Barnes and Noble Inc., New York), originally issued in 1961.In the late 1960s it was still fairly common to see it cited in bibliographies and suggested reading lists, usually in connection with \\"The Canterbury Tales,\\" but sometimes with a book for children, \\"Adam of the Road,\\" by Elizabeth Janet Gray (1942; itself currently in print). There were apparently reprintings during the 1970s and 1980s which I have not seen. Now, well past the book's centennial, it is available from Kessinger. I would not be surprised to see it picked up by another publisher.What, except inertia in non-medievalist circles, and perhaps a certain (limited) practical utility for readers of Chaucer, has kept the book going? It continues to be available in the face of several revolutions in approaches to the Middle Ages, and a basic shift in scholarship from anecdotes and quaint customs to elaborate documentation and tightly focused questions. Other, more technically distinguished, books on medieval life languish out of print, and \\"English Wayfaring Life\\" still goes on -- and on, and on.Mainly, I think, it is the book's sheer charm. Jusserand had read a great deal, and selected really interesting bits and pieces to fit together in a loose framework. Despite the juxtaposition of possibly atypical incidents from a wide variety of times and several regions of the British Isles, the idea of presenting the types of people, places, and events a medieval traveler might have encountered makes the book feel like a narrative, rather than a rummage-sale bin. And Jusserand (and the translator!) could really write. Although the presentation is occasionally cloying, and the grasp of \\"modern\\" science and medicine sometimes so vague as to be amusing, Jusserand obviously likes the world waiting to be discovered in old documents, and wants the reader to share this interest.J. J. Jusserand also wrote \\"A Literary History of the English People,\\" which Tolkien alluded to with contempt in a public lecture (\\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\"). Years ago I tried to read it, on the strength of \\"Wayfaring Life,\\" and I understand Tolkien's annoyance. Jusserand there seemed to value anything in English in direct proportion to its similarity to something in French, and attributed anything he didn't comprehend to English muddle-headedness -- or beer. (If only those Anglo-Saxons drank more wine!) Michael Drout has an account of the matter in his edition of Tolkien's \\"Beowulf and the Critics.\\"But in \\"Wayfaring Life,\\" Jusserand mostly stuck to concrete details, didn't pass off literary judgments as historical facts (at least not often enought to remember), and is fun, if hardly as authoritative as he perhaps imagined."},{"Title":"Rene Magritte (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Absolutely wonderful presentation of an artist for kids ages 6-9.

If you're the least bit like me, you'll love this too."},{"Title":"Romeo & Juliet & West Side Story","review":"A great word-for-word rendition of both plays. It was especially helpful to me, because I had a research paper comparing the two."},{"Title":"Romeo & Juliet & West Side Story","review":"This is two books in one: the text of William Shakespeare's tragedy &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and the text of &quot;West Side Story,&quot; the 20th century musical with a book by Arthur Laurents and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. The book also includes an introduction by Norris Houghton, who notes, among other things, that WSS is based on R&amp;J. Each text tells the story of a love affair between a young woman and a young man who are caught between warring factions.I find it stimulating and useful to have these two pieces, linked in theme but separated by centuries, together in one volume. Each is a great text on its own, but having them together may help the reader to see each piece in a different light. One of the things I find most striking as one moves from R&amp;J to WSS is how the latter text adds the element of ethnic tension to the fundamental story of &quot;star-crossed lovers.&quot;R&amp;J is more than just a classic piece of literature; it's also a touchstone of pop culture (hey, it's even been incorporated into a &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; episode!). Despite the passage of centuries, I find Shakespeare's portrayal of the joy and pain of forbidden love to remain relevant and compelling. And R&amp;J holds up as a reader's text, even with the availability of filmed versions. I think that WSS, being a musical play, naturally loses some impact as a text strictly on the page, but nevertheless I found it a rewarding reader's text also. One might try listening to a CD of WSS's songs as an accompaniment to reading the text.To supplement WSS's portrayal of urban Puerto Ricans, I recommend that interested readers seek out some writings by &quot;Nuyorican&quot; authors; to start with, try Roberto Santiago's illuminating anthology &quot;Boricuas: Influential Puerto Rican Writings.&quot;"},{"Title":"Romeo & Juliet & West Side Story","review":"This dual book provides both the timeless Shakespeare classic and then the more-modern New York City gang tale. Romeo and Juliet was one of Shakespeares top efforts; a tragic love between youngsters from warring factions. In initially-difficult old English, the story glows as the tragedy examines love, distance, and the foolhardy hostilities that divide us. The couple tries but cannot navigate the difficult waters of their love, and come to tragic end via hostility and misunderstanding. Seldom has Shakespeare so captured the human condition as here. West Side Story is the stunning musical adapted to modernity. Tony is a Jet, a white gang that senses they are losing their New York City neighborhood to the Puerto Ricans and their gang the Sharks. These more-recent arrivals feel the sting of hostility and discrimination. When Tony meets Maria the two fall in love, but Maria's brother Bernardo leads the sharks will never accept Tony. Again, tradgedy results, and Tony and Maria are not the sole victims of hatred. Ironically, the Jets and Sharks of the 1950's seem much tamer than today's drug-running, gun-toting gangs.Two excellent plays, emphasizing tragic hostility, and highly popular with younger readers."},{"Title":"Romeo & Juliet & West Side Story","review":"This single volume containing the scripts of both \\"West Side Story\\" and its source, \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" is an excellent resource for comparing and contrasting both plays.

Berman has brought together several key strands of modern history to help explain the most troubling phenomena -- the increase, by orders of magnitude, of barbarity in the setting you'd least expect to find it, smack dab in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the apex of progress, as well as the equally troubling capitulation to it by sophisticated moderns. These things have not just randomly happened. There is still something dark here that evades explanation, but Berman has at least found parameters for lucid discussion. The book is continually interesting and enlightening. He has an argument and makes it in an orderly, cumulative, persuavive fashion. The two chapters on the thought of Sayyid Qutb are alone worth the read, demonstrating that Islamic extremism doesn't exist in some other-wordly vacuum.(Berman also points out an Achilles Heel to the extremist agenda -- womens rights. The activists and apologists know they have a real problem here.) Paul Berman's book is a reminder that individuals and their collectives should keep core values of freedom ever before them, weigh policies and actions against those values and, equally important, defend them."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"After September 11, 2001, the United States became immersed with the study of terrorism, the enhancement of national security, and the study of Islam. The \\"Know your enemy\\" trend became prevalent. Samuel Huntington's theory about \\"the clash of civilizations\\" enjoyed renewed popularity. Paul Berman's book is part of this trend. It is yet another attempt to understand the rift between the west and Islam, to try to make sense of the hatred that was grossly manifested on September 11, hatred that brought young, educated and skilled men, who had promising future ahead of them, to hijack four plans and fly them into the twin towers, the Pentagon, and to another designated location.In the first chapter, Berman justifies the war on Iraq, saying that \\"Saddam's regime was aggressive, dynamic, irrational, paranoid, murderous, grandiose and demagogic\\" (p. 4). Although I am also a supporter of the war on Iraq, I found this statement somewhat puzzling. One may also argue that the US regime is aggressive, dynamic, grandiose and demagogic, and some may add it is irrational. Also, I hope nations do not wage wars on each other because they are paranoid. Amassing so many adjectives together is a sign for light writing, which has some advantages: it is quick, easy to read, and usually engaging. The downside of such writing is that it lacks focus and cautiousness.Berman goes on to describe the very intricate relationships between the US and Saudi Arabia, relationships that are based on business interests, without mutual appreciation or sentiments. Today's superpower is an important ally for any country in the world, whereas Saudi Arabia has a strategic role to play, both because of its oil and its geography. For Berman Saudi Arabia represents evil: the beheadings, the veils, the oppression of women, intolerance, and Satanic conspiracy theories about Jews (p. 14).In chapter 2, Berman begins a tour of the 19th century violent anarchists and bloody colonialists as well as 20th century totalitarian regimes. The tour is quite rapid, looking at the scholarship of people like Tariq Ramadan and Albert Camus (no mentioning of Arendt or Talmon, arguably more important scholars in the field of totalitarianism); at the atrocious destruction of Congo by King Leopold of Belgium, and at the violent actions around the globe during these two centuries by people like Nechaev, Vera Zassulich, Boris Savinkov and, of course, Lenin in Russia; Alexander Berkman in the US, and Luigi Galleani in Italy. Berman speaks of the role of the leader, rushing from Italy's Mussolini to Spain under Franco and then inescapably to Hitler's National Socialism and Stalin's communism. No in-depth analysis is provided. Berman paints with a large brush, taking issues and immediately brushes them aside.Chapters 3 and 4 constitute the most interesting part of the book. Berman speaks of Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, and his admiration for the Nazis. He characterizes the Baathi and the Islamist movements as two branches of a single impulse: Muslim totalitarianism (p. 60), and then discusses in depth the scholarship of Sayyid Qutb whom he describes as the single most influential writer in the Islamist tradition, at least among the Sunni Arabs. The notion of Islam as totality, Berman ventures, is Qutb's most important concept, which distinguishes Islam from other worldviews. The Koran offers a way of life, and the proper understanding of its teaching can be achieved only in an atmosphere of serious struggle. Struggle against Judaism. Struggle against Christianity. Struggle against Greek philosophy. Struggle against Roman mythology. And, plainly, for different reasons, struggle against atheist Marxism as well as against tolerant, liberty-based liberalism.Terror and Liberalism contends that Islamic fundamentalism and Saddam Hussein's Baath socialism are morally, ideologically and historically continuous with the totalitarian movements of the 20th century; that fascism and communism both fed on liberals' resistance to comprehending the irrational nature of those movements; and that the same blindness is rampant today.The author, a long-time writer on and observer of American foreign policy who reported on many countries, including Nicaragua, Mexico, France, and the Czech Republic, thinks that September 11 did not come from a single man. Instead it was a product of the larger totalitarian wave, and the only proper response was to comprehend the size and depth of that larger wave, and find ways to begin rolling it back. Afghanistan and Iraq were only the beginning.In chapter 5, Berman unfortunately abandons the in-depth analysis and returns to the \\"wide paint strokes\\" methodology. He speaks of the Khomeini revolution in Iran, the Iran-Iraq War, the civil war in Algiers (1992-1997), terrorism in Israel, jihad in Sudan, the Lebanese civil war, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, leading to the emergence of Al Qaeda. For Berman Al Qaeda is not a conventional political movement but a \\"chiliastic movement\\" whose goal is to Caliphate the world (p. 116).The last two chapters of the book examine the failed peace process in the Middle East, and the attack on the United States. Here Berman provides platform to extraordinarily long quotes of criticisms of Israel (pp. 140-141) while explaining the success of suicide murderers. In his characteristic lively but insufficient rigorous prose Berman jumps from one issue to another, from one character to another, skimming through events like a thirsty butterfly: from Bill Clinton to Jose Bove; from suicide terror to the bloody fighting in Jenin; from Breyten Breytenbach to Jose Saramago to Noam Chomsky. Berman ends with a note on the gulf between the United States and Europe, arguing that European intellectuals no longer see these two forces as one, Atlantic civilization.The book contains many interesting ideas and is certainly thought-provoking. Terror and Liberalism is written in a dynamic prose. It is designated for lay people who are interested in the issue. It contains thoughts and speculations (in p. 143 Berman flatly writes: \\"I cannot prove this last explanation. My theory is sheerest speculation\\"). There are quotes but no references. Indeed, I was somewhat curious about Berman's sources, and their reliability. Many readers, I hasten to think, would appreciate some more information, especially when Berman writes in a blurry fashion that some passages in Qutb's writings have been misinterpreted \\"in some of the Western commentaries on Qutb\\" (p. 87), without supplying any details about the identity of those commentaries, and in what way did they misinterpret Qutb.At the end of the book, Berman included A Note to the Reader, in which he cited the principal sources that guided his thinking. This is a atypical way to provide references that I certainly do not endorse.Two final concise comments: Terror and Liberalism lacks Index. This is sorely missed. And the book has been translated into French, Italian, German, and Norwegian."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Everyone should read this book, but it should be required reading for the following:Those who believe the war on terror was fabricated in Crawford Texas.Those who believe our enemies are small in number and if we just rounded up Bin-Laden and Al-Queda the nightmare would be over.Those who believe that our invasion of Iraq created hatred towards America and the west.Those who can't believe that a large number of people living in the 21st century can value death over life, poverty over plenty and Fascist Theocracy over Liberalism.I have only one small complaint about this otherwise great book and that is Berman never clearly articulates how we should combat this \\"mass pathological movement\\".Buy \\"Terror and Liberalism\\", I promise you, you will gain a greater understanding of the great struggle were are currently in."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"The \\"liberalism\\" referred to in the title refers to a liberal society, a society that encourages individual freedom, debate and dissent, some separation of religion and government. Most of the Western world (US, Canada, Europe, etc.) consists of liberal societies; countries like Nazi Germany, the former USSR, or Saudi Arabia definitely are not.Berman links the anarchists and nihilists of the late 19th and early 20th century, to the political assassinations in Russia, Europe and the United States (one of which started World War I), through Fascism (Germany/Italy/Spain), Communism (Russia) and the Axis-aligned pan-Arabism of the Middle East, all the way to the current Islamic extremism. All of these movements have in common an obsession with suicide and murder.A lot of space is given to Sayyad Qutb's writings, and his unwillingness to accept liberal society, due to the limited influence of religion (any religion) therein. Instead, Qutb thought that all societies should be Shariah (Islamic) law. Secular Muslims (Ataturk) as well as non-Muslims (Jews and Christians, mostly) represented a threat to Islam and had to be dealt with--one way or another. Berman links the philosophies of Qutb to the actions of Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini, and Al Qaeda.An interesting point of view, although I'm not 100% convinced that everything can be so easily explained."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Well written & incisive. One of an agonizingly slow but increasing number of progressives who acknowledge the potent threat that radical Islam poses for the established democracies of the world. Berman,along with Sam Harris(THE END OF FAITH)& Dershowitz(A CASE FOR ISRAEL)stress the intractable violence,intolerance, & unremitting rage that Islam directs to our democratic way of life. Berman stresses the dark irrational cult of martyrdom & death that Islam has created about itself. He stresses that this is largely theological-with rational political concerns being secondary. He examines shared irrational apacalyptic traits of familar 20th century totalitarian movements such as Fascism, & Communism & their common prepensity for mass death. As is becoming increasingly evident,effective defence against radical Islam is as much a war of ideas as armed counter terrorism. The privileged & unchallenged status of religious systems which actively oppose secular society have to be critically examined & refuted as unacceptable. Unfortunately,Islam hasn't as yet been housebroken & neutered like Christianity has-even under our current American religious revival. It desperately needs to be. We can no longer afforf the luxury of shielding dangerous religious thought systems from critical analysis."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Through his book \\"Terror and Liberalism\\", Paul Berman has proven false old stereotypes and rhetoric as to the roots of Islamic Fundamentalism. It serves as a wake up call for both liberals and conservatives. He challenges us to put partisan politics aside and place focus on the real enemy...Islamic Fundamentalists who seek to destroy the world as we know it. As he points out, among Islamic Fundamentalists coexistence is not an option. They want to kill Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims. Through his book, he demonstrates that diplomacy is not an option with a group of people who value death over life. If you want corroborating evidence for his many arguments read the Koran. The true Muslim religion advocates violence, martyrdom, destruction of all sources of temptation, and an extreme desperation for seventh century religion. If nothing else he sheds light on the existence on the Anti-Christ amongst us."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Those authors who seem to lead the reader all over the place tend to ho-hum the reader into stopping from boredom or irritation - most of the time. This one is quite different, for a really heavy work, as it will be hard to find places to put the book down. The author does seem to lead the discussion all over the place, especially (and unfortunately!) in the beginning. Yet he develops and focuses his points within a reasonable enough number of paragraphs later to keep the thread going. The writing style is smooth, and even urbane, sometimes like the flow of those correspondents of the 1950's.The many serious reviewers seen on this Amazon website have captured the mains points Paul Berman makes through the book, so they needn't be repeated in detail here. Many of these reviews are well-written and thoughtful, and should be looked at before deciding to buy the book, or checked out from the library. Two general conclusions from Terror and Liberalism seem most important: (1) both left and right radicalism usually boils to the same nihilistic thing; and (2) ignorance of the \\"cult of death\\" end point for these radicals could harm us all.Only on two topics in particular does Berman seem oddly inconsistent: one is Israel and Zionism, and the other is George W. Bush. By the time the reader is done with the book, though, both can be taken into stride, and the author is forgiven."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"[...]Author Paul Berman does not speak directly about Iraq since during the writing of this book, the US had not really even began to talk about invasion. Berman speaks mostly of the justification of Afghanistan (which I incline to agree with him - but disagree that it has \\"worked\\" as an example of Classical Liberal liberation of an oppressed people. We should have finished the job before moving on to Iraq, but that is another topic all together). He points out how Saddam killed thousands of people over the years, and how liberals failed to see how bad it was out of fear of war. This is his assessment of how modern liberals have drifted far from their Classical Liberal roots.(A good summation of Berman's views on Iraq and modern liberalism in general can be found [...]Basically, Berman's argument is that Classic Liberalism has shaped 19th and 20th century liberals into spineless cowards. What Berman fails to recognize is that the Left is largely divided and typically only reconcile their differences when it comes to Bush and the current War on Terror. While claiming to be a Classic Liberal (a liberal who champions the poor and underclass of society), he defends the War on Terror (and less directly the war in Iraq).Berman does not address the vastness of the scope as to why Islamism developed in the first place (he does, however, say that this is a flaw of modern liberalism, that liberals always say things are more complicated than they are because they don't want to truly confront them). He does, of course recount the evidence of some of the more modern Islamic thinkers like Qutb, but he refrains from going any further back in history. Why did Qutb and his followers arrive at such a hatred of the West, surly not simply out the fear of secular dominance? There must be other issues, issues that have been boiling between the East and the West since the Crusades.Modern liberals, says Berman, are quick to point the finger back to the colonial West and its debacles in the Middle East. While Berman agrees that the West has fueled the fire for modern Islamism via botched colonialism, he fails to address how this historical conflict has metabolized in the modern Islamicist. While I will agree that the modern liberal will levy the entire burden of terrorism on the West's colonial past and more recent US foreign policy, I will not agree with Berman that the historical conflict between the Middle East and West had little to do with modern terrorism and totalitarianism. The history between the West and the Middle East has everything to do with it. We are a product of our history, good or bad, and it is that same history that shapes our actions today. Therefore, totalitarianism and Islamism are not simple death-cults that emerged via their black-hearted intent alone, they are responses to stimuli, and that stimuli, in part (but not entirely), are the result of our clash with the Middle East. This does not place the blame entirely on the West, but a finger must be turned back at ourselves, if only for moment, to see the entire picture.I think modern liberals and Classical Liberals, as Berman defines, would agree at least on the issue of helping the lower-class and the oppressed people of the world. Modern liberals are still very active in this matter domestically via social services. The rift seems to occur only on the issue of US foreign policy. Domestically, the answer is easy: if the poor, the homeless, and the abused children need help, then it is in the government's best interest to intervene to correct the problem. But if a child, or the poor are being abused abroad, then military action seems to be the only recourse available. The problem, I suppose then, is which military actions are \\"just\\" and which are not. This of course brings us to the Iraq issue where the liberal intent to free an oppressed people is mixed with the colonial intent of conservatism. The issue to invade/liberate Iraq instantly becomes a convoluted mess by trying to be two polar opposites. One cannot liberate a people by occupying them. One cannot offer freedom under marshal law. Berman is clear in his interpretation of the issue: yes, you can do both. Classical Liberalism, as he defines it, has the duty to stand up for the underprivileged of the world, and to do so by military action which is the only way he views will work. The irony here is that Berman fails to realize his own rhetoric, if liberation is only achievable by force, then Berman has in fact become the nihilistic leftist he so readily denounces. His actions as invader/liberator are similar, if not identical to that of the nihilist/anarchist: freedom must be delivered by force.Overall, I think Berman makes some strong points in regard to his assessment of modern liberals and how they view totalitarianism (whether it be in the form of Baathist, Nazis, or Islamicists). I think, however, that how to deal with these emerging totalitarian movements has yet to be determined. The issues are not so black and white as Berman would like to believe. There are many other factors that Berman leaves out. It is not simply a matter of whether or not tyranny exists, it is a matter of how did that tyranny develop, how can it be address (via militarily, diplomatically, etc), and how can we prevent it in the future."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Excellent book, suggesting that many extremists among us live in worlds of all my way or nothing. A suggestion of how to view the political orders from the just past century as well as an awareness for this coming century. What I also found constructive is the idea that extremeism can be most any political operation that seems to have it's own vision that excludes and names 'others' as being wrong.Fortunately those political operations he gives examples for are a mix of cultures. Certainly he engages the Middle East topic also.For example, he talks about the true Muslim religion supporting peace, respect and brotherly love and strongly notes that *only* the fundamentalist factions advocate violence, martyrdom, destruction of all sources of temptation, and an extreme desperation for seventh century religion. If nothing else he sheds light on the existence on the Anti-understanding amongst us, and gives all of us a new way to view some topics we are just now learning to understand."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"If you want to understand the never-ending conflict between Islam and the West, this book will educate you. Islamism is a key word many Americans do not know. Islam is the religion, Islamism is a political government whose laws are based on the Koran. An Islamist is one whose goal is to create God's will on earth as defined by the Koran basing government on the Koran's laws (called the Shariah) - the Koran becomes a Constitution. There are Islamists who want to bring this about by peaceful means (Moderate Muslims), and there are Islamists who want to bring this about by Holy War (Radical Islamists). While Moderate Muslims do not have our values coming from a very different culture we should still befriend them because that undercuts the power of the Radical Islamists. Both peaceful and violent Islamists though see the West as immoral (glorifying sexuality and nudity in culture, arts, movies and music, worshipping money and wealth, legalized gambling and pornography, alcohol and drugs, dancing, Capitalism and Consumerism). In their view the cause of all this immorality is Western Secular Democracy where government laws are not based on religion. Western Democracies say the individual should decide his/her religious and moral values, Islam says the government should enforce morality by moral police based on the Shariah (Koran's laws). Big difference. There is no way to reconcile this difference between the West and Islam.President Bush's solution is to bring democracy to the Middle East. Democracy though in the Middle East does not mean a secular democracy, but one based on the Koran such as in Iran. So President Bush is wrong when he says democracy is the answer in the Middle East because it will make us peaceful friends. Iran is a typical Islamic democracy based on the Koran and President Bush himself has called them one of the Axis of Evil. No Democrat or Republican can see living in a world where Iran has nuclear weapons.A Solution to the Middle East:1. Oppose Radical Islamists as we did in Afghanistan.2. Try to befriend and talk to Moderate Muslims.3. At least try to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although negotiating with Hamas is probably impossible there are Moderate Palestinians we can befriend and support.4. Don't impose democracy in the Middle East, we may just end up for our efforts with an Islamic State like Iran which hates us, or Iraq which is heading into civil war. Let the Muslims themselves decide on government.5. Try to influence any Muslim country such as Saudi Arabia to improve on human rights.6. Don't station any American troops permanently in the Middle East, just temporarily in emergency. We have troops in over 100 countries, why do we feel we have to police the entire world and then pay billions in taxes for it? How would you feel if you had say Egyptian troops in your state or city??7. Do everything possible to prevent a country like Iran from having nuclear weapons!"},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"I am serious. This is in my opinion the most important book I have read in a long, long time.Berman's book examines the symmetries between the World War II fascists and our present day threat: middle eastern totalitarian regimes. Enlightening and well researched. There are important comments on Islamic religious scholars.A must read."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Berman shows totalitarianism, its causes, and impact on society, in a way that leaves liberalism as a more reasonable and, in comparison, conservative solution. He describes \\"liberal\\" in the philosophical sense based on liberty. His point is that it is the liberal societies that have prospered in the last centuries and that have produced successes. On the opposite side, or maybe both sides, of this success have been extremes that by their very nature all are totalitarian. Connecting those extremes and particularly Nazism, Communism, and Islamic Extremism is made clearer by Berman's use of Albert Camus's book the Rebel.Camus shows that in a liberal society rebellion is expressed as skepticism and doubt but that process leads to freedom. Then in the world of terror, by contrast, there is no doubt or skepticism, only submission. Terror and totalitarian are one in the same. Camus shows that the society that demands submission then crosses into totalitarian and embraces nihilism as the only truth.Another author that in a very different way suggested that the struggle between individualism and collectivism was the key to understanding the difference between these totalitarian cultures was William Buckley's in his first literary success, \\"God and Man at Yale\\". Of course Berman doesn't mention Buckley, and may find the comparison troubling, but his book does find a lot of things that a conservative thinker would embrace. Berman's book seems to indicate that it is the same struggle reproduced on another level.His insight into the Islamic position, and why it's extremes present a threat, are most interesting."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"it's Nietzsche's \\"eternal return\\" but this time in terms of war-mongering, not self-loathing...

In his \\"Terror and Liberalism\\" he presents a cogent argument as to why liberal democracies need to fight Islamic terrorism more with arguments than swords. Human rights, women's rights, separation of church and state, a politics against racism and anti-semitism, a politics to fight oppression and poverty, a strong advocacy of freedom--these are the weapons (i.e., the liberal faith) needed to defeat totalitarianism whether from the right or the left. He calls this a \\"new radicalism.\\" This is a worthy cause and it is stated in limpid prose. Unfortunately, he says little about internal societal changes that need redressing and for which Western culture is criticized: rampant technology at odds with human values, pornography, militarism, racism, crass materialism, unilateralism, political corruption, etc. In short, he gives a masterful analysis regarding America's role in the international arena, but says little about America's need to put its own house in order. We need to be respected around the world, not only for our military power, but also for our ethical and moral values, including those related to liberalism. We should not be seen by the world as a barbaric nation, yet, for example, our continued use of capital punishment for murder smacks of the Middle Ages. Even our neighbors to the north, Canada, have moved beyond that antiquated moral position. In any case \\"Terror and Liberalism\\" is a well-written, thought-provoking book and well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This book is a rather strange, but quick read, that is much like a rice cake, plain, not much substance and unfortunately not satisfying.Mr. Berman tries to be a good leftist throughout most of the book, he makes broad sweeping statements that most everything that the left has done is good, and most everything the right has done is bad. Mr Berman has a \`through the looking glass' perspective of programs. If it works it was obviously a liberal idea and if it fails it was a conservative idea. For example he rallies along the false notion that Hitler was a right wing conservative, yeah right. Lets see, he was the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party (NAZI) and all one has to do is read Hitler's speeches to find out that he was a totalitarian socialist.The substance of the book though is the inescapable fact that there can be no peace with an ideological entity that believes you are evil and they have an edict to kill you. What is shocking to this reader is the naivet&eacute; that those on the left, especially the author posses. He shows just how immersed he is in his circles of left-ism that he and many others like him have left reality. Mr. Berman was shocked that 9/11 would happen, as a matter of fact he has the temerity to say that nobody imagined such an event. This viewpoint only shows the ignorance of the intelligentsia of the left, for there were many books, articles, and the plethora of attacks on the Unites States that preceded this act proved the threat that radical Islam posed for the world. Of course, the radical appeasement minded left pooh-poohed this notion and implied that this was the conservative ramblings of the war-mongering right.In the end Mr. Bearman gets it partially right, radical totalitarian Islam and the standard chamberlain-esque approach of appeasement does not work. Therefore at least this liberal writer has figured out that Islam with its goal of conquering the world is a dangerous construct. The two problems that Mr. Bearman never addresses are just how to convince others on the left that this form of totalitarianism is bad while their brand is good. And appeasement has never and will never work against a despotic dictator. Perhaps Mr. Bearman will continue to ponder these questions and come up with the answer. One can only hope so."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Okay, let me get this straight. We're right to fight against Islam, just not the way we're doing it? We should reason with them while we kill them? They're beyond reason and want us dead, but we should at least articulate our message?This is a good book, in that it examines Islamofascism and realizes that something has to be done about it. But it doesn't go far enough out of its inordinate dislike of the Bush Administration. The author seems to be saying that we at least need someone more palatable to liberals to make the case that this war on Terrorism needs to be fought. How noble.I can see his point, but I disagree. The hard left will always be opposed to war, and much of this book's reasoning seems to be an intellectual way to get the left on board. I.E. We can support the war as long as \\"we're waging it,\\" that is, we being liberalism. But he spends part of the book showing how liberals are incapable of recognizing threats, much less responding to them. Lots of luck.I doubt there is a liberal alive who could have accomplished the defeat of Iraq the way George W. Bush has, with as little loss of life on our side. Let me put it this way, this book has a rather petty point. As far as the Islamic world is concerned, I don't care if they're mad at us. I want them to fear us. Then maybe they'll leave us alone."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"I get pretty tired of hearing that Paul Berman is a liberal or a leftist. If his is, then he is a fifth-columnist. He supported Reagan's illegal wars in Central America in the 1980s for much the same reasons he now supports Bush's wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and all over the Muslim world. He does not understand Sayyd Qutb at all. Qutb did understand the US quite well. He was tortured and murdered by the CIA working through the Egyptian police. He wanted the CIA out of Egypt and he was right to think that. No one is an extremist for wanting foreign occupiers out of their country. Why Berman can't see this can only be attributed to his blind faith in the benevolence in American imperialism. Berman is just another apologist for American imperialism. No liberal or leftist would ever take that position. Berman is a right-winger."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"The whole theory behind this book is flawed. I think what Berman is talking about is one small part of a whole phenomenon that has manifested itself increasingly in the last few years, namely the phenomenon of religious Absolutism(i.e. Religious Fundamentalism). It exists increasingly in all major religions, i.e. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Jewish religions. Actually the so called war against terrorism is basically a war between manifestations of that absolutism in the U.S., The Arab/Muslim world, and Israel. The major problem, that we are facing is that Islamic religious absolutism, is a great recruitment for christian, jewish, and Hindu religious absolutism, and vice versa. Good and evil, Black and White, us and them, believers and non believers, chosen and non chosen people, are the common language used to express religious absolutism. If liberals and religious pragmatists cannot change this vocabulary, than we are in for some crazy times in this world."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Berman seems to consider Qutb, Tariq Ramadan and Bin Laden etc. to be part of the Islamist totalitarian movement(s). I am not sure he really gets the Islamists.He immediately advocats retaliation by the US for credibility's sake. Now, I am not a pacifist (too pragmatic for that principl) but attacking because that would make us a credible opponent sounds too much like bullies in schools.Overall, the book is bad. Ideas don't seem to be well-developed or are just plain bad. I think Berman is hindered by his lack of detailed knowledge of political Islam. Also, it would have helped if he had worked to make it a bigger and more intellectual book than the popular read it is. Berman tries to compare the Islamists with the totalitarian ideologues of the 20th century, i.e, the fascists and the communists. His contention is that there are lots of similarities between all these groups. For example, they all define both internal and external threats. This is fine as far as it goes but Berman does not go beyond a superficial level in his comparison. You have to take a lot of stuff on faith. How exactly is this similar to the fight against the communists? Berman never really does justice to this question. Plus he seems to know little about Islam and Muslims. Overall, a waste of time."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Paul Berman's *Terror and Liberalism* might very well be the first \\"great\\" book of the 21st Century, since it's probably the first book that really captures what the 20th Century was about, and what we have carried over into the 21st as unfinished business. But the book may not get the attention it deserves, because it isn't a very scholarly work. It manages to discuss totalitarianism without referencing Hannah Arendt even once, and it doesn't have so much as a minimal Index. What it has, instead, is a coherent thesis. Consider the following passage:\\"He [Albert Camus] had noticed a modern impulse to rebel, which had come out of the French Revolution and the nineteenth century and had very quickly, in the name of an ideal, mutated into a cult of death. And the ideal was always the same, though each movement gave it a different name. It was not skepticism and doubt. It was the ideal of submission. (p. 46)\\"This is an enormous insight, and to be frank it does not appear with such clarity in Arendt's work. Her explanation, that loneliness has become an \\"everyday experience,\\" seems grossly inadequate. Surely the notion that it's all a matter of loneliness appeals to a sense of profound irony, but couldn't we all just get a puppy? This was the payoff for all that scholarly zeal and industry?Moreover, Arendt never makes the connection between terror as an organizing principle for a 20th Century form of government, and terrorism as a strategy of totalitarian movements that are out of power. And so she did, in fact, miss something important.And of course even if Arendt had not completely missed the seeding of the Middle East with the totalitarian ideas of the Nazis and the Stalinist,s she never would have guessed that Islam itself could become the excuse for such a movement. She, herself, had been a product of the German Counter-enlightenment. Her mentor, Martin Heidegger, made a vain bid to become the philosopher of National Socialism, and would have succeeded had not the Nazis been too clever. So she has no excuse for missing the role that the Counter-enlightenment plays the writings of the Ba'ath founder, Michael Aflaq, and the Islamist founder, Sayyid Qutb.So if Berman lacks some background, he does manage to get to the heart of a matter that deflected more scholarly minds. And he stands as the first to make this leap. Even today people don't appear to see the connection between Jurgen Habermas' \\"Lifeworld vs. System World\\" typology, inherited from Husserl and Heidegger, and the philosophy of Qutb, which simply maps the same concepts into the religious framework of Islam. The insight that man had become alienated from his own nature, whether through the \\"false consciousness\\" of Marx or by our \\"deluded faith in the power of reason,\\" makes virtually the same diagnosis as Qutb. So it's not really that surprising for Arendt to identify loneliness (alienation) as the culprit. Of course, it had to be. There is not such a great distance, philosophically, between Qutb's \\"hideous schizophrenia\\" of modern life, and the nostalgic longing for the \\"Lebenswelt\\" that drives much of modern European philosophy.Liberalism did not evolve as a cure for the condition of man. It evolved as a cure for the tendency of mankind to become dogmatic. Hence it looks nothing like a cure for mankind's inherent ills. It doesn't regard mankind as \\"alienated\\" from himself. One side sees the human condition as tragically fragmented, and seeks a remedy in unity. The other sees the longing for a remedy as the problem, a compulsion to worry the patient to death.Berman reflects this insight in his critique of Noam Chomsky, whom he views as \\"the last of the 19th Century rationalists.\\" But this analysis, though informative, doesn't quite capture the slipperiness of Chomsky, whose philosophy is ultimately counter-rational. While Chomsky does, in fact, tend to see the world in the simplistic terms of a \\"greed vs. freedom\\" dialectic, his main problem is that he really has no program for calamity. Berman is probably more clear about totalitarianism than liberalism, which may be why his great book ultimately reaches a sort of impasse.Why is it the Americans who recognize the necessity? Why is the American faith that the sovereignty of others means security for themselves so exceptional? Why are the Americans so uniquely disinterested in perfecting mankind? Perhaps we need to be as canny as those Germans were, about communicating the antidote to their philosophies of \\"revolutionary nationalism and totalitarianism?\\"Ultimately Berman gets it. The problem lies in the habit of wishful thinking that afflicts most of America's historical allies, and some of its own deluded clan. Without any capacity to confront calamity the natural tendency is to deny it. Pretend it doesn't exist, or is an exaggeration and you need not change your worldview, or your mind. (But you may be obligated to hate the bearer of bad news.) Thus Chomsky's obsessive unwillingness to be impressed by 9/11, an attitude also affected by Michael Moore, and by Derrida and Habermas recently. And it's only this resistance to the horns of the dilemma that represents the impasse. How could there be any problem that can't be resolved by a trick of the tongue or the eye? Oh, I mean by revealing the tricks, of course. It was all just a trick of the eye that day in early September. Don't be alarmed.But thanks to Berman's eloquence we are able to see such pretense for what it is. We are at last able to perceive clearly the continuity of the beast that replaced chattel slavery as the world's consummate evil, and is destined to one day join it on the ash heap. It is alarming. But not beyond us...."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Paul Berman's \\"Terror and Liberalism\\" is an excellent attempt at finding common ground between America's political Left and Right, at least when it comes to the current \\"War on Terror.\\" Berman painstakingly shows Islamic fundamentalism for what it is, a mass political movement, actually the combining of two mass political movements - pan-Arabism (ie. the Baath party) and pan-Islamacism (ie. al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad) that are both devoted to violence and diametrically opposed to the Western Liberal tradition.Berman also argues that the Left in America has as much at stake in the \\"War on Terror\\" as do those on the Right.Paul Berman's historical research is excellent, following the path of the modern pan-Islamic movement to its roots with Sayyid Qutb (ku-tab) author of \\"In the Shade of the Qur'an,\\" \\"Social Justice in Islam\\" and other works. Qutb attended the Colorado State College of Education in the late 1940's and earned a Masters Degree, but came away thoroughly disgusted with what he saw as \\"the barbarous West.\\" He was especially disgusted by what the West hailed as \\"the emancipation of women\\" and \\"sexual liberation.\\"At the same time that pan-Islamacism was growing, pan-Arabism was coming into political prominence behind such figures as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. Though the differences between the two camps were subtle - pan-Arabists wanted a return of the old Ottoman Empire, while pan-Islamacists envisioned a world under shariah (the legal code of Islam) - they were also volatile. Berman describes the differences between the two groups as akin to the differences between the Italian fascists under Mussolini who sought to rebuild the Roman Empire and the German Nazis who sought a return to the Roman Empire in a Germanic form. Indeed the Arab world sided with the Axis powers during World War II, which led to England and the U.S. setting up the state of Israel in what was then the Palestine territories.In 1966 shortly after Colonel Nasser took power in Egypt, several attempts were made on his life. He blamed them on his alienating Qutb's group, the Islamic Brotherhood and had Sayyid Qutb hung in retribution. Still, despite their differences, the two factions have been bound by a hatred of Israel and the West that ignites their common passions.After delving into the history of pan-Arabism and pan-Islam, Berman takes on what he sees as a misguided view among many Western Leftists like Noam Chomsky, who've rationalized terrorism as the only possible response to Western oppression by less technologically advanced nations. People like Ramsey Clark and Noam Chomsky have defined Islamic fundamentalist terrorism as an appropriate response by a smaller opponent to a bully, while Berman sees it as a cataclysmic struggle between two conflicting ideologies, one rooted in individual liberty, the separation of Church and State, a love of technology and women's suffrage and the other one diametrically opposed to all of these things on virtually every level.\\"Terror and Liberalism\\" is an excellent book that not only gives the reader a broader understanding of the roots of fundamentalist Islam, but an insight into why so many on the American Left reflexively support any movement willing to take on the bully they see as America's \\"Military-Industrial Complex,\\" and why that view is not only wrong-headed, but dangerous as well."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"\\"Faith is propagated by counting up deaths every day, by adding up massacres and charnel houses.\\" So said an Algerian religious-political figure quoted by Paul Berman, whose effort here is to get people who believe in liberalism and liberal society to throw off the blinders of multicultural sensitivity and see and hear the real deeds and words and intentions of Islamic extremists as they call for our death and destruction. This small but powerfully reasoned book draws two inescapable conclusions:1) That \\"Islamic fascism\\" is not just a metaphor drawn from European culture (as one might speak in reverse of a French jihad against American fast food), but the actual importation of mid-20th century European fascism, with all the same characteristics as Nazism, Stalinism, Franco's Spain and other such movements: intolerance of any other way of life within its borders, an obsession with purity (which requires ever more total enforcement), the notion of a Gotterdammerung-style clash between the pure and the infidels, and last but not least, a virulent anti-Semitism which in some cases, such as that of a Nazi racial theorist who wound up on Nasser's payroll, is quite literally imported from Europe. The implication, clearly, is that Islamic fascism has to be broken just like European fascisms were.2) A willful blindness on the part of liberal society to recognize that our enemies really do say and think what they're saying and thinking. Both sides in politics still try to see rational motivations for what is in fact an irrational mass movement in love with death. The right, thanks to its business ties with the Saudis, is only slowly acknowledging how the terror really stems from those supposed friends and allies, since why would good business partners do such a thing? The left refuses to entertain the idea that events like 9-11 could have a maniacal religious motivation, since any blow against the US must, by definition, be part of the struggle of the oppressed against global capitalism, and therefore must be ultimately rational (and regrettable yet understandable, if not indeed downright admirable). (For a perfect example of how resistant the left is to criticism of the view that it's All About The U.S., read The Nation's review of this book, which spends most of its energy angrily attacking a couple of pages that skewer Noam Chomsky as the perfect exemplar of the Grand Unified Evil-America Theory of all history.)Whether it's an eye-opening (and far from unsympathetic) exegesis of the writings of the extremist author Sayyid Qutb, or a look at 1989, the year of democracy's supposed triumph, from the Islamic point of view (they saw it as their triumph over the infidel invading Soviets-- and were they entirely wrong?), Berman gives the facts underlying the news we read every day a new perspective. The good news is, liberal society did defeat fascism once, twice, multiple times. The bad news, the fight almost always started later than it should have, and long after someone like Berman had made it clear that a Mein Kampf-- and a Hitler-- really meant what he said."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This is a wake-up call for liberals who would like to pretend that radical Islam does not present a serious threat to the West. There are many good things in this wonderfully well-written book. Berman's explication of the ur-myth of totalitarianism (left or right) is very good. His summary of Sayyid Qutb's thought is the best description of the fundamental ideas of Islam that I have ever read; the theological basis of Islamic antipathy to the idea of separation of religion and the state is very nicely conveyed. Berman's account of the failure of the French Socialists in the 1930s is merciless, and he dismantles Noam Chomsky's simple-minded worldview in three pages. That latter is worth the price of the book by itself.On the negative side, Berman's orientation is a bit too literary for my tastes. For example, I think he forces his theme of irrationality where it really doesn't fit. The totalitarian programs he talks about seem to have two major characteristics, (1) an enormously ambitious goal (remaking society, conquering the world, etc.), and (2) utter amorality in selecting the means of achieving that goal (no compunctions about massive slaughter). However destructive such programs are, there is nothing necessarily irrational about them. The one movement he talks about that does seem to be truly irrational is the Palestinian suicide bombing murder spree, in which those actions have no apparent connection to any specific political goals. Berman can also be careless in selecting examples to buttress his argument. Athens and the Roman Republic were not fragile little republics surviving only in benign circumstances, until \\"popped like bubbles by marauding armies from afar\\". Athens became a predatory and expansionist power, its eventual decline traceable to a failed imperial war to conquer Syracuse. The Roman Republic was never conquered, but underwent a transition to imperial government due to the pressures of maintaining far-flung provinces and armies; it became the Roman Empire, hardly a bubble pop. And Pancho Villa launched an invasion of New Mexico, not Texas."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"...Even long before the end of the Cold War, intransigent liberalism which actually stood for non-negotiable moral and political values had died. Today there are few liberal equivalents of Rush Limbaugh, a notable exception being Camille Paglia and now, in his magnificent Book, Terror and Liberalism, Paul Berman. Berman is a no nonsense liberal who writes from a profound moral center. He cares about human dignity and clearly does not assume any less of a humanity for strangers and Others than he does for himself. He is the real leader of the revolution among a small cadre of liberals who would properly see the eradication of all thugs and criminals decked out in military fab and exploiting de facto sovereignty who claim to represent the will of the people; and further, hold our government accountable for their moral hypocrisy in supporting right wing dictatorships so long as they do not pose a threat to economic national self-interest, but castigate those on the left who are just as vicious in their human rights violations. If our government stands for democracy and freedom then we ought to demand that it behave in a morally consistent manner and adopt an ethical foundation to its foreign policy.Terror and Liberalism is a book rich in historical detail and analysis, and, indirectly, a profound work in political morality. As a liberal I found myself frustrated when the Taliban came to power in 1996 because few of my fellow liberals seemed willing to condemn those primitive trolls for the cruel form of gender apartheid they inflicted on millions of Afghan women. Why aren't liberals marching in the streets to condemn the corrupt Saudi regime and its medieval conception of women or the barbaric practice of tearing out a woman&#65533;s vulva and clitoris thereby denying her for her entire life, the ability to experience sexual pleasure...I am thoroughly delighted that Berman&#65533;s book sets the moral case for why any free and democratic country not only has a moral responsibility to export liberal democratic virtues on behalf of its fellow citizens of the world, but to invade and topple with complete rectitude any illiberal country governed by despots whose gross disregard for the basic rights of their citizens fall below an acceptable moral decency threshold. Leaders of countries who violate sovereignty--which incidentally is not an absolute but that, ever since its initial inception after the Treaty of Westphalia, has always been subjected to constraints of justice--are in essence nihilists who must be subjected to the best of moral and political paternalism that liberalism has to offer.Berman is brave enough to show that the agonistic hand ringing and \\"oh, let's continue talking,\\" prevalent among spineless liberals are empty gestures which political thugs and savages take advantage of. I say three cheers for a liberal who is morally sensitive to the plight of our fellow world citizens who lack meaningful third party international coercive institutions to assume the default duty of protecting their rights when their leaders have failed to uphold them.Berman is correct. We must continue exporting democratic liberal values, values that treat people as ends in themselves and that affirm the dignity of reason in all, values that give people some share in the making of laws that govern their destiny.A real Moral Imperialism based on indispensable political values found in liberalism is the way to go. Those who don't want the same political luxuries for others that that they enjoy are bigots and mere social ballasts. Many of the backward so called nation/states of the world, politically speaking, exist in a state of savage adolescence. Berman's fine book demonstrates that the best of liberalism is a way of re-socializing those who have never had their moral and political sensibilities forged in its civilizing crucibles.Jason D. Hill"},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Phenomenal book!! Berman explores the failure of the left to recognize totalitarianism throughout the twentieth century and believes that the failure continues to the present day. Once again, the European left and the American left refuse to recognize the existence and threat of totalitarianism (the Arab version) in both its Islamic and Baathist forms.Berman notes that Bush has failed to articulate a case for war in Iraq (because he is fundamentally inarticulate), but insists that liberalism itself requires that we defeat totalitarian mass murderers including Sadaam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, because of our commitment to freedom and tolerance for all people, not simply for ourselves."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This book is a thoughtful, thorough and insightful study of totalitarian thought. Berman writes convincingly of his opinions and thoughts on totalitarian and how it is related to the Islamist movement that is raging through the Middle East. He writes about how the current Islamist movement came to being and why. He tells of the reasons why bin Laden is fighting the war against us ~~ not because we're greedy corporate Americans but because we are a threat to his and his people's vision of utopia. He also delves into the Israel and Palestine's problems. He also explains the history behind communism, facism, and socialism. Berman also talks about Western Europe and their ideas on democracy as well as United Nation's ineptness in dealing with different problems.This is perhaps one of the most rewarding reading I've done lately. I don't know much about Islam and what causes Muslims to declare a jihad against Westerners. Then again, I don't know much about the history of the last fifty years or so. And this book has whetted my appetite to know more and how liberalism is related to the current events going on today, even with the Bush's administration. It is also a great way to learn more about the Islamist movement that is going on in the Middle Eastern countries as well as Arabic countries. It is an eye-opener for me and it does help me understand current events better.This is one book that I will definitely pass onto my friends and family. I think everyone who is curious about world affairs and likes essay-type writing, will enjoy this book. It will provoke thought and conversation among your friends and family. It will help you see the world in a different light, even if you don't agree with the author's perspective. But he makes his arguments in a convincing way ~~ and the book is easy to read, very well-written and with thoughtful, concise reasoning behind every word.7-15-04"},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Paul Berman was a major figure in the \\"New Left\\" of the 1960s. Like a few other prominent leftists, he sees Islamic terrorism not as a blow against injustice or inequality but as an attack on the liberal order. In this book he delves deeply into the life and thought of the Islamic scholar Sayyid Qutb, whose writings have provided the intellectual foundation for a number of the radical Islamic movements. Berman advocates aggressive action by America and the Western nations, not based on the political \\"realism\\" favored by many on the right, but to foster a more liberal order in the Middle East. He criticizes the naivete of the left, which insists on seeing the conflict between radical Islam and the West through the prism of strong vs. weak, or oppressors vs. the oppressed"},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Paul Berman is what one could fairly describe as a thinking man's pundit, unafraid of alienating either his more sympathetic supporters from the left, and sometimes drawing praise and agreement from the conservative right. The author of many provocative and thought-inspiring essays, Berman found himself surprised and befuddled by the turn of events on 911, which he watched with dismay from his perch on his apartment house roof in Manhattan. Quite quickly he became much more aware of the radical threats pulsing through the city as, for example, a Yemeni cleric was indicted and subsequently convicted of laundering and forwarded tens of millions of dollars to Al Quaida.In \\"Terror And Liberalism \\" he turns his penetrating wit and intellectual powers to a consideration of the nature of, and threats emanating from, what he has come to describe as \\"Islamic Totalitarianism\\" Far from flying with the angels of either the right or the left, Berman indicates understanding the rise of such radical organizations requires abandoning these kinds of simple dichotomous paradigms, and in examining the ways in which the terrorism of the 21st century finds its roots in the violent and reactionary movements of the 20th century. Berman shows how the recent episodes of terror committed by such Islamic groups finds its origins in a continuation of the historical struggle between reactionary fascist and totalitarian groups such as the Nazis on the one hand, and the Soviet, Chinese and Cuban communists on the other against the entrenched liberal cultures of the Western democracies.Seen in this perspective, self-described Islamic fundamentalist groups like Al Quaida and Hamas are less the exclusively pure religious rejections of the Christian West as they are a violent and ultimately secular ideology camping under the tent of a highly bastardized Islamic fundamentalism that finds its rage and purpose by rebelling against what they see as the \\"hideous schizophrenia\\" of modern society. This is all documented in a relatively obscure set of voluminous texts written by Egyptian scholar and intellectual Sayyid Qutb and entitled \\"In The Shade of the Qur'an\\", which Berman believes provides the theoretical underpinnings of the Islamic totalitarian movements now assailing the West.So, while Berman admits the philosophical musings of Outb to be sophisticated, intellectually profound, heartfelt and deeply nuanced, he also finds reason to criticize the more radical interpretation which spokespersons for radical Muslim fundamentalism such as Saddam Hussein or Osama Bin Laden approach the kind of crypto-fascist critique of post-modern Western societies, and indeed now constitute the same sort of grave threat to the continuation of our culture. Arguing quite persuasively, Berman posits that the radical forms of Islamism and Baathism (which is the variation of Islamic thought that ideologically propels Saddam Hussein's former ruling party) stem from the same kind of reactionary counter-revolution against the rising forces of liberalism that a century ago created the conditions for the First World War. Therefore, he argues, we must marshal our resources to combat this ideological challenge that such violent ideologies arising within the Muslim world today.This makes great sense in trying to piece together a workable strategy for working through the issues and concerns being raised by our interventions in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and will give rise, Berman believes, to a more sophisticated and comprehensive world view than those offered in the overly simplistic liberal or conservative frames of reference in current vogue. He suggest perhaps amore enlightened liberalism will recognize, just as FDR did at the outset of World War Two, that there is great merit in rising to the international challenge and combating the tyrannical forces of radical Islamic totalitarianism. This is a terrific book, and one that will stretch and prod those old brain cells into active work. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"I am on the Left of the American political spectrum, an unrepentant liberal. I am also an admirer of Howard Dean, both before and after the Democratic primary, but I agree with Paul Berman that President Bush is absolutely correct about the seriousness of the terrorist threat -- and he is right to identify a key source of that threat with all fundamentalisms and fanaticisms, political or religious, wherever they arise. In recent years, the threat has come primarily from Islamic fundamentalists, but we have our share of fanatics as well.Neither one of us is a great admirer of all aspects of the President's policies, yet we cannot claim that Mr. Bush is wrong about EVERYTHING, only some things. He may be wrong about tax cuts, perhaps, but he sure is right about the gravity of the terrorist menace.This is a well-written and shrewd assessment of Mr. Bush and the problem of terrorism -- which should be required reading for liberals, who are too often blinded by considerations of \\"political correctness\\" and fail to admit what is staring them in the face: Terrorism in our world is evil and it is coming, primarily, from a small number of people in the world who are unwilling to compromise.Terrorism will require drastic action from the free world to crush it; and it will not be a pleasant or fun experience waging this war upon international terror that is hurting everyone, including many good and decent Muslims who also wish for peace for their children -- a war in which intelligence services will play a crucial role and in which, right-wingers should note this, civil liberties must be protected.Berman's recent book about the intellectual legacy of the sixties and even his introduction years ago to the collection of materials on the debate over political correctness with respect to the academic curriculum, \\"Debating P.C.,\\" are excellent too.My advice: Read everything by this guy."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Terror and Liberalism is a well written book which highlights how totaliterianism in the form of islamic religous extremists dtill poses a threat to the world. This book should be read by all liberals even if they opposed the war to show them how this extremism is a threat to liberal society. Berman is a skillful writer who makes his points very eligantly,he even successfully cuts noam chomsky down to size and points out how his views of the world which are shared by many left-wing people are fundamentaly flawed. This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Paul Berman's Terror and Liberalism is a wonderfully written little tome. The prose is poetic and emotive and makes for an engrossing read.Berman's thesis is that contrary to what Fukuyama has said, the Twentieth Century is decidedly not over. The Western totalitarian regimes that took root after World War I in Europe may all have been vanquished, but their Eastern counterparts-namely radical Islamism and Baathi pan-Arabism-are still around and becoming more dangerous. He draws striking parallels between the different ideologies and finds that their main intersection is a rejection of liberal thought and society.Apart from this interesting idea, the great value of this book is its brilliant explanation of radical Islamist philosophy and its origins. Less inspiring is one of Berman's key premises: that all totalitarian systems-including Islamism-incorporate a cult-like mass death wish. Although this behavior might be self-evident from history, he doesn't seek to explain it. He merely chalks it up to human irrationality and proclaims that liberalism's failure is not accepting that masses can act outside of reason.Perhaps I'm just too liberal, but he didn't convince me. I also find it ironic that after criticizing liberals for desiring neat, little explanations for everything, it is in fact such a tight package that he presents in this book. But Berman must be given credit for being an honest (and consistent) leftist. Unlike his pacifist brethren, once he spies an illiberal, nihilistic, totalitarian menace half-way around the world, he wants to destroy it with government's might.Berman applauds the invasion of Iraq, but not its justification. He prefers preemptive war in the name of Wilsonian internationalism over a realist response to an actual threat. To me this seems like pax Americana under another name. We can invade and impose our values abroad, Berman seems to say, as long as we impose the \\"right\\" values."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Berman asks the question of how those with liberal values can descend into support of some of the least liberal dictatorships on the planet. He shows the way Hitler eventually obtained support from the majority of the French Socialists and how Arafat has managed to do even better. This book is an eye-opener and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Terror and Liberalism starts off by discussing what I have always believed was an obvious truth but have never heard another author talk about. That being that the left and right edges of the political spectrum are not endpoints on a line but in fact the link of a full circle. Fascism and Communism meet at totalitarianism. Paul Berman maps out a template for totalitarian dictators like Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Franco. To this list he adds Saddam Hussain and his Baathist Socialist Party which combines ideas from both ends of the political spectrum including admiration for both the Soviet Union and Hitler. Berman mentions that there was a time within the 20th century when 30 percent of the people in Baghdad were Jewish. Hitler's anti-Semitism has had an obvious influence. The Islamist movement is a similar co joining of the extreme left and right meeting at totalitarianism.One writer that Berman spends a lot of time talking about is Sayyid Qutb, an Islamist philosopher who was put to death in Egypt back in 1966. Qutb wrote about the erosion of Islam due to the influence of Western secularization. His desire was to see a pure Islamic state created with the reinstatement of shariah laws. He hated the Jewish Zionists and Christian Crusaders and his basic goals seemed to mirror the goals of Bin Laden and Khomeini as if perhaps they were influenced by his writings. Qutb saw the pure Islamic state as a liberal utopia which seems, to a western mind, incompatible with his desire for seventh century justice including public stonings, severed limbs and a totalitarian law that applies to all public and private behavior. These Islamists have sunk into a pathological state creating a \`cult of death' where philosophers and leaders revel in killing for the sake of killing. They see blood as purification. The bombshell is that these kind of nihilistic views are nothing new. They are no more violent that the writings in France during the Terror or Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia or the British occupiers of Africa where blacks were killed for seemingly no purpose besides performing the act. Berman argues that this cult of death is very much influenced by western philosophy and the results of WW I and II.The author spends some time showing his admiration for the Bush administrations desire to improve the lives of women in Afghanistan as well as spreading Democracy to the Middle East. I was a worried that Berman was being nave but he redeems himself completely in the last chapter. Bush's talk of spreading freedom and democracy and women's rights is a very liberal stance so why are liberals not cheering? As Berman points out the problem is that this is diametrically opposite of Bush's past views. He was never concerned about women's rights and went on record stating that he was against nation building. He even implied that if given the choice he would have stayed out of the Balkans. So how does a man unmoved by genocide suddenly decide to spread liberalism to the Middle East particularly since he so enjoys denigrating liberals? This cuts to the heart of the matter. Bush is a realist masquerading as an idealist although I question whether his reality matches the reality of our planet. The Daily Show did a segment on Bush's 2004 acceptance speech and counted the incredibly high number of times Bush used the words freedom and liberty. Believing in freedom, democracy and liberty are all well and good but if you continue to support repressive regimes it shows you are working in bad faith. You can't support Saudi Arabia, a monarchy and one of the worst offenders of human rights in the world, and claim to be spreading freedom and democracy. Bush recognizes Pakistan as a Democracy despite the fact that General Pervez Musharraf took over in a military coup and has never had a legitimate election. Working with allies based on strategic interest is fine but it cuts against Bush's idealistic moral rhetoric. He's working in bad faith which may work with American's who suck up his glittering future but not so well with foreigners who recognize the hypocrisy of his words.Ultimately the problem of terrorism needs to be addressed on both sides of the political spectrum. Liberals need to recognize that even with putting the violence aside for a moment the Islamist movement remains a racist, sexist, and bigoted movement with desires to create a theocratic totalitarian society. It is the opposite of liberal social ideals. Half a century ago many liberals made the mistake of defending Communism. The Islamist movement is undeserving of any liberal sympathy. The right needs to stop promoting unilateralism, preemptive strikes and excursions into fantastic nation building as in Iraq and start working in good faith."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This book is a wonderful short tour of twentieth century totalitarian ideology and its similarities to current Muslim extremists. It traces the flow of ideas in Europe, especially Germany, to Egypt and the Muslim Brotherhood, and on to Saudi Arabia, Al Qaeda, The Taliban, and Iran.Berman's successful identification of this common thread of ideas reveals that dictators of today and the recent past in Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan are using Islam as a stepping stone to power in the same way that the Nazis used race and the Communists used class - they all ruthlessly killed their enemies and quieted dissent at any cost. According to Berman, the real object is power, and the real problem is totalitarianism - whatever form it may take. His solution to this totalitarian monster is classical liberalism and the free exchange of ideas.Does he explain every detail of exactly how the ideas change as they flow? No, and this is not because his understanding is simplistic. His intended audience is an educated audience, which is at the very least moderately familiar with the history and philosophy discussed.It is a short book, and in some places incomplete. For instance, totalitarianism did not begin in the twentieth century - see the Inquisition and the slaughter of the Cathars, and on and on back into history - it did however, seem to become larger and more terrifying after the rise of 19th century liberalism and the great disaster of World War I. However, this does not take away from its central thesis about totalitarianism, and that our defeat of it abroad will make us safer at home. Petty squabbling (no pun intended) over ideological and political toes stepped on cannot and do not take away from this powerful central argument."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This book is one of the better books that has been written about todays affairs.

This is a worthwhile read. Berman cites the notion that the 20th century began in 1914 and ended in 1989. He disagrees with the notion and goes on the assert that the 20th century continues unabated. I interpret the larger part of his point to be that humankind continues to hanker after the \\"final solution\\", and that the more massive the notion and the more all-inclusive it may be, the better. Marxist-Leninist communism, Hitler-Mussolini-Franco fascism have bit the dust and now Islamism as interpreted by Sayyid Qutb represents the final, final solution solution. I am reminded of the only memorable and useful remark the Nazi Goebbels ever made, \\"Every time I hear the word \\"culture\\", I instinctly reach for my pistol.\\" Cynical though it may be, he has a good point.Do avail yourself of this slender book.

Some folks in the executive branch of the U.S. government think the end of the world is near. Communism is dead, but a lot of folks on the left don't get it. My wife is a Quaker and a pacifist. I dont believe in ISTs or ISMs. What's a free-thinking left-of-center guy to do?!? I strongly recommend the thoughtful reader start with the learned musings of Paul Berman in his extended essay Terror and Liberalism. Berman finds himself in a position where he can't agree with a lot of what he hears from either the left or the right. After a detailed examination of many of the issues that impact the current war on terror and America's effort to extend liberal democracy around the world both directly and peripherally, Berman calls for a liberal American interventionism. I didn't agree with everything Berman says and at times the book seemed a little too stream-of-consciousness, but it made me think in ways that I had hoped for. Jump-start your thinking with Paul Berman's Terror And Liberalism."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"I found the most important insight in this work the grouping of radical fundamentalist Islam with Nazism and Communism as Totalitarian terror movements. The fact that this understanding is developed by someone who comes from the Liberal Left, a time when so much of the Left has gone in direction of extreme distancing from any vision of this kind , makes the work to my mind especially valuable.What Berman dares to see is that the United States is not as painted by many of the extreme Left in Iraq out of a colonial urge but rather , whether unsuccessfully or not, out of the countering of a real enemy.Radical Islamic Fundamentalism takes more than one form, whether from Wahhabite Sunni inspiration or from Tehran's Shiite variety, whether through Bin- Laden's Al- Quaeda or from the 'Iraqi insurgents of Zarqhawi. But the threat to the whole fabric of world- civilization is very real indeed.It seems to me that this book might be a tremendously valuable one to those from the truly liberal left, who might come to see where the real threat to our civilization is coming from."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Here's a typical example of why Berman's book is not just politically reactionary, but worthless: There's a nine-page put-down of Noam Chomsky, primarily for the latter's response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but also for other things Chomsky has said, on topics ranging from Cambodia to linguistics. And in these nine pages, there's not a single actual quote from Chomsky! (By the way, since Berman's book not only contains no footnotes but no index either, I'll tell you that the anti-Chomsky screed starts on page 144.)Most of Berman's other attacks on leftists also contain either no quotes or short quotes (usually not even full sentences) without citations that would allow the reader to locate the context of the quote.Berman does extensively quote certain Islamist writers (though again without citations). This makes me think that he knows that Islamist ideas (or at least the ones he quotes) will, unlike leftist ideas, not appeal to those he is trying to win over to his position, which is essentially support of Western capitalism in general and Israel in particular.Those who are looking for a balanced refutation of both Islamism and its Western imperialist pseudo-opposition would be much better served by starting with Tariq Ali's &quot;The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity&quot; (ISBN 185984457X)."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Despite a fair summary of Qutb and a few critical comments about Sharon, Berman defends aggressive attacks on the \\"enemy\\". The book and thesis are essentially sophomoric simplification that seems to have impressed (from plaudits printed inside) numerous other unqualified readers who know the subject no better. It meets emotional needs for some but adds no depth of understanding..The thesis is a defense of aggression based on little more that Pop Psychology about totalitarianism and \\"suicidal\\" violence - referring to Camus but lacking his broader understanding. Broad categories and labels are grotesquely inaccurate lumping Islamic Fundamentalists together and describing them as Fascist and Totalitarian. There is considerable diversity in the real world with some ready to participate in elections, and most who are not terrorists. Many are concerned almost exclusively with their own homelands. In the case of Iraq a secular, anti Fundamentalist, enemy of Al Qaeda was the US target. Consider too that there are proportionally probably more Christian Fundamentalists in the US than Muslim ones outside Saudi and Afghanistan. The history (including questionable conclusions describing the fall of France to the Nazis as solely from \\"liberal/socialist\\" lack of backbone) and psychology (sex, suicide, and totalitarianism are a syndrome) are not valid. They do, however, serve as propaganda demonizing Muslims in support of US and Israeli state counter terror. Again they provide a reason to avoid looking at the real issues and grievances resulting from those policies or the essential source of terror training and broad contacts from the CIA and ISI trained alumni of the Afghan-US war against the Soviets in Central Asia. (These are the folks whose leaders trained in the US and who were called, like the Contras, \\"the moral equivalent of our founding Fathers\\" by Reagan!) At least Berman's book it is not quite the insult to one's intelligence as explaining 9-11 by \\"they are jealous of our freedoms\\" but it is just as muddled thinking and equally motivated by propaganda rather than serious analysis - just this time for a book rather than a sound bite."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"It is all too obvious: Berman tags Muslim fundamentalist movements as \\"Communist\\" and \\"Nazi\\" and uses that to justify the brutal invasion and occupation of defenseless countries like Afganistan and Iraq.While Saddam's regime in Iraq was certainly brutal, it was not nearly as brutal as the USA/UN sponsored sanctions regime or the two Bushes' criminal wars. Berman does not once mention either the sanctions or the Allied war crimes in Iraq. The war, as predicted, has fueled anti-Americanism and bolstered fundamentalist movements, and terrorist attacks against United States citizens are at a 20-year high. So then, why does Berman ignore the facts, that the Iraq War is bad for the Iraqis, and bad for the Americans? Simply because the facts point in the wrong direction. So he prefers to confine himself to the lofty areas of intellectual thought, and support war based on the shortcomings of leading Arab scholars.But ignoring the facts still is not enough, Berman needs to rely on unnamed sources (there are no footnotes) and distort the arguments of others to support his cause. His discussion of the Israel-Palestine conflict is heavily biased in favour of Israel and relies on slight-of-hand and outright deception. He claims that Arafat terminated negotiations, but it was in fact Barak (in Taba 2001). Like every pro-war intellectual he slanders Chomsky by claiming that Chomsky ignores the evils of 9/11, Milosevic, Osama bin Laden, and Saddam Hussein. Whereas in fact Chomsky has repeatedly condemned the 9/11 attacks, Milosevic, bin Laden and Saddam. He also completely misrepresents the writings of Saramago and Breytenbach, and basically anyone he quotes in this book.If you really want to know the real story of the Iraq War, look up Tariq Ali's book. This one is just a waste of money."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Probably the reason Paul Berman doesn't write about good &quot;Third Force&quot; alternatives is because there aren't any. It's just a dirty deal that probably won't get done."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Paul Berman's attempt to make a case for war on Iraq is based on anecdotal evidence that so far has not been borne out.The first part of the book is his attempt to \`prove' he is a liberal.Sir, I really don't care if you are a zebra. You were co-opted by the conservatives you so despised. What a fool!Berman's arguments for war are based on discursive \`facts' and hearsay. His arguments for a liberal regime in Iraq are also faulty. And his discussion of 'terrorism' fails to convince.Right now, you are probably very disconcerted how things have turned out (no WMD) but your rationale (\`but Sadam was a WMD.') is a weak case for a first strike.Leave this book for the political science class of 2053 as they try to make \`sense' of the Iraq War and how \`rational' people could have supported such a lark."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"I am not going to spend the time and effort to discredit this obvious neo-con view of the Middle East, but merely to identify it as such.

If you want to read more than you already have about the neo-con view of things on this subject, you may want to pick up this book; otherwise, it is a poor choice."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This book is totally out of line, the author seems to me too extremist and biased with his statist and reactionary view. Even the government admits that there are no dangerous weapons in Iraq, the so called WMDs war is not about religion fundamentalism or to fight religion-terrorism but about oil. Another of the author's labeling is to equally label all progressive movements as terrorists. He places all communists and leftists along the line with criminals, fascists, nazis, and extremists. This is a Ronald Reagan, Churchill, Mussolini type of statist and reactionary language used by neo-cons think-tanks to destroy opposite views. We have to point out that religion have always been used by empires and states to rule people. Religion and religious language is used by governmnets to fool and opiate the masses into wars and the government agendas. Another wrong point i see is that there was no physical evidence of the link between the events of 9-11, Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden. The author bases himself on absolute blind faith instead of sound arguments backed by credible evidence, he even bashes the award winning literary professor Noam Chomsky. So do your self a favor, don't believe the corporate-media, the reactionary writters and think for yourself first, question the authorities and what they tell you through the media, books, etc."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This book is nothing but rubbish directed against intellectuals and thinkers to counter the so-called Islamic threat. Mr. Berman tries to convince his readers that the Islam teaches terrorism and hate, but he does not want to be in the same pot as Salman Rushtie, so he hides behind Syyed Qutb (may God be pleased with him). Syyed Qutb gave his life to tell the TRUTH and spread to all the humanity. It is too bad that Mr. Berman has chosen to turn his back from God and justice.

Berman does a wonderful job of laying out some of the internal battles facing the West in first defining what it is we are at War with.Definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Terror and Liberalism is a very interesting book. The author starts out by citing his leftist credentials in a chapter attacking Nixon, Kissinger, and George Bush (the elder) for their treatment of Iraq in the first Iraqi war. Then he goes to provide an analysis of the rise of a series of nihilistic popular mass movements that are a direct attack against the liberalism of the western civilizations. In this series he places Communism, Fascism, Nazism, and the current version: Islamism.The book provides a chilling description of how easy it is for liberals to fall under the sway of such movements by pointing out the ominous parallels between France's descent into supporting the Nazis during World War II and Europe's currenct descent into blaming Israel for the Islamist problem.Whilst the book's analysis is first rate and is measured in tone and backed up by formidable research, I was left a bit dissatisfied. The vast majority of the book is taken up with the analysis but I would have liked to have seen, and expected, some sort of reasoned approach to a solution. And that, is sadly lacking in this book. There are a few paragraphs that airily talk about having a \\"third way\\" but not anywhere near the substance of how to create it to combat the current evil.So, that is why I slightly downrated this book. However, it is a very thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Berman gives a lucid account of irrational mass movements, from the West and Middle East, and shows how these rancid ideas flow from one part of the globe to the other, with great fluid power because in part the ideas of hate and nihilism, in whatever guise, are born from the same psychology. In addition to his clear analysis of irrational mass movements, Berman shows how \\"rationalists,\\" whether they be liberal or conservative thinkers, are in great error when they try to come up with some coherent theory or absolute explanation to answer the question: \\"Why do terrorists do what they do?\\" Berman shows that there is no rational answer, no victimization that can account for such evil acts of nihilistic theater and rage. He shows that this dark impulse is aroused by several unsavory factors, egotism, a lust for death, and a fear of freedom.A great companion to Terror and Liberalism is Eric Hoffer's The True Believer, which, written 50 years ago, provides a thorough analysis--often in sharply polished epigrams--of those \\"true believers\\" who follow irrational mass movements."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Paul Berman is a gift to those liberals like me who are opposed to the war in Iraq, yet know that it has to potential to be a great event and blessing for the people of Iraq and the Middle East.Throughout the book Mr. Berman, a liberal who does not like George W. Bush at all, details the history of caring, good, intelligent men and women, who, in their desire to oppose war have actually allowed evil dictators and countries to gain power and spread their evil to other countries.-Those on the left who supported Stalin until he finally turned on them.-The Socialists in France who tried to ignore Hitler and the evil growing in Germany- Those who now oppose war in IraqBerman does not say that opposing war in Iraq is a bad thing. Instead, he feels that the energy used to opposed the war should instead be used to support the people of Iraq and helping them spread liberal democracy across the Middle East.I am no fan of the Bush administration, and I think its attempt at diplomacy was embarrassing and will have negative repercussions in the future. Removing Saddam Hussein will benefit the entire World, but through shear incompetence and inability to articualte a coherent message, Bush managed to turn almost everyone against the idea. A sad time in history.Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Terror and LiberalismIt seems like most every generation of progressives undergoes a brutal test of faith. The Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of 1939 was too much for many; Khrushchev's 1956 speech denouncing Stalin and his invasion of Hungary the same year were the last straw for others. For the present crop, 9/11 is in the process of separating the lockstep lefties from the genuine friends of humanity. Which way will Paul Berman, the author of _Terror and Liberalism_, break?It is refreshing to hear an unequivocal condemnation of both Islamist terrorism and progressive anti-semitism from a non-silly Leftist. The first time I ever encountered the writings of Paul Berman was in the late Eighties, during his jousts in _The New Republic_ with David Horowitz and Peter Collier, over the latter duo's book _Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts About the Sixties_. Now here comes this book, which hardly seems like the work of the same thinker. I haven't been paying too much attention to him in the past decade, so I probably missed a lot of changes in these eventful times.The tone of the book verges on the sonorous in passages, as if he were half-consciously minding the cadeneces of his sentences. There are some errors of fact-it was Army Rangers and not Marines who were attacked in Mogadishu, and Arab terrorists have never excluded Israeli civilians from their range of targets--which are not serious barriers to following his points.Unlike some other recent writers who have attempted to answer the question, \\"Why do they hate us?\\", Berman looks not to clashing civilizations, or to Islam's commands to wage perpetual holy war, but to a single Egyptian scholar, Sayyid Qutb. After taking a tour through the 19th century anarchists, the 20th century totalitarian systems, and Albert Camus' parsing of those movements, Berman trace's Qutb's influence in the pan-arabist movement, and thence in the modern Islamic terrorist organizations. (The tyrant-hero of Berman's generation of Sixties radicals, Fidel Castro, does not figure here, nor does the mercifully truncated Sandinista regime. Irrelevant to his thesis, or too close to home?)The main body of the book is devoted to asserting that the modern jihad is a mass pathology, as were those previous movements. Rational onlookers can rarely believe the madness unfolding before their eyes, and so proceed to make excuses for the madmen. This is why progressive voices ululated ever louder against Israel the more grievously Israel suffered from suicide bombings. There are several fine passages in these sections illustrating this phenomenon, and are the book's main value, to me.He rolls a gutter ball in the final part, calling for a revival of the post-WWII \\"Third Way\\" of the European non-Communist Left, and how it headed off deeper Communist inroads into Western European nations. Yeah, the \\"Third Way\\", together with umpty-bajillion dollars from the American Marshal Plan, and a half-century of costly military commitment from the United States (which was borne in spite of all the insults, free-loading and ingratitude from the allies from time to time), did just that. \\"As we go ploughing along\\" as the fly said to the ox...He also gives in to Bush-bashing at the end. And the mock-moral aura of internationalism finally proves too much to resist, too. But when the allies would rather cozy up to Saddam, and transnational progressives are fist-pumping over the massacre of Israeli civilians, just how big a sin is Bush's cultural tone-deafness? If moral dryrot has eaten out the heart of Europe, it's hardly Dubya's fault for not further abasing ourselves, trying to get into their good graces. Especially after what we've suffered! Let them examine themselves. Let *them* grow spines!But this non sequitur ending to this informative book need not stop anyone from profiting from Berman's readings and insights. It's obvious that, unlike so many other progressive cheerleaders for terrorism, he is in full possession of a living soul, and that 9/11 was no 1939 for him."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Terror and Liberalism is one of the best books i have read in regards to what is going on in the world today. It skillfully highlights that the current global war is actually yet another war between liberal society and its totalitarian enemies. Paul Berman is a very skillful writer and makes a very convincing case for this idea. This book describes the work of the islamic philosopher Sayyid Qutb whose teachings are followed by the followers of al qaeda and other islamic groups today.Qutb believed that liberal societies which although had many benefits were still completely incompatible with islam for liberalism allowed all forms and beliefs to function together in a society and that no individual or belief should have complete dominance over the other, but Qutb believed that islam was the devine truth and the idea that it should exist in a society where it was nothing more than another belief which could not dictate the society was something even worse than heresy for it belittled islam,islam for him was sent by god and without its complete dominance over society,society was doomed to failure,islam therefore for the worlds sake should take over.Berman then goes on to explain that the groups which follow Qutbs ways of dominance of a belief of oneness over liberalism and individuals are no more than ideological cousins of the 20th century totalitarian regiemes which like the islamists believed in the idea of totalitarianism and the rejection of liberalism.They also believed in reviving empires of the past and the idea that there beliefs would lead them to an utopean society. Berman also highlights how people with this state of mind need to find an enemy whom they hold responsible for holding their people back and plotting against them such as the jews or freemaisons.Having read a lot on the subject of foreign affairs i found this book to be the most insightful. By focusing more on the people who founded and added to the islamist ideals we learn much more about it than we would have if Berman just focused on figures who just carry out the idea like bin laden. Berman is also completly correct to point out that jihadism and nazism are at ther roots the same basic thing just from different viewpoints and anyone who says different is no more than a common jackass! Even though have said that this is a short book i still felt that it was the perfect length for it told me exactly what i needed to know with sufficient proof and knowledge to back up its claims without going on for too long like other books which try to drag out their ideas.This book highlights the dangers of totalitarianism and in the end Berman who although supported the war in Iraq believes that a war of ideas should be waged to empower the many muslims liberals in the middle east to the support the ideas of a liberal society so that they can develop their own ideas of freedom and with some well placed western help develop their own societies from the inside-out. This way the fasists will lose control and power and will be unable to expand their ways. Overall this is a very thoughtful and intelligent book that teaches us that facism is facism whether the wearer is wearing a swatstika or an islamic headscarf."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Ah, if only more liberals wrote like this. Berman emphasizes and elaborates on issues other lefties will not simply because it would mean identifying with American (liberal) society and principles, and that just simply wouldn't do for some (i.e. Noam Chomsky).Berman's analysis of totalitarian roots shines new light on just what the United States is dealing with in fanatical Islam, comparing elements of terrorism with the cults of death inherent in German nationalism, Spanis facism and Soviet communism. One of his central arguments is that the United States has too many influential intellectuals who simply refuse to believe terrorism is an irrational act and would rather excuse it as \\"understandable\\" and an act of freedom. He offers a persuasive argument that the world is not governed by logic and that a cult of death has more to do with nihilsm and fanatical, irrational belief than it does in anything else. He sights the French socialists prior to Hitler's occupation as the embodiment of such naivete. Also, he shows how U.S. economic hegemony and foreign policy are not central to the terrorists' rage. Rather, it is secular culture we live in, and the separation of church and state and the way we live without God overseeing everything in between--that's what makes us infidels. Indeed, the central anxiety of Sayyid Qutb, the Egyption Islamist philosopher who influenced Saudi Wahhabism, is the temptation that western, liberal ideas of government and culture will influence his and other Arabs thinking and pull them away from what they ultimately strive for.This book has changed my thinking drastically in some areas. I have tried to remain optimistic about Dubya over the past year, but Berman's no nonsense analysis of Bush and how he has carried out this war are so spot on they cannot be ignored. His Bush criticisms are new and fresh, and aren't blatantly ideological and partisan like every other Bush-basing book floating around on Barnes and Noble's New Non-Fiction shelf.Berman's point is that America does have a role in promoting liberal and democratic societies througout the Middle East. It's just that Bush does not have the intellectual background, nor the character, to frame the debate as it should be. Instead of selling the war based on fear, it should've been sold for humanitarian and moral reasons."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"In this wonderfully insightful book, Paul Berman shows us that we are in a war we have been fighting many times before--drawing on the histories of the Crusades (the first recorded time a mass movement dedicated itself to death in the name of perfection) to the twentieth century (when mass movements dedicated to the glory of death have become an almost common-place) Berman shows us that history is not rational, is not logical. He shows us too that liberal values (fuzzy things: like the value of doubt) are worth something. Worth more, in fact, than the certainties in Paradise that, over the span of human history, have led do many to their terrible dooms.And he shows too that the liberal insistence that the world is a rational place has made it so difficult for those who should be the natural champions of liberalism (the Left) to defend their own values. If there is a mass suicide movement that is blowing up Israelis indiscriminately then the Israelis must have asked for it; if there is a mass suicide movement that is blowing up Americans indiscriminately then the Americans must have asked for it. And after a while the language of the Left (at least the extreme Left) become hard to differentiate from the language of the Right (at least the extreme Right). And before you know it, a man who is of the extreme Right comes in second in the French Presidential race. (And although Berman does not say it, simple math leads one to conclude that not all votes were from the extreme Right--but then why should they have been? In so many ways, the extreme Right sounds like the extreme Left these days. And the left is respectable...)And the war of ideas--the war that should be our most important war--the war of ideas between totalitarian ideologies that lead to mass graves and liberal philosophies that lead to maybe not Paradise but at least the chance at a good life, has been forsaken. It has been forsaken because the Left, the champions of Liberalism, are increasingly losing even the language with which to fight. Because liberals cannot recognize or acknowledge totalitarianism in this new, Islamist, guise we have no words even with which to combat it.And so this wonderful and lucid book is also a call to action. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"Let me say that this book is a fantastic read and I recommend it to anyone regardless of their political or historical knowledge.I found the book to be extremely appealing and Paul Berman portrays the great conflicts of the 20th century, not in terms of left/right, or religious/secular, or even warring nation states, but in terms of liberalism and democracy versus anti-liberal ideologies.Nazism, communism, fascism all fit neatly into the anti-liberal basket. And as this book commences with its brilliant introduction, Paul Berman suggests that Western intellectuals have done very little in the last 30 years to pay any attention to the Arab countries. He then poses the idea that both religious Islamic fundamentalism and secular pan-Arabist Ba'athism belong in the anti-liberal basket, and should be opposed by all liberal democracies.A great portion of the book examines the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, calling for nothing less than the restoration of the caliphate and the application of Islamic law in all lands.Berman suggests that these ideas were revived by the encyclopaedic writings of Sayyid Qutb which took seed within the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in the 1970's. These ideas soon spread to Saudi Arabia, and were the inspiration for the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 and the mujahadin-led assault against the Soviet forces in Afghanistan.Berman then returns his attention to Western leaders and intellectuals who ignored or appeased the rise and spread of Islamic fundamentalism. Wherever it spread, misery, violence and terrorism soon followed. 1 million people were killed between both sides in the Iran-Iraq war. Women were oppressed and disenfranchised. Slavery and ethnic cleansing spread to parts of Africa. Wild propaganda and anti-semitic conspiracies were spread through the mosques and state-run media.This book takes a hard swing at the left, as Berman highlights how some Western \\"sophisticated\\" thinkers appeased or invented excuses for the anti-liberal ideology, no matter how atrocious or violent the outcomes were, and drew comparisons with the French intellectuals who excused or even supported Nazi aggression in WW2.Paul Berman didn't only identify excusers or appeasers of the anti-liberal ideology on the left. He also attacks people on the right who pursued realist foreign policies. Berman discussed how in 1991, Nixon wrote an op-ed in the NYT supporting the first gulf war, to remove Saddam's forces from Kuwait, for realist reasons. These basically amount to strategic reaons to prevent Saddam from controlling a massive share of the world's oil supply and amassing wealth to pursue weapons. Berman then attacks the coalition that the US formed for the first gulf war, labelling it a collection of monarchs, dictators, tyrants and thugs, namely the UN security council. And despite the first war being explicitly supported by the Saudi monarchy, it did very little as the 1990's were full of Saudi-funded terrorist attacks on American targets."},{"Title":"Terror and Liberalism","review":"This book is one of the most important books of the year. It is very well written and clearly explains the nature of the threat facing western democracies from fascism in its newest incarnation. Berman then goes on to explain why so many are ignoring the threat. This book should be manditory reading for anyone who thinks we can negotiate or co-exist with radical Islamists, bin Ladenites, Hamas, Ba'athists, etc. This book has my vote for this year's Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"The mystery novel is probably the closest thing we have to a moral x-ray machine capable of penetrating through the shiny, slick surface of a malled-out America to illuminate the tawdry recesses of its darkest inner organs.Russell Atwood is off to a fantastic start, seizing all of the noir conventions and making them work for a new generation. Payton Sherwood isn't a knight on a white horse. He's just a working stiff trying to get through the day with his hide intact and keep his conscience square with the house.Noir fiction, the best at least, is a morality play pitting a flawed hero against the temptations of lust, greed, anger and revenge. The characters the hero comes across during his investigation inevitably serve as avatars of these various human frailties. Our pay-off as readers comes when the hero, despite his personal woes, does the right thing, the thing we all hope we would do in his situation, but aren't sure we would.Atwood seems to understand this emotional dynamic implicitly. What he brings to the table is a fantastic ear for snappy dialogue and characterizations that refuse to divide cleanly into black and white absolutes.This is a fast read and it's well worth the time and money. Russell Atwood is on his way to a great career as a mystery writer and commentator on modern mores."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"Russel Atwood's &quot;East of A,&quot; in which the author introduces us to New York City private detective Payton Sherwood, is a well written book that has many of the elements (lonilesness, cynicism, street-wise attitude) that make for great private detective fiction. Unfortunately, it is all put into service of a story that is just not terribly compelling, particularly if it is meant to be the first in a series starring Sherwood.The plot is fairly straightforward. Sherwood is beaten up by a trio of street thugs when he attempts to stop them from attacking a runaway teenage girl. No good deed goes unpunished, and while he's lying in the street the girl steals his Rolex watch, the only valuable thing he owns. After cleaning himself up, Sherwood goes in search of the watch. That premise doesn't exactly compell one to keep reading, and it was only Atwood's light and easy prose that kept me interested.The case takes some unexpected turns when Sherwood discovers that the thugs are after the girl because they believe the girl stole a new designer drug from their boss, a wealthy eccentric dance club owner. From there Sherwood encounters a trail of murder and deceit. The New York street scenes are well described and the characters that inhabit them are fairly well drawn (except, curiously, for the girl, who the reader never really gets to know). Unltimately, the story just doesn't amount to all that much, though there is one grisly scene in which two men fall out a high window that is quite shocking and shows that Atwood has potential as a storyteller. He just needs more scenes like that one.Overall, &quot;East of A&quot; is not a bad novel, just not a terribly memorable one."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"East of A is the perfect modern mystery: Smart, fun, and exciting.

I found the style of the book to be less hard-boiled than that of the short story.It's a good mystery with plenty of suspects. It seems that nowadays most of the mysteries are written by and for women, with the men's market devoted to thrillers instead.To my knowledge, the author has written only one novel, Losers Live Longer, in the twelve years since East of A was published. That's a pity. I look forward to reading Losers Live Longer."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"In EAST OF A, Russell Atwood serves up a thriller that's witty, funny and rich with atmosphere, as New York City's lower East side becomes a character in this urban thriller, and its protagonist Payton Sherwood takes his place among fiction's best-loved hard-boiled PI's. Fast-paced, and never boring, Mr. Atwood's debut novel is a slim, but satisfying page turner."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"When you first meet Payton Sherwood, the hero of East of A, he seems to be stepping right into the footsteps of every great PI that has come before him. But Sherwood quickly steps out on his own and takes a new path that's fresh and yet still loyal to the past heroes of PI legend. With an expert eye for the East Village of New York City, East of A's author Atwood knows his turf and he knows how to show it off. If one paragraph makes the East Village seem like the kind of place that would be fun to visit, the next paragraph makes you want to run, run, run for your life. The characters are wild and full of surprises, and yet still very real. With all the suspense and drama, Atwood takes the time to give his main character Payton Sherwood, a depth and charm that pulls the reader in. Not a macho tough guy, Sherwood is the kind of hero that's closer to us all, and so we're a little more fearful for him. There is also a great deal of humor in East of A. Something that doesn't always work in the dark world of the PI novel, the humor here fits right in. It fits. That's what makes East of A so good. Atwood's characters, locale, story, and humor all fit perfectly together. And it's a good fit that makes for a great read. Can't wait for the next Payton Sherwood adventure! But who should play Payton in the movie?"},{"Title":"East of A","review":"Being snowed in at a motel for a day, I was very glad to have this book with me. It is the dark kind of book that was perfect to read in an afternoon, looking out at the wind and snow. The descriptions of New York City were so clear that at times I felt I was there. Once in a while I wondered if what Payton did really could be acomplished, like running all over town after having been beaten silly be 3 thugs, but none of this destracted from the good story being told. I will think of this book every time I visit New York City!"},{"Title":"East of A","review":"Atwood's first novel is delicious, if occasionally overripe: he allows himself too many deliberately purple passages, as well as gimmicks such as text laid out vertically to reflect a character's fall out of a window and random words spelled in dialect (i.e., &quot;wire&quot; for &quot;why are&quot;). But the patches of questionable prose will improve with age -- what Atwood already has going for him is a fabulous sense of place (you can see and smell the Village as you read) and a knack for suspense. A scene with Payton trapped in a subway tunnel as a train approaches is a fabulous nail-biter, even if it's not entirely clear to the reader just how Payton manages to survive. On the whole, a good read and an auspicious debut."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"I am a film noir fan and this book harkens back to the best of those stories. I love the language which is comtemporary yet paints pictures of the gritty underbelly that the great Hammett and Chanlder were able to capture so well. It rocks with vivid and all to real descritpions of the not too pretty reality of death and the streets of New York. Great fun and Peyton is a guy that I want to know better."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"After testifying in a child custody case in Syracuse for the last nine days, private investigator Payton Sherwood buses home to New York City. When he reaches his office-home in the East Village, he feels life is good because no one broke into his house. Without changing form his suit, Payton goes to the nearest convenience store to buy some milk and cereal. On the way back, he intercedes when three thugs accost a teenage girl. For being a Good Samaritan, the three punks kick him from head to toe.When he regains consciousness, Payton realizes that his $3500 gold Rolex watch was stolen during the incident. Besides the principle of the thing, Payton wants just about his only thing of value returned. He traces the girl, who turns out to be a homeless runaway named Gloria Manlow. Though he catches up to her by journeying through the bowels of the city, he soon finds himself working a much bigger case that places his life in jeopardy.EAST OF A is well written urban Noir that brings alive the eats Village and surrounding neighborhoods of Manhattan. Payton is a great new entry in the sleuthing world (he has previously appeared in a short story). The story line is quirky and different. Fans will want more works from Russell Atwood, starring Payton in the city.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"East of A","review":"As a mystery author with a recently published debut mystery, I am greatly impressed with Russell Atwood's debut novel. His protagonist, Payton Sherwood, is a fresh creation--a contemporary heir to the noir tradition. Atwood captures his story's urban environment accurately, and his plot is well-paced. EAST OF A is a solid urban noir work and a terrific beginning for what I hope will be a long career writing crime fiction for Mr. Atwood."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"As a huge fan of detective fiction, I had to read this novel. It had an interesting plot but the climax was weak. If the story's hero would have been a tougher guy, I would have liked it a lot more. A book doesn't have to be realistic. In fact, it shouldn't be. An example: Payton shouldn't get pounded by the thugs. Make him be a really cool guy and kick rear himself. Atwood also should have had the main character raise more violence by dishing out his 9mm Luger and settling the score with his nemesis. A good story though."},{"Title":"East of A","review":"ee"},{"Title":"Transformers Collectibles: Unofficial Guide (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","review":"Some sections of this book I found to be quite neat to look through, but how difficult would it have been to include the ACTUAL Transformer toys themselves??? I know he has another book for that, but at the price paid for this book, it would have been nice to at least have reference photos of the vintage (80's) action figures along with all the other stuff (would've been 18-20 more pages maybe). Some of the sections in the book get monotonous (trying to get excited about collecting every book published about Transformers is a tough request), and I found myself thinking \\"who cares?\\" more than once. Overall, I think this is maybe a $19.95 book, but not more than that as I've purchased many many more collector oriented books that were better AND cheaper than this one."},{"Title":"Transformers Collectibles: Unofficial Guide (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","review":"This is a book you must have especially if you are a transformers fan.

He was happy and surprised that I had gotten it for him."},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"This is an excellent Dark Ages romance and Kirkman has the perioddown. The only thing that I noted after having just read a Roberta Gellisbook was that I would have appreciated a little more detail on DarkAge facts. Not so much for myself but I think that Kirkman is taking forgranted that a lot of readers will understand some Anglo Saxon or Norseterminology that a lot may not know. Even so, it is wonderful reading.Lady Rowena is in need of a champion with nothing to lose and he haseverything to gain if he suceeds. She decides on the spur of a momentin a slave market to buy her champion. She can sense a survivor's willin this slave as well as a need for his own revenge and the person whoaccompanies her to the market is repelled or even fears the slave.This is what decides his and her fate. This sixth sense she has is thatthe slave is her only chance to avenge her father's death and save herand her daughter's future.Wulf while trying to right a wrong that his brother brought about, hasput himself in the way of a dangerous enemy. And when that enemy hasthe chance to destroy him without killing him, he takes it. Wulf orAthelwulf (Athel is the title for a thane or earl in Norse and Saxoncultures of the century the story takes place in ) is expelled fromhis lands when he commits a murder. He is made into a slave and soldto the flatlanders known as Frisians (another terminology from theDark Ages) It is in a Slave Market in Wessex that he is bought byRowena. He gives an oath to do her will but only until the day ofLamas Tide or First Fruits of the Harvest( more Dark age jive) .Kirkman's style is a cross between Dain and Hunter. She flows eventhough her sentences are short. Sometimes she almost has Schone likeshort repetitions but they are much more subtle than Schone. All inall her style is very pleasant to read. It is very fast paced andfluid. I read this book about 350 pages in 2 1/2 hours. Once started Imoved right through it to the end in one sitting and that was withmany glances at the cover. God that guy is yummy.I gave this book a B+ and almost an A- but I think she presumes toomuch from tha reader that they will either from context figure thelingo or just be that knowledgeable about the period which is unlikely. Her editors are at fault here. If you've studiedsome of the Dark ages or Norse Mythology you may get a lot of it. Ihave done both the latter. However it still took me a moment or two torecollect at some points. Even so, Kirkman can tell a story and ifthis second novel is indicative of her talent, I am happy to havefound a new author. If you liked Madeline Hunter, Claudia Dain,Joan Wolf's Dark Age books, and Susan Squires, I think you may very well likethis book."},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"Setting - England, 716 a.d. --- Whatever had possessed the Lady Rowena to buy a slave for 12 mancuses, she had no idea, but the deed was done. The big muscular thrall with silvery eyes like cold flint showed no deference for her lofty station - no, they held nothing but contempt. How dare it! Lady Rowena, could never be at the mercy of another ever again and knew she must show more courage than she possessed. Her life and the life of her daughter were at stake, and the thrall was brave - this she knew, and she would risk it's life if he could survive the dangerous mission she would put to him for the price of his freedom.It's name was Wulf, a thrall - no longer a man but enslaved by a betrayal so bitter his rage alone had given him the strength to survive. Now this beautiful noblewoman had purchased him - for what - a plaything to whore upon? Trust would be a fragile link that might be breached between the two worlds they inhabited. Desire and revenge, betrayal and love would all come into play as human passions exploded between two people who knew better than to taste these forbidden waters.Having read Kirkman's exceptional debut novel (A MOMENT'S MADNESS - circa 916 a.d.) I was anxious to read another by her as she once again tackled an even earlier historical period. The author's writing style is different and in this she does not employ a lot of dialog so much as express \`feelings' and \`mood' as Rowena tries to rationalize in her mind, what and why she is attracted to the very compelling slave. Admittedly for action lovers, the first third of the book is slow but, again, this seems to be the style the author has adopted in setting the stage. The secondary characters are all very interesting and well defined, particularly Rowena's six-year-old daughter who practically steals the show as well as your heart as she tries her best to be a \`healer' of both humans and animals. The last portion of the book definitely picks up steam with a lot of action and wraps up all the loose ends that were tossed out in the beginning making this a rather satisfying read. Bottom Line - It does have a slow start, and the writing style is distinctive but, all in all, a very pleasant read for a lazy weekend. --- Marilyn Rondeau, for www.historicalromancewriters.com ---"},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"From the very beginning of the book, where Rowena purchases Wulf at a slave market, I knew this would be a special story. She feels not only a physical attraction to him, but an emotional one as well, and the struggle she endures trying to understand her feelings for a man she should consider &quot;property&quot; is so well written. That Wulf has feelings for her beyond lust might be hard to believe, but the author makes the reader accept it by showing us what an unusual man he is. (Makes me wish I could run out and buy a guy like him ;) The secondary characters held my interest, particularly Rowena's darling daughter and the evil Eadward. I wish we had seen more of Wulf's brother, but I understand he will be in a sequel so I will be eagerly awaiting that. Just a great book all around."},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"I love romance novels and expect alot from an author. This novel and author provides DETAILS, lots and lots of excellent details about what is happening. Let's just cut to the chase...there are well placed love scenes and much in between to show the elctricity between the two charaters. You can almost feel the tension between them."},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"This was my first book by Ms. Kirkman, but it will not be my last. This was a challenging read - those who like simple sentences, one-dimensional characters and every bit of the plot foreshadowed for them won't like it. But if you enjoy characters with emotional depth trying to get through complicated situations with their love intact, and want an ending that you didn't see coming, this is a book for you. Wulf is a wonderful hero - brave, patient, tender and understanding when by rights he should be belligerent and hateful. Rowena is a strong woman trying to keep her family and people safe without knowing who she can trust, finding herself in the bewildering situation of relying on someone who should despise her. It doesn't sound like there would be room for romance here, but there is and it's heartwarming. This goes on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"The reviewers below are all wrong. I was told by someone that her books were not that good, but, I had already bought all of them. Well, I am glad that I did. You don't always have to have so much sex in romance books to make them GOOD. Take my word, this book IS GOOD. It has a new twist on it, with Rowena buying a slave...WULF. Taking place in earlier English history,716 A.D it is not your usual historical romance. Times back then were more raw & brutal. Ms Kirkman does a very good job of telling the story about their blossoming romance. I cannot figure out why the reviewers below did not like this book. I think it was very well written."},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"Forbidden is a really fantastic Historical Romance. The main characters in this story are very well written and with great humanity; I could identify with their thoughts and feelings. With a smoothly flowing story and an interesting plot, this story really satisfies. I was very pleased with the beginning; it captured my attention quickly and held it right till the end. Set in VERY early England, 716, this novel takes you back to a time when powerful families and landowners ruled absolutely; with barbaric savagery and underhanded schemes, the evil and corrupt flourished because there was no one powerful enough to stop them. When Rowena sees a heavily muscled slave for sale, she finally sees a way to right the wrongs. When Rowena purchases Wulf, she also sets a dangerous plan in motion, one that risks everything she owns and loves. The love scenes are very erotic; steeped in sensuality that nearly made me blush.

She especially liked the way the slave made Eadward not only pauses, but show fear for the first time. Rowena buys the thrall planning to use him as a tool of vengeance on the odious tax collector whom she knows killed her spouse.Rowena offers her new penal slave Wulf his freedom in exchange for his killing Eadward. Desperate to escape bondage, Wulf accepts. However, even before she bought the proud Wulf, Rowena and he shared an attraction, but both thought it must be A MOMENT'S MADNESS. Now those feelings are blossoming into love, but a lowly slave and an elitist noblewoman could never share a relationship beyond that of servitude and his mistress, could they?FORBIDDEN is an enjoyable historical romance that grips the audience with the almost helpless feelings that Rowena and Wulf display regardless of their social position. The story line is action packed, but really driven by the lead couple. Though Eadward is too vile to offer any positive rivalry, sub-genre fans will root for love to serve as the mechanism that Rowena and Wulf use to overcome a societal taboo that the villain cleverly exploits for his personal use.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Forbidden","review":"Generally I find I can get into any romance novel.

I am Never this hard on a book but I have never read one so haphazzardly thought out.The characters are very erratic and bipolar with no transition or thought put into explaining the emotions.

I thought this is so bad I have to tell people not to waste their money. While I was reading this book I thought that the author must have a very good friend in the publishing business for her to have gotten this thing published. I have never bothered to remember an authors name to make sure not to buy another book from them but I will remember Helen Kirkman. Why do I not like it, well reading this book was like watching a movie that was out of focus most of the time or maybe like looking at it through an empty paper towel roll where you only get a glimpse at what is happening and the story breaks away and puts you in another seen and you don't even know what the heck is going on. I finally decided when I was half way through the book just to skip through and read just parts of it to get to the end faster. I have to say it seemed no different then reading it chapter by chapter. It is too bad for this author that she got published too soon maybe she could have gotten better if she had some constructive criticism form friends.

Simms is not coasting on his reputation. He prepares for each week's broadcast with the same seriousness of purpose with which he formerly prepared to quarterback the Giants. Simms has always dedicated himself to self-improvement--even improving his throwing mechanics during his second decade as an NFL quarterback. His journalism reflects his professionalism; Simms respects his audience. For example: \\"I try to stay away from buzz terms such as 'Two Deep' or 'Eight in the Box.' Instead, I'll talk about the defense 'crowding the line of scrimmage.'\\" (p. 125).\\"Sunday Morning Quarterback\\" dispels countless false \\"truisms\\" that less analytical/knowledgeable NFL broadcasters spew because they are too lazy to dig deeper.Simms vividly describes the challenges NFL quarterbacks face that average fans (like me) don't appreciate. Simms argues persuasively that, even today, many NFL teams fail to adequately coach and drill quarterbacks in their throwing motion. He explains that it's easy for fans and journalists to second-guess plays that don't work out well, such as a reverse that gets stopped in the backfield or a draw play in an \\"obvious\\" passing situation. But, he argues, the very \\"obviousness\\" of a call makes it less desirable. Also, even when a particular play \\"fails,\\" it can achieve the objective of confusing defenses and preventing them from \\"reading\\" plays too quickly (and, thus, attacking immediately). Planting seeds of doubt may slow down a defense's reaction by a second, which can be the difference between an interception and a long pass completion on the next play.Simms argues that the prominence of highlight films has made fans less patient (\\"Why can't we do that?\\"). Highlight reels, he points out, leave out all the busted plays and short gains. Also, every \\"highlight\\" is a \\"lowlight\\" for another team.He notes that quarterbacks who scramble reduce their ability to notice open receivers and reduce the portion of the field to which they can throw. He neglects to follow up by pointing out that smart defenses will react to a scrambling quarterback by compressing their defense toward the side of the field the quarterback is scrambling to (esp. the sideline toward which the quarterback is running). But he makes plenty of great points that will get fans thinking. He does, for example, add that a scrambling quarterback should keep his head looking downfield and shoulders parallel with the line of scrimmage as he runs towards the sideline. He says Manning and Brady have been trained to do this and complete more passes because they look downfield while scrambling.One place I vehemently disagree with Simms is his belief that \\"good size, a good throwing arm, and the ability to move reasonably well [plus] common intelligence\\" are more important in NFL quarterback prospects than \\"how they handle pressure and other mental aspects\\" which he terms \\"intangibles\\" (pp. 75-76). On p. 180 of my book, \\"Management Secrets of the New England Patriots,\\" I cite former NFL quarterbacks Joe Theismann and Jim Harbaugh who say that toughness is a quarterback's most important attribute. At Michigan, Tom Brady was small, weak-armed, and slow. The Patriots drafted him for his toughness, competitiveness, intelligence, and calmness under pressure. None of these were \\"intangible.\\" You can't measure them statistically at the scouting combine, but you can measure them by studying game film, talking with teammates, etc. The Patriots saw those \\"intangibles.\\" Brady has added twenty pounds to his frame, strengthened his arm, and remains slower than many nose tackles. \\"Intangibles\\" cannot be taught because character is far harder to change than muscle mass. I'm not sure Simms even believes his own words because he later contradicts himself: \\"Your philosophical beliefs determine whether you win or lose. ...[W]hat you believe in--great physical conditioning, toughness, practicing under pressure--forms the core\\" (p. 149). And his entire Chapter 7 describes the many mental challenges of playing quarterback!Some might criticize Simms for his apparent jealousy that Joe Montana had the good fortune of being drafted by Walsh's Niners, but I admire and appreciate his candor. I wish we could re-run history and see what Simms would have done in Montana's place. Simms' story of Walsh telling Simms, during pre-draft scouting, to throw slower does suggest that Walsh's system would have enabled Simms to post even bigger numbers."},{"Title":"Sunday Morning Quarterback: Going Deep on the Strategies, Myths & Mayhem of Football","review":"an insightful and quick read. the stuff about parcells is especially good. great for any NFL fan."},{"Title":"Sunday Morning Quarterback: Going Deep on the Strategies, Myths & Mayhem of Football","review":"If your a Phil Simms or NY Giants fan, this is a must book to have.

Pickles invents stuff, and is well-liked around town. These four kids have only one thing in common--they're going to report to the principal's office!This book was pretty good. I really like Jerry Spinelli's books, and this book was no exception. There were a lot of funny parts. But there were also a lot of boring parts. I would still recommend this book to someone, though. Another thing I like about this book is it tells the truth about sixth grade life. There are so many other books about sixth grade that are so unrealistic."},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"&quot;Report To The Principal's Office&quot; gave me many hours of fun and laughter and &quot;awwww&quot;s. Jerry Spinelli has created a group of 4 sixth-graders whose adventures are side-splitting funny and reminiscent of the Junior High days. The plot isn't what's important, it's the human interest story. For example, cheering when Sunny washes her hair for the first time in 3 weeks because she finally decides she could get used to her new school, or laughing with Pickles when he catches the hamster, or feeling awful for Eddie who sacrificed himself for Salem... Jerry Spinelli writes like the movies, where you hear the swelling music at the end for the hero and you want to stand up and yell encouragement. The books are easy to read, and fun to memorize, and lots of fun to pass on to others. I wholeheartidly recommend the School Daze Series to everyone except maybe the upstrung politicians with a pickle up their tush. The other 3 books in the School Daze Series are: &quot;Who Ran My Underware Up The Flagpole?&quot; &quot;Picklemania&quot; and &quot;Do The Funky Pickle&quot;, all by Jerry Spinelli."},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone who has read one of Jerry Spinelli's books.

Salem wants to write a story and she will do anything to get one. Sunny is trying to get expelled. Eddie just keeps running into trouble. Well, Pickles, he doesn't do a lot. I think this book is very much like There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom by Louis Sachar. They are very much like each other because in both books they go to the principal's office. Also, in both books there are many protagonists.I like this book in all ways. I like it because Jerry Spinelli made it sound funny and I like funny books. I think this book deserves 4 stars.

Sunny, a girl who was schooled at Cedar Grove Middle School is transferred to Plumstead Middle School but Hillary (Sunny's best friend) stays at the old school. Sunny is determined to get herself suspended. Then there's Eddie. Eddie has a plan to fit in but still has to try harder. Salem wants to get a good story and does whatever she can to do so. And then there's Pickles who is a trouble-making boy. This book I would rate a four star. This book reminded me of the wonderful novel by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter, because Harry is a boy who gets bullied around just like Eddie. Harry is also like Sunny Wyler who gets transferred to a new school just like Harry, but Harry gets transferred to a school of witchcraft and wizardry. Over all the book was pretty interesting. The plot was good and fun, but I like Harry Potter even better. If you like this book don't forget to read another Jerry Spinelli book, Do the Funky Pickle!"},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"This book has boring parts in it, but some parts are exciting.

My favorite part of the book is when a group of students have lunch with the principal in his office, and they find a hamster in their food. There are some great characters in this book.

Then there's Pickles; he likes Eddie, so he spends his time trying to protect Eddie from the older students who want to pick on Eddie.I liked this book because it was very funny.

We both laughed our way through each and every one! The stories center around the friendships of 4 middle school students - 2 girls and 2 boys - who are very different from each other. It was realistic in every way from the friendships to the school days to after school activities. You get the humor, tears, fears, ambitions, and so much more from their interactions with each other and their peers. The adults in the books are quite enjoyable, too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book and the whole series to any preteens. If your pre-teen isn't really into reading, these books just might change their minds."},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"Report to the Principal's Office is an interesting book. It was a good book, but just good. It is a book about a girl named Sunny Wyler who is trying to get expelled so that she can go to her old school. There is also a girl named Salem Brownmiller who is a writer. She would do anything for a book. Then there is a boy named Eddie Mott who is trying to get through the year smoothly. Then there is Pickles, who doesn't have a goal, but he does have a purpose.I thought the author rushed through the book. There was no point of the book. The reason I say that is because as I was reading it there were a bunch of little parts that didn't have anything to do with anything. I recommend this book for third and fourth grade boys. It wasn't my style. I like fantasy books. On a star rating I would give it two stars."},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"I have a lot of feelings for this book. Jerry Spinelli is a funny author, but uses some words that shouldn't be in his good books. Report to the Principal's Office is mostly about a sixth grader named Sunny. She is not my type. Sunny is a brat and just wants to be with her friend, but when you go to a new school, you should make new friends and keep the old.Eddie Mott has a lot of trouble with bullies and liking Sunny. Salem is trouble too. But luckily someone saves him. The ending made a non-sense point. It doesn't seem like it fits the story. Eddie reminds me of Harry potter, but the endings to the books and movies are better.At first it is hard to figure all the main characters, but I got used to it. Pickles Johnson is not talked about a lot in this book. I dislike the beginning because it starts off in a weird way. I would give this book a seven on a scale of 1 to 10. There are silly moments and bad moments. This book is part of a series. If you like books that have girls who shouldn't be doing certain things, like troublemakers, then you will like Sunny Wyler.Every book in this series is based on a certain character. This isn't as long as Harry Potter, so it might take you less time to read it. I recommend this book for teachers to read to their class or if you have reading groups. This book is good for ages 8 - 12. If you're younger, have a parent read it to you. Now I'm reading the next book in the series. This book is mostly about Eddie Mott and Pickles Johnson, but it talks about Salem in the beginning. I don't know a lot about it because I am not far into it. What I'm reading so far is good. The book is called Do the Funky Pickle. I guess the only way to find out if the book is good, is if you read it, but be sure to read Report to the Principal's Office first so you understand the rest."},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"The book \\" Report to the Principal's Office,\\" was in my opinion, a very good book.

They all go to the new school Plumsted High. Plumsted has all the latest technology, such as an air conditioner, surveillance cameras, and a P.A. system.

Four unlikely candidates become good friends as they deal with their individual struggles of middle school. There are 3 more books in the serries that extend the story throughout the school year."},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"I recommend this book. It's about school. Sunny gets separated with Hillary. Sunny tries to get kicked out of school. At the end-wait, I don't want to spoil it and tell you what happens. YOU are going to find out what happens! Get this book! You KNOW you want to. 25 chapters of exciting and interesting adventures at school? Come ON! Get it. The ending's good. I'm not saying why they were at the principal's office, (because YOU are gonna find out-if you get this book) but they weren&#65533;t there for such a bad reason. Just TRY it. Get it, you'll LIKE it. Just look at the reviews! 5 stars are everywhere. Maybe 4 stars, too. I don't think I'd EVER see 1 star for this book! NEVER! EVER! EVER! You KNOW you want to get this book, so go for it! Just GO...

Another girl is named Salem (she's trying to write a good story). One boy named Eddie (he's just trying to avoid 8th graders). And another boy named Pickles (he's an inventor). The 4 kids end up going to a school called Plumstead Middle School, where they have many adventures.When you read Report to the Principal's Office you'll laugh the whole time. Kids ages 8 - 11 will have laugh attacks, I know I did. The book may be a little hard to follow, since there are four leading characters. The beginning started slow, but the middle made up for it. He introduced the characters well, and what their goals are. I recommend this book because it's a good book, it's funny, nice descriptions, and it kind of seems like two of the characters (Eddie and Salem) have a little romance (I wouldn't call it a romance novel though). I would compare this book to... nothing, because it's unique, different, and I doubt you'll read anything like it. 3 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Report to the Principals Office","review":"Eddie Mott, Sunny Wyler, Pickles Johnson, and Salem Brownmiller are in for a big surprise when they get invited to lunch by Plumstead Middle School's principal Mr. Brimlow.Salem loves to write and what do you know she is writing a story about a middle schooler's first day of school. She will do anything for a story. Pickles is very famous for his inventions. Sunny is acting sort of like Simon Cowell from American Idol because she isn't impressed by anything and she is very rude. Eddie is really shy.I really like the book because it has lots of details. I give this book a 4 star rating. This is a good book, but it took too long to develop, because in one chapter they would talk about one thing and then in the next chapter it would talk about a whole different thing. Other than that everything else about the book was good. The ending is really good because it is the first book in the series.

The main characters are Sunny Wyler, Salem Brownmiller, Pickles Johnson, Eddie Mott, and Charles T. Brimlow. The story takes place at Plumstead Middle School. The book gives you very detailed character traits and visual traits of characters in your mind. Every character has their own unusual personality. You don't need pictures to see what's going on in this book because of the detailed descriptions of the settings and the characters' actions on every page of the book.

I must say though, that this was the first time ive ever been dissapointed by her. I read the first book in this series (When calls the Heart) when i was 14 or so and it was my favorite book for years. The next 5 in the series were all entertaining and just the right amount of romantic while providing a beautiful message of God's love and guidance. This book was just a mess. I found Christine's character to be painfully flat and uninteresting. Her reactions to the men who were interested in her were almost irritatingly self-centered. I know the end of the book where she spends a week \\"searching for God's guidance\\" was supposed to make up for it all, but I think it fell a little short. The way the book starts by setting up the romance between Christine and Laray and then just dropping it suddenly to start another romance with Eric makes it all feel unhinged. I guess it might have worked if the relationship had been at least romantic, but Christine is unsure of her feelings the whole time so it's really hard to understand where it's going. Anyway, I guess it's hard to write an amazing story EVERY single time...so 5 good books out of 6 ain't bad.."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"I'll admit, I'm not a huge Oke fan, but she's decent. The characters were just all right in Beyond the Gathering Storm and When Tomorrow Comes...the plot twists are almost the only redeeming pt, though they do well in that role.

She discovers a worthwhile ministry at the local Hope Canteen, sharing Christ with young servicemen and women. An automobile accident proves pivotal for both the story line and Christine's life. Oke introduces a handsome young resident at the hospital whose family helped found the town. Christine is torn about her future which seems to revolve around her beloved North.

She builds up a romantic story line and then skips over into another story entirely. I must admit I like the stories about settlers better than the more modern settings and situations. I suppose the wars aren't that modern but they're a less innocent time. I felt like she had cheated her readers by rushing this to press before taking the time to edit it properly. She had proved herself in the past and I'll buy her books again but it was really disapointing. A writer who can write Roses For Mama can do a lot better."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"I was excited to see that Janette Oke had written two more books for her Canadian West series (my favorite of all her books)about the Delaney's kids. Either the quality of her writing has diminished or my literary taste has matured; either way, these two books were not that great. The sixth one was especially aggravating! The character development was poor; the plot was choppy. It was as if the author was trying to minimize words, frequently giving summaries of what had just occurred, rather than allowing you to enjoy it yourself. Without spoiling, the romance aspect of this book completely failed, and was completely unbelievable. Stick with the original four and skip the latter two."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"As an avid christian fiction reader, I eagerly await new books by my favorite authors. This book was well worth the wait. I don't know about anyone else, but I was disappointed when Janette Oke ended the Canadian West series a number of years ago. I was incredibly pleased to see her continue on last year, with &quot;Beyond the Gathering Storm&quot; and I have been anxiously awaiting this book. It is supurbly written and was satisfying in the end. There is just enough suspense to make it impossible to put down. It is a book that reminds the reader how important faith in God really is and that if you listen to Him, you will not choose the wrong path for you life. I am hoping that Oke decides to contine on with this series. I am looking forward to seeing these characters again. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"This book was merely ok for me. It starts right when Beyond the Gathering Storm lets off and continues the story of Christine. This time, Christine is the main character with no switching of point of view to her brother Henry. Her parents, Elizabeth and Wynn, feature slightly but are again, not the main characters.We find Christine living with her parents after the breakup of her relationship in the South where she subsequently loses her job as well. She is just about to look for another job when she gets the good news that her brother and his beloved Amber will be getting married at Christmas and would love if she would come early to help with things. This she agrees to readily.She and her mother first stop at Calgary to visit family and obtain some supplies, like fabric for a new suit for her position as bride's maid. While her mother stays in Calgary, she continues on to her brother's place.After the wedding, it is Christine's job to look after Danny, Amber's son. It is during this time that a certain young Mountie that we know from Beyond the Gathering Storm (one that was mauled by a bear actually) takes a special interest in her. While he is not pushy, Christine just isn't sure she is ready for a relationship yet. She leaves with him saying if she ever changes her mind, all she needs to do is send him a note.She stops briefly back home before going back to Edmonton to pursue a job. Here she finds one and is just hired when she gets the bad news that her Aunt in Calgary has fallen and hurt her back and needs a nursemaid. Knowing that it would be probably for the best, she goes to take care of her Aunt, abandoning the job she just had.The care of her Aunt goes well and soon she finds herself in a job in Calgary, thanks to her Uncle who was able to suggest it to her. With such happiness going on, they decide all family should come for Easter. When all but her brother Henry is there, they get bad news that he and his family have been in an accident. While they wait at the hospital visiting and looking after Henry and his family, she meets a young doctor who later turns out to have romantic pursuits.In addition to the doctor, a young priest also has been pursuing her and knows her from the volunteer work that she is doing for soldiers. However will she decide where her heart leads?There wasn't as much Christian emphasis in this book as there were in the rest of Oke's in my opinion. The only time she really brought it in was towards the end when Christine was seeking guidance towards making a decision. The way she did it, to me, was really strange. It involved Christine conversing with different quotes from the bible and while I realize people do this, it just seemed awkward to me. I think it was perhaps the way Oke wrote it rather than the situation actually being awkward.Another disappointment in this book for me, and the reason I only rated it three stars, was because I did not agree with the ending at all. While there were three guys to pick and choose from, she didn't choose the one I would have chosen for her. Oke had all possible logic leading to a certain one and then out of nowhere switches it up. It made it less of an enjoyable read for me.At least in this book, compared to the last, the characters were more believable. They weren't always perfect and were more fallible. This made it easier for me to connect with them.As always, Oke's writing is inoffensive and while she deals with some tough things, she doesn't go too far with them or get too descriptive in gory details.Overall, while I would have liked to see a better ending to the Canadian West series this wasn't terrible. It just isn't the end I would have chosen for it.When Tomorrow ComesCopyright 2001256 pages"},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"Being a Janette Oke and looking forward to reading her books, I was disappointed that the book did not end in the way I had expected.

Why not? Plenty of real-life people have made decisions that way! There have also been cases of people in love with someone for years before they knew it, I'm glad the story wasn't like that. Perhaps the reviewer has never had such an experience, but that doesn't mean they know everything!

Overall I thought it was an okay book, but the ending just didn't seem right.

The day before she was supposed to make her decision about whether she wanted to continue seeing Eric seriously or not, she had no idea, then after just reading a chapter in Exodus she realized that she truly loves him?? Come on, really. I felt through the whole book that she and Henry's fellow RCMP Laray were a perfect match, esp. since he was going back to the North where she always felt that she belonged.

He explores marriage and its associated (or claimed) theology and the intersection of marriage and the reality of gay male romantic lives. He actually says a lot more of what marriage is not and what same-sex marriage will not be and makes very few assertions about what marriage or marriage theology are or how same-sex marriage will look like. Which is an assertion in itself. Anyway, any book which cites Queer as Folk rates high in my book."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"It's a challenge for a novelist to write about an actual person. Hough did a pretty good job. Mabel's life, imagined and factual, was fascinating. Given her eccentricities and her rare talents, there was a lot of material here for an imaginative author. Hough takes a restrained approach while still creating for us a fascinating, difficult and empathetic character. The presentation of circus life in this novel is at the level of the high-lighted performers rather than the working stiffs as we encountered in Water for Elephants. By combining the information in both of these novels, the reader can get a good idea of the circuses of the first half of the 1900's. Just imagining the logistics of managing these huge enterprises is daunting in itself. Circuses played an important role in American life, and this novel allows us to glimpse that as well as experience Mabel Stark's life. Well done."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I picked this up at the library and read it in 3 days. An absolutely fascinating, marvelously written novel. Held my total interest from beginning to end. I read about 4-5 books a month and this is one of the best I've read during my 50 years of being an avid reader. I will be reading Robert Hough's other books and will be downloading this one into my Kindle so I can re-read on demand. Take my advice; I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I bought this book on a lark...because it was on sale and the reviews were mostly good. I couldn't put it down! What a story and told in such a unique way. I could picture Mabel telling the story even though the author tells us he fictionalized quite a bit of it...filled in the details, like any historical fiction novel. It's such a great read and pure entertainment!"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I will warn you right now- if you are not one for bittersweet fiction, this book is not for you. The end tugs at your heart strings and stays with you long after you close the book. However, it is beautifully written, colorful, and well-researched, albeit fictionalized. Mabel Stark is endearing and her first person narrative weaves a great tale of her life. The author has stuffed the novel with glitz worthy of an old-time circus, but included the darker, bleaker side of life under the big top. Bough did not sugar coat the underbelly of circus life, including the varying treatment of animals, and how even the most devoted trainers had to deal with the ethics of the animal trade in general. Performers and workers alike were often ill treated. Circus people had to deal with dirty cops, constant danger, criminal employees (who needed more TLC than anything) and lost souls who lived for the spotlight. So dedicated they were to this doomed genre of entertainment, that they lived very hard lives with little planning for the future. Mabel Stark, devoted to the circus, needed to accept that, like her beloved tigers, they could turn on her at any given second. And yet, nothing else gave her the same joy as her tigers and her circus.Circus people are poorly understood, being either glamorized to a wispy fantasy or vilified to the point of sinister evil. This book offers a realistic and understanding point of view, and makes the mystical performers in make up and costumes suddenly human. Bough offers no preachy messages, or simplistic morals, though is generous with folk wisdom. The book is a page turner without being shallow. It is objective without being apathetic. It's a gorgeous tale."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"It is true to her life. My first husband worked for Mabel briefly in the late 1930s as a cage boy, and what he saw and knew was confirmed in Mr. Hough's novel. Although scratched and wounded by her tigers, she never let one be harmed. Rajah was the real love of her life, and her understanding husband was God sent."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"As a small child growing in during the 1960's I had the questionable honor to know Mabel Stark during the years she lived here in Thousand Oaks. Well...I thought I knew her, but after reading this book, it's probably better to say that I spent a little time with Mabel...I never really knew her until reading this book. Mabel wasn't exactly thrilled to be around little kids, but for some odd reason she took to me and let me tag around with her on Saturdays back when she was the tiger trainer at Jungleland in Thousand Oaks. I was fortunate enough to be allowed to accompany Mabel feed the tigers at the back side of the cages...(I was scared to death, and suspect that she delighted in that!) I found her to be truly marvelous, I was fascinated by her bravery with the tigers, and her choice in the most unusual career choices for a woman...or for a man! She was unique, much more unique than even this highly impressionable child thought she was so many years ago. A wonderful and interesting read...I would LOVE to see this made into a movie to further celebrate the life of the fascinating Ms. Stark...much more fascinating than I ever knew her to be! Thank you Robert Hough!"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I also picked this book up on a whim!!Glad I did!Great Read really hard to put down!I enjoyed the way it was written very entertaining!"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"For anyone interested in circus stories or the big cats, this fictionalized version of Mabel Stark's life is fascinating. The character is feisty and determined, but Robert Hough also writes of the discrimination women faced in the early 1900s. Normally the use of sentence fragments in a novel irritate me, but Robert Hough did an excellent job of using the fragments to impart Mabel's voice and speech patterns. This captivating story took so many twists and turns -- I was never bored. Read this book at the beach or on long flight or just curl up with it on a rainy day. While most of the novel takes place in a circus setting, it is NOT a book for children (or the YA (young adult) section). I'm looking forward to the movie release!"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"This was one of the strangest books I have ever read. Based on the true story of Mabel Stark, the book has some graphic scenes of bestiality that I didn't expect, but is also an interesting picture of a rebel woman.

An interesting read overall."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"Well, I do, and I absolutely loved this book!!!! I bought it on a whim when I was in a very large book store in Portland, OR. I put off reading it for a few months and then decided what the heck, it looked entertaining. Wow, did that turn out to be an understatement. It was one of those books which you can't put down, but then you are so sorry when it ends because it leaves an empty space in you, one only a really GOOD Book can fill. I have loaned it to several of my girlfriends and everyone of them raves about it. We all know it's not the \\"True Life\\" story of Mabel Stark, but the bits of truth that are there are as fasinating as the fiction. I now trust my \\"whims\\" when looking for a good book to read, which is an ongoing search as I read daily, sometimes 2 books at a time. Next to playing with my grandchildren reading is my favorite way to pass the day and sometimes even the nights.Suzanne Himmelberg/Missouri"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"This book has all the makings of a really great read, and it does start off that way. The character of Mabel tells her own story in first person and most of it has a ring of authenticity.Unfortunately, however, the author had a pre-occupation with what Mabel's sex life may have been like. We read how she had good and bad sex with all her husbands and, in one passage, even with her favorite tiger. Much of it seems gratuitous, as if the author couldn't imagine much of anything else that might be interesting in the life of a female tiger trainer in a traveling circus in the early- and mid-20th century!I'm no prude (understatement) but with all the material that someone should have been able to use to flesh out the life of such a potentially fascinating character, the one thing we get over and over again is her sex life. I guess that's why it's called her \\"Final Confessions\\", but what a disappointment.

I must admit that there was a rather outrageous quality, but I suppose that no circus life would be complete if the story was wholesome or toned down... Despite some questionable actions, Mabel was very likable and really, my main complaint was that the titillating secret the author teased the reader with from the beginning was not nearly as shocking as it could have been, considering some of the other things that went on! For a fictional biography, this was really wonderfully done with a carefully crafted picture of Mabel's whole life. Though the pacing was a bit uneven, and it would have been interesting to see more at the very end, the unique premise and strong writing more than made this an absorbing read."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"One of the most effective things that Robert Hough does in this extremely entertaining read is include tantalizing, grainy photos of the real-life Mabel Stark - one of the first female large-cat trainers in the United States.Decidedly creating a novel, and NOT a point-by-point biopic of the actual woman herself, Hough manages to take the factual framework of Stark and the turn of the 20th century circus life she thrived in and flesh it out into a funny, colorful story that is as human as it is fantastical.After a very poor first choice in husbands and a brief stint in a psychiatric ward, Mabel winds up, due to her saucy if rough good looks, as a hootchie dancer in a traveling circus. Her fascination with the large cats, and particularly, with tigers, becomes a love affair that ultimately overshadows all of the men her life, and her determination to join these cats in the ring will have the reader flipping the pages to bask with her in that triumph. The fear and wild joy narrated so effectively by the author during her romps in the ring with the wild cats will have you flipping back to those black and white photos, if only to see her fierce grin once more.Tigers make up Mabel's days, nights and yes, even her bed - and ultimately, once she's robbed of the thrill of this extremely specific love, Mabel handles the remainder of her life her way, on her own terms."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I thought this was a wonderful book.

For one thing, when I bought it, I didn't realize Mabel Stark was a real person - and that kind of threw a shadow over the whole book. This is just too salacious and crazy a story to feel entirely comfortable as a fictionalized autobiography, especially when the subject is A) only moderately well-known, and B) only recently dead. 1968 isn't yesterday, but I'm sure there are still people alive who knew and maybe even worked with Mabel Stark.Since the author admits in the afterword that he changed certain things to fit the story, as well as filling in blanks, how much of this is real? What about the numerous, and rather descriptive sexual details?

I thought that Hough's main character was more than interesting, but I just felt that he didn't go far enough with her life. There were great gaps left out, especially in her later life, which I found myself really wanting to know about.She certainly would have had to have been arguably the greatest (certainly the greatest female) tiger trainer of all time. Recounted as Stark is turning 80 in 1968, the faux memoir follows her path to superstardom through the 1910s and '20s as she learns to tame tigers and men, and finally tours with the famous Ringling Brothers Circus.One of the best attributes of this novel is the wonderfully, colourful cover!

Stark was a real-life entertainer, who was a noted act in the Ringing Bros. circus, reaching her peak of popularity in the 20's and early 30's - but the book is an imagined biography, giving the author license to fashion a life as large and colorful as Mabel apparently was.Told in a breezy style, with great humor and very talented wordplay, the author takes us from Mabel's &quot;traditional&quot; life (nurse, housewife) through mental problems, abusive marriages and dance girl days, until she finds both her calling (as a cat trainer) and the love of her life (a lipstick wearing man named Art Rooney, who is a wonderful character, deserving of his own book). Hough gives Mabel a literary voice that begins as sad, shifting to (extremely) wise-cracking, and finally all-knowing. Her adventures with the circus and her many cats (the best parts of the book involve Mabel's interactions with her many felines over the years, and this interaction propels the story and brings about the shifts in Mabel that prove to be her ultimate triumph), are both hysterical and thought-provoking - much like something Tom Robbins would write.This book is an unexpected pleasure - I picked it up because of the classic circus design on the cover, because I had never heard of the wirter, or book before (it is a first novel by Hough). I'm glad to welcome him as a new talent, and hope that he has more of this wonderful type of storytwlling within himself."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"My name is Virginia Barnes Stonehouse, and I am the daughter of Al G. Barnes, one of the \\"characters\\" in this novel. I enjoyed this novel about Mabel Stark, and I know it is mostly fiction, but I would like to address two points relative to two of the not so fictional characters therein. One is a reference to a particular showgirl who visited Al G. Barnes frequently, who I suspect is my mother Jane Hartigan whose relationship and marriage to Al G. Barnes lasted several years, and whom the novel refers to as \\"vermin.\\" Although I was very young, I well remember living until the age of five on the circus's private railroad car \\"Canadia.\\" I remember all the people mentioned in the novel, including Mabel Stark and her famous black leopard. I was the one who took the role of \\"Alice\\" in the \\"Alice in Jungleland\\" spectacular and it was a great success. The second point is that the novel attributes the loss of my father's circus as due to the claims made against him by various women. I do not recall this to be true either. When my parents divorced my father was ordered to pay my mother a monthly sum for alimony and child support, but he rarely paid these sums on time and my mother had to call or go to him to receive what he owed her. After my father sold his circus, he invested the money he received into trying to find oil on his property that had once been the winterquarters of the circus. There was no oil and he was left penniless. After he died my mother claimed the home left on the property, and we lived there for several years until my mother sold it. We never received anything more. Al G. Barnes is still remembered and talked about by many people, including myself, several of his grand children and now his great great grand children. I thought I should make clear that despite how the novel portrays it, my mother was not \\"vermin\\" and my father was not a pathetic victim of voracious women."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"Mabel Stark a real circus performer known for her famous tiger taming acts from the 1920's is the main character of this fictional memior by Robert Hough. The story begins with the 80 year old Stark telling her life story or confession and it is a thrill for us to read. Mabel has had more action packed into her life than most.She begins life as Mary Haynie a teenage nurse in a small Kentucky town who ends up in a disasterous marriage and as a result finds herself in a mental institution suffering from a supposed nervous breakdown. When a sympathetic psychiatrist helps her to escape, she finds a job the only place she can, a cheap carnival as a dancing girl. Following another disaster of a marriage she is forced to dance \\"cooch\\" and finally gets spotted by Al. G Barnes who runs a somewhat more respectable carnival. It is here that Mabel encounters her beloved tigers and marries for a third time to well know animal trainer Louis Roth. Although the marriage doesn't work out, her career taming tigers is a smash hit. Barnes buys her a tiger cub named Rajah and Mabels life changes. Hough does a fascinating job describing life in the carny and creating the fictional life for all these historically real people. Mabels accounts of raising Rajah and the act she develops and the maulings she survives are nothing short of astonishing. She has a very interesting relationship to the animals.As Mabel moves through husband number four, she is sought after and hired by the Ringling Bros. circus and becomes a bonafide star. She discovers that fame is not all it's cracked up to be and it is at one of her lowest points that she meets her true love Art, husband number five. It is a very poignant love story that the reader is treated to and you can't help but root for Mabel to be happy after what she has endured. But this story is full of surprises and twists and I was hanging on every word wondering much as Mabel would muse, what life was going to bring her next. I thoroughly enjoyed this story, at 422 pages, it was slow in some parts but overall it was a pleasure to discover Mabel, her world and the unique,quirky characters in her life."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"\\"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark\\" is a colorful novel about an equally colorful circus performer during the Roaring 20s. It is loosely based on the life of Mabel Stark, the greatest female circus tiger tamer in history. Since little is known about Mabel's actual personal life, author Robert Hough uses his imagination to paint a vivid portrait of a spunky woman, plagued with self doubt and self-destructive tendencies, who has more problems handling men than she does her beloved tigers.Mabel was orphaned early in life, married young, and was committed to a mental institution when she would not perform her wifely duties. She escaped the institution and joined the circus. She suffered through five unusual marriages and many a serious mauling by her animals. This story is told in flashbacks by the 80-year-old Mabel as she looks back on her life and confesses her guilt over the tragic things she feels responsible for. Be forewarned that Mabel has some quirky sexual escapades with both men and tigers in this story.This well-researched tale immerses you in circus life in its heyday, when animal acts were much more dangerous and scams much more blatant than in today's circus. You meet carnies, grifters, freaks, cooch dancers, and star performers. You travel circus trains across the country, watch the big top being erected, and then sit under it and watch the show. You learn about the temperament of the big cats and how they are trained. You meet circus owners John and Charles Ringling, as well as Clyde Beatty, and Al G. Barnes. I recommend this book for its realistic circus ambiance. I also enjoyed the interesting voice of Mabel herself, sometimes happy, often sorrowful, always uncertain, as she unburdened her soul. Read the book now, then see the upcoming movie starring Kate Winslet as Mabel.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I was a *huge* fan of Glen David Gold's CARTER BEATS THE DEVIL. In fact, that book ruined my appreciation for most of the last year's fiction. It was a long road back, until now. Hough's great work in this book makes it a *perfect* book to read after suffering Carter withdrawal.Take the early 1900s in American circuses as the setting, light a spot on a unique female tiger trainer, and prepare to be entertained silly. Hough's writing isn't complex, nor is it necessarily lyrical. What it is, if you must know, is perfectly on spot. He works masterfully with the flavor of the piece. It's like going to a great restaurant versus glitzy. He serves you something you go home talking about.This is a perfect book to give someone who's looking for something different to read."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"Interesting novel, but not a biography, November 22, 2004Reviewer: Natasha Gerson \\"Natasha Gerson\\" (Netherlands) - See all my reviewsThis book is a riveting read, but it's not an autobiography, or faction-type historic novel. It doesn't come even close.It is pure fiction and doesn't give any real insights into the life of Mabel or her circus counterparts at all, or indeed into general circus life. It might seem wellresearched but in its circus detail leans heavily on books like Fred Bradna's My 40 years under the Bigtop, so those interested in real circus history had better read that. That this one is pure fiction is masked by the pictures of Mabel in the book, and the mentioning of real people, which gives off its biographical air and which causes it to frequently be sold and reviewed as a biography. But it really isn't.The discription of Mabel's domestic arrangements with the tiger Rajah is no more than absurd. Nobody can share a bed in a Pullman car for years with a full grown Bengal. There are strange conclusions in the book, such as animals that have gone 'rogue' are not in fact killed as ordered but sold off on the cheap within the circus. The question would be, why would they do that? A dead tiger is, and has always been, in it's bits and pieces like skin, claws and teeth, much more valuable than any living tiger, certainly a live one gone vicious out of domesticacy, which is worthless. In the same vein as mrs Barnes saddening remarks on her mother being branded as 'vermin' by the book, the author places Lilian Leitzel at a 1921 Ringlings night out with Mabel remarking upon Leitzels 'insane husband, Alfred Codona'. Leitzel didn't meet Codono until 1926 though, and married him in july 1928. Codona was far from insane till after Leitzels accidental death in 1931, generally known before that as no more than a dedicated, if somewhat arrogant, artist.The circus life as portrayed in this book comes across as very leasurely to me, everyone seems to have so much time to do all kinds of other things, to go out, even on holiday, skip performances, maintain complicated love lives.The truth of circus then and now though, is that it is no more than a constant of gruelling hard work that leaves little lifes beside. But thats not so interesting, so the true stories are never told. Mabel, however, a woman working with tigers all her life, and her counterparts, deserve a better way of being remembered than a fictional, in places sordid novel"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I picked up &quot;The Final Confession of Mabel Stark: A Confession&quot; at the airport. I was looking for a little light reading to keep me occupied during a boring flight, but what I discovered was a fascinating read I couldn't put down. This book worked for me on several levels. Being a writer myself, I was charmed and captivated by the unique 'voice' author Robert Hough gives Mabel. The writing is crisp, clear and wonderfully evocative. You don't just see, hear and smell Mabel's life... you feel it. I found the depiction of Mabel to be far more multi-faceted and textured than the typical fictionalized hero. The Mabel of this book is courageous and heroic, yet at the same time she is a deeply, deeply flawed person. Her poor choices and self-destructive tendancies keep her from true happiness throughout her life. Yet the reader still has sympathy for Mabel and finds an inordinate number of reasons to admire her. Mabel is not the typical 'hero' who is so close to perfect that he or she doesn't seem human. The message in this book is that even flawed humans can contribute in lasting ways. Finally, I found this book to be an intriguing insight into a world that no longer exists. The descriptions of circus life in the 20s and 30s illustrate a time before people grew so jaded... when they willingly suspended disbelief and allowed themselves to truly enjoy the magic and illusion of the circus. If you enjoy biographies, historical fiction or have an interest in an insider's view of circus life you will likely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"When I read the enthusiastic review in the San Francisco Chronicle, I rushed to buy this book. I was disappointed on two fronts.First, the story seems like an odd choice for a \\"truth-based novel.\\" On one hand, this truth was apparently stranger than fiction, so why did he fictionalize it? At times, I desperately wanted access to \\"the truth.\\" For instance, I wanted to read Mabel Stark's own account of her quasi-sexual relationship with the tiger -- an account that actually exists -- not the author's speculation about her state of mind. On the other hand, the very idea of Mabel Stark evidently triggered the darker corners of the author's imagination, so why did he limit himself to the plot laid out by the biographical details of her life? At times, it felt like he was hiding some emotional truth that an invented story might have revealed.Throughout my reading, I often felt frustrated.My second area of complaint is somewhat superficial, but I think this contributed to my sense that the author's own emotional and psychological perspective intruded upon the writing.Stark was evidently a woman who had (at best!) ambivalent relationships with men, and one who earned her fame in feats of athleticism and bravery that were amazing in a person of any gender. I was a little disturbed that Hough's fictional Mabel would choose to frame the narrative of her life as a journey that starts with...er...manually servicing a bedridden man, and ends with...er...orally servicing another bedridden man!"},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"I wasn't prepared for the adventure this book took me on. I loved the flavor of the book and despite first thoughts came to love the heroine and sympathize with her. Mabel's circus history was full of fun characters and wonderful moments.

It's like taking a trip to the circus!I cannot wait for the Kate Winslet movie which is in the process of being made."},{"Title":"The Final Confession of Mabel Stark","review":"The Circus is In Town! A Book Review of The Final Confession of Mabel Stark by Robert Hough, Grove Press Books, 2001, paperback p.430.This is one of those books that is plastered with quotes like &quot;Great Storytelling!&quot; and &quot;Extravagantly Entertaining!&quot; With its hodge-podge, yellow and red drawings of tigers in a ring with a wavy haired, female tiger-trainer...it was eye-catching enough to give it a chance. I was glad I did. This Final Confession frolics through an eye-opening, e, sometimes shocking, sometimes sad life, a life fully lived.Through research, writing skill and imaginative recreation of a colorful, explicit, no-holds-bared character, Mr. Hough revives Mabel Stark. He dives to the core of Mabel's being, let's her develop and tell her story as she wants. She meanders back and forth through time, from her childhood to the death of her parents, to various marriages, and to &quot;the circus coming to town&quot;. Through the detailed description of animals, landscapes and various characters brought to life through &quot;recollected&quot; dialogue, we traveled back and forth across America and through the first half of the twentieth century.It is one of those stories I don't want to tell much about, as the unfolding and the surprises, in spite of much foreshadowing, were phenomenal. Mabel, the most famous female tiger-trainer in history, was quite an animal, herself. She experienced life without much pretense, was straight-forward and seemed to embody a tiger's spirit. If a tiger could talk...what would she say? Well, I guess Mabel does tell us that, and much, much more, in her last confession."},{"Title":"The Thinker's Toolkit: Fourteen Skills for Making Smarter Decisions in Business and in Life","review":"This book is packed with useful content.

Also, since much of this book is based on the new (in 1884) science of anthropology - a close cousin to psychology and psychiatry - I generally find it pretty easy to get my head around the concepts that he presents.It stands out really clearly in this book that he and Marx trace the origins of class society to the agricultural revolution (when human beings started raising crops and animals instead of being hunter gatherers) - which immediately resulted in a \\"surplus\\" of food - which became the responsibility of an elite (chieftains and priests) to safeguard for the winter and hard times.He also traces the necessity for men to trace their offspring once there is a surplus and they begin to accumulate wealth (the keepers of the surplus get to keep a little more of it than everyone else). Because by this time human beings have figured out how babies are made and want to bequeath their wealth to their descendents. This can only happen if they can trace their paternity, which means limiting women (but not men) to a single sexual partner. Thus the need to replace matriarchal society with patriarchy and to introduce the marriage contract to bind women to a single man.Engels then traces how this primitive \\"tribal\\" structure, eventually led to the concept of private property - and of the feudalistic state. To have a state you have to have a king or supreme leader. He maintains power via a standing army and rewards \\"knights\\" in his army with gifts of private property. And because property is no longer owned communally, people are forced off the land they used to farm and have no choice but to go and work as serfs for the knights and lords who now own the property by the king's decree.The book contains a fascinating section about the way the Iroquois Nation governed themselves - including their use of consensus in decision making, inheritance through the female line and their collective ownership of property. He also outlines how various Iroquois tribes were united in a Confederacy governed by a Federal Council (which formed the basis for state-federal structure the colonists adopted in the US Constitution).The section about democracy in ancient Athens and the coalescence of Latin tribes into a single Roman government is also extremely interesting. The final section concerns the amalgamation of the various Germanic tribes into the states of Germany and France.By Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, author of THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT: MEMOIR OF AN AMERICAN REFUGEE.regard for all members of the tribe as having an equal voice (with men and women playing an equal role in leadership), , insistence on consensus decision making, their"},{"Title":"THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY, PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE STATE.","review":"I like this book, of course.

It connects the development of the modern family and the subsequent oppression of women as intimately linked to the development of capitalism. The flaws in this text come from his use of Lewis Henry Morgan and the problematic notion of a universal and linear evolution of human society. Though that has found to be anthropologically incorrect, the true value of this text and its contribution to socialist and communist thought lies in the aforementioned connection between the oppression of women and the emergence of capitalism."},{"Title":"THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY, PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE STATE.","review":"Marx and Engels made a fundamentally wrong guess about the nature of human beings. But it is very important to understand their line of reasoning, because they developed quite a few critical insights along the way.

So, the only way to enlighten yourself is to dig right down into originals."},{"Title":"When Feeling Bad is Good","review":"Where other self-help books tend to perpetuate readers' bad feelings by pointing to something that is &quot;wrong&quot; with them, Ellen McGrath does something infinitely more helpful: She provides clear, rational, *cultural* explanations for women's depression and offers action-oriented approaches to dealing not only with the depression itself but also with the factors contributing to it.McGrath explains that cultural pressures and attitudes cause women to become depressed about their relationships, bodies, and age - making us feel victimized, depleted, and angry. The depression caused by these forces, McGrath tells us, is natural, normal: &quot;To not feel angry or victimized by some of our typical female experiences would be to live in a fantasy world of denial&quot; (p. 7). Yet, she reminds us, we are living in a time when we have more opportunities, more power available to us than women from any other time: &quot;We can reclaim and transform the negative energy we had devoted to suppressing and denying these bad feelings and use it instead to set our lives moving in a healthy new direction. Once we accept that there are times when feeling bad is good, we've taken an important step toward living more fulfilling lives...&quot; (p. 8). She then goes on to show her readers how this can be accomplished through taking action, self-exploration, and learning to recognize the forces at work around and inside us.This book is currently out of print. As a woman who has found it incredibly helful and healing, though, I think it should be brought out of retirement. McGrath refuses to see us as passive, helpless victims, and I think it's high time we refuse to see ourselves that way, too! This book can help."},{"Title":"Adobe Illustrator CS2 @work: Projects You Can Use on the Job","review":"\\"Let's get it out of the way right up front: Illustrator scares some people.\\" From that opening line, I knew this book was for me.I've avoided learning Illustrator during the 15 years I've been in graphic design and related fields both professionally and for fun. I had learned other vector-based programs like Flash and Fireworks just fine. I was aware of so many beautiful and exciting illustrations created by designers proficient in Illustrator. But, alas, Illustrator and it's foreign tools scared me.Scared no more. With the purchase of Creative Suite 2, I decided NOW was the time to face my fears and become a more well-rounded and proficient designer.The book's author not only takes you through a project-oriented approach to learning the tools of Illustrator. But he stops to share insights and tidbits of wisdom from his long and successful career along the way.The first project, well picked for first ups, takes you through creating a simple logo using all of the common, yet often misunderstood, if not feared, tools of Illustrator. This chapter alone, is worth at least half of the book's price. Before reading this chapter, my understanding of the pen tool and it's myriad options was to draw your curve or line and if you make a mistake, fix it with undo and try again.After just the first chapter, I understood how to start with a rough pencil sketch (whether by hand or in Illustrator) and use the pen tool and guides to create perfect curves and lines for a polished look - think conceptualizing a comic book page and then refining with pen and ink and then finally giving your page life with color and effects.This book does not claim to be a beginner's book, nor does it claim to teach you everything about Illustrator step-by-step. Know what it is when you pick it up. It will teach you to use the power of Illustrator, but I would recommend that you be already VERY familiar with any other Adobe product and the common Adobe interface, or at least pretty computer literate. I'm used to reading technical instruction books, and still I found myself re-reading several lines to decipher something that was left out, or poorly described (or completely in error). That was very frustrating at times. If you don't feel you are an intuitive person (i.e. mind reader at times), you may wish to start learning illustrator elsewhere.I also am not convinced that Illustrator is the best program to use for some of the projects presented here (I would use InDesign for magazine ads and tri-fold brochures for example).Those being the book's only weakness, I still give it 4 stars for everything wonderful that it is and for helping me to overcome my fear of Illustrator.Less than 30 days ago, I was a Illustrator novice. Now I'm proud to show my Illustrator illustrations to all.

When you pay thirty or forty dollars for a computer book, you should make sure that it is worth your hard-earned money. Personally, I only buy what I really need. The first question I ask, is; will the purchase of a specific computer book add any value to my life. By that, I mean, will it help me in my job, with my personal life or help me accomplish anything. Since I'm an author, technical writer and editor as well as a programmer, I'm a hard cookie to sell. Working hard for my money and giving it away is not my style. So, I want you to know that what you read in this review is the honest truth. Everyone has different needs and only you will know if buying a certain computer book will aid you in what you want to accomplish.Adobe Illustrator CS2 @Work is an exceptional value that I could not pass up. Published by Sam's Publishing, I believe it is really worth the money and here are some of the reasons I bought it. This book is not one of those lengthy computer manuals that you have to spend hours wading through before you find the answer you seek. No, this book is different.How is it different? It is designed to focus the user on learning Illustrator by creating projects that allow you to create many useful things while following step-by-step instructions. The amazing thing is that while some of the projects seem simple-such as creating a logo, for instance-you are actually learning how to use tools and techniques that can be applied to accomplishing other tasks such as designing a cover for a book or something similar. Here are a few of the useful projects you will work on:Create web sites and extravagant graphics for your siteCreate business graphics, newsletters and handoutsLogosPostersProfessional advertising materialsBrochuresPackaging art for labels and other materialsArt for CD/DVD labels and coversBusiness cards.These are only a few of the projects and tasks you will work on. This innovative book will teach you practical, useful and efficient ways to use Illustrator. The focus of the book is to teach you to start and complete projects without having to search through dozens of pages to find out how to do what you need to do. The material in this book is tailored for everyone including the novice and the person with more advanced knowledge of Adobe Illustrator. That means that just about anyone can benefit from this book.The book is project oriented and in each well-defined project, you learn how to create such things as logos, business cards and copy proofs. Along with step-by-step instructions-just like the teacher was standing right in the room with you-you are presented with many helpful tips. When you do these projects, you learn how to use tools and processes, as you need them. This means that you don't have to learn each tool before you do anything useful.This book definitely has broad appeal. Web site designers, artists, corporate users, and even writers can benefit from the knowledge obtained within its pages. The techniques you learn here can be applied to many other situations. For example, you learn how to create business cards. By learning how to create and manipulate appealing text, you can apply that skill to creating text for you web pages or even for book covers. Of particular interest to those in the business world will be the projects on creating graphs and charts for presentations and reports. Worthy of noting is the fact that you can download project templates and finished projects from [...].As a writer and editor, I consider this book one of my most important tools because I've already found uses for many of the things I've learned from its pages. I've been an author, technical writer and technical editor on over four hundred computer books and technical manuals. As a person who has read my share of such books, I can attest to the fact that you'll enjoy using this book and you'll be happy with what you learn from it. Maybe it won't bring enrichment to everyone's life-there are always exceptions-but it sure has helped me in my business.Adobe Illustrator CS2 @Work is available at most computer bookstores, online at amazon.com and [...]. It sells for around thirty dollars. You can also get information about the book at Sam's Publishing web site.Dallas G.

To anyone else considering this book for anything other than CS2: Stop. Turn back. It will only make you salivate for CS2, for the features CS2 has that earlier versions of Illustrator lack.That said, I've since been able to upgrade to CS2, and this book, although modestly helpful -- (it uses projects to teach, and who has time to work through the book's projects? I've got my OWN projects to complete, and need to get up to speed, fast, on only the tasks required for my project) -- is not nearly as helpful for a complete Illustrator nincompoop (i.e. me) as is the Quick Start CS2 guide by Elaine Weinmann, also available here on Amazon.This book is the one that should've been included in the box with the software, instead of the semi-useful one that was there.

I consider myself an intermediate (if not close to advanced) Illustrator user. I use it constantly for work, school, and other personal projects.This book has not made sense to me since I opened it. The steps are incomplete, not specific enough, and the lack of graphics makes it very very difficult to follow into the next step. If you are new to Illustrator, you will most likely be lost by the middle of every project. Not only that, but it seems this author likes to take the long and difficult way to get things done! I could do these projects faster if my instructor would just say, \\"Look at the final project example and do that\\" rather than having to follow these vague, inconsistent steps.It's absolutely unbelievable how horribly written this book is, with excessive typos and jumbled up steps that seem to be crammed together to save page space. The author also likes to go off on unrelated tangents in an attempt to be witty and amusing. Not to mention the seemingly inappropriate and suggestive comments, and one of the projects which was so offensive to me, I refused to do it for class at all.This book is insulting, frustrating, and just a complete mess. If you want to learn anything about Illustrator, please go elsewhere. I can't even think of anything this book is good for other than a headache (or to line your birdcage with). Please do not buy it.

The presentation of this book is absolutly brilliant. It teaches its lessons indirectly through the use of folklore and story telling. For example, &quot;Skeleton Woman&quot; is a must read. I'm sure that most women identify with the Skeleton Woman, it is a classic story demonstrating the beauty of a nurishing love. Men need to &quot;sleep&quot;, to allow a woman to drink his tears, grow from his ideas, and share his quintessence. I think men should read this chapter to understand the importance of a woman. He needs to let a woman &quot;drink his tears&quot;. She in return would nurish him spiritually and mentally. From this sharing, the fruit of a home and prosperity are born. Man needs to stop running at first glance of a woman's &quot;bare boned&quot; soul. He misses much. This book will help any woman reconnect with her wild nature -- her instinctual nature. Women will learn how to make progress toward forgiveness without severing their own spirit. Find the right mate, like in the story &quot;Manawee&quot;.

It almost reads like scripture, and like scripture it abounds in oblique, vague language that can be applied to infinite life situations.But that very strength is also its weakness. Just as Bible verses can be infinitely used to back up what one wishes to do and say in one's life, so can that be done with the wisdom in this book...because both are often quite vague.The book's major thesis is how women can \\"return to the wild\\". It implies that's good and that women should do so; however it never gives specifics for how a woman can or should actually do this in real life. The text overlooks, or avoids, the very real consequences of \\"returning to the wild\\" via making major life changes that can be quite painful to self and others.A beautifully written book, but proceed with caution, especially if you're impressionable."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"My sister Hannah gave me this book ages ago and it is one that I read and re-read a lot.

Cammile Paglia, Susie Bright, and others are examples of what Ms Estes writes about. Or better yet rent the movie Auntie Mame with Roz Russell and see what I mean. Retrieval of intuition and Joyous Body the Wild Flesh, and Self Preservation: Identifying Leg Traps, Cages and Poisoned Bait are good reads.

We can learn as much as women can from this ingenious book from Clarissa Estes. The parables she tells and the interpretations she provides have truly opened my eyes to many of the issues faced by women. In a style that is easy to read and even easier to understand, WOMEN WHO RUN WITH THE WOLVES contains lessons for both genders to learn. Though a few of Estes' statements are gender-specific, much of her wisdom is universal. Guys, we've been asking all of our lives what women want. My guess is they want us to read this book"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"So WHY isn't it on Kindle??? The publisher has granted permission. It is available as an audio book.

Here is inexpressible creativity that expresses through these written and spoken words...Dr. Estes is not drawn to the single line but moves artfully in the mystery of the circle and the spiral...All of Dr.E's works are the highest quality both written and spoken...The only thing i regret from listening to Dr. E's voice is audio recordings from other authors never measure up to her magical and lyrical voice that has depth, breath, and height..She could read the phone book and i would find it to be a sound healing...The world of the soul has long been known to be secret and sacred...Dr.E's works never reduces the mystery of the soul or the sacred to a single direction or preference.. Where ever this author writes or speaks there is a light to gather healing, sight, and Source within one's Self/Soul...These are transformative stories and how they are delivered are long lasting gems for soul full unfolding."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Well, the book should be read by every woman (and men who can relate), especially those going through life changing events, then the understanding of what drives us, and what ultimately keeps us alive, is understood. If we don't understand ourselves we will never be able to reach the happiness we deserve. Happiness and joy that comes from the soul are quite different from the artificially induced happiness, that as an American we are taught to create, all too often developing toxic environments that kill, that which is precious and life-fulfilling. I see now life gives me the answers when I ask, and when I listen, to anything I am struggling with. It is a power we should all have. It is a power that eliminates all need for war and hatred and selfishness in anyway. Wow, I can't believe I said that!!"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Steven B. Herrmann, PhD, MFTAuthor of \\"Walt Whitman: Shamanism, Spiritual Democracy, and the World Soul.\\"\\"If men are going to ever learn to stand it,\\" writes Clarissa Pinkola Estes in her bestselling book \\"then without a doubt women have to learn to stand it. If men are ever going to understand women, women are going to have to teach the configurations of the wild feminine to them\\" (93). Since I read these lines and began to take instruction from the Wild Woman in Clarissa and inside myself, I have been and continue to be a big fan of Women Who Run With the Wolves. I have an inner woman who runs with her. My first encounter with a real wild woman was when I met the Jungian psychotherapist, writer, mystic, and teacher at UC San Francisco, Katherine Whiteside Taylor, no doubt a living testament of the Wild Woman archetype. Katherine lived alone and I was her spiritual son and friend for eleven years, from 80 to 91 right up to the day of her death. Katherine was involved in the work of her vocation, a calling from the deep unknown, the Rio Abajo Rio, or \\"river beneath the river\\" (Estes, p. 31). This river knowledge was transmitted to me through the techniques she used and which she encouraged in me: dream work, active imagination, dance, meditation, prayer-making, writing, and song. She would descend into the \\"deepest mood of great love and feeling,\\" till her \\"desire for relationship with the wildish Self\\" overflowed (Estes, p. 28), and it was this that she transmitted to me with her ecstatic core of numinous feeling; it was this to which I was drawn. Katherine was a shamaness with a penchant for \\"singing the creation hymn\\" (ibid.). She loved the prayer of Saint Francis Assisi and recited it every time I visited her. Archetypes have a way of manifesting themselves in reality. Just as I saw the Wild Woman archetype flow through the spirit of this beautiful woman who became my first female mentor in the late seventies and early eighties, so too did I experience the power of the wildish female Self again--that is neither masculine nor feminine but transcendent of both genders--during winter and spring of 1991, at a time when Estes' book was just going into print. At that time I was going through a period of psychic aridity. My spiritual life was drying up and the psychoid region of the collective psyche or the World Soul, the Rio Abajo Rio which Estes talks about--was pulling me down into the headwaters of my nativity. I began to write poetry of the Wild Man in quest of Wild Woman. Following a dream about three wolves, I wrote a poem called \\"wolf-mate.\\" Then I came upon Clarissa's book. This book was the first book written by a post-Jungian woman that spoke to me about the nature of spiritual democracy between the sexes in a beautifully poetic way. It was wonderful to leaf through it on a summer's day in the Orinda hills when I was beginning to write out the meaning of my destiny. I highly recommend this book for any writer. It is American and it speaks to us exactly where we are, out of the voices of the shamanic psyche."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This book is so much more than words can ever say! I first read this book when I was 18 or 19 years old and since then, over 20 years later, it is still read and re-read.

Once I got home to start reading it, I got the black smudges all over my fingers, and the really poor quality of print made it close to impossible to concentrate on the reading. I managed to get through some 50+ pages but just couldn't finish the book. I tried two or three times, to covercome this problem, but the paper color was quite brownish, and I just gave up in the end. I realized I couldn't give this book to any of my friends, and had to let it go. The one memorable part of the book was something about Ugly Duckling, and \\"unmothered mothers\\" theme.Also the written quality of the book is such that it is quite chatty and repetitive.

I suppose there are many individuals who, in mass society, feel so insignificant that any fantasy activity is appealing to them, but whether it really will help them along the path of self-improvement and to find meaning in life, I seriously doubt. The so-called Spanish of the author hardly qualifies as Spanish for its many flaws and shortcomings, and I suppose that her assumed Hispanic aspect is as shallow in meaning as her vulpine activities. Men, however, may find reading this tome of value in determining which females to avoid (like the plague)."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I read this book hoping for a little insight and perspective from an educated women and found myself abysmally disappointed. This book failed to capture not only my interest but the interest of every person I lent it to. Pinhola makes exceedingly long reaches to arrive at primitive conclusions (no pun intended), and fails to integrate the slightest hint of logic into her tales that supposedly incorporate a new feminist theory. If this is an &quot;I am woman, hear me roar&quot; chant, it is sure to back fire, serving only to show those of us who already know we're worth something that there are some women who keep our gender from advancing and being taken seriously!

As we discover what was lost or given up we are also given the tools to go about reclaiming instincts that can bring us into a place of awareness; instinctual enlightenment. Intellectually stimulating and a thinker's paradise, this work touches reality as deeply as it does myth -- Estes uses language that motivates, inspires, and also tenderly, lovingly imparts an understanding of the trials I endured and the wrong (and right) choices I made. &quot;Forgive as much as you can&quot; she writes, &quot;forget a little, create a lot.&quot; -- &quot;Refuse to be ashamed.&quot; My book is the hardcover first edition, 1992. It is underlined, highlighted, bookmarked, post-it tabbed, etc. It is virtually in hunks and I carry it around in a gallon ziplock bag to keep it somewhat intact. Oh, but that I would have known growing up what I learned here. - Thanks to Dr. Estes for creating a safe place for me to work out my life and for providing the nurturing that gave me strength and courage to be proud and respectful of my self. I'll never toss my scarcoat. I earned it and I'm glad to trade my survivor status for &quot;thrivor.&quot; And, to Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estes, I'm leaving deep footprints because I can!

(As with the first blush of infatuation, we often focus on how our own physical, emotional and social cravings will finally be fulfilled--how greedy we can be, thinking that this avarice is 'love'!) Then the 'fish', as he pulls it out of the water, turns out to be a terrifying other-thing, a skeleton, which he cannot disentangle from his line: a horrifying apparition confronting him with his own mortality, which he cannot escape. He runs in terror to his igloo but cannot shake her. After exhausted sleep, he wakes and dares to truly see her, finally--and feels... instead of terror, compassion--for he has mangled her utterly by dragging her behind him on his fishing line. As he untangles her and puts her bones back together, he experiences her full humanity, and then (as she transforms into a living being again) her beauty and warmth, and finally, genuine love. Born of empathy, giving, care... abandoning greed, and embracing his own flawed humanity with tenderness.This is how I recall this story, as told by Est&eacute;s in \\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\".

Estes continues the path and this is a new way of seeing fairly tales. Stop being the damsel needing the White Horse! Estes advances the archetype of the Queen in all female.

The exception being &quot; Women who run with the wolves&quot;. Clarissa's writing is so clearly intuitive and knowing that I carry this book with me if I am going to be away from home for more than a couple of days.I can just open the book at any page and connect with her writing. The creativity is astounding. I have always thought and felt that there is not always answers or solutions, just but instead a way of knowing, feeling and loving. Of course it is hard to allow things to unfold at times and to lose &quot;control&quot;Clarissa gives you the warning signs which amount to intuitive sense and gut feeling. She shows us that if we listen to ourselves more often we will develop this sense even further.

My experience is the opposite; when I've picked up Jung's original works I've found them tough to follow, but this book I found very accessible and useful. I don't think the comparison between the Bible and a tv evangelist is at all fair. It's more like the difference between Strunk &amp; White and the Oxford English Dictionary. The OED is wonderful, but Strunk &amp; White is the one that is most likely to help you become a better writer.Although I think of myself as a creative person, I tend to downplay that part of myself and to lead with my left brain, as it were. Reading this book I felt like I was being given a path to my inner wellspring. I felt that I had at last found water for a thirst I hadn't quite been able to identify until now.This book is about one's inner life. It is not a how-to book, it's not political (except in the sense that the personal is political), and I didn't feel that it over-emphasized &quot;what's wrong with you,&quot; as another reader put it. It does continually nudge one to think about what might be wrong: many many women are cut off from their own preferences, their own inner selves, because they feel pressured to conform with societal norms. Many societal norms are, in my opinion, quite damaging and inappropriate. It is very easy in American society to get the impression that women should be seen and not heard. Women are still encouraged to focus on how we look, to be compliant, to act ladylike and be nice even when we are being denigrated, and to stand by our man no matter what. We are encouraged to help others at the expense of our own happiness, and many many of us fall into this trap without even realizing it. We think it is normal to put ourselves last, and we lose touch with the shames and the fears that keep us from being happy, wiping the subject of happiness off the table with a dismissive hand as something that is too indulgent or not important.This book helped me realize the ways in which I stand in my own way, and it gave me courage and inspiration.The author is not only a Jungian analyst, but a storyteller. She is steeped in the traditions of storytelling from both the Latin and the Hungarian sides of her family, and I very much enjoyed the ways in which she uses this legacy of the storyteller as healer to make her points. I never thought of storytelling in this way before, but reading this book I found it to be true. (I feel that her stories have helped heal me.) I am a storyteller myself, of a sort, so for me the book was a kind of homecoming. If you have ever wondered why fairy tales seem so cruel and peculiar, you will find the answers in this book. Fairy tales have been mangled in the translation, but this author shows you where they came from and what they are really about.While I am a huge believer in free-market capitalism, growth, business, and civilization (as opposed to back-to-nature Green-ery), I have tremendous concerns about the increasingly violent and impersonal nature of our society. This book shows you how to cultivate a healing, loving attitude toward the world without becoming a doormat--quite the contrary, it shows how love can give you more strength and power than you'll ever find in a boardroom.Another review on this page criticized the book for not putting these issues into a broader context of one's life. It took twenty years for this author to distill her wisdom of storytelling and her knowledge of Jungian archetypes into this lovely, readable book. For me, that's quite an accomplishment. I'm more than willing to take it the rest of the way myself."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Since this book was first published in 1992, I have made it my New Year's resolution to re-read Women Who Run with the Wolves every year. I have given more copies of this book away than I can remember - and I am thrilled to do so. I begin again in 2006 for the 15th full reading (though I pick a page throughout the year to journal with and 'wake me up'.)To begin the wondrous journey of discovery to my wild and intutive self is a gift and a new journey to uncovering the jewel within. New depths of power are accessed with every reading and I am bathed in feminine myth and mystery. This book has inspired me to design, write, accomplish and accept fulfillment at so many levels. Please read this book. Women Who Run with the Wolves is a MUST tool for every female. It's a treasure. Elaine Maginn Sonne, PhD, Author Legends of the Stones."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Ancient cultures the world over have all had oral traditions as the roots of their literature, both for the purposes of education and entertainment.In the darkness by the fireside, story-tellers enthralled their fellow tribesmen with tales handed down through countless generations and centuries.What determines which stories are told and re-told on through the ages? Usually, they are tales which illustrate a moral value, a particular quality or a lesson that a particular society deems important. Whether it be a cautionary tale or a legend demonstrating a virtue, we get great insights into what is valued by examining the old, old stories.Until recent years with the advent of Women's Studies on university campuses, the teachings imparted to one's daughters and grandaughters were often overlooked. That glaring omission has been rectified through Clarissa Pinkola Estes' incredible book.&quot;Women Who Run With the Wolves&quot; is not light reading by any means, but is a scholarly exploration of the feminine character. Has civilization tried to strangle our basic &quot;Wild Woman&quot; inner natures? And, if so, at what cost has the shrew been tamed?&quot;Women Who Run With the Wolves&quot; contains some familiar stories from our collective childhoods: The Little Match Girl and Bluebeard. But these are not the soothing, toned-down versions to read by your toddlers' bedsides. Instead, they are terrifying and real.Estes, who is both a Jungian analyst/psychologist and professional storyteller, vividly recounts the visceral details of often violent folklore.Not only are European nursery tales included, but the book is global in scope. Estes also weaves in less familiar traditions, such as stories from the Lakota Indians. The one element running through all the stories is how they relate to women's lives and spirits.In each section, the author gives a scholarly overview of why the tale was told, what values it imparted, and why the story still speaks to us today. She also recounts the story with great dramatic narrative, and it is easy to imagine oneself listening to the tale around a flickering campfire late at night.Ancient wisdom coupled with modern psychological insights make reading this book a mind-expanding experience."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This book is so different, so astounding, that it defies catagorization. The concept of analyzing ancient legends and folk tales to reveal the inner nature of women and the patterns in womens' lives felt revolutionary to me when I first sat down with this book. But then, as I read each segment and digested the author's analysis and correlation with typical life patterns experienced by women, I realized that she tapped into truths which are as ancient as the folk tales and legends themselves. Besides that, she is one of the most ELOQUENT writers I've ever had the pleasure to read. Her observations and their resulting lessons are so profound, so insightful they take my breath away at times. I just have to sit back, take a deep breath, shake my head and reread the section that just overwhelmed me.My favorites are \\"Skeleton Woman\\" and \\"Baubo the Belly Goddess\\". I don't want to give away any surprises... so just get this wonderful book and read these chapters for yourself!

The author uses age-old stories to help the reader understand her life, her heart and her soul better. It is in no way a book against men. It does not encourage irresponsibility or the development of a feral personality. It does encourage women to look inside themselves, to bring out the creativity and emotion within.

Just as the wolves, the wild women are misunderstood and persecuted by those who can't understand them and who despise what is wild, untamed, instinctual, spiritual. As Wolf, the wild woman is strong, wise, loving, spiritual and empowered. She is a survivor, a huntress who fights for her survival and the survival of her &quot;pack&quot; but who always pay homage to Mother Earth and respect for all life. There is a great connexion between women and wolves that must not be denied nor shamed. Both Wolf and the Wild Woman have been persecuted and now risk extinction. Is it not time to learn to respect them and stop denying our instincts? I rediscovered the wild woman in myself and became a better woman into the process, who found my place into the Cycle of Life and strive towards balance.This book should be in every woman's bookshelf, through it you will learn about yourself and your place into the fragile balance of the Earth, wisdom and empowerment. It has a very strong message: To nature and wildlife we are bound and we live in symbiosis. Our survival is bound to balance"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"It took me about 2 years to finish reading this book. I consistently reached a saturation point after each chapter or two and had to stop. Only after digesting for weeks or months was I ready to read on. When I picked up again, the next chapter spoke directly to a current issue for me (sort of eerie). This suggests to me that to get a developmental effect, the book should not be read in one sitting. If one is simply interested in reading a collection of myths and fairytales (without intending to do any inner work), then this is probably not for you.By the way, I'm 38, female, married, career, etc. -- but I can see this book being useful to those on a learning journey regardless of age (or even gender). This book gave me a valuable, new lens for viewing myself and the world. In parts, I thought that \\"this stuff\\" would have sure helped me 20 years ago, but I don't think I would have understood it in the same way then. In parts, I thought that \\"this stuff\\" may help me 20 years from now because I don't fully understand it yet.

As a storyteller, Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Ph.D. does an amazing job of dissecting each fairy tale into bits of useful information. The book is a huge resource for finding new perspectives or frameworks to apply to real life situations. I find her work helps unravel and clarify thinking about specific situations rather than give you prescriptive rules for living. What I responded most to was Estes' style of writing. She writes poetically with lush sentences that give you tactile information. She uses metaphors in ways that invite your imagination to dream on. She writes with overflowing diversity addressing the same issue in a variety of ways and somehow in the multiplicity of her description you sort out your own view on the issue. Estes is an inspiring writer. The book is long, however, so realize you are in for a major read."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"A man in my family blames this book for his divorce. His ex-wife ought not to have been told by her therapist to read it, you see. After reading it myself, I suspect I can see what he means; but that's because the status quo was comfortable for him, and I don't suppose it ever entered his mind that it wasn't equally comfortable for his wife. Now, with my reason for reading disposed of, what did I think of the book from my own viewpoint? That of a professional woman who grew up in the \\"be a nice girl\\" 1950s and 60s?I think that there's a lot of truth here, although it's presented in a manner more scholarly than readable. The stories are fantastic, though, and VERY readable. I just have a hard time with anyone telling me how \\"women\\" feel as if my gender must define me in all ways, forever, because that's simply not the case.Five stars nevertheless.

If you want to think that you are oppressed simply because you are female and that partriarchy is the root of all evil in the world, then maybe this is the kind of narcissistic reading you require in order to get through the day. If you have any self-esteem at all, however, you will see this book for what it is, mildly amusing and thought-provoking but not especially intellectual or &quot;deep&quot;. Archeptypes and mythology are neat to think about, but impractical if you regard them as role-models for personal conduct and everyday living.

Estes' argument seems to accept the premise but with a positive spin. But what's the intellectual gain? Influenced by post-structuralist thought, the academic feminists of the seventies and eighties deconstructed the notion of an &quot;essential&quot; female identity, especially of a unified, universal, archetypal sort. As human beings, each of us has masculine/feminine, animus/anima, Apollinian/Dionysian elements regardless of our &quot;biological&quot; sex. Moreover, these elements are found in the characters of stories told by men as much as by women (consider Homer's Calypso, Athena, Nausicaa, Circe and Penelope or Virgil's Dido and Camilla). But if these books (I'm including the Iron John archetype as well) provide some readers with a sense of personal identity and self-affirmation that daily individual experience does not, perhaps they have some practical value."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I take issue with so many people telling me what is &quot;wrong&quot; with me.

I happen to think all myths surround a kernel of truth. Unfortunately it is possible to arrive at many distortions of truth through interpretation, just like this author.Bottom line? I didn't think much of the book. There is nothing new here. There is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with me. There is very likely nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with you. We are not broken.

Wild woman is validation for the me that I haven't been in touch with for decades. Thank you and keep up the great work."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Clarissa Pinkola Estes gives women an endless gift with her creation of Women Who Run with the Wolves. It's a guide and inspiration that supports and encourages all women on their journey through life to be complete, integrated and wholly alive.As a psychotherapist who specializes in eating disorder recovery I especially recommend Women Who Run with the Wolves to women in any stage of a past or present eating disorder. Eating disorders numb the mind. They so thoroughly block access to a woman's true spirit, beliefs and sense of herself that she can live her life bogged down in the details of food, eating, weight, appearance and fear of being discovered. She denies her true soul yearnings by replacing them with sensation, serial relationships and a roller coaster ride of emotional highs and lows that leave her exhausted, guilt ridden and full of despair.Reading Women Who Run with the Wolves can begin to feed her soul. Estes' stories can reach through the eating disorder mind blockade to touch, however briefly, the essence of the woman trapped beneath the illness. Reading this book on a regular basis can help awaken a woman to the truth of her nature. That awakening can help fuel her determination to be who she really is in this life.Spending time reading Women Who Run with the Wolves is an investment in a neglected self and may well be a major encouragement and support for turning from living with an eating disorder to a life dedicated to recovery.Joanna Poppink, MFTLos Angeles psychotherapist, speakerauthor of Healing Your Hungry Heart: recovering from your eating disordereatingdisorderrecoverydotcom"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"If I was asked to pick a single book each woman must read, regardless of her age, social and marital status, or her career, \\"Women Who Run With the Wolves\\" would be it.Estes weaves her stories beautifully. Her choice of myths, legends and literary examples and archetypes for the common traps a woman may fall in is impeccable. From Bluebeard and Vasalisa the Wise, to The Little Match Girl and Manawee, we are taken through the rainforest of our psyche, down the underground rivers of our souls, over the snowy peaks of our dreams.\\"Women Who Run With the Wolves\\" is more than a set of brilliantly told stories, and more than a compilation of sound, valuable advices from a caring healer.

The word itself carries such a negative connotation that I actually prefer to refer to it as the sacred feminine. This was a good listen, as far as seeing into the archetypes and mythology. However, it was really heavy with the past wounds of the feminine, and I kinda felt more pulled into the pain of all of it then liberated into strength and freedom. I recommendThe Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine (Plus)by Sue Monk Kidd andIx Chel Wisdom: 7 Teachings from the Mayan Sacred Feminineby Shonagh. They are real women's journeys through the discovery of the sacred feminine and they are very inspiring!"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This is the one book I would want to have on the proverbial deserted island . . . it was a gift from my mother 10 or 12 years ago, and I've read it a thousand million times. Depending on what is going on in my life at the time, the stories and interpretations can be completely different from one reading to the next. I have taken away several facets to one story or another over the years, making these precious tales truly alive and magical.The stories are told by an utter genius who is able to find that river beneath the river, that flowing part of ourselves that is the soul."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This book is mythic, spiritual, explores issues of the Soul and that which is deeply feminine, and truly inspires my creativity. It also a very useful self-development tool. The book describes circumstances and situations that a woman may experience in her life, as well as stories as metaphor for those actual events. The myths, and journeys of the characters, are helpful to gain a perspective, or life meta view, that illustrates options which may not be obvious. When we are living our life, in our own heroine's journey, we may be tired, overwhelmed, or unable to process and synthesize our experience very well. Myths and stories allow for, or create opportunities for, enlightenment. What makes this book better than a book of myths of fairy tales is the profound and elegant interpretations and anecdotes offered, alongside the stories, by Dr. Estes. Like a literary ritual, this book is redolent with dream symbology, spiritual meaning and energy, and the reader a chance to trip their feminine Soul light fantastic. The prose and content is rich, deep and moving. Reading and rereading this book can change your life for the better. I hope that the author offers the book for Kindle soon, as this is a book I keep in my library and read again and again."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I've heard about this book for years from women I love and trust. Women who I admire and look up to as fierce warriors and I finally, finally took the time to read this piece. I'm still reading it. Estes writes with a clear voice and shares simple, fairy tales to help her readers along as they learn the importance of staying or getting empowered. From &#34;Bluebeard&#34; to the &#34;Red Shoes,&#34; the book is engaging but never unreachable. Part of it's beauty also is that Estes shares stories from different traditions, interlopes the characteristics of wolves and sprinkles the teaching with Spanish as necessary.One can learn a great deal about the psyche from taking the time to read this. Even for men, this is a great way to learn more about women and how best to let them blossom."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This is my favorite book of all time to date.

It also makes a great gift for graduates and those who are coming out of a job loss or divorce, or other dark times. I enjoyed reading it in my thirties, so many women go through a tough time in their early thirties and have no where to turn except their friends who are going through the same thing.

As a teacher of literature, I have a real appreciation for storytelling--the ritual passing down of stories and the layered meanings. I am happy to have this book as part of my collection. The reason I give this book four rather than five stars is that I wished the storytelling voice carried through to the author's reflection as well. Once the tone of the discussion became prescriptive and psychological, it lost it's power and--with all respect--the author \\"talks too much\\"."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This book really had an impact in my life. After a master's in women's studies that left me disappointed in the sterility of academic feminism, it was refreshing indeed. It resonated with me in many ways and it felt empowering in a profound sense. I really think any woman would benefit from reading it. It is one of the few books that addresses women's lives in a positive, almost magical way. The suggested reading list at the end of the book is also quite valuable."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published.

The first chapter is very slow to start but once you get past it, it's hard to put it down. I started underlining and adding notes as I went along but then realized that about 70% of the book is underlined!The book is a literary treasure and the analysis of the woman archetypes is intriguing.

Absolute essential for all women to read."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet, but I cannot recommend this book enough. I think it is extremely important for all women to read this book, and reconnect with their intuitive feminine selves. Through examining fairy tales and myths, the author helps reconnect the dots where society has separated them. Occasionally I felt she could have kept the book a tad shorter, but I loved it and found it so inspiring that I could never give it less than five stars. If you consider yourself an intuitive female at all, or feel like you once would have, you must read this book.

Amazing truths, thought-provoking stories, and connections from deep archetypes to who and where we are now. I've found it to be inspiring, comforting and helpful at times when I've needed these things. And when I pick up the book and randomly open it, it always comes to a page and story of particular relevance for me at the current moment.

Head to the nearest psychiatrist's couch? Cower in depression? I was fortunate enough to tell a friend who recommended I immediately read Women Who Run With the Wolves. Clarissa Pinkola Estes explores a number of myths, some familar and some unfamilar to most readers of the Western &quot;canon,&quot; to reassure women going through this transformation that they are not &quot;crazy,&quot; but are developing an awareness of the tranforming power of the &quot;wild&quot; soul. This book is life affirming, life saving, and one to read and reread throughout your life. I only wish Dr. Pinkola Estes had written some follow up works to this book that sings &quot;truth&quot; on every page. G. J. Frui"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I think that this book deserves high credit being an original, as far as I know, in it's genre. I love the fact that the author was able to gather so many stories and myths from diverse cultures. The analysis was also thought provoking. But I think that I read this book too late. At 37 years old, a university graduate, married career etcetra I find her book a bit of a downer at times. The emphasis on how to get out from under the thumb of an abusive/domineering man, boss, parent, &quot;friend&quot;, is a bit depressing. I think it's great for those who have been down-trodden to listen to Oprah and Rosanne and Sally Jessy Raphael and Hillary Clinton for that matter to learn truths about destructive interpersonnal relationships. But, although I applaud Ms. Pinkola's originality and thouroughness, it's not for me.What do you think?"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I wasn't sure what this would be about, as it was recommended by a guy. So I found it on audiobook and listened to it while driving on my job. It is a series of stories, not real, but mythical. It is up to us to see where they fit into our lives. They can provide some insight into ourselves. I have since resold the tapes, but not without taping copies so I can listen to them again later. If nothing else, I have new stories to tell others around the campfire."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I read this book several years ago during a two year period of going through a divorce. This book empowered me to get in touch with my inner female voice, listen to my instincts and trust them again (because they were always sending me warning signals I was told to ignore by my overbearing, controlling spouse at the time). This is a wonderful collection of tales from many cultures that remind us women that we are born with an instinctual knowledge of things to come. We, unfortunately, allow others (i.e. the men in our lives) to tell us we are too sensitive, overreacting, imagining things, jealous, distrusting, etc., only to discover that those instincts were right on the mark the entire time! This should be on every woman's bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I re-discovered \\"Women who run with the wolves\\" a couple of months ago. I read it over 10 years ago and find it even more fascinating and enlightening than I did then. It is so full of useful advice - ways of thinking and proding to do our own work with ourselves. My daughter-in-law is going to receive this as a gift. She has read excerpts from it and is as intrigued as I am! It seems a difficult read at times, but is well worth sticking with it!!! A book to keep in your library always and re-read as many times as inclined. I am 63 years old and still find many wonderful passages that are timeless and for all ages."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"It was as if for the first time ever I saw my Great Grandmother, my Grandmother and my mother... and eventually also myself. Women Who Run With the Wolves is about allowing yourself to embrace womanhood. Not by burning bras or refusing to get married but rather by using what is already there, underneath all that, which makes us vulnarable and insecure in our gender. Est&eacute;s takes the reader on an exquisite journey through our inner landscape and her unbreakable faith in the strenght of all women is contagious so that in the end you too cannot help but believe in yourself. Simply life-changing. What more could you ever want from a book?"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Clarissa Pinkola Estes is a gifted storyteller--one who does not just love stories, but also recognizes their ability to stir the soul. She sees each story she shares as a cure for a spiritual deprivation, and so retells each one in her rich, soulful style, adding Latino ethnic twists to increase the illumination. Then, sounding like a village wise woman, she explains the effects of each type of deprivation in the souls and bodies of women. For instance, she interprets \\"The Little Match Girl\\" as a story about the necessity of putting one's creativity (represented by the matches) to good use: the failure to do so makes one freeze to death.Certainly, women need the sort of healing that stories can give them--but so does everyone in the world, male or female. Men just didn't happen to be part of Estes' \\"target audience\\" when she wrote \\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\", I suppose. Yet it is precisely this book that encouraged me to read \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" and \\"The Selfish Giant\\" to my little brothers.The wondrous thing about this book is that it is only one person's opinion about the power of certain myths. Anyone is free to agree or disagree with Estes . . . to take or reject her advice . . . to give her chosen stories different meanings . . . to apply her meanings to different stories. For example, Estes used \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" to lament how a rigid, uncompromising society can oppress mothers into abandoning \\"unconventional\\" children. To that I add that if the ducklings had had a father duck around, then the ugly duckling would have had proper protection from the pond bullies and a lot more backbone.It is also delightful to recognize the archetypes playing hide-and-seek in the fairytales and myths of many cultures. Russia's \\"Vasalisa\\" is uncannily like \\"Snow White\\", except that the cottage in the woods houses a witch (Baba Yaga), rather than seven dwarves. Also, the colors white, red and ebony/black are not found in the features of the story's heroine, but are sewn into the dress of her doll. Then there are the striking similarities between \\"Bluebeard\\" and the Greek myth of Eros and Psyche. (Of course, the difference is that one ends happily and the other does not.)Finally, I love the way almost every sentence here rings with the kind of beauty and passion I have come to expect only in poetry, never in prose. For this reason, I can sit with this book and just dip into the paragraphs to be refreshed.The most potentially disturbing element in \\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\" is Estes' firm faith in the Life/Death/Life cycle--something very pagan. If readers miss the point early in the book, all the references to long-gone goddess-based religions of the ancient world will certainly drive home the fact. Personally, I thought it less bothersome than all the psychological concepts she used--half of which I don't buy at all. I've found that it helps to remind oneself all throughout the story that even though Estes writes of something true and deep, it doesn't follow that all women must identify with wolves (I happen to relate to mice), or feel like wild women, in order to be healthy in spirit."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I had such a hard time getting through &quot;Women Who Run with Wolves,&quot; yet the struggle was so worth it. I discovered Estes' book after Jean Shinoda Bolen's &quot;Goddesses in Every Woman&quot; turned me onto Jungian archetypes. Unlike the Greek myths in &quot;Goddesses,&quot; however, the stories Estes chooses to portray the lessons women need to learn to grown are much darker. Perhaps because Estes' writing requires so much emotional work from the reader, I took a very long time reading this. I would pick it up, read a chapter, put it down for sometimes a month or more, and then pick it up again. As I went through this process, I made an astonishing discovery: Somehow, what followed from the point where I had left off was EXACTLY what I needed when I picked up the book again. What a wonderful gift she has given us!"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"As a male psychologist I applaud this book. The stories are wonderful, the message is very important. If we do not continue to share the stories, all will be lost. From generation to generation, please share the stories.The growth that many of my patients have received from this book is vast. I have gone back to it many times. Recently I shared my own story of my sexual abuse as a child, \\" Above His Shoulders. \\" I thought many times about Women who run with the Wolves as I wrote. I knew the importance of disclosing my story. Not just for my family, but for others who have and have not disclosed their own trauma."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"\\"Women Who Run With the Wolves\\" is roughly 500 pages long and well worth reading. It is such astounding to see or rather to understand the concept of legends and myths to bring forth the psyche of the women. There are fifteen chapters in this book, and each of them revealed new stories and they are truly enlightening.The one story that got me to read and re-read is the \\"Bluebeard\\" story, which is really mind-boggling and chilling.This is very enlightening read and full of powerful insights. And, I do recommend this book to anyone, even men who want to understand their female aspects and the inner nature of women."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I read this book at a time in my life when I was open to looking at who I really am. Each chapter resonated with something deep within that I had been hungering and searching for. This was the pivitol book that began my personal healing inner work. I recommend this book to any woman who wants to find the parts of herself she has lost or disowned. It is much easier to read with the right side of the brain and it does require emotional work as you go along, but very well worth it."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said the book lacks practical advice, real applications to everyday life. I find Estes' connection of fairytales to the psyche intriguing and powerful, but something is lacking.An example: There is the story of the seal woman who skin is &quot;captured&quot; by a man, who is forced to marry him, and then eventually escapes back to the sea.Estes connects this story to loss of one's true self, and equates this with clients she's had who have experienced a major sense of theft in their lives, as in theft of opportunity, for example. She talks about visiting a prison and finding that nearly every woman she worked with had experienced a soul theft and was in the processing of reclaiming her true self. Powerful stuff.She promises through the subsequent tales to show how a woman can &quot;come home&quot;. I eagerly read through, but was disappointed to find that the advice boiled down to: read a favorite poem, sit in a favorite rocking chair. Advice that would work for healing everyday stress, but not for the kinds of &quot;soul-thefts&quot; she originally discussed. In other words, no meat.There is another problem as well, and that is the lack of feminist analysis of fairytales, which were often coded stories of oppression. The seal woman's marriage is a good example. She interprets this as the marriage of the soul to the practical everyday world. However, it also obviously speaks to another, more painful reality of women's lives: forced and/or abusive marriage. And the child who results, the &quot;soul-child&quot; is also the child who helps his mother escape and return to freedom. This consciousness is entirely lacking in her analysis, and helps crystalize what I feel is lacking in the book."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Although a good CD, this is NOT and UNABRIDGED version of the book. It does have some content that the book does not. However, if you, like me, are looking for an unabridged version of the amazing book, this isn't it."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This is a book is a treasure that provides more wisdom everytime I read it. The stories awaken and empower the wild womyn within that society wants to repress. It's about women recognizing and reclaiming power that has been stolen from them. I loved the Chapter Joyous Body: the wild flesh that tells women to celebrate their bodies. One woman was told that the split between her teeth was the sign of a lier and told that her body was evidence of inferiority and lack of self control. How many times does Society tell women such lies and they believe the lies. The Two Women in the story connected with the women of their tribal root. One woman was told that the split in her teeth was a sign of wisdom. The other woman was told that the women in her tribe were built close to the earth and built to hold much. How wonderful that women can celebrate who they are. The Doll in her Pocket tells of Women's Intuition. Wise women pay heed to it. Society wants to invalidate it. A woman's issue of soul ought never be defined by the dictates of a clueless patriarchical society. Women who Run with Wolves does it better. This is a book that will be a classic through out the centuries."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I'm a 37 year old female, a graduate from a women's college (and I'm sure this book was on at least one class syllabus, but I did not read it then), and I'm shocked at how the stories mirror my life experiences. The Red Shoes and Bluebeard are most disturbing. Lessons I wish I had learned years ago! This is a great book. Should be required reading for every woman living in our culture. And any man who wants to really understand women (and, in turn, himself) should also read it.

Also she allows people to stay close to their feelings and to listen to them.As a women, she encouraged me to find and build my inner life, but, unlike some people think it is a long and harduous process, and one does not become a Wild Woman by simply wearing a wolf T-shirt!"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I have bought a copy for evey woman I know.

Yes, I personally think that some would feel this way. I would not 'replace' it with bible &lt;sigh&gt;. Clarissa Pinkola has put to black-n-white, what I could not. She does not necessarily tell us anything that we do not already know, but merely reminds us. And yes, I agree, this is not a how-to-book. There are no 'expectations' other than self-acualization. It has much depth, some can read straight through, others a little at a time. I have come back to it time and time agian. From what I understand of her book, fables were told to help the individual to find their own answers. (Not much different from psycology today.) In each story, you are the princess, the evil step-mother, the magician, the prince, the nice old woman, the scarey witch. For it is you who allows yourself to be decieved. You can save yourself. You seek, you destroy. You create, you hide, you embelish. I have found much spirituality within this book. I talk of the 'power of a woman' quite often. How else can you stand by your man? You cannot do it when you are weak. How can your children depend on you and thrive later in life, if you cannot give them the foundation? This book does not tell you to go run outside without any cloths on, laughing at the world. (Unless that is your calling! :-).) It encourages you to believe in yourself via fables of long ago. I feel that it does shed light on 'social and economic realities'. (I.E. Chapter 9 Homing: Returning to OneSelf pg. 271) &quot;The ego is initially born into us as potential and is shaped, developed, and filled up with ideas, values, and duties by the world around us: our parents, our teachers, our culture. And this is as it should be, for it becomes our excort, our armor, and our scout in the outer world. However, if the wildish nature is not allowed to emanate upward through the ego, giving it color, juice, and instinctive responsiveness, then although the culture may approve of what has been fashioned in this ego, the soul does not, cannot, will not approve such incompleteness of its work.&quot; Also, I find no 'generalization or oddities' in this book that are in any way offensive, if carefully read and comprehended. :-) It also is not just a book for women, as Clarissa states it is also for those men 'who choose to run with women who run with wolves.' In referring small portions of this book to men (I.E. Chapter 4 The Mate: Union with the Other) I have recieved postive feedback in parallel in better understanding the dual natures of both men and women. Clarissa's 'credibility and her considerable scholarship' come second to her gift of storytelling and love of anthropology. I admire her ability to take a close-to-authentic fable from different origins, and to educate, mesmerize, and encourage strenth to me, the reader."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I'm all for reading soul-searching materials, but this book was like pulling teeth - I felt it was translated (and poorly at that) so the sentence structure was long and difficult to follow; NOT that word choice was difficult or that it was above reading comprehension, far from it...some of the sentences just didn't make sense and I often lost their entire meaning."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"This book has many doorways. Some have been harder to enter at times than others for me. Rich. Complex. No simples answers that I would likely discard anyway, saying to myself that the author really doesn't know my circumstances or those of the people with whom I strive to work more effectively.The experiences that rise for me within its pages depends on what I bring out of my life at the time. Some days there is deep inspiration, and I read on for pages in a portion of the text that until then seemed \\"closed\\" to me. Other times a single paragraph or page rises out of the ink and into my mind in a way that seems to best be honored with space and time around it. Some parts are intense and in a certain periods of life I am open to them only sparingly. Even though I know there is solid substance within, I am not always ready...then or yet. Other portions are comforting, strengthening, encouraging ... always. I know I can count on them if such is needed.These are the features which lead me to keep returning to Women Who Run with the Wolves and other works by this author. A text that alternatively was an easy read -- full of well delineated steps by which the author presumes to be able to tell me just what to do in a particular circumstance might indeed be much easier to race through from cover to cover and impress for awhile. But my experience with ones like that is an urge to begin scanning faster in order to see all the punch lines. Then it goes on the shelf or in a box ... but does not become a permanent part of my memory or life.In contrast, the unique way in which this author works with stories and principles of depth has been much more enduring for me. It continues to hold my respect almost 2 decades after its release. I keep it in close proximity. As I age, I see and experience different insights from the same passages I thought I understood before. It has NOT become \\"dated\\" by specific advice that may have been relevant back then but now has drifted out of relevancy. If I had to move and could only take with me a very few books or audios -- Women who Run With the Wolves and other recent works by Dr. Estes would need to be among them.Ironically, the very things for which the Kirkus review seems to fault the book are actually a part of its strength. But then again, given that this company of expert critics acknowledges:\\" Kirkus Reviews receives between 100 and 200 titles per day, a volume that makes quick decisions necessary on the part of the editors.\\" ...from www-kirkusreviews-com / about / submission-guidlines /they essentially demonstrate that if one invests little in time or conscious effort in understanding what a writer has offered, they are likely to reap minimal rewards and feel irritated. No surprise. This is NOT a book to be skimmed lightly. I believe them in the sense that I doubt there are many if any rewards for speed reading it -- instead there could be a growing sense that the doors have closed!!Suggestion. Especially to libraries and purchasers. Look for the reviews here by readers and customers who say something about the experience of living over time with the content of a particular book. Sometimes even living with misunderstanding and then having to make corrections. This kind of information doesn't normally come from professional critics who have been paid to move on to and through several hundred other books by the year's end. Nonetheless what the critic fails to see --- it may be just be what changes lives, even the culture itself -- the sort of thing that matters more in the long run, anyway."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Personally, this book is one of my pivotal books. I was already a very strong female when I read this, but the strength came from bonding with my father, who always encouraged me to excel in whatever I was passionate about, and who did not believe in female sterotypes for his daughter in the 1960-70s. My mother is brilliant and intuitive, but due to circumstances she chose not to fight, never went to college or furthered her music, and she did feel embittered from this. She, I think in order to protect me, (she has always been overprotective) tried to decrease my expectations, and always encouraged a fallback plan of staying in traditionally female roles. So I, in rejecting part of what she represented, the passive, overprotective and dutiful female, was also repressing half of my self, my maternal or feminine side.I did grow up with the femininst movement, but rejected much of their teaching also, due to not understanding fully what they were saying, as they seemed to be \\"anti-male\\", and I was not going to reject a father who was my main emotional support and cheerleader.So there is two very important reasons for this book being pivotal for me when I read it over 15 years ago. One, these folktales, well known to me, were being interpreted from a female, intuitive point of view, which was a way I had never looked at them before. The stories and Dr. Estes interpretations of them from a feminine perspective, did become a basis for discovering my feminine strengths, and accepting this side of me. Her analysis, which to some may be unnecessary, were helpful to reprocess and explore this whole new area. The second reason it was pivotal, is this book is NOT anti-male or anti-masculine for me, at least not about the type of men that I have bonded with."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I can't begin to describe how beneficial this book is. In fact, I would run out of space here before I even got halfway through an explanation. I will forever be referencing this book and gaining new insights with each read. I have a notebook full of notes that I took as I read the book, and applied her statements to my life, and events therein. It explained so much, and made a remarkable connection to just about everything. As I go through my \\"phases\\" in life, I expect more notebooks of scribbled notes, page references and quotes that will certainly apply and give new insights.

My other daughter preferred a CD of the book and when I found this \\"unabridged\\" version, I bought it for her. I was very surprised when she finished it in a little over 2 hours and many of the most compelling stories had been omitted.

It is not. This book is for every woman who likes to listen to tales, to think about these tales and to learn from these tales. Read it and ask your self, why is that so.

Just as the stories are timeless and archetypal, so are the messages contained within. I'd recommend WWRWW to anyone interested in inner work and understanding, and also the Theatre of the Imagination (two volumes) audio series, which doesn't suffer from the perception that it is for women (only)."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"What I truly like about this book is, firstly, the palpable intelligence of Est&eacute;s and the monumental extra effort she undertakes to lead readers to an in-depth understanding.At no time did I have the perception that she wrote the book for the sake of putting together an impressive pile of data, truths and half truths; no she did not want to create a book.She wanted, needed for people to know what she herself knows to be absolutely essential, crucial information about life itself.The book is neither scientifically dry nor scary through its very thickness and seemingly endless number of pages. On the contrary - it allows this reader to visit for as many repeated stays as desired and as will be pleasurable. And these visits all entice me to come back, home, to read more, to learn more because I need to, to read again the wonderful stories about the red shoes, the seal, the fisherman and the skeleton and especially about La Louve, the she-wolf.I can live in parts of the book, and even though it was written primarily for women, I can peek in, can get a glimpse and can re-affirm my lifelong, thorough fascination, or better yet infatuation with the other sex.And what sadness comes up when one reads about the rather cruel fate of heroines in the stories, heroines who end up victims of the laws of our minds, souls and spirits!Powerful words, powerful stories.And, come to think of it, once into the first few pages, something unexpected happens. One senses that not only has one just experienced the privilege of being allowed into an entirely foreign world, which looks, sounds and smells very much like a forbidden territory, one experiences a transformation from mere visitor to membership.I have kept my eyes open and the welcome is overwhelming. I feel I have been adopted into the family. My ears respond as if they were hearing voices and the air seems to have acquired a positive charge.But, what is most noticeable, and becomes shockingly comfortable is the sudden perception of something that can only be described as SCENT.To borrow from the movie, starring Al Pacino : \\"The Scent of A Woman\\", that is what makes this book, for me, the most satisfying book, the book most deserving of being cherished by this mere male and the book that goes far beyond being just another book.It is the experience of being in the company of the soul of La Louve (the she-wolf)and of your own .And thus it was revealed that I will always love La Louve."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Although this audio cassette claims to be abridged, which it is, it also contains information not printed in the book, which to me seems odd.

Because of that, I felt compelled to look through the reviews posted here at Amazon to see what some other readers thought of what Dr. Estes has written. I was not surprized at the impact this book has had on almost everyone who has taken the time to post a review. I am also not surprized that a few reviewers just didn't get it. Much of what we are becomes known to us through both the words we read and the words we write. We never know ourselves totally because we continue to evolve, but certainly insight into where we have come from helps us to cope with where we are at any given time and helps provide a meaningful context for our continued evolution. I think perhaps those readers who didn't get it were still trapped by their belief in the limitations and restrictions imposed by others, but I do not judge, just speculate. Those who did get it, almost all communicated in a manner that (to me at least) reflected their awareness of life as being evolutionary, ever changing and wondrous. Some of us, perhaps most of us, will continue to play the various roles we have learned to play in order to survive the various situations we find ourselves in. But some of us do believe in our own power and believe that power embodies both the choices we make and the responsibility we accept for the consequences of those choices.

Here is inexpressible creativity that expresses through these written and spoken words. Dr. Estes is not drawn to the single line but moves artfully in the mystery of the circle and the spiral.All of Dr.E's works are the highest quality both written and spoken. The only thing i regret from listening to Dr. E's voice is audio recordings from other authors never measure up to her magical and lyrical voice that has depth, breath, and height..She could read the phone book and i would find it to be a sound healing.The world of the soul has long been known to be secret and sacred...Dr.E's works never reduces the mystery of the soul or the sacred to a single direction or preference.. Where ever this author writes or speaks there is a light to gather healing, sight, and Source within one's Self/Soul...These are transformative stories and how they are delivered are long lasting timeless gems for soulful unfolding."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Have you ever had a book come across your path numerous times? You hear about it, read clips of it on blogs or message boards but never get around to picking it up? \\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\" by Clarissa Pinkola Estes is one of those books.It sat on my wish list for months. It wasn't until I read about it on during my studies on society and women that I decided to finally borrowed the book from the library.I am glad I did. Two chapters into the book I realized: I don't want to borrow this book, I must own it.\\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\" is well written and makes you stop, look, listen, and pay attention with your soul. You will need time to read this book to get its full value. It is not reading time that makes it a long read, it is thinking time. This book will address the feelings, thoughts and emotions that you have at the core of your existence. It is a starting point to being honest with yourself.In the simplest of terms it is the handbook on womanhood, intuition, and creativity. Many books on being a woman or understanding a woman seem to tell you about women and womanhood from the outside looking in. This book starts at the core of a woman and shows you layer by layer what the essence of a woman is all about. It is honest and can help a lot of woman and girls understand themselves and live fuller and more meaningful lives.It addresses our needs, joys, fears, hopes, dreams, emotions, creativity, intellect, intuition, customs, views on our self, and society. It hits so close to home that it will feel as if Dr. Estes wrote this book specifically for you. She is like a mother sitting you down and sharing her knowledge with you one beautiful word at a time.I enjoyed the stories and myths that were added to this book from various cultures. It is a great way to understand how ways of being are transferred from generation to generation. She shows us the positive and the negative.The book shows that although women are from various cultures, backgrounds, and races that at the core we are similar in experiences, fears, and love. We have a bond that crosses all these lines. Dr. Estes's book helps to connect the dots.It addressed unanswered questions in the back of my mind and uncovered feelings that were hidden. I slowly found ways to untangle other emotions and thoughts that I deemed crazy but were normal and shared with women across time. As a result look at myself and other women with new understanding.Giving this book to a young woman will be a gift that she will cherish and use throughout her adulthood. I have given copies of this book to women and many have called me to talk about it. We were able to talk about things women don't usually share and help each other. The book is an excellent bridge to create and deepen bonds with other women.I have been stopped in the street and at restaurants by people who are intrigued at the title and my presence when reading it. I have met women who have finished the book and gave me their thoughts on how it has helped them.I would like to thank Dr. Estes for taking the time and having the love in her heart to write this book. It is a book that will help create more stronger and grounded women.It is a book that I will carry with me always"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I use Women Who Run With The Wolves as my bible.

The chauvinistic/psychopathic societies we live in, are designed to strangle this feminine aspect as to deprive women from their instinctual nature to resist, to fight back and to overcome. Women are to be kept subservient. But despite the predators from outside, a woman's worst predator is that of her inner landscape, born of the suppression from outside.And that is why Estes book is of vital importance to each and every woman on this planet: through excellent writing, the use of stories and a profound insight into the feminine realm, she offers us the means and ways to understand the inner and outer restrictions on our instinctual selfs, and a map out to freedom, the key to unlock the chains that hold the Wild Woman captive.A must read!"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Such a good book, couldn't put it down. Written in the true spirit of 'story telling', something greatly lacking in our world today. The archetypal symbology expressed in the myths of old are not just entertaining, but also enlightening. I really enjoyed this book and re-read it often. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Clarissa Pinkola Estes has a warm vibrant personality. As she explores beautiful myths and fairytales, you can sink into the beautiful space of childhood dreams and wonder. Her voice is soothing and comforting and her main message seems to be the uncovering of the feminine archetype that brings creativity and nourishment to a woman's life.At times I have thought that until you have used the idea of \\"bones\\" in a poem, you have not reached into the depths of yourself and found that essential element that births you as a poet. This almost represents an indestructible part of yourself and Clarissa Pinkola Estes brings a new understanding to the idea of \\"bones\\" used in mythology.The Mistaken Zygote idea seems more like the \\"story of the stork\\" and doesn't seem to explain why you may find yourself in a family where you feel out of place or never at home. A few teachers who focus on archetypes seem to think that you are placed in family of your choosing. So, both ideas are ways to explain what we can't possibly know. I think that \\"feeling different or like you came from a different planet\\" has more to do with a conflict of personality or the difference between being an introvert or extrovert. Since most people seem to be extroverts, introverts can sometimes feel out of place or different.Some of the topics include:The Story of La LobaThe Soul's Need for ExpressionWomen's IntuitionTips for Reconnecting to Your Instinctual NatureThe Importance of FeelingsRhythm and RelationshipRage and ReleaseForgivenessClarrisa Pinkola Estes discusses how it is possible to channel lust into poetry, gardening or other creative endeavors. For women who feel they have been \\"over domesticated\\" or restricted in younger life, she gives ideas for breaking free from other people's restrictive ideas. This is not done without much consideration (and also includes releasing the rage you feel) and this is not an encouragement to be rebellious or destructive. Instead, this idea is more to nurture the inner wildness of a woman that breaks her free into her deepest life expression and most fulfilling creative path.The mysterious stories, memories from childhood and advice about how to enhance creativity felt very true, honest and encouraging. The message is one of nurturing your soul and being patient with yourself so you can flower and your heart can open so you can bless the world. I had to smile when Clarissa says she is friendly, but not totally tamed. If you know the wild beauty of being able to express your inner creativity or you want to experience this freedom, this classic study of the wild woman archetype may encourage a renewal of your life purpose.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I can't say enough of the works of Clarissa Pinkola Estes!

I can only say I see clearly now where feminism went bad.I will not deny that there may indeed be a Wild Woman in every female, but to dedicate one's mental health to that one archetype would be akin to saying that in every man is solely a Warrior archetype. Such a theory followed through would result in very one-sided males, brutish and without self-control. The same is true of a Wild Woman without acknowledgement of the other aspects of herself in balance to guide the Wild Woman's energies. This is not addressed in Estes' book. According to Estes, a woman's highest obligation is to paying homage to the Wild Woman within. She holds that a woman has no responsibility to anyone else, to her community, to her family, and certainly none to men. It is the quintessential &quot;me generation&quot; book for women. I read this directly after reading &quot;Iron John&quot; by Robert Bly. In contrast, Bly integrates the mental health of the individual, even paying homage to the &quot;Wild Man&quot; within, while still promoting responsibility to others.In short, if you want a book that idealizes women and disavows them of any self-control, this for you. If you want something that will empower women in the modern world, search elsewhere. At the very least, if you *must* read this book, be familiar with the concept of archetypes as presented by CG Jung, who Estes is basing her theories on...Like reading the Bible before you listen to the speech of an evangelical TV minister, it helps to know the original to understand how it is being twisted for personal gain."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Book was sent from the States to Australia and arrived a month before expected.

Second only to Joseph Campbell's work (The Power of Myth) in it's power to explain many of the facets of our lives. As equally valuable to men as to women."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"If you need to find yourself... you may want to give this book a try, you will definitelly see yourself in one of the stories at least.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I picked up this book when it was already a best-seller, and hence approached it with a certain cynicism: it sounded like yet another touchy-feely, &quot;let it all hang out&quot; invitation to express aspects of one's character that are probably better left unexpressed.Was I wrong! Myths are powerful because they speak to a level of understanding beyond the rational. I got to the story of the Ugly Duckling, and found myself in tears: that was me as a child, and, although I'm well into swanhood now, I'd never overcome the feeling that there was something profoundly wrong with me because I wasn't the cute, cuddly little girl everyone said I &quot;should&quot; be. Estes' advice to the former Ugly Ducklings of this world was right on, too: don't get hung up in being a &quot;survivor&quot;; pay tribute to the pain and the strength of the child you were, then leave it behind you.This isn't as &quot;scholarly&quot; a work as some critics would like, but I don't think that's the point. Reading it is like spending time with a wise grandmother who tells you all the old tales and advises you based on what she's learned from life. In rational terms, much of what she says may make no sense -- but the stories themselves, her wisdom, and the love and acceptance she radiates, are all powerful teachers.This is a book about changing from within, not abandoning your responsibilities to, literally, go off and run with the wolves. Through reading these stories, you'll REclaim parts of yourself that you thought you'd lost forever."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Am rereading for the 4th time - live saving and soul saving information - all thing your mother should have taught you and didn't."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"I am an avid reader and have many books in my library. This is one of my all-time favorites and it amazes me with it's depth and ability to inspire me and empower me. I have found myself returning to it again and again, for enjoyment purposes or because I've hit a rough patch and need the inspiration. I have bought this book for all of the women I cared about in the past and am now reminded that I have new friends I need to share it with. It is very deep but if your heart is open, it speaks to that instinctual, understanding part of you. When I read it the first time, I needed to read it and it went straight to my heart and gut.Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous!I find myself quoting from it on facebook often and get great responses!Just buy it!
