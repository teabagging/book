I'm enjoying motherhood, information is helpful."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Bought this book for a friend, as I already own one. It has some great advice on fussy babies - how to calm them and be a calmer parent! A MUST HAVE for any new mom."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a wonderful book for any first time parent. It really works for my daughter and I have bought it as a shower gift twice! I defiantly recommend reading it before you have the baby. I love that this book goes into the why's of crying and how the technique of the 5 Ss work! It's an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I wish that I could give this book more than 5 stars - I am not exaggerating when I say that this book saved our sanity when our daughter was born. She was a very fussy baby who cried a LOT; she would sometimes get so upset that she wouldn't even nurse. My husband and I read this book, and also watched the DVD by the same name. These techniques really do work when nothing else would! My daughter is now 15 months old, and she is still calmed by my shushing because we did it so much when she was a newborn.Every time I meet a pregnant woman, my first and biggest piece of advise is \\"You have to read or watch 'The Happiest Baby on the Block'! And get a good swaddle!\\" This book or DVD has become my standard baby shower gift paired with a swaddle and the big ugly pacifiers that were my newborn daughter's favorite from the hospital. Inexperienced parents often don't think to register for these things - they register for pretty embroidered burp rags (cloth diapers make the best burp rags anyway) and other cute/fancy baby equipment. What every new or expecting parent really needs is this book/DVD, a good tight swaddle, and a pacifier!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is hands-down the best baby (0-3 mos.) book. Combined with a velcro swaddle, this is my shower gift for new parents. Dr. Karp treats the first three months of the baby's life as the 4th trimester--keep the baby close, warm, bundled tightly and try to replicate the womb. (no, nothing weird like wrapping the baby up in a red velvet blanket!) Motion, tightly swaddled, background noises (white sound shhh-ing). We followed this book to the tee for the first couple months of our baby's life and when we implemented the 5 s's, her crying quickly subsided."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read the book and watched the video. I thought this would be a lifesaver but honestly it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Swaddle the baby, shush in their ear, gently vibrate/rock... don't expect miracles but some of the tips help."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A very informative book. A bit repetitive at times, but he really drills into you the basics of how to soothe your baby. We bought this book before baby was born, since we wanted to have some soothing techniques ready for use. Turns out our baby fairly laid back, but occasionally we found the 5 \\"S's\\" useful, although we didn't need to do them in the order he recommends, or even all at the same time.Was very useful for new parents.Filled with a lot of great stories, a few theories, and some fun writing. He makes very clear these are just his theories, but he lays out a lot of evidence about why he feels this way."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great book! It takes things you may already know and puts it in a way that helps you to help your baby. It also brings up points that you may have never thought of to help your baby (and you) rest better!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I'm told this book is best once the baby is born. It was a gift and I am always getting notes about how it has helped them."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Although this book is well written, I truly have mixed feelings about this book. It is obviously written for a stay-at-home parent! The 5 \\"S\\"'s did particularly work for a short period of time for our very colicky newborn, about 2 weeks, but, some of the suggestions were what we deemed to be a little \\"rough\\" and only upset our little girl even more. The Shhh-ing did work, momentarily, but, mostly as an abrupt scare when she was out of control crying, but, then she would begin screaming seconds later. We felt as if we are hyperventilating with all of the \\"Shhh-ing\\" and became more annoying to each other along with the loud crying. The swaddling always only overheated our newborn to the point of sweating no matter how thin the blanket and we even purchased the large cheesecloth dish towels that are made of very thin cotton to try to keep her cooler. Putting the swing on high caused her to be even more upset as you could see her eyes widen with fear as if she was on a roller coaster. Yes, we did combine all of the techniques as suggested at one time, but, basically, what we feel would happen was that she would cry to a point of complete exhaustion and finally fall off to sleep.Ideally, if this is an only child with a stay-at-home parent who can walk around day and night with their child glued to them, it may work. But, in today's society where 2 incomes are necessary, sleep is a necessity. We eventually resorted to the fact that this too shall pass and it is getting better. We just have to take turns when she has her \\"spells of crying\\" since one of us has to attend to our 21 month old and get sleep. It's not pretty, but, sometimes you do have to put them down and give yourself a break and let her cry, while going into the bubble bath with ear plugs and cry yourself! You come back with a little bit more sanity & patience, pick her up and start over! Sometimes, just sometimes, they fall asleep during the process. Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I like the five step approach for calmuing a screaming baby. It works like a charm. I don't like how they suggest that the baby will be less secure if you let them cry. My baby was miserable when we followed that rule. it was only when we started to let her cry a little that she learned how to go to sleep on her own and gain some independance. She is now a happy baby and rarely needs the 5 step calming process."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It was the first night home from the hospital and it was 2 a.m. Our daughter woke up, I nursed her, and she would not, for the life of us, go back to sleep. Each time we put her in her crib she would wake up and cry. She cried, and cried, and cried (louder and louder and louder). We tried everything we could think of and nothing. So imagine a baby and two adults flipping through baby books (at about 3 a.m. by this time) trying to find something, some sort of indication, on how to stop this sound machine. Finally, we got to this book (of course it had to be the last book we grab) and found the magic spell. IT WORKED!!!! She went to sleep AND stayed asleep.She's three now and I always recommend this book (plus the already made swaddlers) to all new moms. I did the blanket swaddle for a little while but then our dd figured out a way to get her one arm out -- never really good at it. A friend got us a swaddler and we loved it! With the swaddle and a wedge (it's suppose to prevent baby from rolling over but for us, it was a way to give her the feeling that she's being held) she always slept well.I read comments on jiggling baby. It's not like your shaking the kid, you're just swaying/rocking. We also ended up getting a swing and she loved napping on it.Our suggestion: read the book after you get it while you're still pregnant, not after baby comes home from the hospital at 2/3 a.m. :D"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was too confusing. I got the DVD instead and it is worth every penny! The DVD is the best 25 minutes you will spend! It clearly demonstrates the swaddling technique that is not too clear in this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"While I applaud Dr. Karp's system and approach for \\"The Fourth Trimester\\", this book could be written as a short pamphlet. It repeats itself over and over and over and...over.The techniques themselves are great, however. My 3-month old is happily swaddled to sleep and sleeps better for it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book could have said everything it said in 1/3 of the space, particularly because it wasn't well-organized, rambled often, and repeated similar points in different chapters. Heavily based on his own practice and opinions, it used only anecdotes from his personal patients. I don't think I would like the author in person--seems like he'd be the type to talk about himself and never let you get a word in edgewise.The sub-title says \\"the new way\\" to calm your baby, yet on every single page he rationalizes that women have done this for thousands of years, third world country mothers still practice childcare this way, and that it works because of our evolutionary heritage and infants are reverting back to when they were baby monkeys hanging on to their mama's in the trees. He refers to children as \\"cave babies\\" and newborns under 3 months as \\"really still fetuses,\\" saying that evolution decreed they were born after 9 months instead of 12 when they'd be too big to be born.I think it's much more plausible that these techniques may work because going from womb to room is a huge transition and babies take several weeks to really adjust, and are comforted by whatever seems familiar to them (hence the white noise, tight wraps, etc. that remind them of the womb). However, I do think the actual techniques he proposes are very practical, and may even be quite useful.Just pick it up long enough to read the \\"how-to\\" chapters (8-13) and skip the rest. If you're a moderately intelligent adult, you can figure out why those techniques might work without needing to see your precious infant as a monkey."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This was a very easy read and easy to understand. It really works."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This had 5 main points that should be used to calm a crying baby. To my disappointment, they weren't meant to put a baby to sleep, but rather only to calm the crying spell. Other than that, the advice was really good. Swaddling is not an easy thing to master, but I was an instant expert after using his technique. I also bought the accompanying CD for the 'shhh' sound, and I use it every night. It is a large book that drags on and on to define 5 simple techniques. It could be covered in a pamphlet, but the information is still good for new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A great source of very helpful information for those trying times when your baby is colicky."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We bought the dvd because we did not find out about this until our baby was 4 weeks old, which was about 4 weeks too late, that is why we bought the dvd first (no time to read), I have oredered the book also, but the dvd is a must have. It is very easy to watch and makes so much sense, and the 5's really do work. We also orderd his swadle blanket and his swaddle me one piece as well as the white noise cd, they all work great and it really has given us more peace at night. It is the best stuff I have bought for my baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that the 5 S's worked like a charm for the first three months. I recommended the book to all of my pregnant friends because our baby slept so well and was so easy to soothe. HOWEVER, now our baby is almost 6 months old, and the 5 S's do not work anymore. In the last week, she now takes about 1.5 hours to calm down enough to go to sleep. She screams if I wrap her, and she screams if I unwrap her. Dr. Karp makes the reader feel that all of a sudden at four months, your baby doesn't need a swaddle, can find her thumb and feel secure all on her own. She did seem more like a baby, not like a fetus, at four months, but I really feel she never learned how to self soothe, and the confidence I had when she was a newborn is gone! I really feel like I don't know what I'm doing anymore!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My son hasn't really been a &quot;problem&quot; baby in any way--no long nights of crying, etc, so the results I experienced may be less dramatic than those written about by others. However, I found his techniques mirrored things I was already trying when my son was upset or having trouble sleeping. He simply explained in a straightforward manner how to combine what I already knew into a technique that works almost all the time.It was reassuring to know that my instincts were right, this being my first child. My one complaint about this book is that it tries to be funny and cute, which almost demeans the information found inside. I found the cartoons and silliness distracting."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was disappointed to find that the entire book is for newborn babies only. Once your baby is too old to swaddle this book isn't for you. I purchased several others at the same time and found that The No Cry Sleep Solution has great ideas for all babies and even toddlers. The ideas in the happiest baby book cannot be applied to a baby that is over about 3 months old. If you look at the main points you'll see they are: swaddling, placing on his side or stomach, saying Shhhh, Swinging, and Sucking. I also suspect that if you always do this with your newborn you may create sleep problems for when you can't do them any more. Beware! If your baby is over 3 months this isn't the book you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Unbelievable that so many people gave this book such a high rating. I'll sum this book up with 5 words. Swaddle, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking. These are the \\"magic\\" techniques that are the basis of this book. The other 250 pages are pure filler fluff. Look online and you'll be able to find a site that shows how to swaddle (it's not tough), shush is pretty self explanatory and laying the baby on his side, along your arm is quite easy to master too. Put those three together and you have a good way to quiet a fussy baby, for a couple of months anyway. Swinging and sucking are pretty self explanatory too.The popularity of this book just shows me how out of touch we are as a species with our own biology. All of the techniques in this book should be pretty instinctual for people, but for some reason they don't seem to be for many. If you are completely clueless, and have a hard time differentiating your newborn from the family puppy, then run out and buy this book. If you have any common sense at all, and spend some time getting in tune with the needs of your child, then save your money for a more worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Attention mothers of truly colicky babies: Do not feel like you are a bad mother because you did all of the techniques listed out in this book, along with every other bit of advice you were given, and your little angels still cried...eh hem...I mean SCREAMED all day and all night like mine did. I read this book before my baby girl was born and was a full fledged believer in the fact that \\"colic\\" had a cure and even though I was sure my baby wouldn't be colic...if she was, I was ready to cure it with these techniques. This book makes sense, it draws you in, it is logical, and quite frankly one of the most convincing parenting books I've ever read. Unfortunately - if your baby is colic, this book makes you feel like a complete and utter failure. Do you want to know what stopped my precious baby girl from screaming (sometimes)? Bouncing on a large medicine ball in the middle of my kitchen with the oven fan on and the kitchen sink turned on full blast, while holding her in the fetal position. THAT WAS IT! I don't care how IN SHAPE you are (I'm in excellent shape - worked out everyday of my pregnancy) you will not be able to do this forever. After hours of doing this, your back hurts and your arms feel like they will simply fall off."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We received this as a gift from my mother when our daughter was born. We followed all the advise to the tee and could not have gotten better results! The 5 \\"s's' really work!! Since then, I have purchased this book for every friend of our that is a first time parent. I highly recommend this very easy to read and simple book (which is just what you need when you bring a newborn home)!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I had not idea what to do with a screaming wiggling little dude. I read a review of this book prior to having him and decided to read it. I read it cover to cover and used 85% of the content. My son is 3 months and I still use it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This will be the shower gift of choice for friends expecting from now on. The book is great, the philosophy makes sense and best of all- IT WORKS. My daughter had a hard time staying asleep in her first couple weeks of life. I had this book sitting on the table waiting to be read. After a week of no sleep I tore it open, once I started reading I just couldn't stop. The book captured my full attention, its very interesting and of course I starting testing the theory in pieces as I was reading- hmm.. it worked. Then I finally tried all the steps together and found it works like magic. This author isn't just a person writting books but a person who truely understands babies. Best book I've read!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My daughter was very difficult for the first two months and this book was the only one I found that offered useful advice on how to cope with her fussiness. Following these ideas, I bought a white noise machine, learned how to swaddle and rock my baby. This was a very desperate time for me, particularly when talking with certain people that don't understand that there are all kinds of babies and some are extremely difficult to calm down in their first two months. This book made me feel that I was not alone and it saved me from a lot of misery."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Our baby daughter is not colicky, but like all newborns has times when she's screaming like the world is coming to an end. Thanks to the techniques in this book, we discovered the position in which we can hold her, and the two other things we do at the same time, that shut down her crying within 10 seconds. Dr. Karp calls it the calming reflex, but whatever you want to call it, it allows the baby to calm down enough to eat (and hopefully sleep!). New parents will find this book well worth the money. And it makes a great baby shower gift!The DVD is a great companion to the book, because you see visual and auditory proof that the techniques work, and you see a visual demo of proper swaddling technique. We have both and I'm glad we do."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was very lucky to have an easy baby but when I was pregnant I was terrified of what I would do if he was collicky. This book helped me feel much more confident about how I would deal with problems and when they came up, I did what the book recommended and it worked. My baby is 6 months now and still a very easy, non-collicky baby but i pull some of these tricks out of my bag when I need them."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Every parent should read this book before they bring the baby home. Guaranteed, the baby will sleep better and so will Mommy and Daddy."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I'm actually pretty disappointed with this book. The information he presents is good, as far as the steps to soothing a fussy baby. However, I don't think he needed to write a whole book to share that information. Instead, he could have just written a 10-page pamphlet. Most of the book is repetitive and full of stuff that I, as a mom-to-be, couldn't care less about. Seriously, I don't care why ape babies millions of years ago held on to their mothers; just tell me what to do with my baby now. If you want to know the \\"secrets\\" he offers, look up the youtube videos. You can learn the skills in 5 minutes instead of the hours it takes to read the book. Reading the book is a total waste of time if you're looking for useful information and applicable skills, since most of the pages are filled with fluff."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My daughter has horrible colic, she would scream for 6+ hours a day and I was about at my breaking point. We had tried prescription colic drops which were little to no help. The 5's were very helpful in calming her. I can't say that it \\"cured\\" her colic-she still has some symptoms of it but the colic is much improved and I at least feel like I can comfort her instead of feeling helpless against her screaming. Highly recommend this book. If it doesn't work right away give it some time and keep doing the 5 steps, it will help."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book helped my husband and I understand how we should manage our fussy, colicky newborn as first time parents. After our baby was two weeks old, he became very fussy, especially in the evening, and nothing we did seemed o help. This book is an easy read, gave us a confidence boost and taught us how to calm our baby and keep him calm enough to sleep. He is two months now and he sleeps 2-3 hours intervals at night and 1-2 hours naps during the day, with less and less fussing. With the help of this great book we got through those difficult weeks when we felt exhausted."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is great gift for parents of newborns. It's even better given in advance so parents have time to read it before baby arrives. It is practical, easy to understand, and helps parents understand and relax about their newborn. It is particularly helpful about calming your baby down, especially a fussy baby. I've seen the techniques given in the book work, over and over. In addition, when practicing the simple techniques you're given to comfort a crying baby, you either help your baby stop crying, or if the techniques never work for your baby, you may discover you need to consult your baby's doctor about the problem. I feel if we'd had this book when we were dealing with our young baby crying inconsolably for hours every evening, we would have known so much sooner that he didn't have common newborn and young infant problems, and needed medication for a medical issue. For most parents, this book will simply give them confidence and peace of mind."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has opened my eyes to how simple and effective Dr. Karp's techniques are. I am grateful to have found it in time ( I am 16 weeks pregnant with our first) so I can read it and watch the dvd. To me the whole idea became a common sense."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I don't know why it took me so long to get this book. I wish I had read it before I gave birth to my son. It would have prepared me for what Karp calls \\"the fourth trimester\\" and how to help soothe my baby through it. If you're like me and find yourself with an infant that screams for no apparent reason, get this book. I use the 5 S's daily, sometimes modified to what works for me, and always at bedtime. I wouldn't say that my baby is now \\"the happiest on the block,\\" but he is calmed with greater ease which helps my confidence and sanity!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I love this book. Dr. Karp allowed me to see my son's needs in a way that helped me to understand better than anything else I've read. My first 4 months with my son would have been hell without this book. I've recommend it numerous times and even given it as a shower present. Honestly, you won't need another book, for your newborn. And, if you have a stubborn husband that won't read, get the video, my husband is more of a proponent than I am and all he saw was the video."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I could write a long review about this, but it would say the same thing that everyone else said. It worked magic for our extremely high need baby. And those comments about it being redundant... Well, I find that helpful b/c it really really explains his methods thoroughly so that you can fully understand the and do them correctly."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I swear by this book, the techniques work like magic, and it made me feel okay about letting my baby sleep in the swing.

It's also a very interesting read. I absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is an absolute must have for new parents. Dr. Karp gives solid advice and recommendations for caring for infants in the first few months. His 5 S's are highly effective and very easy to use. The first half of the book is mostly on his theories; which are good theories, but there is some repetition. The second half of the book goes into each of the 5 S's in detail. He gives great suggestions on many different ways to calm, comfort, and soothe your baby. I have bought this book for friends and family with new babies, and highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My wife says this is the one book she wishes she had when our kids were babies. She gives it to all our friends having babies and they love it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My baby was not colicky, but I followed this book anyway. It worked beautifully. When my baby was a newborn, following the simple steps in this book would comfort him very quickly.

I would highly recommend this book to any parent."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"So The Happiest Baby On The Block is all the rage, and though your grandparents might wonder just what the hell you're doing wrapping your baby up (\\"let her breathe!\\") and swinging her to and fro, people say over and over again that it works. For us, we layer parts and pieces and our beautiful daughter calms down.Here's the thing, though: you don't actually need to buy this book. You need to read it for 15 minutes in a book store, or borrow a friend's book, or find a web site that explains it. The book is 288 pages with maybe five pages of actual information and 283 pages of filler. Not bad filler, and I don't hardly begrudge Dr. Karp for making money while creating less-harried parents, but you can save your money and learn these things another way."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Where was Dr. Karp and this book 10 and 12 years ago? How I wanted to calm my babies in an effective manner. They weren't 'colicy' but when they did cry or wouldn't sleep, I wasn't always successful in calming them. I often times felt ineffective as a parent and the only advice I got was either 'let them cry it out alone' or 'just hold them and deal with the crying until they stop'. NOW, thanks to Dr. Karp, there are some wonderful, practical and useful solutions to 'colic' and fussiness that WORK. No one, not mommy, daddy nor baby are left feeling frustrated or unsuccessful by these solutions. Dr. Karp's suggestions of the 5 'S's' are comforting and effective for all. Less tears and more smiles all the way around!In my present profession as a Board Certified Lactation Consultant in private practice, I have many parents ask me about calming their new babies. It is hard for parents to realize how much sleep their babies need, much less, how to help their babies get all that sleep. Since reading Dr. Karp's book, I have answers for them! Now I suggest to all my future clients \\"Read this book now, before your baby comes into this world\\". To my present clients, I suggest they buy a copy ASAP. This book is empowering.This book will change the beginning of the parenting journey in many positive ways for all who read it; moms, dads, grandparents, Childbirth Educators, Doulas, Lactation Consultants and Pediatricians. Even the most hard to convince parents and babies will be surprised by the results! Enjoy!He also has a video for those visual learners, or those short on time (like new parents!). It is a great video too!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read this book when my first child was about 4-5 months old. And it was a little too late for the baby. I read it again right before my second child was born, and it really worked well. My husband was amazed how fast I could calm our second baby. He thought this baby was just easy to calm until he tried his own way. I think if you follow the 5S's from this book, your first three months with your baby will be much easier and pleasant.However, I didn't think it contained much information other than the 5S's. It kind of feels like he tried to stretch out the simple concept into a hundred-whatever-pages long book. I would recommend reading it and making it yours, but borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read this book cover to cover, not knowing how to deal with my colicky baby. We tried everything and nothing worked. We saw Dr. Karp and he demonstrated his famous shooshing sound while pounding my then 6 month old baby's back real hard. My son looked at him like \\"what are you doing to me?\\" His suggestion at the end of our appointment was \\"Read my book and call me and tell me what you think, will ya? I need to know if I am brilliant or not.\\" He also thought our son was 6 weeks old (normal healthy well-developed 6 month old!). My husband and I were shocked. We were so unimprssed by both Karp himself and the book! Besides there's nothing new in this book and is extremely poorly written!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Well my first thought is that I wish I had had this one four years ago when our second child born. My first slept through the night from nearly day one but the second was a crier. And oh how he cried to the point that we literally had to walk with him and rock at the same time for two hours to get him to sleep. My wife and I had to do this in shifts as our shoulders and elbows would be hurting something fierce. Now I will disagree with the doctor in regards to anti-gas medicine. It helped our son a great deal but the biggest help came from switching from regular milk to Soy Milk.At any rate, I have two neices who are both having babies this year and I plan on giving both of them this book. The first chapter which covers why babies cry is probably the most important one. I cannot understand ever harming a child because of their crying but I can certainly understand the incredible amount of stress and frustration it can have on parents, especially young, first time parents who are often unprepared for what happens when they take the newborn home. The techniques that Dr. Karp prescribes are wonderfully simple and really commonsense. Best of all this isn't some ditzy child psychologists babble but the experience of a Pediatrician who has been down in the trenches for years. Highly recommended for new parents"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book came out just in time to give me a refresher course for our second son (now two weeks old). Harvey is our pediatrician, but was not available to see us in the hosptial because of his book tour! Having his book was the next best thing, and his book gives all the tips he ever gave us, and then some! I especially appreciate the years of study that he shares in these pages, which he has never had time to give us because he is the most coveted ped in town.Both of our sons have great temperaments, but of course they had(have) their moments. These techniques nip those moments in the bud, bring peace to our household, and establish a bond between all of us (and I am glad to be able to lend a hand in the calming, which gives my wife a rest and keeps me from feeling too jealous!). Get the book for your own babies, or anyone you know who has one or is expecting."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As first-time parents of a 5-week old, we had been agonizing over the crying jags our daughter has been having, thinking we were somehow failing as parents. Dr. Karp puts her crying into perspective by having us think of her as being in the \\"fourth trimester\\" -- a not quite \\"cooked\\" baby. Understanding that her crying is mostly reflexive and how to calm her in terms she can understand has helped to calm my own crying jags! The book is pretty repetitive and could really be boiled down into a pamphlet, but the repetition helps to drive his points home. I wish someone had given me this book before my daughter was born."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Arrived quickly in perfect condition. Gave to my daughter and they are using and enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was excellent! I found that it was very repetitive throughout, but only to reinforce the important facts of the 5 S's. I don't have a child of my own yet, but I was watching my friends baby and I used all 5 S's that were explained in the book in order to put him to sleep and they worked within minutes! He went from screaming to completely asleep within minutes. It was amazing. I will read it again throughout the next several months. It's also a great book to give to your closest family members so that they will learn the technique that you are using. Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I heard about this book in Lamaze class, and bought it that same day. My son is now 5 months, and in his early weeks of life and up to 2 months, when he would cry, HE really CRIED, and following the suggested techniques in this book really worked for him!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is an excellent way to learn how to soothe a new baby! I was completely clueless about babies when I got pregnant, so I had a lot of learning to do! This book is a fairly quick read that presents a common sense, safe (some sleep approaches aren't), and simple method of soothing. Dr. Karp repeats himself a lot, so you really don't have to worry too much about reading every bit word for word. I have used these techniques from the night my son was born, and he's a happy, gentle, easy to calm baby at 11 weeks!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! I love his common-sense, loving approach to baby care. I have twins, and I don't know how we would have survived it without this book. I've recommended it to every new mom I've met. My babies hardly had to cry, because we were always able to quiet them with these techniques. I hear stories from so many moms whose babies cried and cried, and they were unable to comfort them. I wish they'd known these techniques. I was rarely frustrated. My twins are now 20 months old, and they're doing GREAT!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great book. I saw the writer on Oprah and was very impressed. Glad I got the book. The book has a lot of information to help you and your baby.

I would sweat every time I heard my daughter cry during those 2 weeks I was waiting for the free shipping; but now that I understand what's really going on w/ her and I have confidence quieting her when she's unhappy, I don't sweat as much and I can do it for her even at 3AM. It's 2 months and she sleeps through some nites (from 1AM to 6:30AM) :) This is really a great book and I would give it as a gift to a new dad if I wouldn't look weird doing so."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My daughter is 5 weeks old and I read this and watched the DVD during my pregnancy. You know how people say you can never prepare yourself for parenthood? Well they're wrong...YES YOU CAN with this book! The DVD and book equipped my husband and me with the tools needed to calm our baby and feel confident in ourselves as parents. This is going to be my baby shower gift to every expectant parent I know."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I love this book and the DVD!!

It really works. Our second child had colic and I read everything I could to try to soothe her and learn more about what colic was and how to deal with it. Our pediatrician recommended the book to us and we couldn't get to the book store fast enough. The five S's that the book details make sense. And once we got the right amount of each for our daughter it made all the difference. The book also focuses on some of the myths of colic and tells you why they aren't true, which was very helpful, because everyone you talk to has a differnt solution. This book is straight forward and easy to read. Parents with children who have colic NEED this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a miracle book. We had our 9 day old Grandson over and tried Dr. Karp's ideas about swattling and shussing. It worked immediately. I told my daughter, and hopefully she'll use Dr. Karp's techniques. They really do work. I am so impressed with Dr. Karp I e-mailed him with a question and he returned my e-mail within the hour. I would recommend this book, and video to all new parents and grandparents. It would make an excellent baby shower gift."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was extremely helpful in calming our 6-week old baby girl. She used to cry for 3 hours every night. But using these techniques really saved our lives. She responded right away and it really worked.

Thank you Dr. Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I heard about this book, and even though I don't have kids, I found it really interesting.While visiting a friend with a three week old, I got to try the &quot;S's&quot;.Their baby boy, Cooper, would not stop crying. I asked if I could try something. I took him in my unexperienced arms and swattled him, best that I could, held him sideways, and shooshed in his ear.He immediatly quieted down and fell asleep. His parents were amazed. They know I study and practice &quot;horse whispering.&quot;Baby horses have a very distinct way of communicating from birth. All horses understand it. We are using it to communicate back with them.That's why this &quot;baby whispering&quot; is so cool to me!Great book! Looking for more!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"There should be a national holiday made about this book!! It's fun and so easy to read that I got through the whole thing in a day and started immediately using the 5 S's with my little son. He wasn't colicky, but as a new parent I really didn't know what I was doing. This book helped me understand WHY my son was crying and taught me EXACTLY how to calm him down (which really helped me stay calm...too). This is the now gift I'm bringing to EVERY baby shower I go to!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great book, maybe the single best book I've read on baby's first year. This worked for our baby almost every time, from day one."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"When I read this book while I was still pregnant with my first child, I thought &quot;Surely, it can't be this simple,&quot; and almost forgot about it. But then I found myself with an &quot;inconsolable&quot; 2 week old baby girl in my arms with no clue how to calm her. I remembered the book and put Karp's method to the test. After following the 5 steps to trigger the calming reflex, she stopped crying as if someone had flipped a switch. My husband and I were absolutely amazed! To this day, he tells just about anyone who will listen about the 5 S's, and the book has become my standard shower gift. I enthusiastically recommend this book to all parents-to-be!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have to admit that I was pretty desperate when I bought this book. I don't necessarily subscribe to the good doctor's theory about the fourth trimester, but his techniques worked! I thought my baby didn't like swaddling because he struggled so much. Now I know that the tight swaddling is simply to help him calm himself. Add in the other 4 S's and it's like magic. It really helped to read the parent tips. I don't know how I survived the first two months without this book. My baby actually sleeps longer now and can be calmed quickly before he spirals out of control."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I found this book to be extremely helpful. Although my daughter is not what most would consider a fussy baby, ALL babies have their inconsolable moments, and these techniques WORK. Also, it is a quick read (if anything can be considered such to a new mom!) and although other reviewers have criticized Dr. Karp's writing style, I personally enjoyed it.When I was pregnant, I glanced through this book without much interest - I thought that I was more philosophically in line with the \\"Babywise\\" methods, but all of that changed when my daughter was born. I found that the idea of scheduled feedings felt very wrong to me, and I realized that I was incapable of letting her cry if it was in my power to calm her with nusing , cuddling, etc. At the times when these things failed to soothe her, I could feel myself breaking out in a cold sweat, my anxiety climbing. It just felt WRONG to say that all babies cry with no reason, or (as my in-laws constantly told me) that I would spoil her by calming her cries and that she needed to \\"exercise her lungs\\". Without this book, I would have felt that I had no response to these criticisms and nothing else to try.As I said before, my daughter has been pretty calm with occasional periods of fussiness or sleeplessness. During these times I can ALWAYS calm her with the 5 S's (minus swaddling - she has hated that from the start, for some reason). For me the most valuable thing about this book was its compelling argument that you cannot spoil a newborn and that you should treasure the \\"fourth trimester\\" as a time to hold, love, and bond with your baby without worrying about creating bad habits, spoiling, establishing rigid routines, etc. Now that my daughter's magical first three months are over, I don't have to look back and regret that I let her cry too long or that I didn't hold her more."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I admit, Karp took a few more pages than really necessary to instruct the reader on this process. OH WELL! IT HAS BEEN WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT! PRAISE KARP! I know I was a skeptic-I read it while 3 months pregnant and thought, \\"Hmm! Ok. Whatever.\\" THEN she was BORN. When all else failed--she'd eaten, she'd been changed, she was clean, she should have been good to go according to the standard checklist...but, nothing...absolutely nothing seemed to work against the shrieking cries of this normally calm child. Then, I remembered the little book. I tried Karp's process and in a matter of 60 seconds, she was out COLD!!! My husband, who is in charge of baby after 8:30 PM was a skeptic and would NOT listen (typical male syndrome)...that is until he suffered through a few evenings of endless cries, evening walks throughout the house at 3:00 in the morning...etc....until he finally broke down and agreed to let me train him. Let me sum it up--HE IS A BELIEVER NOW. Worth every single little PENNY and every MINUTE spent reading it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this book for my daughter who just had my first grandchild in Feb. '06. I had the pleasure of being with her for the first month. I read the book and we implemented these 5 suggestions. They worked!! Swaddle, Hush, Motion, Side, Pacifier. It was like magic. Also, a friend gave my daughter a DVD which she said she swore by. Would you believe the DVD was The Happiest Baby on the Block?!! Newborn parents, get this! It works!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The Happiest Baby on the Block is packed with great advice for calming babies. Although my daughter (now 6 weeks old) is not a fussy baby I have tried the 5 S's and can see the calming effect they have on her. If I do all 5 she can't help but fall asleep. It's wonderful and definitely worth the read. I wish I'd known about it when my son was a baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's book is a &quot;God-send.&quot; In fact, my wife and I were beginning to think that the sleepless nights and endless fussy behaviour of our third child was God's idea of a bad joke, paying us back for the exact opposite experience with our other two children, who were sleeping through the night the second week home from the hospital. Then, after learning of Dr. Karp's techniques and a few practice sessions mastering his art of swaddling, rocking and shhh'ing, our baby was finally getting to sleep AND STAYING ASLEEP - AND SO WERE WE!! There was a time there where we thought &quot;that's it, we're done, three's enough&quot;....but because of Dr. Karp and his simple but so effective idea's, a fourth one sounds pretty good all of the sudden!! Thank you Dr. Karp."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Over and over the reader is assulted with \\"why\\" and not \\"how\\" to make baby sleep. While it contains helpful information, this book would be about 2 pages long if it dropped all the filler - one page showing the swaddling diagram, and the other briefly explaining swaddle, side-lying, shhhing, swinging, sucking. The rest is just filler information to \\"sell\\" the book and its ideas, period.I purchased this book before having my twins, since I was a first-time mom and concerned about my ability to get the babies to sleep. Though I didn't read it before my twins were born, it didn't matter, because the nurses at the hospital showed us how to swaddle the babies and how to gently hold down their arms if they were flailing them around at bedtime so the babies could relax and get to sleep. It worked like a charm. So, in addition to being incredibly long-winded, I have found this book to be utterly useless now that I'm a parent.The other hints - side lying, swinging, shushing and sucking (paci or nursing) - all are things you will figure out on your own given one day with your baby. Mommies have hidden instincts that way. Or you could look up on the internet without buying this book.By the time I read the book, I found I was already doing everything the book recommends! So for me, buying this book was pointless. Maybe for the completely clueless mom, this book would be helpful. But you've already basically read the book if you've read this review.It is an interesting read, though not a very educational one. If you want to hear 10,000 stories about how many other parents have used these techniques over the years (without having them explained) and how these techniques can help you too, by all means dig in. It's like a never-ending infomercial.One more hint - there is a new product called a Woombie which swaddles babies very well, highly recommended! I think the author of this book would approve. And it is safer than blankets which can potentially cover a baby's airway accidentally, especially if your baby wiggles into her swaddle like mine do when they sleep on an incline."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I started reading this book when my newborn was about 2 weeks old and I only wish I had read it before she was born because as soon as I started implementing the techniques that Dr. Karp suggests for calming babies, I found I was able to comfort my crying baby almost instantly. I plan to purchase this book for every expectant mom I know - its that good, and honestly, it may be the best gift any parent could receive!As a first time mom with next to no experience handling babies, I felt anxious and uncertain whenever I heard my baby cry the first couple of weeks. Those feelings were just compounded by sleep deprivation - I remember one night feeling desperately frustrated when, after feeding her, I still could not get her to stop crying and fall back asleep. Dr. Karp's book helped me to better understand why my baby cried when she was not hungry or wearing a wet/soiled diaper, and more importantly, how I could effectively comfort her so she could stop crying and we both could get some sleep. Now, at eight weeks, she typically sleeps for stretches of six to 7 hours at night (one night it was 8!) and when she wakes, she is smiling and appears well rested.New parents: if you buy ANY baby book, get this one - you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This was one of the best parenting books I have come across since I had my son 4 months ago. Although my son was not colicky, Dr. Karp's philosophy on fussiness and his methods for calming crying babies worked for us. However, I would recommend buying it before you have your baby, so you are more prepared in advance and understand why your baby will cry so much during the first few weeks of life. It's definitely a reassuring read for a highly stressful time."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a good book that explains some of the most common and time-honored baby soothing methods such as rocking and swaddling. If you are a first time parent without anyone to help you during the first few months this book is like having a wiser, older person explain the basics. I would also recommend The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night. Both of these books are kind and reasonable and give good advice on babies."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is at the top of my list for every parent-to-be I know. It's the instruction manual we wished came along with our newborns. While our friends worked through the first 3 months with their colicky baby, Dr. Karp's loving guidance and the 5 Ss gave us a bit of peace and a chance to experience the joy of the 4th trimester. Now, if only he'd write the \\"Happiest Parent of a 3 year old\\" book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I wish that this book had been around when my first son was born but I am just so thankful that I found it in time for my second son. Following the techniques in the book, my baby has slept beautifully and been easily calmed. I cannot recommend the book highly enough! (The DVD is also great and shows you how to do things very clearly...especially helpful to show grandparents how to calm the baby too.)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp is absolute lifesaver when it comes to babies. I have 1.5 years old girl and 7 months old boy and I have used Dr. Karp's techniques on both of them. They worked like a charm every time they were fussy. I even tried them once on my girl when she was crying because it was her time to eat. As soon as all five S's were implemented she stopped crying and she fell a sleep! I had to wake her up to feed her!This book helped me so much that I am buying a copy for all of my pregnant friends/relatives. I also have DVD and it is perfect compliment to the book. If you did not quite get something just by reading, watching DVD will make you an expert on calming babies. When it comes to weaning, you have to do it gradually and you have to trust your baby. It is ok to keep her wrapped even past 3 months. It cannot do any damage. I have two living examples. What I did is start out by leaving one arm out for few nights, and then both of them. The other useful technique with older babies is to wrap more loosely so that the baby can get unwrapped during the sleep without even noticing it. Weaning is NOT a problem. Even if it was, never forget how much less your baby will cry, how much happier she will be, and how much more sleep you will get.This book is THE best book on babies I have ever read (and I have read a lot). It is clear, easy to read and full of priceless advice presented in sensitive and often entertaining way. Must have for all new parents.Thank you Dr. Karp for helping me enjoy my babies more and struggle with them less. I will be forever grateful."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has been the most helpful book of all! I have told everyone parent I know about it. I used the methods on my then 4 week old son right after I read the book. He became calm in couple of minutes and then asleep within ten minutes. Before using Dr. Karp's techniques my son was having daily crying sessions that lasted five plus hours and nothing worked to calm him. I am just thrilled that there is something so simple to comfort my baby. I am also pleased that he supports breastfeeding and writes about co-sleeping in a positive way.This book is a wonderful tool for any parent. You will not regret this purchase!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Why hasn't anyone else thought to explain the basics of baby soothing to new parents? This book simply outlines the time-honored techniques of swaddling, swaying and shhing a baby and provides brilliant help for parents dealing with babies who have colic. The reassuring tone helps you feel like you are not alone. Great for the first few months, and if your baby is past the newborn stage I'd recommend a book that Dr. Karp wrote the introduction to called Gentle Baby Care (by Pantley, the baby sleep expert.)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My first baby was what I call a &quot;high need&quot; baby. As in he needed a lot of attention but as long as he was held he was happy. Then our second baby came and we felt like nothing we did helped. We had so many people trying to help. Our Grandmother saw an article in the paper about Dr Karp and clipped it for us and we quickly bought the book - we were willing to try ANYTHING. What relaxed me was not so much what Dr Karp said collic was but what he said it wasn't. I was able to relax, which left more energy for helping my baby relax. I was afraid I had left it to late as our baby was already almost 3 months old when I purchased this book but it made a HUGE difference and now that he is 6 months old I still use some of the techniques. My only regret about this book is that I didn't read it sooner. I am purchasing one for my pregnant sister! Thank you Dr Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has probably save my sanity. Really!

We almost didn't get pregnant again for fear of the same experience.But, thanks to Dr. Harvey Karp's book, our second child has spent a minimun of time crying and much time settled or sleeping peacfully. The book has giving me tools and confidence to comfort my child when she needs help.It's been a great tool for my husband, too. Since only I can nurse her, he now feels he has things he can do to help comfort her, as well.The best part of all is that we are all getting MUCH more sleep than we did with our first baby.This book is worth every penny.

As first time parents, we were not prepared for the CONSTANT screaming and crying. Somebody recommended this book to us, and we bought it (even though we didn't think anything would really work). Dr. Karp's method helped SO much and saved our sanity until our son outgrew the colic when he was 3-4 months old.

She had a hard time sleeping because she flails her arms in her sleep startling herself awake. We tried Dr. Karps techniques and they worked right away. When we swaddled her and she was able to sleep much peacefully and longer. Eventually she figured out how to &quot;unswaddle&quot; herself so we purchased &quot;The Miracle Blanket&quot; and I recommend that as well.

It is written in an easy-to-read style and everything makes sense. The first time we tried the &quot;5 S's&quot;--lo and behold our baby became calm and fell asleep. We consistently use the technique Dr. Karp explains and don't experience nearly as much fussiness at sleep time as we used to. Instead of taking an hour or more to coax him to sleep, it now takes about 10-15 minutes. This is the most helpful advice I have gotten as a new mom.Thank goodness I found the book.

My son kicked a LOT in utero and came out screaming. He unswaddled himself the first day, rolled over the first week and was jittery all the time. Thanks to Dr. Karp, we swaddled and swung the boy for all naps/sleep. At four months, he's still a frisky critter but seems quite capable of quiet time and self-directed behavior. From what I've read elsewhere, getting enough sleep is VITAL in the early stages for cognitive development (the baby's - not mine!).All that said, a few points:1. Karp is a bit repetitive, as other reviewers have noted. But given my mental state in the early months, that was about the only way I could process information!! I think he did that intentionallly!2. Not all babies stay swaddled easily. TRUST ME. Even the hospital nurses were surprised by my son's Houdini antics. You can buy special swaddlers online. Worth the extra money, imo. Get two - one clean and one in the wash at all times.3. Buy a really good swing. Yes, the kind with batteries. You'll be happier. We were advised by a friend to buy the hand cranked kind. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! If you are worried about batteries in landfills - buy the rechargeable kind!!!!!!!We ONLY use the swing for sleep, btw. The rest of the time he's in his papasan or, more likely, on me. These days, he's rolling (both ways at 4 mos.) on the ground, too. If anyone gives you grief about the swing, tell 'em to think of it as a \\"motion pacifier.\\" Same basic concept really...and beats the heck out of driving around. (Think of the money you'll save on gas.)4. Karp talks a lot about babies sleeping through the night (5+ hours). For more out-of-the-gate mellow babies, maybe. However, my son is exclusively breastfed AND frisky (read: burns more calories) AND had colic well into the third month. He's had a couple of 5+ hours of sleep, but not routinely. Keep in mind that MOST people formula feed...and they may get a longer sleep in the swing (formula stays in the belly longer). That said, without the swing, my darling boy would prolly not have stretched out his feedings so easily. So, if your child is physically active, keep all that in mind. (Note, too, that there's evidence that exclusively breastfed infants don't naturally sleep the night until closer to 6 months. Unfortunately, most of the sleep research out there is on FORMULA fed infants.)5. If you want to sleep share (cosleep), the swing is still useful. We started a bedtime routine that ended in the swing early on. This helped him get used to sleeping - closing his own eyes without mom (again the pacifief concept) - for a bit alone. In the night, usually for the first feed, he moves in with us. This gives mom a break at night to sleep, rest, etc. This also has helped him learn to sleep flat and still - if that's something that worries anyone about the Karp technique. You can also use the swing to induce slumber and then transfer to crib.Finally, I had to chuckle at the parent-to-be who wonders if this book will be useful. Time will tell! In my mind's eye, I had visions of a peacefully sleeping baby in a bassinet. I delivered a vibrant, otherwise happy and physically advanced baby boy who SHOOK his bassinet, would only sleep next to mom and dad in the beginning and who cried like a banshee. I wouldn't trade him for ANYTHING!!!! - but I also wouldn't have made it without Dr. Karp.Saint Harvey INDEED!!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a new Mom, I am doing a lot of reading on different parenting techniques--especially to calm my infant son when he gets fussy in the evening. This book is very interesting in its description of the missing fourth trimester. It really helps explain what babies are going through in those early weeks. Dr. Karp's calming techniques (the 5 Ss) are excellent. Dr. Karp notes that you have to do them exactly right to calm your baby, but I found that even doing them partially sometimes was very helpful. When my son was at his fussiest, doing all 5 of the Ss really did do the trick. This book is easy to read quickly but could be condensed--there was a lot of repetitive information. I feel like he could get to the point faster so that we can get out there and start soothing our crying babies. I do like Dr. Karp's tone--he is very encouraging and conversational in his writing. The cartoons in the book were a bit goofy, however. :)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was at my wit's end with my daughter at two months old. As soon as I started using the method in this book, she went from sleeping an hour or less at a time to sleeping five hours at a time. She became calm right away every time with this book. If you have a colicky baby or a baby who is not a good sleeper, this book can help you and your baby!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We bought this book out of desperation of sorts: we were trying to find a way to persuade our infant daughter to sleep a little longer at night and, hopefully, give us a little more sleep. We followed Dr. Karp's advice: swaddling and white noise did the trick! She went from waking every hour and a half to waking every two to three hours. It doesn't sound like much, but every minute more feels amazing.I think this book is a big help to parents in that it gives them some time-tested methods to help soothe their babies. However, once you get past the five Ss (swaddle, side, shhhh, swing, suck), the book doesn't have a lot more to offer. It's full of a lot of anecdotes, most of which include the phrase, \\"Dr. Karp is amazing!\\"That being said, I did appreciate the advice the book had to offer and it was nice to read the words, \\"Your baby cries.

She raised 4 kids, helps with 8 grandkids and was a neonatal nurse for 10 years. She was blown away by his wonderful techniques too.My son would have been labeled colic, but instead I had tools to use and made it through with my sanity.

Not only did it give us ideas about how to calm our newborn, but it also gave us some understanding of how a baby thinks and views his world, more so than other texts I had read. (And I've read plenty!) It's true that the book works best for the first three months, but it doesn't really pretend to be more than that. Dr. Karp's idea that there is a \\"fourth trimester\\" really makes a lot of sense, and those three months are the focus of the book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone! I have a 6 week old baby girl. She is not a coliky baby but would scream at night for no reason. (I thought) When she would sleep, it was only 15-30 min. incriments.(sp?) Unless she was in bed with me. I read the book immediately after I recieved it, tried the 5s's on my daughter, and they worked!! She now sleeps by herself and one night slept six and a half hours!!! I had to wake her to feed her! I have only had the book one week and already feel like a pro at calming my baby! I can't say enough about it. I will buy this book for every expecting mother I know. What's even better is I had a question about one of the 5s's and the Dr. himself e-mailed me the next day with an answer!!! Don't pass up this book!

He had gotten into a quick 30 min nap routine. The book was an easy read and the concepts and diagrams were easy to follow. After the first swaddle my son slept 3 hrs compared to the 30 mins. We had gotten into a good routine for about 1-2 weeks, so I stopped with the swaddle and still continued the white noise and shushing. Well after a week of quick naps, no sleep for mom and an unhappy baby we went back to the book and will continue all the concepts until the \\"fourth trimester\\" is over. Thank you Harvey Karp for a great book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was given to me as a baby shower gift and I have since given it to everyone I know having a baby. The information is extrememly helpful for first time parents or for teh parents of a colicy child. The layout is great and the book is very easy to read.

It is written simply and gives step-by-step techniques for calming your newborn. The author leaves nothing to chance, he explains all details so even the clueless among us can learn how to use the calming method which involves swaddling, shhhing, swaying and jiggling your baby to turn on a 'calming' reflex that works amazingly well. I would also recommend another book that Dr. Karp wrote the introduction for: Gentle Baby Care, and also The No-Cry Sleep Solution, and Baby Signs."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The techniques in this book really work!Our six week-old daughter has cried for 2-4 hours every evening without fail for the last 3-4 weeks. We have tried everything: every possible way of bouncing, jiggling, rocking and swinging; walks outside; drives in the car; warm baths; baby massage; \\"bicycling\\" her legs; singing; white noise; Mylicon drops...everything suggested by our pediatrician, What to Expect the First Year, Dr. Spock and the Le Leche League. Everything worked sometimes, though rarely more than once and rarely for more than a few mintues. We had just about given up and decided to buckle down for another 6 weeks of colic. Then we found this book. We did everything it said to do and, like magic, we can now soothe our colicky baby in minutes...seconds if we work quickly.I would recommend this book to anyone with a colicky/fussy baby. It is a quick and fun read...lots of passages to read aloud to your spouse...and it will help you to stop your baby's crying...not just tell you it's ok to put the baby down walk away...no, it will actually help you stop the crying. Quickly. Easily. Really."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We bought this book two weeks before the birth of our fourth child. We were trying desperately to avoid the situation we found ourselves in with our third: a fussy, high maintenance baby who cried often and was difficult to console. We began practicing Dr. Karp's methods while still in the hospital. We were astounded at the results. We realized that we had stumbled onto the secrets of baby soothing! All in one volume!People scoffed. Friends told us it was too good to be true. Many seemed to gleefully await the dreaded six-week mark when &quot;colic&quot; supposedly appears. Our little one sailed right past the &quot;colicky&quot; period. Content. Sleeping six hours at six weeks and ten hours at ten weeks. This from a breastfed baby!Dr. Karp makes the distinction between true colic and an unhappy baby. It will be very easy to tell if your baby is truly suffering from an actual medical problem or if your little one is simply craving a return to the way it was in the womb!We cannot recommend this book highly enough. If you could only buy one baby book, THIS SHOULD BE THE ONE!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone with an infant! Our 6 week old baby girl simply could not settle down. After reading Dr. Karp's book and implementing the 5 S's, my husband and I can now help her to relax. It is amazing! The steps are simple and the book is an easy read. Again, I recommend it for any new parent!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp is welcome at our home anytime!I learned about this book when our little girl was six weeks old. At that time she would not sleep in her bassinet and wanted to comfort nurse for hours in the evening and at night (and I do mean hours). She would wail if she wasn't nursing or being held. I usually eneded up falling alseep while I was nursing her in bed. When I tried to put her in her bassinet, she would wake up and cry until she was in my arms and nursing again and the cycle repeated itself all night long. Her longest sleeping stretch was four hours. I was exhausted and always on the verge of tears and my husband was sleeping in our guest bedroom so that he could be functional at work the next day.The first night we tried the S's, Madeline slept for five and a half hours. The next night was almost seven hours. In the three weeks since, we've never had less than a five hour stretch and once she slept for almost nine hours. When she does wake up to nurse, I keep her swaddled and she goes right back to sleep.Our little one certainly cries less since we adopted the Karp method. We were already using the SHH (a box fan on high works better for us) but not the rest of the S's. Using four of the five S's (she still won't take a pacifier), she almost goes into a trance once she stops crying. Another nice benefit is that my husband puts her to sleep at night using the S's and that's his special time with her.I can imagine the Karp method won't work well for older babies but it has worked wonders in our home with our little one. My husband calls this the best [money] we've spent and we're telling everyone we know how well the Karp method has worked for us."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I live in the Los Angeles, CA area, and I had heard of Dr. Harvey Karp before I had my daughter. I was given his book when I gave birth to her, and started to read it. I am blessed with a very easy going baby (so far!), so I did not have to do the 5 S's very often. The biggest gift Dr. Karp gave us though was SWADDLING! She would instantly be calmed if we swaddled her. It was amazing! And still is swaddled! She is five and half months old and I still swaddle her! And I will continue as long as she wants it! She has been sleeping through the night for several months and has 3 solid naps a day, I think because of swaddling!I would highly recommend this book and also a &quot;Swaddle Me&quot; blanket for every new parent. These two things will be baby shower gifts for all my friends having babies. Buy this book now if you have a crying newborn and swaddle away! Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A must have for all parents of newborn babies. My daughter was diagnosted with colic at 3 weeks and reflux at 5 weeks. She would have crying fits, would not sleep with out a battle, and was generally very fussy. I read this book in one day - I was desperate for help - and it took me about 3 days to really get a hang of it. Now my daughter falls asleep in a few minutes, even less, instead of the hours it would take before. She sleeps longer and last week started sleeping through the night. This book saved my sanity and my back. I am buying it for all my friends. Some people might give up on it after a few tries but I recommend dedicating yourself to at least 4 days of trying it out before giving up.We even went on two long distance trips, and I was able to keep her happy and calm during the whole trip. Yes family thought I was nuts doing it this way and called me a &quot;book&quot; mom, but hey my daughter sleeps and is happy.Even if your child does not have colic I would recommend buying this book. It is a life saver."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This was about the only good advice I encountered for taking care of my newborn. She's 1 now and I'm starting to think about getting, \\"The Happiest Toddler on the Block.\\" She was very difficult as a newborn, cried a lot, trouble sleeping, constantly wanted to be held. This taught us how to swaddle and comfort her and it helped...not perfectly, but better than anything else. This, combined with a rock-n-play sleeperFisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellowwas a lifesaver. When she was older we had a little trouble getting her to sleep without her swaddle, but we used something called a zippadee zip to transition her, and later used Ferber method so she'd sleep in her crib and it worked. Only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is the book really isn't necessary...watch the video and you can actually see how to do the techniques and it only takes about 20 minutes. The book has some additional interesting info. but if you just want the basics so you can survive those early months, the video is all you need."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was a bit skeptical regarding this book; so many people raved about it and many people bashed it as \\"simplistic\\" Well, I agree with the former.First, it was a very entertaining read. Dr. Karp did his best to make the book a very easy, fun read, chock-full of interesting and very useful information!Yes, you may have heard about swaddling and making the \\"shhhh\\" noise to calm the baby, however the depth in which Dr. Karp describes each of these helpful techniques is truly astounding--and it's not boring! In fact, I wanted to read more and more! I even liked the somewhat \\"cheesy\\" cartoons and all of the testemonials, which fit with the content very well.Speaking about the content--I am a new Mom and although I have heard about all of these techniques in passing, Dr. Karp truly put all of them in perspective. I have tried each of them on my \\"average temperament\\" baby, even during crying fits and they all work as Dr. Karp claims! Sometimes, the simplest techniques work! I know so many parents that like to give their children medication for reflux, colic, excessive crying etc. I prefer to go the natural route first, and if that doesn't work, I'll explore other options. I believe that this approach is healthier for all, especially small infants. Dr. Karp fully agrees, and encourages parents to try all of these techniques first, before going the medical route.I have tried everthing that Dr. Karp outlined in his book, and as a result, my daughter is happier and healthier! I found the book to be fun and informative. I feel that I have learned a lot about parenting and soothing from this publication. I would love to meet Dr. Karp in order to experience this man, whom I believe to be kind and very intelligent.True, the suggestions in the book are simplistic and there are no clear scientific data, however, any distraught parent will tell you, this works! Of course, it takes longer on the parent's part to engage in all of these techniques, which some will find discouraging; I am a very impatient person, and if I can do these, I believe most can!When it comes to my daughter, I believe in no short-cuts and in doing everything right the first time around. Dr. Karp's book is very positive and encouraging and I feel that I am a better parent from having read it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The writing is fairly terrible, and the book is annoyingly (really annoyingly) repetitive. You can get all the information you need in fewer than 5 pages of reading. If this book were edited down to the useful information without repeats- it would be a pamphlet- not a book! And that would be so much more useful, as when you're a new parent brevity and concise information are very helpful in your sleepy stressed-out state. So I'd give it 1 star for writing, for being annoying to read, and for taking too much of my valuable time.That said, the actual content and point of the book is truly amazing. If you take the tips and the main points- IT WILL SAVE YOU. So for the hard content of this book, I'd give 5 stars.This makes an average of 3 stars, which is why I rated it as I did."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"While I totally get the need for the 5 S's...and they make sense evolutionarily, biologically, and...well...all around, I feel like I could have gotten all I need to know from a couple of condensed chapters. This book angered me while reading it and made me feel like I was wasting a lot of time just to get to the good stuff! While Dr. Karp might be incredibly knowledgeable, world-renowned, and...well...RIGHT, he is NOT a good writer. There are WAY TOO MANY wasted pages, redundant personal stories/anecdotes, and repeated information. (Hint: Don't waste four chapters telling me what colic ISN'T). My recommendation-- if you want to read the book, buy/borrow used. Also, spot read the important chapters (like what are the 5 S's and how do you do them correctly). OR look them up online. They are pretty common sense, but I did learn a few tips/techniques that might go against your intuition, so I DO RECOMMEND learning them correctly, but this book is just too many wasted words.

Dr. Karp's advice is solid and, without a doubt, helpful. Was it as helpful as I'd thought it would be when I read it at 8 months pregnant? Absolutely not. But isn't that the case with any parenting book read before actually becoming a parent? Reading it when I did, however, helped to ease some of my anxiety as I tried to mentally prepare for the possibility of a colicky newborn. And you *will* be able to add at least some of the ideas found here to your ever-expanding, ever-changing \\"bag of tricks.\\" I especially appreciated the thorough explanations on *how* to implement the \\"5 Ss\\" (swaddling, swinging, shushing, side/stomach position, sucking). These tequniques are not new -in fact, they are rather intuituve- and you will probably find them in almost any other baby book -- but not in this kind of depth. More importantly, the author unites these tequniques under a common rationale. And his thesis makes sense. Why wouldn't a new baby be comforted by the experiences he/she experienced in the womb? My baby loved white noise during his first several weeks (he still likes it). Swaddling has been a gift. I can't say enough good things about the pacifier, and our cradle swing has been a god-send. That said, I'm sure a lot of this reflects my own parenting style and preferences. Also, I have struggled with one of the Dr.'s main points: the importance of what he calls \\"vigor\\". For my baby, increasing the intensity of my jiggling, swinging, shushing -whatever- in porportion to the intensity of his crying was often counter-productive. He seemed to prefer my husband's gentler approach. Also, you could drive youself crazy trying to combine all the \\"S\\"s in just the right way and with exactly the right intensity (which the author insists you must do for truly fussy babies). In my experience, there simply is no one single \\"cuddle cure\\". What's helping today may not quite be \\"what the doctor ordered\\" tomorrow -heck, may not even be working five minutes from now. At which point, you will draw from your little \\"bag of tricks\\" or from your own timid but growing parental intuition and try something else. You try to learn to \\"read\\" your child. You begin to realize it will be a life-long endeavor but probably the most important endeavor you will ever undertake as a parent. Reading this book, on the other hand, will only take a few enjoyable sittings (it is -at the very least- an interesting read) and will give you some good ideas and facts to get started with."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Harvey Karp is a genius and his techniques work. However, you won't actually be able to figure out what his techniques are unless you buy the video instead of the book. In this case, a picture is worth a thousand words, and as the parent of a colicky baby you won't have time to read this book and try and figure out exactly what he means by a 'shush' sound."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Harvey Karp's methods work to calm a crying baby and can help save your sanity in the middle of the night. But get the DVD, not the book. For the shushing noise we used the fan on our ancient microwave. It prevented hyperventilation from trying to \\"shush\\" under our own power. But I just don't buy that babies cry for no reason. I'm convinced that gas is a big cause of crying in the very young (under 3 months).

Even though I don't have children of my own yet, because I have taken my fair share of child development books, and I've practiced on my friends' children, I know Dr. Karp's methods work! Not to mention it's full of anecdotes that are hilarious. This is a great book not only for parents, but caregivers and birth-kindergarten majors! Anyone who has ever spent time around babies can appreciate the wit and inspiring (and comforting) ideas that Dr. Karp has packed his book with. I have already bought the second book, The Happiest Toddler on the Block. I can't wait to read it too!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I couldn't be happier with this book and the advice in it. It is a quick, easy read.(Perfect for sleep-deprived parents). When we brought our daughter home from the hospital my husband and I were very inexperienced at caring for an infant. We thought since she appeared to dislike the swaddling maybe we shouldn't wrap her up that way. Needless to say, her naps were very short if at all. The book explains the importance of swaddling to provide security and the importance of white noise to mimic the sounds of the womb. We began swaddling and turned on the white noise machine immediately. What a huge difference. Half hour naps became 1 1/2 hour naps. She also began sleeping 4 to 5 hours at a stretch at night. The book explains what life is like for an infant. I found that really helpful. This book definitely helped us all get some sleep. I really recommend it especially for first time parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book makes absolute sense and works.

BUY IT!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a great book! I wish I had bought this book sooner. It would have saved me weeks of frustration out of mine and my baby's life. Though my baby isn't colick, she's high maintenance and constantly needs to be carried and soothed. We've found that Dr. Karp's methods have helped immensely. Though she still has her fussy periods, at least now we are able to control it better and not become so frustrated ourselves. This book is a life saver!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"These techniques really work! The only thing I would add is a longer section on how wearing a sling goes right along with this method of comforting. With the sling and this book we are able to comfort our daughter 99% of the time in just minutes! My parenting library is now over 30 books and this is the one I recommend the most to friends.Both of my children would probably have been labled \\"colicky\\" or \\"difficult\\" babies and I read this book when I was pregnant with baby #2. I really wish I would have read it before I had baby #1 because it has saved us hours of crying with baby #2 who is actually a more fussy baby than #1 was, though cries much less when we apply the method presented in this book.It is an easy, quick and entertaining read!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was skeptical at first about this DVD, so I previewed it before showing it at a new mother's group. I was so impressed! The information was so practical that I could hardly wait to try it out myself with a crying baby. The mothers in the group also thought it was great. I particularly enjoyed the idea of seeing the first three months as \\"the fourth trimester.\\" What a marvelous and useful concept! I have since used the techniques with various crying babies, and they work every time."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I gave this book to my best friend, and she says she owes me bigtime.

They are currently 8 months old and we swaddled right up to about 7 months old! They loved it and they slept through the night because of swaddling since 2 months old. As soon as they were swaddled we could put them down awake and they would fall asleep within 15 minutes with no fussing. They are now more active and like to move around more so they are now sleeping in sleepsacks. I just think some parents think swaddling is just for newborns but if your baby really loves it and is comforted by it keep doing it?they will let you know when they don?t want to be swaddled anymore."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have a 6 week old baby girl who is right at the height of her colicky phase. Last night even the 5 S's (which normally work fabulously) were only working temporarily, so I decided to try something drastic. Since I really needed to vacuum, I decided to combine the two efforts and see what happened. Since Dr. Karp says that cultures who &quot;wear&quot; their babies rarely have problems with colic, I purchased one of those baby slings. I put her in it and got the vacuum out and proceeded to vacuum. Within about 15 seconds she was asleep and stayed asleep the entire hour it took to vacuum, complete with all the movement that comes with the task. The only precaution I had to take was to make sure I didn't hit something with her, since she was an extention of my body. If anyone needed more proof of the 4th Trimester theory, HERE IT IS!! Save yourself a lot of heartache, and buy and read this book before your baby is born!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am the mother of two &quot;high-needs&quot;, fussy, colicky or whatever you want to call it, babies. My son is just 7 weeks old and although I did not need this book to teach me what Karp calls the 5 S's, (most mothers instictively wrap, rock, hush, etc.) it was so nice to read that what I was doing by tightly wrapping, loudly hushing, and harshly swinging was ok. New mothers are often anxious with their babies and treat them much more carefully than necessary. Tricks like securing the swaddle with masking tape or duct tape, using the highest speed on your swing and the &quot;jell-o head jggle&quot; are all things that I have used successfully but wondered if such &quot;harsh&quot; treatment is ok. Yes yes yes! Although visitors may come over and see my newborn tightly bound in a blanket with masking tape around him, swinging very fast in his baby swing and question my mothering skills- I have a happy baby that stays asleep!If I don't swaddle my baby, the most he ever sleeps for is about 15 minutes. With a tight wrap, I can get 2 hour naps out of him during the day and about 4 at night. The main trick for us is a secure wrap! Don't be afraid to use the tape! It sounds awful and I felt ashamed at first, like I was hurting him or at least overpowering him unfairly. But, as Karp explains, so many other cultures do this using rope or twine to secure their swaddled babies. Newborn babies are used to being &quot;swaddled&quot; extremely tight in the womb. Not used to open spaces, they can't control their limbs and often scratch at their face, squirm and cry. Swaddling is SO helpful for parent and baby.Another thing I have resorted to with my difficult babies is a lot of swinging! Even sleeping at night swinging happily in their baby swings. I remember being pregnant with my first and reading somewhere that infant swings are for mothers that neglect their babies and don't want to hold them! I hesitated buying one because I wanted to do the &quot;right thing&quot;. What I quickly learned after a few weeks of hysterical screaming is that the &quot;right thing&quot; is whatever safely calms you and your baby down! I recently purchased the new cradle swing that goes side to side as well as front to back. My little boy loves it and sleeps peacefully every night. Karp mentions that this much swinging is just fine unlike Marc Weissbluth in &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child&quot; when he explains that babies need motionless sleep. This may be true and eventually I do want my baby sleeping in his crib, but for now I do what I can to keep from going crazy! If it works, I'm going to keep it up!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I were exhausted beyond belief after trying our own (numerous) techniques to get our 4 week old firstborn son to sleep. Nothing was working for us and he was only sleeping for an hour or so at a time each night. After applying Dr. Karp's techniques, he began to sleep for three and four hour stretches on a regular basis. We have regained our sanity!Additionally, we have employed the same techniques when our son becomes extremely fussy during the day and in almost all instances, we are able to calm him down within a minute or two. We are thinking of renaming our son Harvey!! Just kidding....but we are seriously indebted to Dr. Karp and so thankful that his theories have made all the difference to us. Life has become manageable again."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I stumbled upon this book while looking for books on how to get my baby to sleep more hours through the night. I decided to give it a shot, mostly because of the reviews posted here on Amazon. It's the best [money] I've spent! While our son is not colicky (he doesn't scream and cry), he is fussy. His fussiness began at seven weeks- he just seemed unhappy- crying etc. He also had trouble falling asleep- especially during the day. He only would sleep 2-3 hours at night. Now we use the methods described in the book, and it calms him right down. He stops crying and becomes very peaceful and sleeps like the dead (five hours straight last night!) The methods are not difficult and the book is very funny. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a fussy or colicky baby!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I got this book when my baby was a couple weeks old. He wasn't that fussy and for the most part he's pretty mellow. My doctorhad told us of some techniques to use to quiet him down when he did cry. Most of those techniques were mentioned in this book, but the book gave more techniques and more insight as to why they work.Not all of these will apply to every baby, so use the ones that work for your baby. My son loves to be swaddled (even now at 3 months!). The book was worth reading for one tip alone - thehead jiggle. No, not a head shake! A gentle little jiggle that's barely noticible... patting him gently on the back will do it. Swaddle the tyke up and pat his back and he goes from all out crying/screaming to snoozing in a minute or two. I never would have beleived it but it works every time!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a must have for all novice and experienced parents of a new baby.

The two boys did not sleep well for the first three months after birth. Our daughter was exhausted...and this was what she dreaded...was three months with little sleep. After her shower, when she got the book...she read some each night...and when the baby was born she went by the book...swaddling the baby, etc. This is unreal but the baby will be two weeks old tomorrow...and she has slept through the night twice already!!!! She is such a wonderfully comfortable baby and cries only when she is hungry or needs a change of diapers. This is a must for any parent inexperienced or experienced.

Dr. Harvey presents his advice clearly and concisely, and provides much interesting and useful information about parenting and infant development.One thing I especially liked is that it was simple to adapt Dr. Karp's general approach to our child's specific temperament and personality.This book is a real gem; it will guide parents for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I haven't had my baby yet, but I know I will be using the 5 S's when I do.

The well-researched and well-written book goes a long way toward toward helping parents achieve some sleep.My only concern, is the sucking S of the five S's, described in the book. Although, Dr. Karp clearly describes the place of the sucking role in calming a baby, many moms may feel an around-the-clock offering of the breast is necessary to calm her little one. While a 24 hour offering of the breast to feed and suckle is a solution for some moms, many moms may not be up to that challenge. It is therefore a good idea, to read the book in its entirety to clearly understand how all the S's work in together and in a particular order to achieve the calming of your little guy."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We got this before our second child was born based on a recommendation from a friend. The suggestions have been very helpful. In general, I dislike didactic \\"how to raise your baby\\" books. There are no decent studies to demonstrate that one method is more effective than another, and everyone has strong opinions based on anecdotes. That said, I find it helpful to hear what \\"tricks\\" and \\"techniques\\" work for other parents so that I can incorporate if and as needed. To that end, this book is very good - when Jamie was younger, I increased the noise of my shushing, I rocked with more vigor, etc. These techniques seemed to work for her, and it's likely that they could work for other babies as well."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As the mother of a 7 week old-I have decided that babies need to come with an instruction manual. For the first month of my son's life I would dread him waking up as I never knew if he was going to be awake for 5 minutes or start in on a 3 hour crying spree.We also could not understand how our son would get out of a swaddle, could not burp him very well, and would sometimes spend up to 3 hours getting our son to sleep.This book was miraculous. This was the closest thing to the instruction manual we needed when our baby was born. We learned how to swaddle well-which helps tremendously with keeping our baby asleep. We also learned a very good technique to burp him-which so far has cut down tremendously on his spitting up, and general gassiness. But most importantly-my son doesn't cry for hours anymore-we can usually calm him down in a few minutes. Now when he is crying, we can usually attribute it to something.My son still has his fussy moments. He is a high needs, intense baby. However now I feel equiped to deal with him rather than at a loss for how to calm him down. I don't dread him waking up as much-and I feel better about having a baby. I think that every parent of a new baby should have this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I've watched the 'Happiest Baby' DVD and read the book.

The ideas apply to those early months, especially if your baby has colic. However, the ideas simply don't apply to a baby over 4 months. Swaddling and Shhhing (two of the keys) simply don't apply to older babies, and relying on the other keys: Swinging and Sucking will only create a situation where your baby relies on these things to sleep. (Trust me, my 1 year old still needed these, most likely because I used them so much during her early months!) Also, the other \\"S\\" side/stomach position goes against the Back to Sleep research that says babies are at risk of SIDS when sleeping on their stomach (even if they do like it better). I found more answers for my older baby, and ways to prevent the problems from happening in the first place for my next baby, in a different book: The No-Cry Sleep Solution."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Can we stop listening to a men to learn how to raise our infants just because he has a degree?

That mistake aside, I decided to read it anyway as my first Kindle book.The book itself is fairly good overall. My main criticism is that the text is somewhat pedantic and repetitive, and the author's \\"proofs\\" presented for the 4th trimester theory don't stand up at all if you are a fan of reading well executed and documented scientific investigation methods, which these are pretending to be. However, I did get some good advice out of it about calming my newborn (he's 2.5 weeks old today).Comments on the specific problems of the Kindle edition:1. There were numerous misspellings throughout the book (excepting, of course, the pages that were used for the sample). A basic spell checker would have found the majority of these problems as they seemed to be scanned text capture issues (like \\"Dr.\\" very frequently came out as \\"Or.\\") There were also a number of other word substitutions beyond misspellings, such as \\"sleep\\" would show up as \\"deep\\". In some chapters, there would be as many as 1 mistake per paragraph. This was highly annoying, especially to a new mother trying to relax and read a little while holding her fussy baby at 3 am.2. The charts weren't readable at all, and should have been probably re-entered as text charts rather than illustrations, or otherwise cut in half and put on two pages.I'm only giving it a 2-star rating entirely because of the poor editing job done for the Kindle e-book version, otherwise would have only taken one star off for the book itself for the lack of supporting scientific evidence given in a credible manner."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Wonderful experience with purchase.

Unfortunately, the author has decide it to wrap his advice in the rather unconvincing idea that evolution has stupidly decided to bring babies into the world before the they are ready to handle it. Swaddling babies is not a new idea and has been successfully practiced in baby care for centuries without the \\"fourth trimester\\" theory.The author also makes frequent general assertions that \\"primitive cultures\\" in Africa and Asia possess inherent cultural wisdom that permits them to always treat their babies right. This idea, although complimentary of those \\"primitive cultures\\" (as he calls them, though with the quotation marks), is inherently racist, and Karp never back up such assertions with actual data or by quoting studies.I wish Dr. Karp would just stick to providing his useful advice and keep his half-baked theories about the fourth trimester and the inherent wisdom of \\"primitive cultures\\" to himself."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"this book was very highly recommended to me from all my girlfriends with new babies, but after reading through it, I found it to be just a whole lot of common sense stuff written the same way in many different chapters.

They work to calm a fussy baby because your baby misses being inside of you! They miss the warm, tight, curled up feeling, and they miss your smell and the sound of your heart beat. If that is what they miss, then give it back to them! The 5 s's are \\"good\\" suggestions....but there is an answer far superior. Hold your baby. Nurse your baby on cue. Sleep with your baby. Carry your baby close to you (wrapped in a maya-wrap sling, for example, which frees your hands while keeping your baby happy and nurtured). Instead of a swing calming your baby, YOU be the one to calm your baby. Studies have shown that when a crying baby is being comforted by human touch, the crying is far less harmful to their emotional-psychological development (as opposed to a crying baby being \\"soothed\\" by a rocking swing or other non-human device).This is how we have chosen to parent our baby. She is now 10 months old, and from the very beginning we have received numerous comments from friends and strangers about how happy she is, even as a newborn. By trusting our instincts and my natural mothering ability to hold my baby and nurture her by my own touch, we truly had the \\"happiest baby on the block.\\"I highly recommend books by Dr. Sears (\\"The Baby Book,\\" \\"The Attachment Parenting Book,\\" and more) as well as a book called \\"The No-Cry Sleep Solution,\\" if you need help with a crying baby who has trouble sleeping at night.

It was miserable, and you feel so helpless when your baby is crying and nothing you do soothes him. Our pediatrician told us we would have to \\"wait it out\\" for several weeks until the colic phase passed. I would have lost my mind if we had not found this book! I have since recommended it to anyone and everyone I know having a baby, because even if the baby doesn't have colic, all babies cry at some point, and this book is invaluable!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have read many baby books, but this book makes sense, and most of all Dr. Karp's techniques really work! If you follow his advice step by step, you will have a calm baby! We begin to swaddle our son and his eyes get sleepy even before we are done! A fast and helpful read!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"an excellent, practical book relevant to the first few months of your baby's life. It is very useful in managing fussiness/colic. great to read during the third trimester. That way, you can use the skills learned in this book on day 1."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My sister-in-law first brought this product to my attention some time ago. When I became pregnant I included it on my registry and that was about it. I had no idea what a lifesaver this book was going to be.In introducing parents to the 5 S's (which include shushing and swaddling), Dr. Karp does not just give suggestions on how to soothe your crying infant, he actually backs them up with hard evidence. The information he provides helps you understand why a particular method works.My husband and I had an infant that would probably be considered \\"high need\\" as perThe Baby Book. However, the moment we put Dr. Karp's plan in motion, our son would instantly calm down and within minutes fall into a deep sleep.To address any of the less than stellar reviews--will this product work 100% for everyone? Maybe not, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it. Plus, infants are fickle. A method may work great for awhile and then not at all and it might not work one moment and then work great the next. The key is that Dr. Karp gives parents yet another set of tools to put in our parenting \\"arsenal.\\"Our son is now five months old. We don't do ALL of the S's anymore (it was 100% part of our bed time routine until his fourth month), but we do lightly swaddle him (his night movements still tend to wake him up) and we do shush him as he begins to fall asleep (white noise is wonderful!). Dr. Karp clearly explains why his method works for the first three months (babies are born too early and we need to mimic the womb), but also says that some babies may continue to respond to some of the methods--this was true for us.As for theThe Happiest Baby on the Block - The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Baby Sleep Longer (DVD), I read the book while waiting for our son to arrive. I told my husband everything I had learned and we even posted the quick reference section on how to do the 5 S's in our son's room. However, it wasn't until we watched the DVD that it all came together. Dr. Karp shows each of the methods with real babies and their parents. He answers questions and explains the rationale behind the methods.The book and the DVD together would make an excellent purchase for ALL new parents.[...]"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My pediatrician recommended this book to me as it helped her with her baby. I found it so helpful as it equipped me with new techniques to soothe my newborn when she was having a \\"meltdown.\\" I couldn't believe how easy it was! Now I can calm her down very quickly so she can be in a peaceful state.I stopped using the Mylicon gas drops for what I thought was colic. It turned out that my newborn just needed to be soothed when she felt overwhelmed by the sensory overload in our world. She missed the womb and we needed to use the 5 steps to soothe (swaddling, shushing, swinging, sucking, side position.This book saved us from countless hours of crying (the baby and us!)."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is really great. I learned so much from it and everyone really should read it. However, don't expect it to be as easy as it looks or sounds in the book. It really does work but you might need to keep trying but it's worth it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a great book for 1st time parents. Tells you how to calm your baby if your baby cries all the time, there are effective ways to calm him. Reassures you that you aren't a bad parent. Some babies are just fussy. The book does go on a bit I didn't read the whole thing. Who has time? But read enough to help calm baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this when my son was 5 weeks old. He was fussy because he couldn't get to sleep, but not colicky. The 5 S's worked like a charm for him. He was finally able to sleep (and so was I!) I recommend that you get the Miracle blanket and slumber bear to use with it. It worked like a charm for our son. He's 6 months old, and does sleeps just fine with only a pacifier at night and naptime now."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I love this book!! Our second child was a real screamer and the suggestions totally worked!! I liked his re-assuring tone and knowing that this, too, shall pass. We also have the \\"Happiest Toddler on the Block\\" which has given us very effective strategies for disciplining and connecting with our son. Dr. Karp is number one in our household!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's book wasn't very helpful for us, it is also unnecessary lengthy, full of repetitions, and stories that are of little help. I wish I didn't buy his book, but bought Marc Weissbluth's \\"Your fussy baby\\" instead. I am reading Weissbluth's book now and find it so much more informative and interesting, fullof interesting up to date research information and recommendations on how to deal with crying and sleeping problems in babies."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"There is some solid advice in this book however it could have been written in a pamphlet. The author uses way too many words and too many examples to prove his point. He makes you read through way too much history to get to the good useful points."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Hands down, this was the single most essential baby item we had for our daughter. If you have a cranky or colicky baby, this dvd is a lifesaver. Don't know what we would have done without it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"That is why it is the first gift on my list for any baby shower I attend.These techniques literally changed our experience with our baby. You just can't imagine how inadequate and how frustrated and fearful you can become when you cannot comfort your crying baby until you are in that position. Read this book, use the 5 S's and watch the transformation.At first read you might think shshing that loudly will hurt the babies ears, or you might wonderhow the baby will breathe being swaddled so tightly. But the book assures you that the baby is most comfortable in a loud, crampedenvironment and that replicating that will actually soothe her. And in our case it certainly did. For what it's worth I'm writing this review seven years later. That might speak to what a profound impact it made for us."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I recently (Fall '10) purchased the Happiest Baby book and video, as well as the Happiest Toddler book and video. I received exactly what I ordered, in excellent condition, packaged well, and delivered on time. I have a 2 1/2 year old son, a 16 month old daughter and a 3 month old daughter. As a physician and an experienced mother of 2, I thought I was prepared for number 3 but when she was about 3 weeks old, she developed colic. I've actually viewed the video before and recommended it to patients of mine, but for some reason, I couldn't calm this child! I purchased the video and the book, and quickly realized that I wasn't using the techniques aggressively enough (not shaking of course). Reading the book and watching the video refreshed my technique and taught me the reasoning behind it and was a lifesaver! Now the techniques come as second nature. She was calmed within minutes and cried less than 30 minutes per night afterward (down from 4 hours!) Inexpensive and well worth the purchase!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The first 3-4 chapters kind of drag, then it FINALLY gets in to the details on how to calm your baby. I bought this book because I'm having my 3rd child, the last one being born almost 8 years ago. I was trying to brush up on my skills but found that this book didn't offer me much of what I didn't already know from trial and error. This is a good book for anyone that thinks letting a baby \\"cry it out\\" and \\"holding your baby too much is spoiling them\\". Good arguments on why not to do that."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I found this book very helpful with my daughter, the techniques that Dr Karp describes in the book are ancient, yes, and many may think they are obvious, that he brings nothing new to the table and you may be partially correct, the key to success though, which Dr. Karp's helps us learm, is first understanding why these techniques work and then apply them, thus, knowing why they work will help you to achieve success. Swaddling for example, many many people think babies need to sleep with complete freedom, but when you read the book you will know why this concept does not apply to many babies, then you apply Dr. Karp's technique (swaddling a fussy baby is not easy!) and you may achieve the desired result, which is what the nurse at our pediatrician's office called \\"instant happy baby\\", and this, you learn from Dr Karp's explanations. Anyway, you think you can't read the whole book, then at least buy the DVD and learn the techniques in a few hours, it's totally worth it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We have the companion book to this DVD and this gives you all the information you need in a better format than print. It is much better to see Harvey Karp's methods demonstrated visually than try to understand them from written text.That said, the information in this DVD is invaluable and succinct. It has made having a newborn much easier than the alternative described by MY poor mother. Harvey Karp will save your sanity."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Very good and informative DVD. I recommend this DVD for anyone with a newborn as a \\"Must have\\". What was unclear by the description though is that this DVD really isn't for babies older than 6 months. It's more for newborns. If your child is 6-mos and up, I recommend Elizabeth Pantley's \\"No Cry\\" series (both Sleep and Nap Solutions). Unfortunately it's not available on DVD."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The explanation of the \\"fourth trimester\\" is very valuable for a parent to understand, but some of the anecdotal side stories got a little tired. Karp gives a great approach to calming a baby. However, there are a few things he recommends that seem a little contradictory to me. First, he advises \\"swinging\\" a baby, which any parent knows can be very soothing (though neither of mine EVER were a fan of the baby swing. He goes so far to advise that the baby SLEEP in the swing which no pediatrician I have ever encountered favors. In fact, I believe there are specific warnings on the swing that you should never allow your child to sleep in it without an awake parent in the room. He also dismisses concerns about \\"weaning\\" the baby from his program as though it will be easy. I am currently in the process of weaning a 3 month old from swaddling as she is waking herself up trying to get out of the swaddle (yet wakes when I try to put her down asleep without it) and is desperately trying to roll over already which obviously makes the swaddle dangerous. He sort of off-handedly advises leaving one arm out, then two, etc., but this is MUCH easier said than done. I could see very similar problems with swinging, sucking, white noise... Finally, he frequently expresses a disapproval of letting a baby cry. Yet, towards the end of the book, he suggests putting the baby down for sleep awake after the 3 month mark as though they will just get themselves to sleep. My experience has been that after getting a baby used to such specific sleep conditions, it's either going to take some crying or a lot more maturing to get the baby to that point.That said, if you have lived with a colicky baby, you will do anything to calm him or her and a lot of his suggestions will work. I'm just not sure they will be as easy to do without as he claims."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I purchased this book a little too late, the advice is really for the first three months and my baby was already 3 months when I bought the book.

The idea of the fourth trimester is genius and we have a very well adjusted happy baby because of the ideas in this book, with that said the book could be much shorter than it is.

I have never read a book so fast! His advice resonates well with your soul and IT WORKS, instantly and is a easy and fun read. Forget all the medications recommended for colic or a fussy baby and buy this book. My only regret is that I did not buy it earlier. I am a Registered Midwife and even so, I did not know how to calm and soothe my baby - she cried for up to 7 hours a night, every night!

When he's fussy, my husband and I (S)waddle him, (S)sshhh him, (S)wing him on his (S)ide and let him (S)uck on his pacifier. Part of the 5 Ss. It's great. The theory about the baby being born 3 months early, and needing to be treated like he's still in the womb- warm, white noise, cuddled, it all makes sense. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It's simple, too simple to work, but it works. I read it for my grandchildren. I then watched my daughter stop her 4 week old from crying. Wow! Next time that the baby started to cry, daughter said, \\"You do it, Pop.\\" Worked in less than a minute. Takes a few times on a new baby so be patient (as if you have any choice w/ a crying infant.) Just buy the book. Both the baby and YOU will be happier. You may want to overnight it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this right after my second child was born. I had no idea you had to put their arms straight down when swaddling them. I loved to read this book, I couldn't put it down. For me the advice worked great. I wish I would have read it for my first child, but I don't know if it would have worked for her. She didn't like to be swaddled."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As far as \\"book review\\" goes, this book is not my style. I don't like the way it was written. I find the \\"scientific\\" explanations to be speculative at best. I agree with the person who gave a low review saying that the entire meat of the book could be condensed into a much, much shorter volume. Maybe people don't feel they'll get their $10.20's worth if it's only 50 pages?Despite my misgivings over the style of the book, the trick that it teaches (how to sooth a crying infant, 0-3 months old with swaddling, white noise, side/stomach lying, jiggling, and non-nutritive sucking) absolutely worked for my baby daughter. It worked quickly. It worked completely. It worked every time.I give this book two stars for written style and overall content, and five big and shiny stars for efficacy and importance of method. Skip to the chapters that explain each of the five s methods and those that concentrate on extending sleep, and you will cut out some of the fluff while retaining all of the most precious content.No matter how negatively I feel about certain aspects of this book, I give it to all of my pregnant friends, because the 5-S method helped my family so very much in those early months!

I'm pretty good with spatial reasoning tasks, but couldn't for the life of me get the swaddle technique right until I saw the video. Also, as great as Karp's methods are, keep in mind that the five S's are for AFTER you've tried all the usual things (burp, change, comfort, etc.). If you know nothing about babies, you'll need other books and videos to get coaching on those things."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this book for a friend after having borrowed a copy from a friend. This is the best resource I have read as a new Mom. The information is organized in such a way that I was able to easily memorize the five S's to comfort my baby. This book should be given to every new parent. I read it when my son was 3 weeks old, but wished I had the information even sooner. The information is geared for the first 3 months of the baby's life. I have read a lot of baby books, but this one was the best! I highly recommend it.

After my daughter was born my mother-in-law read this book and told me to get it too, since it explains colic and the 4th trimester concept in more detail while the DVD focuses on teaching the \\"how to\\" of the 5Ss. From day one we swaddled our baby and used shushing and swinging to calm her down. It really works! My parents were skeptical about the 5Ss at first, they thought a baby would need his/her arms free, thought the shushing was too loud, the swinging was too vigorous, and so on (they had the exact reactions to the techniques that Doctor Karp mentions in this book). Well, when they started seeing that it worked, they stopped questioning Doctor Karp's methods and started using them too. When our daughter starts crying in the car seat and we obviously can't pick her up, whomever is in the back seat with her starts shushing and it's the only thing that will calm her down.

It gives a completely fresh perspective on the early months of having a newborn, and Dr. Karp provides a nice counterbalance to many of the books on the market that tell you not to spoil your child and how to train them to sleep.Reading this (unfortunately, only when my baby was already about 5 weeks) really changed my life and my perspective as a mother. My life, because it provided me the means to calm my fussy baby and help her sleep. My perspective, because it reinforced that some of the things that seemed natural to me -- holding her close a lot, wearing her, etc. -- were in fact good things, not bad habits that would need to be broken.I stopped swaddling after about 3 months (she was too big and kicked it all off), and stopped some of the other S's around the same time or a bit later...and at 8 months (and for the past several months!), my baby sleeps calmly through the night, goes down peacefully at night, and is a very happy baby! People ask me all the time, \\"Is she always this happy?\\" and I can confirm, I have the happiest baby on the block!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We loved this book! and DVD.Only problem is we didn't realizes you must teach your baby to go to sleep on her/his own (you find that out only at the very very end of the book when it's a bit too late)Once your baby turns 3 months she/he should be sleeping on their own 2-3 naps a day and through the night.I highly recommend parents get this book but also get the book the \\"baby whisperer solves all your problems\\" by Tracey Hog her first book will only help before 3 months this one gives detailed explanations till toddler hood.Good luck."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a new mom sometimes you wonder if you are doing the right things with your baby, and one of the worst feelings is not being able to calm her when she is upset. Dr. Karp has really great information in this book. Its a easy easy read, and not only is it great info, his suggestions really do work. It amazing to be able to soothe your baby and also get a better understanding of life as a newborn. This book deserves 5 stars and more if I could give it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"this book has some great ideas, but by the time I got it, my babies were almost 3 months old, and a little past some of the suggestions - seems to mostly address newborns up to 3 or 4 months."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"At first I thought this book was just another one of those books. But then I started to try the different things it says in the book and started seeing results with my colicky baby. I just wish I read this book right after my baby was born. I didn't read it until she was 2 months old. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a colicky baby. It really works. I feel like I can bond with my baby like I wanted to now that I know what to do for her crying."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has been great so far. Just brought our daughter home and have already started to put things into practice. Thanks for the practical advice!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is excellent. Dr Karp not only teaches you the techniques to help your infant cry less and be happier, but he also explains the theory & why it works. In addition, he goes into other theories of colic, and explanations about them. As a pediatrician, I found this fascinating and very useful. I highly recomend this book to toher parents and especially other health professionals. My mother, a pediatric rheumatologist, has worked with Dr Karp since he was a resident, and has seen his theories work for years in many children."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The second half of this book has really practical, proven-by-experience advice (five basic strategies for keeping a baby peaceful) for anyone with a newborn baby. The first half, on the other hand, is almost laughable. My recommendation to my daughter was to soak up part two of the book and ignore the first half in the interest of saving time."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"You will read this book and think maybe this will work. Then get he video and you will see it in action and think how have we parented without this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We were having alot of sleep issues with our infant and after reading this book I realized that I had stopped swaddling him way too early. After we started swaddling him again; he slept for 6 hours straight; which at the time was a huge achievement. I now purchase this book for everyone I know as I believe it has some fabulous ideas and I simply could not have lived without it! Trust me; you won't regret purchasing this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I think there is some pretty good advice in this book, but I think it could have been written out in a couple pages, maybe a chapter. The rest is a lot of evolution theory, stories, and reiteration. For a solid in depth look at sleep and fussy babies I recommend Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Weissbluth"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Basically, read every other reviewer who gave this book five stars.Also, when practicing these techniques in public or in front of an older generation, don't listen to what they have to say, since it seems very out-of-the-ordinary to others. Most people are used to seeing a parent trying to quietly soothe his/her baby with quiet sounds and gentle movements. And it doesn't work! You need the \\"jiggle\\" (which scares the hell out of my mother-in-law when she watches my husband or me shake the baby so her head jiggles like Jell-O) and the loud shushing, as well as the swaddling, which people will equate with putting your baby in a straitjacket. But it really does work!I recommend buying the book BEFORE you give birth. Or giving it as a baby shower gift, for sure! If you're looking to buy it after you've had the baby, it might be faster (for the time being) to get the DVD. The book's a fast read, but not when you're trying to calm your little one or when you should be catching up on much-lost sleep.Things to buy with it:-SwaddleMe sleepers or Halo Swaddlers. The blankets are fine, but I get so sick of them coming undone when we pick her up (they're never big enough to tuck in the way Dr. Karp says).-A White Noise Machine. Make sure you test if it's loud! We bought the Munchkin one and it's not loud enough to distract her when she's crying over it. We used the vacuum and hairdryer like a charm, though. My husband got a free white noise app on his iPhone, which works like a dream. And I've ended up putting a radio in her room with the volume cranked up and tuned to a static station to keep her calm and quiet.Baby Swing or Vibrating Chair. These babies really do love movement. During the day, I'll even hold my little one and bounce on my yoga ball until she falls asleep.-Different types of pacifiers, including Soothies. Our little girl really won't take a pacifier, since I didn't want her to take one until she had established breastfeeding. Well, I must have waited too long since she really doesn't want to take one for very long. Even with Dr. Karp's technique about training them, she only wants one on very rare occasions. Since I use a nipple shield for breastfeeding, I found that she'll take that as a pacifier, except I have to hold it in her mouth, since it's not something that'll stay in automatically. But keep trying different brands."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was urged to read this book by several friends and am so happy I listened to them. This is a must read for all expectant parents. Although my baby is not here yet, I can't wait to use all the great techniques I learned in this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read and utilized this book's techniques when my girls were babies.... now 7 & 8 yrs. The 5's Ss work like magic. They truly engage the baby's calming reflex. Now I am a Childbirth Educator and we use this book and the techniques for a couple difference classes at the hospital where I work. The techniques are easy to do, the book is a quick read and definitely makes for a good gift. Those first few months when you and baby are trying to learn each other and about yourself, this book makes for a wonderful coach. There is also a video on the book. I think it is a bit long and redundant, but you get the visual of the techniques in action."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I ordered this book late one night when I was up with my then 5 week old daughter whom I couldn't get to stop crying-I was crying myself! After just reading the first few chapters I instantly starting putting the info to practice. I was amazed how quickly I could now calm my baby down! Within a few days of using my new found knowledge she was sleeping about 6 hrs. straight, get up to eat and then sleep another 2-3 hours.(Before she was sleeping no more than 2 hrs straight and very difficult to get back to sleep) Now, at almost 9 weeks old, she has been sleeping 8 hrs solid for the last 10 days! I will buy this book for every expecting mom I know! Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Good book overall--has a lot of useless info in it and could be cut down to a smaller size with just the \\"pointers\\" for parents. Basically, Swaddle, swish, sway and go from there. Didn't work overall for us, but I used some of the info to soothe my son. Liked the Baby Whisperer better."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"One of the nurses in the hospital suggested this book to me, and my husband and I picked it up when our son was about a month old and getting increasingly fussy at night. Some of it is common sense, but it's nice to be reminded. Other ideas are things we hadn't considered.As with anything, it's just advice--you don't have to do 100% of it to make it work for you. Our baby didn't like full swaddling, but we figured out that it helped to wrap his legs and let him have his arms free. He never took a pacifier, but it would get to the point at night where I couldn't breastfeed him anymore because he was clearly full... my husband would let our baby suck on his finger for just a few minutes. (The finger thing didn't even occur to us before.) Have a little common sense when you follow the suggestions and see what works for your baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The 5 s's in this book are such helpful tools. I'm a first time mom to a wonderful baby girl that wasn't a wonderful sleeper/napper. She would get so fussy midmorning and midevening I though I was doomed to 3-4 months of colic. I bought this book when she was 5 weeks old and when she fussed I'd do the 5 s's in the book and all of a sudden she was napping for an hour a two. What a miricle! I would almost say you could skip the first half of the book on the history of colic and why there is no such thing and jump straight to the five s's. I've passed my copy along to friends that have all found it very helpful also. One is even a nurse that used it with her second child and told the ob floor at the hospital to start recommending to it new moms."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a must for both expectant parents and newborn parents. The simple, invaluable advice gave me great confidence to deal with my newborn. The book enables you to understand the needs of your newborn, which are the 5S's. The text is easy to understand and there are good illustrations showing you how to swaddle etc. If you are a tired parent who is struggling to cope with your baby's crying,you must buy this book. I'm sure it will enable you to enjoy the so called fourth trimester."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Some of the things Dr. Karp writes seem a bit silly and maybe even extreme, but the 5 S's work for my 8 week old daughter. At 2 weeks, I told my boyfriend that we must just have a colicky baby and we would have to deal with it. Then a neighbor loaned me this book. Now she sleeps 6 hours a night, eats, then sleeps another 3 hours because of these techniques. This book is definately worth reading and at least trying. I bought one each, for 2 of my friends who are expecting and I would recommend it highly to anyone who is having trouble with a fussy baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"If you are expecting, you should buy this book NOW. I brought premature twins home and limped through the first few weeks they were home. If I would have had this book, my life would have been so much better. This is a short review, but the minute I started applying Dr. Karp's techniques, our babies responded immediately and are almost sleeping through the night. You MUST get this book, especially if you are getting ready to have your baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I wish that I had purchased this book before my daughter was born! When she was about 2-3 weeks, she suddenly became a cranky colic baby. I went on Amazon and purchased a bunch of different books because I was at a loss on what to do. I was tired of getting advice from well-meaning relatives who actually had no idea what we were dealing with. It turned out that our daughter had acid reflux, but the techniques in this book were a life saver! The five S's worked like a charm and we still use them even though our daughter is now 5 months old. Dr. Karp helps you see what you can do to help your baby feel calm and comforted."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The title alone made me gag -- I thought this was going to be yet more marketing hype created for overachieving parents (like those Baby Mozart, Einstein, etc.), fearful that their child isn't \\"happy enough\\".Thankfully this book is actually instructional, and does provide techniques that WORK to soothe fussy infants. You can probably skip through most of the book -- the first chapter sounds like a sales pitch, and much of the book repeats itself -- and get all the information you need to soothe your baby in chapter 5. (This book could have been a pamphlet, actually, but I understand the need to make a buck.)My baby is very fussy and needed a lot of holding (all day!) to keep from crying. This book's advice helped me to free myself up without feeling like I was abandoning my child. She responds to swaddling by calming and sleeping. She is able to sleep without fussing for longer periods than without the swaddling, and definitely feeds a lot less than she did before."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"WE have a three-month old daughter who has been very fussy and not a great sleeper. The minute we used the 5 s's, she responded. This is the gift I am giving for new parents. I wish I had this book sooner. This book should be mandatory reading during pregnancy. It is amazing how quickly our daughter responded.Thank you Dr. Karp for the simple techniques and guidance."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book changed my life. As a single mom of twins, I thought sleepless nights while my newborns wailed was just part of the process. I thought I would DIE from exhaustion. Meanwhile, a nurse recommended this book to me, and although I was at first skeptical, after doing EVERYTHING in the Cuddle Cure, I've found I have the happiest babies ever. They sleep well at night, are happy during the day, and I feel very closely bonded to both of them. This book should be required reading for all new parents. Even if you think your kids are the happiest babies on the block, just try out the 5 S's. You will find joy, and so will your children."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We LOVE this book. I'd also recommend the DVD/Video, which is very useful in helping to master the practial aspects of baby calming. Our baby is 7 weeks old. At 2 weeks he started having colic symptoms - screaming and seeming to be having digestive pains, particularly at night-time. The pediatrician diagnosed reflux and put him on antacids, and I was also advised to give up dairy products. However the really marked improvement came when we recieved this book and DVD (a kind gift from my Uncle, who is a pediatrician). My husband started doing the 5 Ss very rigorously (strong swaddling, and he even went out and bought a white noise machine). The techniques have never once failed to calm the baby down, even when he is working up quite a storm! All in all, I would say that your book has helped restore the sanity of two very tired new parents, and made one new baby much more contented. We are recommending the book to all the new parents we know."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"No need for this review to be long. Our son is nearly 4 weeks old and we didn't read this book until he was 2 weeks old. Wish we had read it sooner. We have been using these techniques since then and it is absolutely wonderful. It saved us, and it saved him and we all got some sleep. I would highly recommend this book to any parent, and will be sure to give it as a shower gift to anyone I know having a baby. You can't go wrong to try the methods - you and your baby will be so much happier."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book really helped me to find ways of calming down my three month old son. We had been through three months of intense &quot;colic&quot; and I had tried everything to try to help my little guy to settle down. He resisted all attempts to get him to sleep for more that 2 hours at a stretch.The first night I tried Dr. Karp's technique of swaddling my son slept 6 hours straight! I was very surprised since I thought he would hate swaddling and that he was too old for it.This also helped with the frequent fussy feedings we had been going through since I now had other ways to settle my son down.My son is now sleeping 9-10 hours at night with one feed at the 6 hour mark and has two 2 hour naps a day! I would have thought this impossible just two weeks ago. I highly recommend this book, I only wish I had got it earlier."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a must have if you are going to have a baby, or just had a baby. I read this book 1 month before my baby was born, and it really helped to get ready for her arrival. It goes over many tips to help a crying baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is wonderful . I am a new mom again after 9years to a little boy and I very well know that times have changed since my daughter plus boys are different. The happiest baby on the block gave me and my husband new ways to comfort our new little guy , the swaddling method worked great and he is not a fussy baby at all because we get right to him before he has a chance to get fussy ,he also gives us cues which we look for now.. Where with our daughter people would tell us it is good to let them cry if you pick them up all the time you will \\"spoil\\" the baby , and this book tells you that there is no way to \\"spoil\\" a baby and that was good to hear but the tools that they teach you in the book are also very wonderful so if you are looking to a new aged way to comfort your lil one this is the way to go i think .."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"UPDATE, daughter now 10 months old:Okay, so I get this book and it's accompanying CD in the hopes that I would not need to utilize these techniques but wanted to be prepared. Guess who gets one of the fussiest babies in the world? That's right... ME! Even my mother who raised four children under the age of SIX agree that she's ridiculous... anyway... none of these things worked to soothe her, and oh how I wanted them to!!! You know what really worked? Simply taking it hour by hour, day by day. She's now 10 months old! My child was so ridiculously fussy (still is, but now she's walking so she's a bit happier), we tried everything (I mean everything... any suggestion, any tip, anything...) She cried literally 16 hours a day for over 6 weeks. The only time she didn't cry, excuse me, SCREAM, was when I was walking with her (I wasn't getting sleep, and I have narcolepsy and lupus/sjogren's syndrome so it was REALLY rough). I suppose it's not Dr. Karp's fault that this didn't work for us, so I won't rate my review down, but one should realize that just because something appears to be wonderful, doesn't mean it will be for your baby. I'll tell you what worked for her... putting her to sleep on her stomach (GASP! I said it!), a \\"sleep mix\\" (Nature Sounds for Sleep and Relaxation: Sleep, Baby Sleep on i tunes) and unconditional love. That last part sounds lame, huh? Well, it's the truth. I don't know many people who could withstand as much as I have (I don't work outside the home currently), and I still look forward to and love that screaming face every morning :)***I also HIGHLY recommend a website for fussy/high needs babies: the fussy baby site (dot) com. Real stories from real parents!!!God bless Dr. Karp for those of you who his technique worked for, but God bless us parents who have survived and cared for such difficult children without much assistance. I really don't know where she came from, I mean, I was perfect... hahahaOriginal review in Aug 2009:We haven't had our daughter yet, but she's due in 3 1/2 weeks... and I feel prepared. This book was extremely helpful and it makes a lot of sense. I will update my review after she is born as to whether or not Dr. Karp knows what he's talking about... but I'm 99.9% convinced it will be successful! Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have not finished this book yet but love what I have read so far. We love the swaddle techinque, it puts my son in a coma and he will sleep for hours. I wish I had this book with my first child. I have already purchased one for a friend and getting ready to purchase another one."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a true Godsend. The techniques work every time and very quickly as well. My 3 week old daughter now sleeps 3-4 hours at a time instead of staring into space dying to sleep but not wanting to shut her eyes and wailing the whole time. I would cry right along with her because I did not know what else to do for her besides change her, feed her and burp her. This book is very informative and has truly given me peace of mind and given my daughter some much needed sleep."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I really enjoyed the read and was able to finish it quite quickly. Dr. Karp has a lot of valid and interesting points and the illustrations in the book help you to visualize exactly what he's saying.One slightly annoying part is that I found Dr. Karp repeats himself constantly. I'm sure it's intentional to ensure that people grasp his message, but for some it can become redundant.I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was recommended to me by a nurse who teaches infant care and lactation classes. The video is better at teaching the techniques involved, but the book is better at giving you the whole picture, having some laughs, and understanding that all this is research-based, not just the latest fad. This is a new grandmother talking, and it is great!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The methods outlined in this book work. We spent the first few weeks with our daughter swaddling, swaying, etc and she was a great newborn. The book is written in an easy to read, informative style. I feel like a lot of books on newborns are basically a list of things to worry about. This book is refreshing because it offers explanations for your newborn's behavior."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT. VERY INFORMATIVE AND NOT SUCH A BORING READ. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY NEW PARENTS."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My pediatrician recommended this book to me when I expressed my concern about my (then) 2 week old's night time crying. Once I read the book and saw how simple it could be to calm my baby down, I felt much more competent and was able to put the steps to good use. Now that my baby is 2 months old, and doesn't really enjoy being swaddled anymore, I'll be buying the No-Cry Sleep solution.One thing, this book was VERY wordy and probably could have been a third the size that it is and still gotten the message across."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I love this book and the DVD!! It gives no nonsense solutions to help with the stress of new motherhood."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a mom with a baby with colic, i couldn't get my hands around this book fast enough. If you have a baby with colic you will appreciate not just chapter 2 but the entire book. When you have a collicky baby, everybody becomes an expert and tries to tell you what will work and when it doesn't, as a new parent it's discouraging. The book dispels some of the colic myths and helps a parent understand what colic really is and how to help your baby through it. If I heard one more helpful person suggest gas drops for our inconsolable screamer i was going to cry. This book is a must read for anyone with an inconsolable baby like ours and it has great information even for those who don't."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is an excellent resource for new parents. As first time parents my husband and I had no idea what to do for our baby when we realized she had colic. She was unhappy and crying all the time. A friend recommended this book. It gave us the tools to keep our little girl calm and happy most of the time. Once the colic was gone, we still used the 5 s's. She was sleeping through the night by 6 weeks. This is information that all new parents should have before they bring their baby home from the hospital."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I just LOVE this book. We followed the very easy steps and found it worked like a charm. We now have a 2 year-old daughter that has amazing sleep habits, and I know it all started with helping her learn how to sleep as a newborn thanks to Dr. Karp. I can't wait to see the video when we have another to brush-up on the process.I HIGHLY encourage you to read this book, it works!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"You just don't know what kind of child you are going to have, so this book is a must for first time parents. Anyone can benefit from it, but those of us with fussy babies (guess what, we have one!) will be so glad to have a solution to the shrieking. For anyone who wants to just read the middle two pages - there's a lot of good information in the details, even if some things are repeated. Buy the book; we are glad we did!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's advice in this book is rock-solid. He gives great advice to all mothers, and does not bias against anyone. Using the tips in this book helped my husband and I when our high-energy infant was keeping us up all hours of the night. Our child loved the soothing techniques. I recommend this book to any parent, even if their child is not having trouble sleeping, because it is packed with such excellent information."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Content is sound- look forward to applying it when my little one arrives!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I would have been lost without this book. Even with years of practice with kids, little could have prepared me for the overwhelming experience of having a crying baby as MY sole responsibilty. This book is filled with the tricks of the trade that we as a culture don't learn from our community as a parent might have learned from moms, aunts, & grandmas a few generations ago. It is easy to do the 5 steps outlined in this book. More important is that THEY WORK!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We bought this book just after our first son was born. He cried for an hour every night and the techniques in the book helped us calm him almost immediately. This time around our second son was doing just fine until he was four months old. Then no matter what we did he woke up and cried repeatedly during the night and became nearly impossible to get to sleep any time of day. I'd loaned the book out so I grabbed the video and refreshed my memory of the S techniques. And low and behold my darling baby who was taking up to an hour to calm and get to sleep, quieted down and was looking up at me sleepily in just a few minutes. Now a few days later I wrap him up, calm him down, and get him to sleep quickly. Between what we learned from Dr. Karp (who also personally answered a question I sent to the email address on his website I might add) and what we learned from The No-Cry Sleep Solution, our little guy is steadily learning to go to sleep on his back and calm quickly. I'm sure in no time he'll be able to calm himself and my nights will no longer be the hourly screaming fests that were wearing me out (and breaking my heart). Not only does the technique work but I found the book interesting. And what's more, I found Dr. Karp's demeanor on the video very soothing for me! There I was watching it in desperation when I suddenly felt everything would be all right - I will sleep again! Can't wait to get the book and video for my sister-in-law who's expecting in December. Oh and we also used the Happiest Toddler DVD/Book with our older son to much success. Three cheers for Dr. Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I suspect that many parents stumble onto the techniques that Dr. Karp has outlined in his book. I learned the technique for snuggling and jiggling my daughter from a friend who had worked for a daycare. It took us several weeks of being unable to reliably comfort her before I put the whole process together in a way that works reliably. It would have been such a relief for all of us to have the whole thing put together at the beginning. I appreciate having a system that works for my daughter, but even more, I value knowing WHY it works.I think that every first parent should learn this technique, whether they learn it from a parent, a pediatrician or Dr. Karp. It will save the sanity of many new parents!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"If you're having a baby, or even thinking of having a baby, buy this book and study it. It has helped tremendously with my 4-month old daughter. I bought and read this book when she was about 2 weeks. The book teaches that some babies have limited self-calming abilities and gives proven solutions. My daughter is one of those difficult babies, and this book has saved our sanity. It is also written by a pediatrician, which eliminated any doubts I had. She sleeps for 10 hours at night and only wakes to nurse and goes right back to sleep. It's wonderful. Worth the money, worth the time, worth the effort. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I received this book as a gift when my little boy was 3 weeks old.

I only wish I found out about the book before I had my son. Unfortunately I struggled for 5 weeks before someone recommended it. I ran out, bought the book and the first night I had a quiet sleeping baby!!!! I strongly recommend this book to anyone that needs it.

We were first time parents and were clueless. It seems that we had spent 9 months buying \\"stuff\\" for the baby and we failed to try and educate ourselves on how we could help our baby adjust to life outside the womb. Happiest Baby truely made our baby the happiest baby on our block. I sat down and read the whole thing in a couple of hours and put the methods to work that night. They worked the first time - she slept that night!! We still use some of the methods now that she is 6 months old and they still work.

There are many experts out there who offer boatloads of advice on raising children. It is easy to get overwhelmed with the numerous styles that directly conflict with each other. Dr. Karp cuts through the fluff to provide easy to understand, scientifically relevant information that allows a frustrated parent to &quot;turn on&quot; a babie's calming reflex and end hours of agony. This is the most effective technique I've seen for calming an hysterical infant, and is a must have for parent's wishing to actually help their suffering children instead of tuning out or ignoring the cries generated by collic."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a life saver! My little boy had the worst time staying asleep, and when he woke up, he would cry for hours. With the 5 S's, he sleeps for four or five hours at a time! I finally feel like I'm rested when we wake up now! If you have a fussy baby, you need this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"After seeing Dr. Karp work his magic on a morning TV talk show, I dedided to buy this book while I was pregnant with our daughter (our first child) -- I wanted to be as prepared as possible should she be a colicky baby. While we were really lucky that our daughter was not a textbook colicky baby, the techniques in this book nontheless helped us to calm her through her fussy period in the early weeks and continue to be useful in keeping her happy, content, and well-rested as she approaches 3-months of age. And who knows -- maybe employing Dr. Karp's techniques preemptively actually prevented some colick. We would certainly recommend this easy to read and use book for any new parents-to-be."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We were clueless first-time parents with a screaming newborn. This book had been recommended in our Preparation for Childbirth Classes but I hadn't bothered to read it. At one month our daughter was still screaming and my husband and I were wondering what the heck we had been thinking when I sat down and read the book--out of pure desperation. Within two nights she was sleeping 6-7 hours at night. Sometimes more. Soon I could count on 8 hours of sleep. Now the &quot;tricks&quot; in the book may seem a little funny, but they work. Read the book, and TRY EVERYTHING he suggests no matter how silly it sounds. It will work. It saved us. Let me tell you, you can deal with a lot more stuff when you can get a good night's sleep."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!My son USED to cry from 6:30-11:30pm then would sleep a little during the night, after hours of walking, would wake up and cry from 9:30am-noon day in and day out with no sleeping during the day. I was ready to go crazy!!! I found you on the Internet and ordered the tape. My husband and I watched your tape at 10pm and we practiced the 5's during the middle of one of his colic fits. He needed all 5 steps. Then he turned off like a switched!!!! He went to bed at 11pm and slept to 5am!!!!!! It was only the beginning. We are 3 weeks into this and he doesn't cry any longer then a few minutes. We just dudu wrap him and he stops. He takes naps now and is really bonding with our family. I passed the tape around to friends with babies and it works for all of them. I tell everyone, I even brought it to my pediatrician who is getting one for his office. I had been calling him for 7 weeks to find out what was wrong with my child and all he gave me was gas drops and medication to relax his bowls. Now he is on nothing.Thank you for giving us our son back,David and Elizabeth"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is AWESOME!Best baby book out there.

It worked for us!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As countless others have pointed out, I agree that the 'Happiest Baby' BOOK is repetitive, somewhat patronizing, and not particularly well-written. However, I could not be more grateful that I learned the METHODS precisely as described therein.Our newborn daughter is six days old, and was born in a birth center with midwives. They strongly recommended the 'Happiest Baby' book and methods, so we borrowed the book and bought the DVD used on Amazon. A couple of weeks before the day of birth, we started practicing our swaddling technique on the stuffed animals we'd already begun to receive from loved ones, and from day one, little Ellie has been swaddled, held on her side/stomach, shushed, and swung (more like jiggled). (We're waiting on the 'suck' part because she is still taking to the breasts.)Simply put, the methods described in this book, and made all the more clear on the DVD, have been EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. To date, Ellie, who wants constant attention, has never cried for more than a two minute stretch, and even then, it's mostly when we're changing her or putting her into the swaddling blanket. I've been careful to do the swaddling/shushing/positioning/jiggling just like Dr. Karp does on the DVD, and as a result, she has quieted down instantaneously, every single time. Without a single exception.Best yet, since I am not someone who likes to read a bunch of different books espousing different techniques and theories about child-soothing, this book has been a one-stop shop. Master the techniques as described, and that's it. I can't say if this will work for every baby (probably it doesn't), but it worked exactly as described for ours, and I for one am so pleased and grateful to know this method. And hell, the books start at fifteen cents used, so do yourself a favor and buy or borrow a copy of this book - or, frankly, just the DVD, which was perhaps even more helpful because you get the visual."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has by far been the most helpful so far.

Then my mom gave me this book and I followed the instructions and instantly my baby starting sleeping 6-7 hours consistently at only 6 weeks old. If he did get fussy, I always knew how to calm him down as well. A must read for new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We're expecting our first baby in about 3 months so we're not sure if all if this stuff - the 5 S's - is going to \\"work\\" on our little one. But Dr. Karp sure is compelling! And the language is repetitive and so \\"in your face\\" that even the sleepiest of new parents will get the message loud and clear: You CAN calm a 'colicky' baby! The 5 S's only really needed to be written on a one-page worksheet, but the fact that he goes over and over them in such detail multiple times really grills it in you. My two cents: practice this on a doll or someone else's baby before you have your own! :)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This simple read book is the \\"owners manual\\" that everyone has always wanted who care for babies. For new parents it gives them answers and confidence to care for their newborn with down to earth explanations, directions and suggestions. This book is helpful if this if your first baby or you last baby. I give this as a first gift early in a pregnancy so it can be read,studied and discussed by both the mother and father long before the baby arrives. They will enjoy their new baby much more with the techniques and information that they will acquire from reading and studying this book. Others will be asking them for \\"advice.\\"I always keep some on hand for quick giving when a pregnancy is announced.

I paced the floor with my screaming baby for HOURS every night prior to getting this book, but thanks to Dr Karp I know how to soothe my baby. And don't just skim through the book, as another poster said would work. The steps of the 5 S's have to be done just right, in the correct order, in order for the 5 S's to work. It's not hard.

Thanks to Dr Karp for sharing his knowledge with the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The advice is this book is necessary knowledge for any new parent. It has helped us with our 5-week old countless times already. I read the book, and then my husband and I watched the video. Frankly the video contains everything you need to know to implement the 5 S's, so if you have limited time this might be a better option. The book gives a lot of background and anecdotes that may be boring for some. His method really does work though. With a confused newborn, the order of the 5 S's helped us to get our son to sleep. Now that he's a few weeks old we implement the S's as needed."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"All new mothers should read this book.

After that, this book is not helpful and seems to be meant to be passed on to other early parents. Its advice is helpful, and makes absolute sense, so its not at all a waste of money."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book could easily have been half its published length. There are some good tips, but it's very repetitive. After at least six chapters that began and ended by reminding me that a newborn baby is really a \\"fetus in its fourth trimester\\", I was ready to start screaming uncontrollably myself.Finally, I skipped to the part about how to swaddle, then never referred to the book again. For me, this book was a waste of time. I'd have been better off just Googling \\"swaddling\\" and downloading the instructions."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter who gave birth to my first grandchild in July. We tried the methods listed in the book. Some tips worked, others failed miserably. After parenting three children of my own (one happy, two criers) and helping out with my granddaughter, I've come to the conclusion that some babies are just more vocal than others. If you can survive the first three or four months of parenting without throwing the baby out with the bath water - you've got it made. Survival is the key and support (many forms - neighbors, family, friends) always helps! We did enjoy this book and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is ok, but it certainly did not turn my newborn into the \\"happiest baby on the block\\". I was expecting a miracle and did not get it. I think it is interesting that the author says that \\"if done correctly\\" his techniques will work. Well, I guess I did not do them correctly! The techniques described in this book did not really work for my son (he hated being swaddled!). However, this book did help me understand what the world must be like for a newborn and did provide some soothing mechanisms. Also very helpful is the author's CD of \\"womb sounds\\" that my son loved until he was about 3 months old.A much better book is \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" by Marc Weissbluth."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My kids are grown up, but as a midwife I've delivered about 3000 of the little critters, and some of them are now having babies of their own. This new generation of young parents all seem to swear by this book, and I really think they're on to something. Honest-to-God, these babies are calm, happy, relaxed, and contented during the period in their lives when we would expect at least 25% of them to be fretful and colicky.Author Karp offers a common sense method of soothing babies during their newborn phase, a period he calls the Fourth Trimester. Essentially it involves reducing stimuli and introducing the baby very gradually into our chaotic, noisy, and brightly-lit world. It feels right, slowing the transition for these tender little souls so their circuits don't get overloaded. It speaks to some cultures' traditional period of quiet and privacy for approx 6 weeks after the birth before new mother and baby, by then in tune with each other's rhythms, are introduced to society. When I was a public health nurse in LA, I learned their term for this magical and therapeutic period of time: La Cuarenta Dias: The Forty Days. It's an old technique, older than any childcare book ever written, but there's real wisdom in these ancient traditions.If you're expecting a baby or a grandbaby, buy this book. Now."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Before you sell yourself on this book, take the doctor's advice and rule out any and all medical causes for the crying. I had almost convinced myself that my newborn was suffering from colic and had my husband run to the store to get this book. I read a few chapters, got a good laugh about the prehistoric connection and decided to call my pediatrician before I was sure that is was colic. And I'm glad I did. My poor baby suffers from reflux (as had two of my three other children). The missing link was my newborn did not vomit or spit up and so I thought it couldn't be reflux and the incessant crying must be colic. Not so - she suffers from silent reflux where the stomach acid comes up the esophagus and then she swallows it back down.So I suggest that you definitely follow the doctors advice and consult your pediatrician to rule out any medical concerns before you sell yourself on the missing trimester!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp is a wonderful pediatrician and his recommendations will help fussy babies and their parents adjust to life!! His techniques work remarkably well. We and our patients thank you."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I haven't had a chance to test out the techniques in this book yet, and I'm sure they help... However I don't think the book is worth buying, really. (I got it as a gift). You'd be able to get all the important info from skimming the main chapters at Border's sometime (don't bother reading the whole first part of the book, go straight to the explanation of the \\"5 S's\\"). The vast majority of the book is fluff. Dr Karp obviously thinks very highly of himself as his genius techniques. I just wish he'd provide some actual evidence of them working rather than just anecdotal stuff... which contradicts itself anyway (there's tons of examples of parents whose babies were calmed immediately by swaddling, yet he also states that swaddling alone WILL NOT activate the \\"calming reflex\\"). When he does mention any scientific research that supports his theory he doesn't bother to actually reference the studies at all. Sorry, but this bothers me.Again, I'm sure I'll end up using a lot of the \\"S's\\" when our baby arrives in a few weeks, but I'm having a hard time reading the book b/c Dr Karp and his writing style are annoying me so much."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have no idea how come so many intelligent people like this book and talk about it like it's the discovery of the century. There is ONE idea in the book (the fourth trimester) and one practical set of advice summarized in 5 words: swaddle, swing, shush, side and suck. The rest is fluff. The whole amount of information could have been fit on one index card, no need for a book.Maybe the structure of the book works best if you are reading it already sleep deprived and your brain cannot handle complex sentences and you actually need all that repetitive stuff.So, bottom line: swaddle your child, stick a pacifier in his/her mouth, rock the baby in your arms and sooth him/her by shushing (I really don't buy the author's suggestion that a roaring vacuum cleaner is the next best thing to the noises of the womb)."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"One of the 5 steps in this book is swaddling, and my baby HATES this since he was born... so this book was useless for me."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp \\"lays out\\" clear, concise ideas and information for the new parents to read and easily follow.

In fact even though she is now two we still use the white noise machines (her sleep sheep) and nighttime rituals to help our daughter go to sleep. With the help of Dr. Karp's method (which we learned from the book and the DVD) our daughter has slept through the night since we brought her home.

My infant was two months old and would not nap unless I was holding him! I was exhausted and desparate to find a way to get him to sleep and to keep him asleep during the day. This book was a lifesaver. A quick, and surprisingly interesting, read that gives you step-by-step instructions on calming a fussy baby, getting him/her to sleep, and keeping them asleep. Although my child did not have colic he was overtired and therefore very cranky most days, but once I mastered the cuddle cure I was able to get my child to nap during the day, which quickly led to sleeping through the night and our house became a much happier place for all of us."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We got this yesterday.

Well this is it, they should be required to give this to you at the hospital, it helps you cope with and understand why your baby crys and what they feel. My son was colicky, and when I came to understand what he felt and why he was crying and carrying on the way he did, it stopped. This book really is magic. The book talks about this missing month for the babies and how they have this traumatic change from being warm and soothed all the time in the womb to being pushed into a world of unfamiliar. With this book, you need to buy a large blanket for swaddling and you are set. If you need instant relief for your child buy the DVD, new parents rarely have time to sit and read, especially with a colicky little one.

I bought this book when I was still pregnant and learned all the techniques so that by the time our baby was born, we knew how to do them all. Then in the hospital, she never cried and has been an ANGEL ever since. This book is as necessary to a new monther's arsenal as diapers. NO KIDDING.

We saw Dr. Karp on the Dr. Phil Show and immediately purchased this book. His advice is based on years of scientific study, research, and practice. He explains not only his methods but also explains his research in layman's terms.Dr. Karp, a highly experienced and revered pediatrician, gives unbelievable techniques that have worked like a charm with our 6-week-old infant son. Because of the 5 \\"S's\\", he is a smiley, happy, content baby with minimal fussy periods and, knock on wood, the nights have become a breeze (he wakes us once to feed, and goes back to sleep immediately!)

The most frustrating part of my job is helping a mother cope with a fussy or colicky baby. Dr. Karp's book not only gave me an excellent explanation of a baby's first three months, but he also gives very practical and realistic ways to help calm your baby. After 10 years of raising my own kids and working with mothers I had many peices of the puzzle, but Dr. Karp's book put the the puzzle together for me! It is fun to explain Dr. Karp's book to mothers and see the light bulbs go off in their heads.

I have started recommending this book to my clients."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I would HIGHLY recommend the book because Dr. Karp's suggestions really work! Our baby just hit the 6-week-old mark and just started becoming &quot;colicky&quot; as most people call it. But, I think Dr. Karp's idea of the fourth trimester is more correct. We have done the 5 S's and it works instantly to stop our baby's crying!! We also have the accompanying video, and I would HIGHLY recommend that as well, because in it, Dr. Karp SHOWS you exactly how to swaddle and shush and swing to be the most effective in calming your baby. The book explains HOW to do it, and WHY it works, but also SEEING it helps you execute the 5 S's correctly!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a firm believer in the fourth trimester theory, I loved this book! Dr. Karp outlines the 5 S's that help your baby transition out of the womb and into the world. Doing so reduces fussiness and helps your baby sleep better. All important things for a new baby and a new parent! To me, the most important \\"S\\" was swaddling. Nothing soothes a baby like the feeling of being back in the womb. What's the best way to swaddle to comfort your baby? TrueWomb... Hands down. [...] The inventor, Cliff Hardesty, discovered that his grandson loved to have his feet put into the fetal position, so he developed a way to do exactly that. The unique pouch for the baby's feet allows him to kick out, and then the stretchy material returns him to the fetal position. The arm pouches allow your baby to move his hands up and down, but not out. It's EXACTLY like the womb!!! All other swaddles simply wrap your baby up like a burrito-- not womblike at all! For all you \\"Happiest Baby on the Block\\" believers, TrueWomb really is the way to go. Hope this helps you swaddle your baby through the fourth trimester and beyond!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I thought the information and techniques shared were very helpful and they actually work.

So I find this book to be a waste of time to read in entirety since we just need the 5S's and instructions on how to do them correctly.The tone is rather arrogant. I can only imagine that in person he would be condescending.Finally, the book is only good for babies through four months of age. Much of the book is repetitive. He makes some suggestions that I find to be out of the ordinary but doesn't elaborate-- such as ending the pacifier very early and \\"weaning\\" off the 5S's before 6 months too. I guess in his experience babies are perfect sleepers around 5+months? I read the book when my baby was 6 months because I found her to have a poor sleep routine during the day. I found nothing helpful in the book and I had been doing much of the 5S's for my baby prior to her 6th month. I was hoping he had some advice for those of us still having some problems with sleep and fussiness."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My pediatrician recommended this book because he said I have a \\"demanding baby.\\" I was very hopeful based on some of the reviews on here. It did have some helpful information, but it didn't really \\"cure\\" the problem. My husband and I have tried all of the suggestions (repeatedly) & we still have a crying baby. The author assumes that his advice will work all of the time, though, and there wasn't really any advice on what to do/try if it doesn't work. Consequently, I got extremely frustrated & felt like I was doing something wrong or there was something wrong with my baby. Also, some of the suggestions only worked temporarily & there were no good alternatives to taking a car ride or running the vacuum so that we could get some sleep!Anyway, there was good information, but if you have a difficult baby, don't expect miracles."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My brother and sis in law just have this new born cutie.

The techniques are great, but the book is repetitive, and filled with story after story praising the author. The DVD is much more helpful and you can watch it in an hour. We borrowed the dvd from the local library. The techniques are difficult to learn by reading a book; you really need to see them demonstrated.The other criticism I have is that he dismisses the value of osteopathy in one of his chapters. Our two month old child was keeping us up at night with congested sinuses and difficulty feeding while she was on her back. It didn't matter how much she was swaddled, shushed, etc. After one treatment by an osteopathic physician, she no longer has that problem. I'm sure that it's not always resolved so easily, but it was amazing how well our little girl responded."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I got the Happiest Baby book to help calm my newborn daughter who suffers from reflux and gets pretty fussy at times.

So, I got the DVD for him.The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Baby Sleep LongerIt was easy to understand and he picked up the method quickly. In hindsight, the DVD itself would have been sufficient.I also recommend purchasing a few swaddle wraps.Summer Infant Swaddleme By Kiddopotamus 100 % Cotton Size Small 3 Pack UnisexIt makes the whole system so much smoother.

Every mother should read this book. It has been a great help with our newborn. The swaddling and sound machine not only help to put her to sleep, but she stays asleep longer, too. She is one of those infants who doesn't want to miss out on anything and we found that going to a dark room helps to settle her so she can fall asleep much quicker.

I had received a copy of this book from my neighbor who is a pediatrician and works at the neonatal department in Kaiser. Of all the books I read before my little girl arrived this one was the most helpful.

The book contains is an expansion of the DVD, offering more of the background and science behind Karp's methods."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Boy do I wish I had this book with baby #1. When my second child was born I prayed for no colic but alas he had it too. at 2.5 weeks the SCREAMING started. He also has reflux and they tried to tell me his silent reflux was making him scream.. so why then does the sound of the hairdryer make him stop?After I read this book and watched his video.. my life changed. The swaddle with the swaddle me available on Dr Karp's website ... was what saved my sanity on the road... I NEVER would have thought that this could work the way it does. Just like the kids on his video my screaming son stopped in seconds.I now buy this for any baby shower I go to. If you never ever buy any other baby book buy this one. Once again thank you Dr Karp for helping to open the eyes of the world. We tried 3 different reflux meds on my son before I called it quits saying I really think its bad bad all day colic.. and at 4 mos.. he really is the Happiest Baby on the Block"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Why didn't this book come out before I had my first daughter?? She had such bad colic that I had to wonder if I was really cut out to be a parent. Being a pediatrician, I knew lots of tricks to try to calm her. But getting just the right combination eluded me. Through trial and error, we found that many of the things Dr. Karp recommends work. If only I had known before how they all work together. Looking back, I know that if I had read this book 4 years ago, her infancy would have been so much easier.Since reading Dr. Karp's book for an article I'm working on, I've tried his method on many babies in my office and the hospital. I amaze parents by quieting their wailing babes in minutes or seconds!! I recommend his book to everyone now, and am planning to get extra copies for my office to loan out.

The \\"Cuddle Cure\\" works every time we try it because the combination of swaddling, side holding, shhhh-ing, sucking and swinging is such common sense yet Dr. Harvey has medical science to back it up. He explains very easily why neurologically babies need a \\"fourth trimester\\" and why the combination of these things illict a calming reflex. It literally works within minutes and we are able to calm our daughter by following these simple steps. She knows that relief is in sight once she is swaddled. Also, it is helpful to us because if she continues to cry we know that it's either because she is hungry or needs a new diaper but she doesn't \\"fuss\\" anymore after we use the 5 S's. We are also amazed at how long she sleeps through the night - she can literally go 7 hours straight without waking up since we swaddle her (she is 2 months old now). It is a pleasure to sleep again, particularly because for first 3 weeks she had her days and nights confused and woke up everytime we would put her down. We were emotionally and physically exhausted until we got this book and started using the 5 S's. This book was a tremendous help to us and we would highly recommend it to anyone with an infant.

None of this advice was helpful, and much of it went against what I believe in. Dr. Karp's book not only gave me fool proof ways to help calm my daughter, it also reaffirmed by belief that you cannot spoil a newborn.His threories make sense, his techniques work. I recommend this book to any parents who want to provide their babies with the most natural ways to fall asleep and calm his or her crying (NOT LEAVE THEIR BABIES TO &quot;CRY IT OUT&quot;!!). Following Dr. Karp's techniques will leave your baby calm and you feeling like a great parent."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Review by Dr Tobin, Author of The Parent's Problem Solver: One of the most frustrating things for me as a pediatrician, is not to be able to offer my patients solid solutions.

Thank you, Dr Karp, I truly appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Finally, Dr. Karp has exposed the colic &quot;poo poo&quot; that has driven parents and babies nuts for years.

The five S's sometimes work a little to calm my fussy baby, but I can not walk around with a swaddled baby swinging in my arms with white noise following us all day. I suppose if my baby would tolerate the swing, these methods would allow me to eat a meal.The other thing that drives me crazy about this book is the amount of people who ask me if I've read it when they see me and my fussy baby. I've shushed until my teeth were numb, I can swaddle in the dark, and I can't stand anymore without rocking back and forth. Yes, I read the book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I got this book because of the high rating and reviews, it was during the time my newborn was very fussy, as a distressed mother I thought to myself, I NEED THIS BOOK, with that amount of good reviews,it must be one of the best baby books ever! I had to order it.So I anticipated its arrival, and finally the day came. I delved into the book, only to find myself eventually skipping paragraphs, then whole pages, until I was most of the way through, I realized, it was very repetitive.. When I came back on amazon to see the not so good reviews, I wasn't surprised to find people who thought the same things I did, that its really information that can be summed up in a pamphlet.Honestly I don't believe the book deserves the hype, I'm glad its a lifesaver for some people, It did help me to a degree, but I get the impression, this author knew a simple concept, but also wanted to make money, so you get a very long drawn out disappointing book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book gives great suggestions for all types of babies. My son was very difficult to burp and the methods in this book really helped. Also, the shhhhh sound that the book describes soothes a fussy baby.

We didn't have any training on how to parent an child, especially a little infant. We read this book and watched the video. We followed everything suggested in the book, and it really was incredible how these simple steps calmed our daughter down. She is now five months old and she still enjoys being swaddled as she sleeps."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a great resource, especially for new parents. We learned a lot about how to keep our baby happy and content by recreating the \\"fourth trimester\\" womb experience. Of course, every piece of advice in the book did not work exactly for our little one, but many did, and we took an a la carte approach, using the book to customize the best way to keep him happy (and get a little more sleep ourselves)."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I were at our collective wit's end when someone recommended this book to us for our colicky baby who fought sleep tooth and nail. The 5 \\"S\\"s worked like magic on our son. We even bought a special swaddle blanket and used it until he was about 5 months old -- at 17 months, he still sleeps with a white-noise machine on, although he probably no longer needs it.

It will be the best give you can give them. Every baby deserves parents who know how to use this magical technique. We used this for our twins and it worked every time.

The techinque really works and the book is full of lots of helpful tips and information about babies. I would recommend buying the DVD as well because it was great to see someone actually soothe a crying baby with this method, also it was a great, quick way to show my husband how to do it since I couldn't get him to read the book. I would strongly suggest reading this book about one month BEFORE you new baby is born because you will need this information AS SOON as you get home from the hospital. Dr. Karp's advice really helps you understandwhat your baby is experiencing and and what he/she needs.

He was sleeping between 2 1/2 and 4 hours between feeds at night but, consistantly fought his nap during the day. We knew he was tired but, he couldn't figure out how to put himself to sleep or back to sleep. My husband and I were really starting to doubt ourselves as parents. We didn't want to fall into the trap of rocking or walking our son to sleep.I read the parts of Dr. Karp's book that applied to our problems and within one day my husband and I had our baby sleeping during the day after every feeding without more that a minute of tears. Now our baby is waking one time only during the night to eat and then goes right back to sleep.

I read the whole thing and then rented the DVD from Netflix and felt like I really wasted a lot of time with the book. Everything you need to know is in the DVD and since you can see the techniques being done it is a lot more helpful. Knowing the information has been SO helpful with our baby that I would recommend the DVD as a must have for any parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a LIFESAVER if your baby is a colicky newborn. There is no other manual for the ideas that calm and soothe a cranky newborn. The ideas are all commonsense and known to mothers since the beginning of time: rocking, swaddling, shhhing and holding your baby - but in today's world lacking family to teach us these things this book is the next best thing. One problem is that when you are outgrowing the methods and you no longer want to rock, swaddle and shhh to sleep several times a night then you have to go the next step and I'd suggest The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley. Dr Karp's work and hers are very compatible and he even wrote the foreword to her new book Gentle Baby Care (which ALSO has great chapters on sleep and crying and colic and teething and swadding) Between these two authors your baby can have a calm, peaceful first year."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I saw this video at a childbirth class and now I'm going to buy it for a couple of friends of mine who are expecting.

I can't say that it works for us 100% of the time since we're still getting used to things, but it has definitely helped. My mom, who never used any of these techniques, was amazed at how easy it was to learn and how quickly you can watch a baby go from screaming to quiet and content. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has a newborn."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Let's face it--if you're a new parent, you'll try anything to get an unhappy baby to stop crying, even juggling live raccoons or wearing Mardis Gras costumes. I'm on my third child, so I found Karp's suggestions veering from the practical to the inventive. Some of the theory stuff--the \\"4th trimester\\"--I found to be on obvious attempt to be different and create a marketing spin for the book. Nonetheless, you can try this and move on to Ferber, Weissbluth, etc. -- first-time parents, you never know what's going to work, and every baby is completely different. When you come up for air, though, I urge you to read \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler, the funiest, most honest book about parenting ever written, and the most wonderful account of sleep deprivation you'll ever read. Read it five times during my last pregnancy."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book gives you a truly magical technique for stopping your little baby's crying.

We often both ended up crying together and I honestly thought I would never see as day when my child would be happy. All the advice and books I read told me to let my baby cry or offered solutions that were obviously for much easier babies. Reading DR. Karp's book made me realize that many babies out there were just like mine - what a wonderful feeling! His 5 S's allowed my baby to &quot;shut down&quot; when he couldn't almost instantly and saved us from many hours of heartache. It also gave me alot of hope that my son would mature out of this miserable stage - and I can honestly say at 3 months he is an absolute joy and barely cries for anything anymore! I would give Dr. Karp's book to anyone who has a difficult child, a colicky baby or a screamer in general. The methods work and he is a genius with a BIG heart.

Turns out we were just not wrapping him tight enough. This book help us to calm a fussy baby into a manageable baby. He isn't completely over the fussy phase, but it is a LOT better because of this book. The techniques to calm him when he screams work just about every time. We can't get him to sleep much longer, but at least we can get his crying to stop within a minute or two rather than an hour or two. That alone makes this book worth the money."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is wonderful in that it offers a loving way to help calm your fussy baby down, where other \\"experts\\" recommend letting babies \\"cry it out,\\" saying there is nothing you can do for colic, etc. At 5-months, my daughter still loves to be swaddled at night and has been an 8-hour+ night sleeper since about 4 weeks (when we finally got the swaddling technique down!)However, if you have a chance to see the Happiest Baby video featuring Dr. Karp (we saw it in our \\"Baby Care\\" prenatal class) and also learn how to swaddle really well, you probably don't need this book. It's pretty lenghty with a lot of examples from parents with fussy babies -- really all you need are the \\"5 S's\\" and you should find success in calming your baby.

My husband and I were getting desperate and also not enjoying parenthood at all, and even worse dreading the next several months. I started using the techniques described in this book just yesterday and last evening was the first evening in quite a while that we did not have to tag team holding a screaming baby while the other one took a break. While it has only been 24 hrs the changes have been quite remarkable so far. Also, I have noticed that my baby when awake and alert is less fussy-it is like the sleep she is getting now is more quality. I highly recommend this book for all parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I used this technique on a baby on a flight from Europe. The baby had been crying for hours and could not be soothed. Once in the plane I told the flight attendant that I could help....I am a nurse-midwife. I sat next to the father, who spoke no English, took the baby and applied the technique. The baby calmed down within minutes and was quiet for the next 9 hours!!!! After I did this,everyone in the airplane clapped and cheered. I taught the technique to the parents. The flight crew brought me presents!!! My travel companion was totally amazed that the family let me try it with the baby, but the crying was distressful."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"THANK YOU! I'm the mother of three children -- an 8 year old, 6 year old and a 5 week old. At three weeks, she began screaming and crying every night at 9:00 p.m.. She cried every night for 10 days straight for two to four hours.We never experienced such crying with our older two children. I broke out all the old baby books and went to the Internet searching for help. I found this book, but was skeptical about whether or not it would work. I bought but only had a couple of hours to read it before the 9:00 witching hour/ In that time, we were able to get enough information that when she started crying, we were able to calm her in a matter of minutes.Since that first night, we've gotten better at using Dr. Karp's techniques and we haven't had one crying episode that we couldn't calm in minutes, rather than hours.If you have a fussy baby BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"After trying everything I was told to do to stopping my 11 wk old daughter's crying &amp; get her to sleep, I got Dr. Karp's book &amp; it saved my life.

She seems so much more content &amp; happy when she is awake because she is getting better sleep. It has ended the stress I was feeling each time I knew she was tired but had to spend endless amounts of time getting her to sleep &amp; then continuing to hold her because otherwise she would wake up. It has allowed me undivided time to spend w/my 3 year old son as well &amp; for that, he is appreciative.Thank you to Dr. Karp for this invaluable parenting tool.

My husband and I read all of the &quot;colicky baby bibles&quot; to no avail until we followed Dr. Karps instructions. His mix of sound, movement and swaddling stopped our baby in the middle of a crying fit. The best part was the following day when I performed the same mix and heeded the same result. It literally changed my life to be able to calm him down in minutes instead of over an hour. We will forever be thankful and only hope others share this monumental break through."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"At least it didn't work with my son. Please don't do what I did, & read the reviews & buy this book and think it will be a cure all for your baby. You'll only drive yourself insane. I read all the reviews & the People magazine article & thought this technique would calm my colicky 6 week old, who cries 12 hours a day. While this book is interesting at times, all of the steps do not work all of the times. Swaddling worked twice (yes, I did swaddle him correctly. I even went back to the hospital & had the nurses show me again to make sure I was doing it right.) \\"Shhhhing\\" has worked once or twice (I've done it so much sometimes I feel like I'm going to pass out). Swinging hardly ever works and \\"sucking\\" doesn't work either becaues my son refuses to take a pacifier. It actually aggravates him & makes him more upset if I try to give it to him.I have done all these techniques together and also seperately time & time again, and have found that some of the things work some of the time, but it is NOT a cure all. If your baby is anything like mine, it will be hit or miss with a combination of Dr. Karps and some of your own.As I said, some of this book is interesting, and some of it is very repetitive. For example, on about every third page or so, Dr. Karp reiterates over & over again that other countries have almost no instances of colicky babies. That's great if your a member of the !Kang tribe in Africa and can carry your baby every waking hour and breastfeed every 10 minutes.Also, Dr. Karp states that colic babies go through their crying spells in the evening and that colic stops after the \\"fourth trimester\\" when your baby is 3 months old. I find fault with that, because my son is wicked from 5am to 11am, sleeps most of the afternoon, and then is inconsolable again from 4pm to about 11pm. Also, I have heard from numerous mothers that colic often lasts longer than the average 3 months. I know one mother who's daughter was colic for 8 months.So please don't do what I did & pin all your hopes on this book, and then fall into a deep depression and feel like a bad mother when, after weeks of trying this book's techniques over & over again, your baby still screams for hours. I kept thinking I was doing something wrong until family & friends reassured me that sometimes there is nothing you can do to stop your baby from crying. Even the no-fail car ride doesn't work with my son all the time. Just keep in mind that it is hit or miss, some days one thing will calm your baby and other days it will be something totally different. What calms your baby today may totally aggravate him tomorrow, at least in my experience anyway."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was at a loss as to how to rate this because the information is GREAT - the steps to getting your baby to calm down and not cry are really effective and everyone with a baby should learn them, at least to have them at your disposal should you need them.However, I felt that this technique, which was basically the heart of the book, could have been written in about 10 pages, if even that much. SO the rest of the book felt like filler. I wish they would have just published a \\"cliff notes\\" version of it. :)My recommendation is to skip the first half of the book (it's divided into two parts) since it only talks about why other methods don't work... and while that might be interesting to some people, I'm usually more interested in the theory that he thinks actually DOES work."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was exactly what I needed. I just wish I'd bought it sooner. I had premature twins and had a difficult time keeping them happy at certain times of day, especially during naps. This book gave me very easy instructions on how to make my babies happy and even explained the theory behind the method (something else I really appreciate). My babies were so much more content after I started using the Happiest Baby method with them so I was a lot happier too!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It may sound a bit melodramatic but if this book didn't save my life it sure made it a zillion times better. Since my baby's arrival there is the BTB and the ATB -the \\"Before The Book\\" and the \\"After The Book\\". The difference has been like night and day...my newborn daughter used to cry and scream for what seemed hours and hours and got so upset she couldn't (and I couldn't help her to) find her way to calmness, after trying nearly everything we would end up crying together... I felt so scared and anxious whenever her fussy time would start...but after reading this book and aplying the techniques for the 5 S's well... I am scared no more. I feel truly empowered. These methods 1. the snug swaddling, 2. the white noise, 3. the swaying, 4. the sucking; they all work -if performed correctly. Now when my baby cries, it's no longer a marathon cry...we apply the layers of soothing and she is back to her happy calm self in no time, and if sleeping, she sleeps at least twice as long as before. I am forever grateful to the author."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great advice whether your baby is colicy or just typically fussy. Both my daughters did so much better being swaddled and playing white noise for them at night helped them sleep longer instantly. Great advice for all parents of a newborn, whether you've been through it before or not. I also reccomend reading this book before the baby is born since there isn't much time to do anything afterward."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My 10 week old baby boy now sleeps through the night. From 11 pm to 7 am. We swaddle him and put him in his bassinet with Womb Sounds Music playing on an endless loop. My oldest daughter(without this book) did not sleep through the night until she was nearly a year old. She would wake every two to three hours, and need to be fed and then walked to get to sleep. If I try to put my son to sleep without swaddling him, or the background noise, he usually wakes up within a few hours.We also bought the overpriced extralarge baby blanket that is sold on the book's website. It goes everywhere with him. If you can afford it - get two, or buy fabric and make your own.I thought this book was interesting in the way the author explainesd his theories, and explained other information about babies in general. For instance, I always thought pacifiers sort of shut up babies, almost that they were like a plug. I felt guilty using them. Dr. Karp explained how sucking on a pacifier is very calming and actually soothes the baby, not just shutting them up. I would recommend this book to anyone with a newborn."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A must have for both new and experienced parents. This book ( and video) I think would also benefit pediatricians and other health care professionals as the invaluable information in this book is simple yet effective advise for truly calming the fussy or uncomfortable baby.It is wonderful and refreshing to see Docs such as DR Karp re teaching the basics. I think with all of the conflicting info out there, it is difficult for parents to know what to do even though they KNOW what to do."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have an 22 month old and a 5 month old. My first baby had terrible colic. Her first months of life were the hardest ones of my life. Our Pediatrician kept on telling us colic was related to tummy troubles that had to just work themselves out. We tried all different formulas and spent a lot of extra money. It wasn't until I found out about Dr. Karp and his book on Good Morning America almost two years ago that I learned the real cause of colic and REAL solutions. I think his techniques (especially the swaddling) would have made ALL the difference in the world had I known. The good news is that I had watched the &quot;Happiest Baby on the Block&quot; DVD and read the book several times in prep for our second child. Our experience with our second has been completely different. In fact, our 5 month old son still has to sleep all tightly bundled as Dr. Karp recommends. I highly recommend ordering the DVD off of the Happiestbaby.com website. I tell every mother-to-be about Dr. Karp and the 5 S's."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My 7-week old son's pediatrician lent me her copy fo Dr. Karp's DVD two weeks ago, after five weeks of sleepless nights and dealing with what I thought was a &quot;gassy baby.&quot; We watched the video and implemented Dr. Karp's techniques that night, as our son was also going through the 7-10pm &quot;fussies.&quot; Dr. Karp's &quot;5 S's&quot; work wonderfully. I can't say more positive things about how wonderful it felt to find a technique that is peaceful, easy, and immediately effective in calming our new baby boy.I am now reading his book, and I am finding it just as useful and informative! I highly recommend both resources; definitely purchase the video, as it is really important to see how he does the techniques he describes. All soon-to-be parents should read this source and learn about these techniques to soothe a baby before they are born. I wish I'd had this knowledge during our son's first few weeks."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My wife and I just laughed and laughed over how effective Dr. Karp's calming techniques work. We just couldn't believe it! Our first baby cried and cried, but our new second baby has been a dream come true thanks to this book. And regardless of what an earlier reviewer said, not everything in this book is obvious and already known...in fact, some of it is downright counterintuitive. I can't recommend this book enough!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am a first time mom, and also a school psychologist - so I am VERY familiar with behavior management...and I have to say I absolutely loved this book because it not only blended neuroscience, medical field, and anthropology/sociology in a VERY EASY to read fashion - it incorporated SIMPLE strategies!The BEST part about the book is that it gave me TOTAL confidence from our baby's first cry &amp; how to handle it. I give this book to all of my first-time mom friends...and they raved about it!The best gift this book has to offer you is the calm confidence you will feel as a new parent! I promise!I also appreciate that there is an M.D. out there with a sense of humor able to relate his ideas in a simplistic, organized, &amp; encouraging manner."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a must for every new mother! Whether this is your first or fifth baby, Harvey Karp's new book is a must for a happier Mom and baby. I've used all of Dr. Karps techniques and they really, really work. I loved this book and I highly recommend it to anyone with a new baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Bravo Dr. Karp! I know from experience how these techniques help parents who are struggling with fussy babies. You MUST READ this book. This is a perfect gift for a new parent. The first three months of your child's life will benefit tremendously and so will yours. It is simply the WISEST way to calm your child."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a wonderful book for the parents of any newborn. Dr. Karp provides practical, easy-to-use advice to help new parents finally get a good night's sleep. Some of the tips in this book are even more effective than the &quot;finger-of-brandy-in-the-baby-bottle&quot; approach Amy and I were using before we read this."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"At 6-weeks old, our son had colic so badly that we thought we'd never make it through. We were first-time parents completely overwhelmed and severely sleep deprived. Our son wouldn't sleep more than two hours at a time and screamed the rest of the time at the top of his lungs. His pediatrician tried several reflux medications and switched his formula four times, but nothing worked.A friend suggested The Happiest Baby on the Block book and DVD. We saw an amazing difference in our son in the first day. Within three days he was sleeping 8 hours through the night (with tight bundling and white noise throughout the night) and crying very little during the day. He's 8-weeks old now, and he's still doing great! When he starts into \\"meltdown mode\\" we can calm and quiet him very quickly (with the help of swaddling, the swing and a hair dryer, but hey, we'll do whatever it takes). He's a much happier baby (the happiest one on the block!) and we're much happier parents.There is a ton of support out there for breastfeeding moms, but very little for parents of colicky babies. Thank God for Dr. Karp! To me, calming and quieting my screaming son is just as important to his health and happiness. I'm giving a copy of this book and DVD to everyone I know having babies from now on!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this for my daughter and son-in-law who have a new baby and they are first time parents. They LOVEED this book and my son-in-law had only read the first few pages and got up and took the baby from my daughter and did as the book said and the baby was asleep in 5 minutes. My daughter has now recommended this book to many other mothers. They swear by this book. She said it saved their sanity. My son-in-law said before they read the book, if THIS is how it is going to be, THIS is the last baby. hehe Well, now it is a different story. So, I and my daughter and son-in-law HIGHLY Recommend this book. Especially for first time parents. Or any parent that has a baby that will not sleep. Hope this helps someone out there."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Next to diapers, this book is the most valuable tool I've found for taking care of an infant. My baby was deemed &quot;extremely colicky&quot; from her first week of life, and absolutely nothing has worked to console her - except the techniques described in this book. The 5 &quot;S&quot; are easy to follow (really!), and can be easily used by, or taught to, any caregiver. Because of this book my baby is actually sleeping more, crying less - and has much happier parents!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The combination of the calming techniques in this book did wonders for our colicky baby. Now we can calm her down in minutes, and for the past three nights that we've tried the book's suggestions, she has slept for 5 hour stretches which is amazing to us, never thought we'd see it!We were concerned about swaddling anymore at this age (6 weeks) because 'What to Expect the First Year' says that swaddling after one month can lead to stunting your baby's growth. Not true! I used to think the 'What to Expect...' books were a must-have - now I wouldn't recommend any book for dealing with colic except Dr. Karp's!!! Wish I'd had this book the day our baby was born!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Little Baby Jack cried and cried...and I cried and cried, because I was at the end of my rope. My pediatrician gave me Malox, anti cramping medication, Mylecon drops...you name it. Nothing worked, and I felt so bad for not being able to comfort my baby. Then my pediatrican told me about Dr. Karp's book, and off to the bookstore I went. Hallelujah! I was so desperate that I read the book in a couple of days, and started applying all the 5 s's. It worked! I couldn't believe it, as I zoomed inches away from Jack with my vacume cleaner, he was quiet and content (and I got a clean house!) I would use my hairdryer by his crib at night, and sure enough, my little wrapped burrito drifted off to sleep. He is now 4 months and a beautiful and happy baby. I recommend this book as a \\"MUST HAVE\\" at every baby shower. My husband would tease me any time a baby issue came up: \\"what does \\"THE BOOK\\" say!?\\" Thank you Dr. Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr Karp approach is very simple and practical for fussy and crying babies.This is a magic touch to calm crying babies.This is a MUST to read book for all the parents and for the pediatricians to recommend to their patients.His Video showing very clearly the approach and is fun to watch and learn."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a first time mother with a colicky newborn I felt my life had descended into chaos. Dr. Karp's book helped instill a sense of order and calm for both my son and me. The Happiest Baby on the Block philosophy and strategies make intuitive sense and, most importantly, worked to calm my baby. I now feel more in control and knowledgeable about ways to soothe my son. I'm also getting more sleep :) Instead of buying clothes or toys as gifts for new parents, I'm giving them this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Wish we had know about this book with our first child - would have saved many sleepless nights and anxiety. We are using the methods in this book with our newborn son and the results are incredible! The swadling/shooshing technique really works and subsequently, our son is easier to calm and sleeps longer through the night!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has done wonders for our family!I got the book when our 10 week old baby was about 5 weeks old. He had just started having long fussy periods at night between feedings. I would pace the floor until I could feed him again. I even resorted to nursing him more frequently..every hour or 30 minutes...nothing worked. Once I read this book, I had an effective way not only to calm Cole, but to put him to sleep.Now we use the Cuddle Cure to put him to bed at night as well as down for naps when he gets fussy during the day. This technique has provided us with a way to calm him and to put him to sleep. We use this technique now every day. A definite must have for new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have twin sons and we used the techniques Dr. Karp suggested.

Turns out she had colic, acid reflux, AND food allergies. I tried all the suggestions in this book but unfortunately they did not help.I do think it would have been more helpful to have read this book while pregnant. Perhaps I would have had a better idea of suggestions and tips from the start... although, in my case, they would not have helped anyway. I found this to be a pretty quick read and have kept it just to reference for the next baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Fortunately,\\" The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" was exactly as described and was just what I wanted for my daughter-in-law. However, I was a bit puzzled by the purchase process because my understanding was that I was simply looking and deciding if i wanted to buy and once I'd come off the site and later checked my emails I discovered it was already bought!!Good job it was actually something I wanted and not too expensive. I don't know how it happened because I certainly did not go through what I understood to be a purchasing process as you do on eBay.I think I'd previously entered my details on Amazon for something else some time ago so I will have to be careful in future or I could end up with all sorts of stuff!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"All I can say is this has changed my life!! i thought my baby had horrible colic and I would sob right along with him all night long. now I can literally calm him within 1 minute and he's fast asleep in less than 5 minutes!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Excellent book!

Thank you so much for writing this amazing book Dr. Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I checked out several books from the library on the subject of colic, calming crying and sleep training for my newborn. This was our first child and we found ourselves mostly lost on what to do when he cried and all his needs were met. Our son is not colicy, but I was worried about him becoming so. I was also worried that I couldn't calm him when he would cry. Well let me say I've since bought this book to have on hand as it is the BEST method and works like a charm! My son recently had his 2-month immunizations and that whole day he acted colicy. He would fall asleep after a feeding and then wake up inconsolibly screaming. I immediately applied the Five S's in the methods described in Dr. Karp's book and it calmed him almost immediately EVERY time! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a newborn or will have a baby soon. It doesn't matter how many kids you have had, this will help tremendously! I've recommended it to every Mom and mom-to-be in my support groups and friends. Thank you, Dr. Karp, for writing such a profoundly honest, easy-to-read and intelligent book that actually WORKS!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The book is repetitive and pointlessly wordy to the point of becoming boring and annoying. I agree with the reviewers who wrote that the entire book content could be summarized in a pamphlet. I didn't like the author's writing style either, but this might be just a matter of taste.I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The information is great. I wish the author didn't use evolution in explaining why babies are the way they are. It's not like this throughout the entire book but it creeps up on you every now and then. As someone who does NOT believe in evolution it's a bit disconcerting.Other than that the information is wonderful. My husband and I are planning for our first child and I've been reading up on as much information as I can. All the techniques are explained thoroughly and make total sense. You get to read first hand experiences about other parents and what worked for their children.It explains the myths of colic and why they don't make sense. It explains why some babies need pacifiers and how to keep it from becoming habit forming. If you plan on breastfeeding, which I do, it explains the best time to introduce the bottle for when your breasts are not available. There's a lot of Q&A; sections throughout the chapters on common questions many parents have.It explains the 5 techniques needed in order to calm your baby and that they have to be done in a certain order and in a certain way in order to be successful. The book does a wonderful step-by-step instruction and explanation.I can't wait to put to use what I've learned. I know it will make me more confident in being a new mother."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Being new parents was a daunting experience, but with Harvey Karp's amazing philosophy and practical advice, we were able to calm our son down within minutes.

Dr Karp saved us and our daughter miserable hours of crying at night and let us all get some sleep.I want everyone to know that when it is hard to know what to believe with all the different methods and books, this is the winner and it really works.I have been telling everyone I know with a baby to get this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We doctors love this book! Sure, we feel helpless too when parents bring us an otherwise healthy baby who just can't stop crying. It's even worse when they come to the Emergency Room late at night as a last resort (not a great experience).Dr. Karp's method is simple and logical...and it works! This book is like a &quot;Get Out Of E.R. Free&quot; card.

It is cheap and may be a life saver for some people so it is worth checking out if you think it may be helpful. It is very conducive to attachment type parenting and helps give some historical/cultural background that maybe not all moms/moms to be know, but a lot of it I have read/heard elsewhere so it was not as insightful in that sense. My advice, save your self the time and money and check it out at the library and read the five steps and go on your way!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has a lot of great information. It's been very useful. However, they could have consolidated the entire book into a just a couple of chapters. A lot of the book is descriptions of how wonderful this technique has been for other parents (think info-merical). I have heard from several friends that there is a video that provides the same information in about 15 minutes. It's available at most libraries."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is one of the most overrated books I've ever come across. Skimming the book is all you need to get anything out of it, because it's extremely repetitive - and if you've educated yourself on babies' sleep needs, etc., you won't find anything new in this book. Much better books that worked for us are the Baby Whisperer and Good Night, Sleep Tight - our baby has been sleeping through the night since 2 months without crying - and we trusted ourselves that our son really didn't like having his arms swaddled. The Happiest Baby on the Block methods are not for every baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a must have for parents of unhappy babies. The funny thing is that the ideas and concepts in the book make complete sense and when you read it, you go \\"oh yeah, of course!\\" Anyone that has spent any time around babies will have their own special tricks for calming and quieting babies and there is a good chance that the methods you've used are in this book. There is no earth shattering single magical trick for calming an unhappy baby in this book, but what it does have is solid practical advice on techniques that when done in the right order and in the right way do work. Our baby is much happier since we've followed the concepts in this book.Equally important, the author helps put your mind at ease that there is probably nothing wrong with your baby when he screams uncontrollably. He explains why they do this, and why the calming methods he recommend work. Very interesting and informative as well as useful. I highly recommend this book to all parents of newborn babies and especially those that have extra fussy babies. Worth the money."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My baby has been very colicky in the evenings and this book has been sooo helpful in calming him.

Never has anyone put together such a wonderful method for calming children. However, buyer beware- the swaddling is addictive for the baby. Our child is 5 mos. old, and he will not sleep unswaddled. I disagree with the previous reviewer that the baby simply doesn't need swaddling to sleep. It is a learned behavior and it is hard to break.Keep in mind that once you get your baby used to the swaddling, it will be difficult to leave your child with another caregiver, as few people will do the &quot;tap dance&quot; you do to get your child to sleep. My wife had to delay her maternity leave b/c of this.Still, Dr. Karp is the King of calming fussy newborns. I would recommend his methods for calming the crying jags, but def. not for sleep. Unless, you want to get in the predicament we are in. Good luck! -"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"While I support what Dr. Karp says about creating a womb-like atmosphere during your baby's &quot;fourth trimester,&quot; not all of his advice rang true for me. My first baby was very fussy and not easily soothed, and I don't think that anything would have prevented the weeks and weeks of colicky behavior that we endured. I'm a big fan of Dr. Sears' book The Fussy Baby -- the bible for parents like me who were blessed with &quot;high needs&quot; babies. :-) The main thing to remember is that this too shall pass. Your baby won't always be this fussy and this needy. And some day you will sleep again. (Or at least until baby number two arrives. I'm pregnant again!)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"After reading these reviews I rush-ordered this book. I was disappointed to find that the entire book is for newborn babies only. Once your baby is too old to swaddle this book isn't for you. I purchased several others at the same time and found that The No Cry Sleep Solution has great ideas for all babies and even toddlers.The ideas in this book cannot be applied to a baby that is over about 3 months old. If you look at the main points you'll see they are: swaddling, placing on his side or stomach, saying Shhhh, Swinging, and Sucking. I also suspect that if you always do this with your newborn you may create sleep problems for when you can't do them any more.Beware! If your baby is over 3 months this isn't the book you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book might be helpful for parents of babies that are slightly fussy, but it offers no real help for babies with true colic. To start, you can save the money and learn the techniques in this book by doing a quick Google or YouTube search. You can even lean them by reading other reviews on this site. That may sooth a mildly fussy baby, but amount to nothing more than a parlor trick to parents of babies that suffer from colic. Swaddling, shushing, swinging, (etc.) bring about an interesting instinctual reaction that instantly quiets a baby. Likewise, tickle a baby's foot and they will spread their toes. Neat reaction, but not very helpful. For a baby with colic, these techniques work for mear minutes before they return to crying. I'm sure the author shows parents this neat trick in his office to the delight of worn our parents. Unfortunately, when they return home, they quickly find out you can only swaddle, shush, and swing for so long and it becomes a full time job to use these techniques only to keep the baby on edge and slightly postpone the inevitable \\"meltdown\\". The techniques produce a temporary reaction and then leave parents of colicky babies frustrated and wondering if they themselves failed at the techniques.The theory of the \\"4th trimester\\" is just that, a theory. The \\"filler information\\" in the book makes some interesting points about babies \\"missing the womb\\", but from practical experience dealing with a baby with colic, I question much of this. The book makes much reference to \\"primitive societies\\" that have no cases of colic because they use age old techniques of replicating the womb. The primary way they do this is through baby wearing. Well, we've tried that too with marginal results. Again, it works briefly (slightly longer than the techniques mentioned in this book), but the inconsolable crying still happens. The author also says \\"it's not gas\\". I also question that. During bouts of crying, it's obvious that our baby is processing gas. Changing position gives her mild relief as it causes the gas to move through. Also, remedies like gripe water and modifying mom's diet (when breast feeding) have mild results.Overall, save your money and frustrations and learn these techniques by doing some online searching. And to those parents of babies with colic, my heart goes out to you and your child."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This product was exactly how it was described.

I would have ordered it again for the price"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am currently still pregnant with my first child, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the techniques in this book. However, I was so impressed with the writing and the presentation of the material in this book that I am going to give it 5 stars. I also hope that the baby-calming methods are as effective as the book was easy to read.This book (and its DVD companion) were recommended to me by my OBGYN, and friends with and WITHOUT children! I considered this book a must-read. However, I am a skeptical reader and wary of pop trends in baby care and parenting. This book is none of that - or if it is, it's because the methodology is popular because IT SEEMS TO WORK.The writing IS repetitive. However, I did not find this a minus in terms of really learning the methods in this book. Repetition means that by the time you've finished this book, you know by heart, for sure, what the 5 S's are, and how to properly implement them. For those of us with pregnancy brain, or for parents operating on little sleep, the repetition is necessary.My main criticism of this book is the goofy font that is used for the anecdotal stories. In the paperback version, it's a small point size, thick, and not at all easy to read. The illustrations are a little silly and somewhat hard to follow in some cases, but I imagine the DVD makes up for some of this. Otherwise, this is a well-written, common-sense book and I intend to keep mine - with dog-ears - until that fourth trimester is over!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"LOVE this book!!!

The whole thing could (and should) be summarized in about 20 concise pages rather than waste the precious hours of tired new parents with irrelevant case stories.Also, the advice in the book is wrapped in a pseudo-anthropological narrative that fuses dubious speculation about human evolution with highly racialized clich&eacute;s about child-rearing in non-Western societies. In short, the book contributes to the romantic (and racist) myth that non-Western societies are better at dealing with babies because they are supposedly more in touch with \\"nature\\". The corollary of that argument is of course that non-Western societies are stereotyped as backward and primitive."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Kudos Dr. Karp!

Since then, I have looked all over for ways to improve the situation with our \\"fussy\\" (sensitive AND intense) baby. I have been using the methods in this book for about a week now (my baby is 6 weeks old) and have seen amazing results. She is so much more calm and happy. This book made me a believer that there is no such thing as \\"colic,\\" but a new little being that needs some extra help at getting settled into this big world. This book will teach you how to do just that. :)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A family member gave us this book when we had our baby and it was a huge help. Buy a Swaddle Me or learn to swaddle wrap your baby tightly in a blanket, get a free white noise generator app for your phone (you will loose your voice saying 'shhhhh' otherwise) and if you can, buy a rocking chair and/or a baby swing - this will enable you to get some rest. The five 'S' 's actually work. Our baby is now 3 1/2 months old and this still works.This book is a very quick read (Dr. Karp repeats himself a bit) and the whole technique could have been put in a pamphlet but I don't begrudge Dr. Karp for making some money off of his technique since it enabled my partner and I to get some desperately needed sleep."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was a life saver, My son was always crying and it was hard to put him down at night.

I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the book did have a lot of fluff in it and could have been shorter, and the idea of a 4th trimester is a little cheesy to me, but the usefullness of these techniques far far over rides any of my complaints. Although I read this book cover to cover, and picked at specific chapters after my daughter was born, what I found really helpful was renting the DVD from our library to SEE how you really have to get right in their ear to shush and how exactly to do the jiggling motion.

I think this book helped from day one!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"First let me say that this is a great book. The information is fantastic and extremely logical. I particularly appreciated how Dr. Karp researched other \\"non-colic\\" cultures (there are hundreds of them) to form his approach. On the other hand, this reads like a sales pitch for a used car. The language is so simplistic that I actually felt insulted. There's a lot of self-congratulation on the author's part, which gets old quick. So get the book and look beyond the writing style. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Until we used these methods our daughter would cry for hours and we would pass her back and forth.

As I didnot have much experience with babies I carefully memorized what he said and put that into practice with my baby.Most of his advice is practical, sensible, and helpful.As with any advice we should take his advice with caution and adaptive mind. Colicky babies are mostly sensitive babies and there are many other baies who are secure and less sensitive. If yours is a secure one, you don't have to swaddle your little one unlike Dr.Karp's advice. She may resent it genuinely.A spoiler is that the book is quite wordy. While I think his theory of the 4th trimester has a grain of truth, he didnot have to repeat why his theory beats other theories of colics, I think. At least I found that boring and unnecessary and that part made him look desperate to sell his theory.Honestly I think this book could have been better written as a 20 page booklet rather than a 200 plus page book.You can skim through it quickly and still get all the ideas for good or bad."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Karp's theory about calming newborns -- a good theory, as far as it goes -- could have been stated in about three pages. Since there's no money to be made with a three page book, he has to pad it out some.Unfortunately most of the padding involves either sniping at other techniques for calming newborns or else patting himself on the back for his own genius in having the theory he's got. He seems to be waiting for the phone call from the Nobel Prize people. That part is fairly nasty to read.

Dr. Karp repeatedly tells the reader what the signs of colic are, what the causes of colic might or might not be, and that this book will tell us parents how to calm babies quickly and effectively. The first several chapters basically repeat the same information again and again. We are told over and over that in several cultures babies never (or rarely) experience colic. This is an interesting piece of information, but it did not need to be repeated so often.At the beginning of each chapter, there is a summary of the main points; I found this to be a \\"spoiler\\" of sorts, and found myself skimming a lot of the book because of these spoilers and the repetitiveness.I am expecting our baby soon, and I will definitely try the techniques outlined in the book (which are easy to remember and well-defined). I can't comment on how useful the techniques are because I haven't had a chance to try them...Overall, the book is a quick read, and the techniques seem simple enough to try. Dr. Karp does have disclaimers scattered through the book that amount to: \\"If this does not work, then you must not be doing it correctly\\" which basically absolves him of all responsibility.If you have had experience with a colicky baby (or are expecting a baby soon), this book is worth looking over.

Within 20 minutes my son was out like a light. (And so was my husband) We used this method and my son did not have anymore crying fits like that again.

THERE IS NO NEED TO LET YOUR BABY CRY HIM/HERSELF TO SLEEP. Don't confuse them, comfort them... If you are pregnant, read this book and study this before you deliver! Get the techniques memorized in order. Write yourself up a poster board and post on the baby's room door for reminder of what to do (the 5 S's) in what order because you will be so deliriously tired with a new born with colic, you won't be able to think straight. Then get the DVD to be able to watch as needed (you won't have time to read the book after the baby is born!)What is really sad is how this is not known wide enough how many day care providers don't know of this or use this method. I have been to specialists, none gave me good advise. I wish I could kiss doctor Karp and hug him! I wish I could make a new career for myself just holding classes at hospitals or YMCA's or somthing to help people practice these techniques. I think it would prevent child abuse just by being an implementer of these wonderful methods. I think all pediatricians should be offering this as a standard for new parents. It is amazing how much crappy advise and NO HELP you can get from the general pediatrican/medical world!MY BABY WAS DIAGNOSED with \\"extreme nuerological colic\\" and the only thing that worked for him are the techniques in this book.

My baby responded immediately to the swaddling. He still wakes up once a night, but goes right back to sleep and spits up much less. He is much more easily soothed and falls asleep so quickly.

Either we have the easiest baby on earth, or this stuff really works. When they handed the baby to me after he delivered, he was screaming his head off. I swung and shushed him, and him immediately quieted down.Using the techniques in this book, if our baby isn't hungry, some combination of the 5 s's always calm him. Only occasionally, when he is out of control does it take all 5, but it always works. Our baby has NEVER cried for more than a few minutes, thanks to this book.We shared the book with our pediatrician, who hadn't heard of it, and he totally endorsed the techniques.

Prior to our second daughter's birth, my husband and I read this book so that we would be better prepared for dealing with a fussy baby and it is a good thing we did. Our second child also turned out to be colicky, but fortunately, we learned the techniques that Dr. Karp outlines in his book and I can honestly say that they work! Dr. Karp's book provides parents with a step by step approach to calming babies and he thoroughly explains why they work.

We tried everything from putting me on a restricted diet (as I was nursing) to washing all of the baby's clothes in a hypo-allergenic detergent and nothing would stop the hours of endless crying.I don't know how we would have survived without Dr. Karp. Once my husband and I mastered swaddling as well as the 4 other &quot;S&quot; techniques, the baby would stop crying in under 2 minutes.

I had not sufficiently allowed for the extreme fatigue that faced my husband and I being so compounded by two colicky babies. We were beside ourselves. Were we doing something wrong? Were our children afflicted with some awful sickness to make them cry so heartrendingly? Enter Dr. Karp.His techniques work and while they don't eliminate the problem completely, they allow zombified parents to get a handle on the situation, and believe me, that's the difference between coping with those early months and not.We were so fortunate to have the hands-on help of such a dedicated doctor who not only understood our situation, but also had found solutions for those difficult first months that the previous generation seems so readily to forget.With this book his message is going to reach more than those who are lucky enough to be patients at his office, and as a confirmed convert to swaddling, swings and shushing, that's a wonderful thing!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a mom of 20 years, a nurse of 23 years, a birth/ parenting educator of 6 years, and a lactation consulant of 5 years.... I have waited a long time for this book! I am now including \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" in my \\"Intuitive Parenting\\" classes, and recommending it to my clients. Why?Well, for one, it is research based. As far as I can tell, the only book of it's type that is based on more than just a few anecdotes, or a compilation of the work of others. HBOTB draws it's wisdom from actual research on what helps colic. Until now, colic has defied medical and, at times, intuitive management. It has been the great baffler for which we parents have taken alot of blame... but no more!Second, it works! I am always reluctant to recommend any parenting book because in 23 years, I have found few that actually do what they say they will. This book delivers! In every situation where I have helped parents implement Dr. Karp's strategies I have seen improvement. Improvement in baby's ability to calm, improvement in parent outlook, and.... to top it off, improved feeding! What do I mean by \\"improved feeding?\\" I mean calmer latching, less fussing at the breast, and fewer spit-ups. I mean good weight gain!I will continue to observe for the downside to this book (there has to be one, doesn't there?) But for now, I am encouraging moms and dads to read the book, try the 5 S's and enjoy their babies!Sincerely,Susan Keith-Hergert RNC, MS, IBCLCHolistic Natal CareCincinnati"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Forget the vacuum cleaner and the hair dryer.

I felt pretty confident in my abilities to take care of babies by the third time around, but I learned something new from his book. Dr. Karp's methods are really common sense and are things that our grandmas probably knew, but we've lost touch with in our age of electronic baby gadgets and experts who think they've reinvented the wheel. Dr. Karp brings us back to basics with something that ACTUALLY WORKS. It's not gimmicky, nor is it a rigid program. It's just the key to helping your baby feel better and cry less.I would recommend buying the video along with the book, though. The one part of the book that was trickiest to implement was the tight swaddling. We couldn't quite get it right and I think our baby missed out. The video is complementary to the book, showing you how to do what you read about in the book. I recommend this book to all the new moms I know. May Dr. Karp's ideas get the attention they deserve - his respect for babies shines through and through!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I came across the book when I was pregnant. All I can say is, I have read many books on child care and when my baby was born, I pretty much toss out all the books I read except for this one. I would not know how I would survive if I did not know Dr. Karp's techniques. For all new mothers out there, this book is a godsend. Thanks, Dr. Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"For all mothers-to-be - memorize it. And for all new mothers - always have it by your side. I wish I knew such valuable information with my 4 babies. I just spent 1 week with my 1 month old granddaughter who was diagnosed with \\"3-month colic\\" and this book cured her in one day."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Although our son was not colicky, he was a loud sleeper. He thrashed and kicked and woke himself up 3 or 4 times a night. He was so loud we had to put him in his own room long before we were ready to.I read Dr. Karp's book in one evening and started using the 5 s's that same night. What a change! The very first night, although he kicked and screamed about being swaddled, he fell asleep quickly and slept FIVE hours straight (at four weeks old)!! Since then, we have been swaddling our son every night and for his long nap in the daytime. Most of the time, only 2 or 3 of the s's are needed to put our son to sleep. We even can put him to bed mildly awake and he goes to sleep on his own.Dr. Karp's book is easy to read, easy to use, and absolutely the truth. My North African husband had tried to convince me to use the very same techniques Dr. Karp espouses in his book from the time we came home from the hospital. I thought my husband was nutso to want to keep swaddling the baby... I eat my words!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Despite being an educated woman and an experienced aunt, I really knew nothing about caring for a newborn when I became a new mom at age 40! Dr. Karp's amusing and interesting lessons helped me feel confident handling and caring for my baby right away. The result is my son IS the happiest baby on the block! My family and friends were amazed when the 5 S's were put into action and calm ensued immediately. They worked EVERY time. I absolutely recommend Dr. Karp's book to new/old moms, caregivers, medical personnel and even folks considering having kids! I feel like Dr. Karp is one of my best friends!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I'm part of that trendy new group of moms who was expecting that first baby at age 40; however, I felt so overwhelmed that I didn't know the first thing about having a baby at my age! I happened to see Dr. Karp on a television show and saw his &quot;miracle working abilities&quot; with a crying baby. I was amazed! I read with vigor about the fourth trimester, the 5 Ss and the truths and myths of caring for a baby. I even started practicing swaddling a cabbage patch doll! When we brought Jack Barrett home from the hospital, we put into practice all 5 Ss and he responded perfectly! My husband was much better at swaddling -- making a &quot;baby burrito&quot; -- than I was and even my mother, who looked at me skeptically when explained the 5 Ss, learned to be a champion &quot;shhhhsher&quot; and &quot;swayer&quot;. When friends who were also new parents would complain about colic and crying, I knew then how amazing Dr. Karp's method was and would offer the book. Jack Barrett was all the proof they needed! One friend who is having her 2nd baby is reading my copy and swears she did everything wrong with her first son (and still feels guilty that she couldn't wait to get back to work and get away from her crying baby!) I felt confident during those first weeks that I could pacify Jack Barrett in any situation and know without a doubt it is due to what I learned in Dr. Karp's book. It is a MUST read for new moms, old moms (God bless us) and anyone who cares for little babies."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I purchased this book after seeing Dr. Karp on Oprah. I read it about 2 weeks before my baby was born - and boy was I glad! The book gives such great advice on techniques that are not taught to you in any of the other baby \\"how-to\\" books. The advice and techniques are simple, but very useful. Also read that this book is now out on DVD, which \\"shows\\" you the techniques to use."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book should be required reading for ALL parents, grandparents, caregivers, etc. I'm a 43 year old mom of a 4 month old...my 3rd child...the other two are 18 and 13. Where was this book when I was 25 and having babies? Take it from an experienced mother...Dr. Karp knows what he is talking about. Our 4 month old has been a breeze as compared to our first two. Don't mess with all the &quot;other&quot; advice you will get. Follow his suggestions and you will be the happiest parents on the block. The book is easy to read, straight-forward and a great reference tool. I have referred back to it several times over the last few months. BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT...you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am expecting my first baby in July and this book took away so much anxiety and fear about a crying baby. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed. Dr. Karp has a very easy writing style and does not talk down to you, nor does he demand that you do things his way only. He presents his ideas in a very friendly and easy manner - like you were talking to a good friend. I read the book in about 2 days - I just couldn't put it down. The biggest releif I found in his book was there were very few DON'Ts but there were many encouraging words and tons of DO's. :)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought the video tape to this book at a baby store because we needed help calming our 2 month old baby! I had no idea as to what the outcome might be. When I got a chance to see the tape and applied the 5S's shown by Dr. Karp, it was like a miracle! This book and video tape should be a MUST HAVE for all new parents. Nothing works to calm your baby like Dr. Karp's method and it is the only way we could calm our baby to get her to sleep 4 hours at a stretch. I wish I would have known about the 5S method before we brought the baby home from the hospital. Thanks Dr. Karp for giving us our sanity!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We had stumbled on many of the tricks in this book through trial and error. If we had read the book before the baby was born we might have slept during that hectic first month.I consider this an essential for first time parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The happiest Baby on the Block is a must read for all new parents. The 5 S's really work for all types of babies, not just the extremely fussy baby. My baby responded immediately to the 5 S's, and best of all my husband and our baby's grandparents found the 5 S's easy to use also. With the consistency of all of us applying the same soothing strategies, our daughter responded. This book is easy to read and the strategies make sense. I also ordered the Happiest Baby on the Block CD that Dr. Karp has available on his website. My husband and grandma watched the video and were able to apply the strategies without reading the entire book. Even better, so many of my friends who are new moms were able to come and watch the video and we got to discuss the strategies together. I have reccommended this book to so many of my friends who have all been pleased. You won't regret purchasing this book, in fact you will find yourself buying it for other new moms too!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"With a background in education and child development, I thought I was all ready for my baby. I have had a lot experience with my nieces and nephews and I remember the things that comforted them the most. Each one of these methods are suggestions in Dr. Karp's book. One loved side sleeping, while another loved the white noise. He uses anthropology, biology, sociology and a lot of love to come up with some great ideas on how to calm your baby and make them happy! It all makes so much sense and it is written from a loving point of view not just a medical one. I highly recommend this wonderful book and cannot wait to make my baby the happiest baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My wife and I read many books about parenting as the days were drawingnear to the birth of our daughter Sofia. We read about naturalchild-birth, guides to successful breast feeding and others on babyschedules and successful sleeping and also attended baby classes herein Rome.We had many questions, but still more advice from others than we wanted and simply tried to make our own decisions based on what we'd read and what we'd been told, drawing conclusions based on what worked for our child. There is a lot of conflicting information out there and this book is the only one that I feel I can recommend without any reservations.We started implementing the suggestions in this book right around our baby's first month and they worked incredibly well. Now at four months we have a baby who is not just happy, but excited to be awake during the day and observing the world -- due in large part to her ability to sleep well at night.We've given up trying to explain to people that we're not just, \\"lucky to have a happy baby who sleeps well\\", except when it comes to expecting parents. Then we suggest the book or, in the case of a coworker, give them a gift that will last a whole lot longer than a toy or cute outfit."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"this is one of the many books i bought about sleeping problems and i found this book, to the point and very helpful."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this book while I was pregnant with our first child. I read it cover to cover and it helped me gain the confidence I needed to know that I actually could be a good mom with a new baby. The real miracle was that when it came to applying everything in real life, it really worked. Our little boy doesn't know when to stop playing, so he gets really tired and worn out, but still fights it. If it weren't for the 5 S's, he would be a nightmare. But we swaddle him, swing him, put him on his side, and shoosh him and he goes right to sleep (he doesn't like pacifiers, but I've seen the sucking work with other kids). THANK YOU DR. KARP!!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"All I can do is agree with the rest of you folks. This book is a miracle. Our 2 week old son was great for 21-22 hours a day, but the other 2 hours were unbearable crying and screaming. I read this book in one sitting b/c I couldn't wait to test it (it's an easy read). It worked right away!! My wife and I were sitting there in shock as our screaming son fell calmly asleep sideways in my arms while listening to static from our baby monitor and having his little head jiggled. It is very important to do the 5 S's correctly, but they really do work. It's been 3 nights so far and I'm just hoping that it keeps working (I feel like it's too easy to keep working).I would have paid $500 for this book in hindsight."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was recommended to my wife and I by friends who had a colicky baby. They found it the only way to help their baby calm down (that and a trip to the doctor's to check to allergies, which you should do to rule out food allergies if you suspect colic).So far my wife and I have found the book useful and our infant does not seem to have colic. It is useful for getting the infant back to sleep from hour one of their life. The techniques worked wonders and the reasoning behind the techniques makes perfect sense to this layman. The techniques are also useful for calming your baby. For instance if you need to feed but the baby is too upset to take to the breast.All in all a life saver. Yes, your baby will still cry and sometimes not even the techniques here work, but 95% of the time you and your baby can have peace.I would get this book for anyone who is going to have a baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp is a miracle worker when it comes to helping new parents deal with their newborns!! I found that there is way too much information out there and it began to get confusing. Dr. Karp is the ONLY one who helps you deal with what to do when you bring your baby home and realize just how much they can cry. And, he does it in an easy to understand and light hearted manner. Our baby is 8 weeks old and we have been using this system of the 5 S's since he was born. He has acid reflux and can get miserable in a hurry. We just swaddle, sush and swing him to a peacful state everytime. He rarely cries for more that 5 minutes if he gets upset!! And, using Dr. Karp's methods, he sleeps for 5 hours at night, then after feeding him, sleeps another 4 every night!! I can't thank Dr. Karp enough for his insightful book. It was so easy to read and we began implementing his tools even before we finished reading the whole thing!! The DVD is a great complement to actually see the S's in action-it's amazing!! It helped reluctant grandparents see how to swaddle and how great it works, too. The first time they watched the little guy alone, they were running for the swaddle!! All I know is Dr. Karp has written a book that should be included in all households with a newborn. I know I give it to everyone who is pregnant or has a child under a year-it's a great gift! We are big fans of Dr. Karp's because of his understanding and compassioniate style-we couldn't imagine this time in our lives without the knowledge he has passed on. No crying baby makes us happier and has definitely made our little one \\"the happiest baby on OUR block\\"! Just buy this book-it even turned a skeptic like my husband into a believer!! Thank you Dr. Karp!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great tips to calm any baby ... I wish I had it 2 months ago when our son was first born!! The book is an easy read, you can get through it in a day or two, and it is AMAZING how the simple common sense steps it outlines help any new parent ease their baby into a great mood or a restful sleep. Based on other reviews, I am going to purchase the DVD too, as a supplement to this book. I am also giving it at every baby shower I attend from now on. I read MANY books before our son was born about how to have happy babies - most were long and tedious - this one says it all simply, quickly, and accurately."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My baby is 5 weeks old and has been fussing since week 1 getting progressively worse each day. My husband and I were getting desperate and also not enjoying parenthood at all, and even worse dreading the next several months. I started using the techniques described in this book just yesterday and last evening was the first evening in quite a while that we did not have to tag team holding a screaming baby while the other one took a break. While it has only been 24 hrs the changes have been quite remarkable so far. Also, I have noticed that my baby when awake and alert is less fussy-it is like the sleep she is getting now is more quality. I highly recommend this book for all parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"When my wife and I had our first child this year, the nurse suggested we watch the VHS version of \\"Happiest Baby\\" while still in the hospital. Unfortunately, the VCR in our room didn't work, so we missed what turned out to be our golden opportunity. We didn't get the book until our son was about two months old. We had tried all the classics up to that point to get him to sleep for even a couple hours at a time: singing, rocking, late night car rides, but we couldn't bear the thought of just letting him \\"cry it out\\". We were exhausted and at our wit's end when we received this book as a gift. After reading it and putting the suggestions into practice our boy began sleeping through the night (eight hours a night). Even now that he's teething he'll give us four hours at a stretch and sleep eight to nine hours during the night. And putting him to sleep is a snap. All my friends who also have infants comment regularly about how \\"lucky\\" I am to have a child who's easy to put to sleep for the night or for his naps. Dr. Karp's methods DO work, and they work FAST (ever seen a screaming infant fall asleep in two minutes flat?). For tired moms and dads, this book could be what turns your \\"colicky\\" baby into the joy of your homes and lives, even at night.UPDATE: After the birth of my second son, I was able to use the swaddling techniques immediately and they worked like a charm. The methods actually worked great until he was over a year old, and he's always given us at least 9-10 hours of peaceful sleep every night since the day he was born (except for when he was teething, of course). I have recommended this book to all of my expectant friends. The methods themselves aren't earth-shaking, but what the book does give you is the tools, knowledge, and confidence to try."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was a rare lucky Mommy -- both of my children had colic. With the first I suffered since I was unable to know how to calm her, she cried for hours. It was Heck! With my second baby I had this book and was able to calm myself and my baby. I am truly thankful. Even if you have to wean from the steps after the colic phase is over its worth it. For weaning from the 5 S's I used The No-Cry Sleep Solution book and it worked for us. Now no colic and sleep too. Ahhh."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book should have been a pamphlet. The information is GREAT-- and specific, but the book repeats itself in every single chapter. Successive chapters are more-or-less the same thing in different words. There is a two page spread at the center of the book that summarizes the whole thing. If you skim the entire book and photocopy the center pages, you have more than enough to practice the technique. If I knew this, I would not have purchased the book, but would have just picked it up from my local library.However, don't let this deter you from reading it-- the author gives EXCELLENT advice on how to make a crying baby happy. he basically argues that \\"colicy\\" infants are a product of how we tend to raise babies-- and have nothing to do with any physical ailment whatsoever. He claims that almost NO other cultures have anything like \\"colic\\" and he answers the question \\"why\\" with a series of steps that restrict, soothe, and make your baby happy!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The 5 things he writes are great, ones we've used for generations. So glad they are now written down, but he could have made it into a pamphlet. I think it was deceptive when he said \\"if you do it correctly\\"... There's his out to his claim to make babies stop crying. The fact is, some babies cry. Mom's rock, swaddle, sing, use a binky and they still cry, bless their hearts. The devoted and frustrated mom hasn't done anything incorrectly, it's just how some sweet little ones are. And besides, how does he know what the cave-women thought, anyway? I'm shaking my head at how he made so much money by giving so little advice."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Review by Elizabeth Pantley, author of The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Dr. Karp clearly loves babies and respects parents. His soothing technique brings together all the pieces of baby-soothing knowledge into a 5-step pattern that works to help even the fussiest newborn stop crying. His system is especially valuable for parents of colicky babies. All of Dr. Karp's ideas are loving and respectful to babies, and encourage bonding between baby and parent. He gives parents the tools they need to feel confident caring for their new baby. The 5 S calming technique should be taught to all professionals working with newborn babies: it's effective!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"During my daughter's third week, she began to cry consistently for several hours in the evening. My husband and I were convinced it was colic. My sister-in-law, knowing how exhausted we were, researched information regarding colic on the web and sent it to us. She found an article describing Dr. Karp's techniques and then sent us The Happiest Baby on the Block. We read it and learned how to help our baby, quickly learning that it was first-time parents not aware of how to comfort their baby girl (despite having 16 nieces and nephews!).When a friend of mine had her baby a month later, I recommended that she purchase the book as well (it's actually one of my 'must have books' on a list I give friends who are having their first baby). Her baby truly had colic; following your recommendations, she swore by your book as she saw significant improvement. She now gives The Happiest Baby on the Block as a baby shower gift!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Like other parents of colicky babies, we were at our wits end. That is until we discovered Dr. Karp's 5 S's. We were truly amazed and delighted how quickly Dr. Karp's methods made a difference with our 3-week-old daughter - it was practically immediate. And being tired, sleep-deprived new parents, we also were glad to find the book very easy to read and understand. The book provides great insight into what your baby wants and needs to be happy. And a happy baby makes for happy parents. With Dr. Karp's invaluable help, we learned to successfully manage our daughter's colic, gain confidence as parents and, perhaps most importantly, enjoy our new baby.

It took me about ten minutes to figure out how to bundle my baby and it worked. IT REALLY WORKED! That was the moment when my night-time troubles with my newborn ended. The mistake I made was waiting to read the book until AFTER my baby was born.Buy this book. Read it, practice its techniques (get the DVD if you can - it was great too).

Our infant started his bout with colic at day 14 and he was unreal. We sat and just stared at him with amazement - we could not believe what a terror he turned into. He would scream, turn bright red, not eat, no sleeping- just screaming. NOTHING would pacify him... until we read this book. We followed every step and it worked like magic. Our bout with colic kept improving every day and now there is very little crying and our son is 3 months old. However, he still struggles with sleeping through the night, so we're tackling that problem currently. But nothing will be as challenging as those days with colic. This book is the only reason my husband and I are still alive and made it through that time.

Ever since I started swaddling my son in the \\"swaddle me\\", he started sleeping through the whole entire night at about 9 weeks old (He was able to free himself from the square blanket). He has continued to sleep through the evening and he is 23 weeks old. I highly recommend this practice for all new babies!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"However, I agree with a couple of the other reviews that the book did not need to be as long as Karp made it. While I don't agree that the information could be put in a pamphlet b/c the details he provides for how the 5 Ss work are important, not everyone is as intersted in the why. If that's your issue too, skip to about page 90 or so. That being said, I have given this book as a shower gift twice now (along with extra long receiving blankets for swaddling).

I read a whole bunch of different baby-care books, each with differing views. Who was I to believe? I was at my wit's end. I just wasn't sure about Karp's methodology. No one I knew had used his methods, and they seemed so strange. I was worried that Dr. Karp's methods would coddle the baby too much, and that she would get &quot;hooked&quot; on the 5 S's. But I was desperate, so I decided to trust Karp completely and use his methods.Thank heavens I did! It saved us in those first few months. I worried endlessly about her sleeping in a swing until she was 3 months old. Would she develop neck problems? Would she have to sleep in a swing until she went to college? No, she's just fine. Just as Karp predicted, we were able to wean her off of it gradually by 4 months. Reflux caused major problems for her, so we had to swaddle her until she was 6 months old (the key: get a BIG square blanket, and swaddle very tightly). I worried that swaddling her would slow her development. It didn't. In fact, it HELPED her development because she could finally sleep.Karp's methods stopped working when she was about 6 months old, but by that age we could feel comfortable using Jodi Mindell's sleep training methods to teach her to comfort herself. Now she's 10-months old, she sleeps through the night (as she has since she was about 4 or 5 months old), and she's right on track developmentally. In fact, my daughter is LITERALLY known at her daycare center as the happiest baby in her class!Trust Dr. Karp. He knows babies. He respects babies. His methods are a bit unorthodox, but they work. Besides, it's only for a few months. You and your baby will both be happier for it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I wanted to urge any new moms or even experienced moms to get this book. My third child became colicky at 6 weeks and we followed the directions and they really did the trick. I also should mention that after three weeks of using the techniques I noticed that the book suggested that if you are formula feeding a child with the powder formula to try and just use the liquid. Well we tried and our baby calmed down considerably in three days of using no powder just liquid formula. Now using the techniques of calming a baby are that much easier! Our baby sleeps more soundly and she sleeps longer. This is a wonderful book and very helpful for the new mother or an experienced one who would like an easier way to calm down one's baby! I also suggest buying the fisher price aquarium cradle swing-worth it's weight in gold. The babyslumber.com website has great swaddling blankets if you can't do a good swaddle. They are wonderful with the white noise machine I bought. My baby is waking up only once during the night now and she is only two months old. I wrote this review to save some other mother out there some frustration and a chance to really enjoy her baby!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's book was wonderful, as was the video which gave us a very useful visual reference. We followed Dr. Karp's instructions and swaddled our daughter, and she slept soundly for up to 9 HOURS at a time even in the first few months. I would recommend this book and video to anyone who is having trouble gettting their infant to sleep. Also, Dr. Karp has been kind enough to personally respond to email questions we had. I was amazed and more than pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Count me among the throngs who found this book immensely helpful. I learned fast that a parent needs a big repertoire of baby-soothing techniques, and Karp's five are always among the go-to moves to help our baby calm down.Karp's notion that colic is essentially cultural is interesting, but his reasoning has some big gaps and is based on some sweping generalizations. And in any case, I personally hope to raise a child that understands and fits into our culture. His \\"fourth trimester\\" model similarly is compelling but doesn't support the weight of a whole parenting philosophy.No matter; the book's real value is in the techniques. Our baby never cared for tight swaddling, but the other four techniques work like a charm. You do need a whole range of modalities to be of much comfort to a fussy baby, and reading Karp's book alone might leave one a bit unprepared, but his techniques pretty much always get fast results.Amazingly, Karp doesn't push a position on attachment or scheduling. Maybe that's why he leaves out holding and carrying the baby, which is among the few points of agreement among pediatricians regarding modalities that reduce colicky crying. I'd say the book is better for it, and in any case one should read more than one source. But his techniques are the missing link for soothing an infant, and he gives enough detail to help any parent make them work."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I asked for this book for my shower because a lot of moms on a discussion forum I read raved about it. Just a few pages into it, I wondered if there was really any need to read the entire book. The other mommies assured me it was worth it.I am not convinced.There is absolutley nothing in this book that is in any way a breakthrough in the area of baby care. Swaddling, swinging, shushing, sucking, and stomach positioning to calm a baby are all as old as the hills. Some of these have fallen in and out of fashion at one point or another, but none of these tips are so unique that they can't be found as helpful suggestions in other parenting guides or by asking older parents... (I can't even begin to count the number of times my mother or father has suggested I calm my extremely fussy baby by &quot;Try putting him on his belly&quot; or &quot;Why don't you give him a binky?&quot;)This book suffers from a number of flaws.1. I can't even begin to say how irritated I am that the author claims to have found a &quot;new&quot; way to calm fussy babies.2. This book would be nice as a PAMPHLET handed out at the hospital to new parents... it should NOT be a book. My original impression that this book is extremely repetitive was correct. It's not so much that none of these methods work, it's just that all can be explained very quickly. It does not take a full length book. Luckily, I read this book before my baby got here - any parent already dealing with a fussy or colicky baby would be at their wits end trying to read this entire book. (Therein lies the irony of childcare help books... those who need them the most don't have the time or ability to read them!!!)3. The methods do NOT work for all babies and despite Karp's claim that colic does not even exist in some cultures due to parents using his methods... Colic does NOT always respond to these methods. Living with my baby was agony for the first few months. It didn't matter what I tried - days and evenings were horrible. Anyone who claims to have a cure for colic has clearly never really dealt with colic! What seemed to matter more to my baby was the clock... once 11pm hit, swaddled and nursed, he would sleep well at night. Between 6am and 11pm, though, it didn't matter WHAT I tried, he was fussy and needed to be held and nursed constantly. I could nolt put him down no matter what I tried. There was no magic &quot;off switch,&quot; despite Karp's claims.In short, this book was a waste of my time. Skim it in a bookstore if you wish, but do not spend your money.In response to others claims that babies can become hooked on the methods in this book... I don't think this is a serious issue. We swaddled at night until my baby was big and strong enough to weasle his way out of his wrappings, no matter how many diaper pins I tried to fasten him with. Once he was too big to swaddle, he had no problems sleeping at night. (I mean, at 4 1/2 months he has yet to sleep through the night, but he sleeps no differently unswaddled than swaddled...)Maybe some babies require the calming methods a little longer than others, but sooner or later they should all outgrow them... I hope!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read this book while still pregnant and have found it to be very effective. My parents (who raised three babies of their own) were stunned when I showed them how I could \\"switch off\\" my son's crying so easily.Although most of the S's are very easy to implement, I almost gave up on the main one, swaddling, because the swaddling technique shown in the book and the DVD is tricky and my son could bust out of it almost from birth - and he was a small baby. Also, he screamed and kicked when he could see that swaddle coming. I thought \\"ok - so he hates swaddling\\" and tried to put him down witnout a swaddle but no dice! He HATED just being on his back for even a minute. It was sleep on me or sleep in a swaddle but it took 5-6 tries to get the swaddle on and he'd usually break out of it within an hour or two. I felt like I was caught in a terrible \\"hates being swaddled but needs to be swaddled\\" catch-22. I thought about giving up and just letting him sleep on his stomach (like we all did) but knew I'd ever sleep with him on his stomach for fear of SIDS. So, I went through almost all the swaddler products on the market trying to find one I could get him into without a terrible struggle and that he couldn't escape from. I think the one that works best depends on the baby - the Halo was probably the best for us. However, none of the products worked perfectly for our needs (keeping those arms down, blanket away from face, plenty of room to kick the feet without breaking the swaddle).In the end, I watched a bunch of YouTube swaddling instructional videos and developed my own escape proof swaddle wrap using just a blanket again. I recommend trying a \\"bat wing\\" configuration to keep those little arms in place. It works really well for us and after getting used to it my baby now lies pretty still and lets me swaddle him! Sometimes he starts to fall asleep as soon as I finish up swaddling him. I never, ever thought that would happen! So, if you can't get the DUDU method in the book to work for you - don't give up. Just keep trying and develop your own swaddle if you have a really little Houdini like I do! It is so worth it.Oh, final tip is that I give the baby his pacifier while swaddling but not until he starts to fuss. That really seems to calm him down and stop him from resisting!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"If you are pregnant or know someone who is pregnant you have to get this book. I got this book right after I had my daughter and I liked it so much I give it as a gift to everyone I know who is pregnant. It is especially helpful if you haven't previously been a parent or if you had a child but had a really hard time with the beginning months. I had no clue what I was doing (even though I took a class about it) and my daughter cried a lot. This book saved me from the loony bin. It really helps you understand why your baby is crying even though you think you have met all the baby's needs. It helps you understand what to do to sooth the baby and keep them happy. You read about other peoples' stories in the book and you don't feel so inept and when you just want the facts, skip the stories. This book really helped me make a happy baby and be a happy mom."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Yes, these \\"5S\\" method works. No, you don't have to buy the book.Swaddle is the most important \\"S\\". I heard different opinions about swaddling when I was pregnant. My mom also mentioned that she wrapped me tight when I was a newborn. I just cannot believe a baby will feel comfortable in that way. We didn't swaddle our baby from day one and she was a happy baby for the first 3 weeks. Then, all the sudden, she woke up at night as soon as her back touched the mattress. We tried to find out why. We changed the nipples on the bottle. I found out I had overative letdown. I changed our feeding method. We though she had too much gas. We did tummy message, pressure point message, changed diet, fed her gripe water and gas relief drop...Every time, we thought we got the problem solved, but she was still crying through the night, and exhausted, sleeping through the day. I remembered my friend recommended this book to me. I read it and tried it. I didn't even have a big enough blanket to wrap my 6-week old baby. I just hold her really tight to hold the blanket together. Amazing thing happened. She was quiet down and started closing her eyes when I rocked her.This is not a reference book that you need to keep at your book shelf. If you believe these methods and willing to try anyways, you can find the information all over the Internet. The book spends more than half of its length to prove these method work. After you know what to do, you just need to practice."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This was the best purchase we made for ourselves as new parents. The most wonderful aspect of this book is that it is GREAT for FATHERS. New mothers are busy feeding and changing, and given that my husband read the book as well, I would hand our daughter over to him to \\"shush her down\\" based on Karp's advice in the book. It was GREAT that he had one thing HE could do, (swaddle, swing and shush her down to sleep)-- and it made for a happy, secure little baby who slept beautifully from day 10!Good luck new parents -- follow this book exactly and you wont regret it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read this book while pregnant with my son anytime he was fussy I would use some of the 5 S's and melt down avoided."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"\\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" DVD has proven to be the best tool we have to educate our male and female clients on how to best calm their crying babies.The day it came, a couple came in for their scheduled appointment and when they mentioned the problem with a chronic crying baby, I opened the DVD and asked them if they wanted to be the first to see it. They were enthusiastic and both commented on wishing they had known about this training a long time ago."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My baby was born on 6-20. I read this book a few months ago and remembered most of what was taught. I also recommend the video - since many of the techniques really need to be seen to learn properly. The hospital was pro-swaddling which also helped. Even if every one of the 5S's don't work, you will want techniques to calm your baby quickly. I felt if I didn't read this book I would be absolutely lost! A crying baby can drive you slightly mad. The swaddling, shusshing and sucking on pinky work best for my baby. The turn on the side and jiggle also work.Essential reading for the new parent. I was skeptical. Now I am a believer.If you have changed his/her diaper, fed him/her, she/he is not cold/too hot the next steps are the cuddle cure."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My baby hates to be swaddled. She loves to sleep with her arms up in the air. When we do swaddle her tightly (with velcro blankies even) she somehow manages to wriggle at least one of her arms out. Maybe she is double jointed... Anyway, as mush as she hates having her arms down, the techniques in this book work like a charm. She will fight me the whole time getting wrapped up, but as soon as she's wrapped tight and I start the jiggling and shushing she immediately calms and falls asleep. It's as if I hit some sort of reset switch.My only criticism of the book is that Karp has way too much repetition of stuff that you really only need to read once, He hits us over the head reminding us that some cultures don't have colicky babies. That's great, but when it's 2AM and little cherub is screaming at the top of her lungs, I just want to know how to make her stop. It took me three days to even get through this short book because of all the extra verbiage."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My neighbor recommended this book to me while I was pregnant and I bought it that night. I had it memorized by the time I delivered and was putting the five S's to work as soon as my daughter was put in my arms. It has worked ever since. She calms right down with her cuddle combo. We still swaddle her at night (she is 10 weeks) even though she my fight it. She settles down as soon as we wrap the last flap and tuck it behind her. She also loves the swinging. She has started to sleep 7+ hours at night at 6 weeks. I really do have a happy baby because this book gave me the confidence to handle her everyday. I may not know why she is upset but I know how to settle her down and have from day one.

Since my 1st child wasn't colicky, the screaming fits I was experiencing with my 2nd was all new to me.I tried the 5 S's 1 night after enduring 2 weeks of screaming fits and I was amazed at the results. My son went from a clenched screaming monster to a sleeping angel within 5 minutes. I could not believe it. Not only can we now eat dinner without the stress of a screaming infant, but he has also started sleeping better at night by using the techniques at bedtime.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that has a fussy or colicky baby - it will change your baby in a matter of minutes.This book has been so useful I have told everyone I know about it & recommend it without hesitationTHANK YOU DR KARP!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The advice in this book is priceless, however, you could ask your pediatrician about the five S's and s/he'll tell you them and you won't have to pay for the book or take the time to read it! I read the book because my baby cried for 2-3 hours before bed each night. After implementing the five S's, he no longer cries and cries at night. It really has made him a happier baby and a happy baby = happy parents.

From day one my son would non- stop cry every day ALL DAY LONG!! We had purchased a snuggle nest and with it came a free happiest baby on the block dvd. We casually put it in and it changed our lives forever. Harvey Karp is a genius. I really mean that. The technique he tells you to use works EVERY time. No kidding! It not only helped my son calm down within seconds, sleep longer, and keep his reflux under control, it made me feel like the best mother in the world! It is also a neat trick for people to watch a zen- like calm come over your red faced colicky infant who has been crying for hours. And it happens within seconds. This book taught me so much about my son and his veiw of the world, which I didnt really think about until I read it.

It kind of worked, but I knew I needed to buy the book and really understand Dr. Karp's philosophy. We are now the proud parents of a well rested 4 month old who still enjoys a nice tight swaddle and the hum of his vaporizer. He takes two or three 2-hour naps and sleeps 10-11 hours at night.

(As a first time mother with a 1 week old baby, I had precious short term memory.) This book was recommended to me by a lactation consultant but I forgot to order it until I read an article referencing this book about 2 months later. My baby is not a fussy or colicky baby which is largely who this book is directed towards. However, there is a lot of good information to help you understand babies and why they cry and most importantly, how to soothe them. Dr. Karp's techniques work. My problem was getting my baby to sleep in longer stretches at night. Had I have read this book when my baby was a week or two old, I would have saved myself two months of stress and exhaustion. I gave up swaddling Brenna too early. Dr. Karp recommends swaddling for a much longer time. Brenna woke every two hours to feed at night which wore me out. When Brenna was two months old - and I finished the book - I began swaddling her at night, she immediately began sleeping thru the night, occasionally waking up for only one feeding!!! This was a life saver as I returned to work when she was 9 weeks old. This book is a quick read and is very well written.

These techniques helped us for about 8 weeks (which is when most babies are their most fussy)--after that we found our baby was too big for swaddling, but had gotten to the point where he didn't need it. We did have a hard time finding blankets large enough to properly swaddle so we tried many different \\"swaddling\\" blankets and the only one that is worth anything is the magic blanket--works wonderful and baby won't kick or squirm out.I've recommended this book to everyone with a new infant-because those first two months are the worst-this book makes it so much better!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book absolutely saved our lives...without a doubt!!!

After trying everything I read this book about utilizing the \\"five S's\\" and discovered that the method works. The only difficult aspect is trying to swing the baby for long periods of time. This tends to lead to pulled arm muscles if the baby is very fussy.

It probably could be about 5 pages long, and the rest of it contains a lot of anecdotes, trying to persuade you that the techniques really work, plus wacky theories about evolution and why the techniques work. Some I assume are supposed to be funny, like the \\"story\\" of the cave woman watching a pterodactyl taking care of its babies. I also felt that the tone was somewhat condescending.However, the techniques really do work (at least they did for me) and that makes it worth it.If you want something that is scientifically accurate about brain development, I recommend \\"What's Going On In There?\\" by Lise Eliot.What's Going on in There? : How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of LifeIt's not exactly light reading, but really interesting and not dumbed-down like this book.

My husband and I used the techniques on this DVD with our daughter when she turned 1 month.

We also love the Miracle Blanket that we purchased through amazon.com as well."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My three-week-old son had a horrible feeding problem--whenever he'd latch onto the breast, he'd immediately pop off and start screaming. He'd wriggle and stretch and groan and barely get in any actual eating. I didn't know what to do! I had incidentally been reading this book on suggestion of a friend for his other fussiness (not colic, just fuss). While I'd swaddled initially, I'd abandoned it early on due to my son's extraordinary length. So I tried it again, only swaddling his arms very tightly, and tried him at the breast. All of a sudden he ate like a dream. If I remove the bundling and try to get him to eat, he goes right back to his old ways. This book solved my son's eating problem when I was already ready to give up breastfeeding.I think the concept of the \\"Missing Fourth Trimester\\" is invaluable to EVERY parent. Even if your baby isn't colicky, even if he isn't fussy, I think the emulation of the womb for the first three months of life is essential for all babies. If my son gets upset, all I have to do is swaddle him, put him on my chest, jiggle and shush and he's asleep within seconds. I feel like I'm selling something, but this is a real holistic approach to the reason some babies just seem to reject the world. It really helped me and I feel it really helped my son!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a good book with some great ideas but the testimonials get to be a little too much.

I highly recommend it if you can get passed what (John and Jenn) did for (Amelia) every three pages."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The positives: A most worthwhile guide to comforting crying babies and their frantic parents! I have accidentally discovered many of Dr. Karp's suggestions while soothing many infants over many years, so I think his approach is sound and effective.A few negatives: The book is a little too precious and wordy for my tastes, and the information could be organized and summarized MUCH better. It would be a struggle for a tired, desperate parent to get to the heart of his ideas, so take notes of key points as you read, and you've got a gold mine!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My niece told me about this book when she had her first baby a few years ago. I couldn't believe my eyes when the baby would fuss and cry and she was able to calm him down with the methods discussed in the book. I read the book and found that it is wonderful to help get through those times when you just don't know what to do to stop a cranky baby and ease them into sleep and quiet time.

I was very sad by it, first as other people have said it is mostly common sense but he also advocates the use of a pacifier, never once mentioned the calming effects of breastfeeding or wearing your baby.

That was difficult because it is incredibly repetitive. I don't need to be told something multiple times. He could tell you everything once and this book would be much more useful and only 10 pages long. I already knew the basics and thought this book would enlighten me. It didn't. It bored me. And, as it turned out, my son wasn't a crier so the information in it was completely useless to me. If you already have a colicky infant and have tried everything else, you might consider this book but otherwise, I'd save yourself some money and avoid it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is the best book for the first three months.

I hate this book!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is really good for calming a crying baby, but not very useful for sleeping--our baby (now 3 1/2 months) cried when we put her down to sleep even when we used the 5 Ss, until she was about 2 months old and had learned to calm herself. I also found his reasoning regarding the &quot;fourth trimester&quot; a little ridiculous so as to be disregarded. I didn't like his seeming praise of tribal cultures where women breastfeed 100 times a day or babies are continually held 24 hours a day for the first year--that might be what babies want, but that is a completely unrealistic, and dare I say unhealthy, expectation for new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It feels that the book could be summarized in 1 chapter only. The writer keeps on repeating the same ideas again, again and again (5S techniques). Also, she presents some irrelevant examples just to extend the length of the book. Better be able to read fast, while baby is crying.Besides, all the tips in the book are only good for up to 3 months baby... title of the book must be changed accordingly.I am puzzled with the strictly positive feedback appearing first in the review webpage, and I honestly question their validity.On a positive note, the description of the 5S techniques is effective and detailed, and very helpful for new parents. Although I am hesitant to use the 2 S (Side / Stomach position sleep for the baby), as I read that stomach position sleeping might be fatal for baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Really repetitive! Plus, who wants to be rocking a baby hard and/or shhhhing out loud? You have to be really fit and rested, plus you need a high lung capacity not to faint after two long and loud shhhhhs!!! Then your baby gets used to it and you'll be rocking a 22 pound baby/todller!!! Give me a break.The swaddling is ok for the first months, but the rest...And being a physician he should not explore wrong concepts like the babies cry in the end of the day and if it was colic they should cry the whole day long: if they had pain they would cry more towards the end of the day because we have a circadian rythm to our production of steroids (our natural antiinflammatories AND painkillers), so it is expected that any pain and/or inflammation gets worse towards the end of the day, when that production is at its lowest.I recommend Tracy Hogg's Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. Very humanitarian approach and feasible in the long run.I bought this for my second baby who is a month old because my first was very fussy.

Take it from the world's most clueless first-time mom, me. It is common sense to Shhh, and swaddle and rock.A waste of time because he has about 5 points to make that take him way too many pages to get out. SO MUCH REPETITION of junk like how other cultures keep their babies swaddled and close for months, blah, blah, blah. Maybe it was interesting the first time he said it but by the 12th time, it was old and my baby was still fussing. And despite what anyone says, you can't wear your baby in a pouch and wash bottles at the same time.Plus, what he leaves out is that you can do the technique and it will calm your baby...for like a minute or two! Then, you have to keep rocking/shhhing, etc. for hours on end, unless your baby, like mine, gets wise to your ways and refuses to be distracted for long.As for advice, well, the vacuum worked OK but mostly it's a grin and bear it kind of thing and your baby will grow out of it. Mine did. Oh, and also don't believe him when he discards gastrointestinal problems as the cause of the fussing. My baby was allergic to milk proteins and soy, even though he did fine on regular formula for the 1st 2 weeks of his life. It took about a month on Nutramigen for him to stop being a monster and become just high-maintenance!

Some good tips (like how to properly swaddle your baby), but certainly not worth buying or reading the WHOLE book for.Does not really encourage any healthy parenting styles, only how to shut them up when you dont want them crying. I guess this book may be ok for colicky babies, but unless you have a crying issue, I recommend you purchase \\"secrets of the baby whisperer\\" or \\"babywise 1\\" for a healthy parenting approach (a balance somewhere between demand feeding & schedule feeding).

Once our little bundle of joy arrived, I thought HBOTB provided the most helpful, practical solution for sleep problems. (Also liked Baby Wise's overall advice re: sleeping and eating, but took some of the specifics with a grain of salt.) (Don't get me started on how Baby Whisperer caused me to obsess to the point of tears trying to follow the \\"EASY\\" schedule -- my fault for relying on it too much, but it just did not work for us at all.)Having skimmed some of the negative reviews, I agree there is a lot of padding in the book, but to me, that just comes with the territory of these types of books. It doesn't diminish the effectiveness of these methods.Our little one is 19 months now. She was never, ever a \\"natural\\" at falling asleep (particularly for naps). Due in large part to these methods (and I will also add a plug for the SwaddleMe brand swaddler--a lifesaver), it became easier and easier to put her down for naps and bedtimes. In fact, she slept for 7 hours straight beginning at 4 weeks, and 11 hours straight at 6 weeks. 12-hour nights came shortly thereafter. Part of that is due to her easy-going temperament and lack of health issues, but it was also thanks in large part to Dr. Karp's words of wisdom."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has great advice!

Great book, great advise, and for us, it worked."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Yes, you may be a parent who ends up with a perfect, quiet, charming infant who sleeps through everything and coos when he/she is awake. Many of us aren't so lucky, though. And if you're in the latter group, you MUST get this book. (Better yet, get the dvd. Who has time to read with an infant? And mom, dad, even grandma, etc can watch at the same time.)There's no pretense here. No philosophizing. Karp explains simply that for many babies, they struggle through the \\"4th trimester\\" and need the extra comforts that you can give them. (This is not just preemies or kids who had trouble in the womb or getting delivered. Could be any baby. Any.) He tells you EXACTLY what to do and how to do it. And IT WORKS.Our son was an angel until we hit the 3-week mark. Then boom, suddenly he was crying whenever he wasn't sleeping or eating. Constant crying. Killing-every-last-nerve-at-the-top-of-his-lungs crying. After returning from my first trip to the store and finding my husband in pieces because my son had screamed for the whole 3 hours that I'd been gone, we remembered that someone had recommended that I buy the HBOTB dvd. In desperation, we pulled it out and watched. We shushed and swaddled and rocked the baby exactly as shown/explained.1) Again, it works...2) ...but it may take some time to get it right. The right angle to hold the baby. The right way to swaddle. (We used the Anais + Aden (or whatever they're called) gauze wraps but later, we also used the swaddle-me velcro types. Both work great.) The right shushing sound...3) ...which for us, turned out to be a hairdryer. Stunning. It worked so well that we put them in every room. I even packed one in the diaper bag from time to time. (I worry that I hurt his hearing or brain or something b/c we used it so often, but I figure that crying 16 hrs a day couldn't be healthy either.)4) And last thing: if you find yourself in the situation where these techniques are needed, Karp's book lets you know that no, you did not do anything wrong. You are not to blame, and you are not bad parents. The person who lucked out with the perfect infant angel is not a better mom or dad who is more capable than you. Simply, your baby needs the comfort and you have the ability to provide it. He gives you confidence and hope (which is hard to find when you're feeling so desperate for yourself and so sad and concerned for your child).IMO, this is a great thing to have even before you have a kid (whether it's your first or 14th) because the techniques can be used even for the perfect angels. But if you're reading this because you're at wit's end and wondering what you're doing wrong... this book/dvd is probably your answer.Good luck to those who are going through this. Our son grew out of it around the 4 mos mark and has been that perfect, nary-a-meltdown kid ever since. I often feel like it's earned having spent so many days and nights swaddled baby in one arm and hairdryer in the other. I have no idea how we would have gotten through those months without HBOTB."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As first time parents the tips in this book/dvd helped us immensely with our newborn baby.

I'm a new mother with a 7 week old that has been fussy since day 1. We were trying everything and I was starting to feel as miserable as my son sounded. I read this book (through one of the nights my son had me up) and the next day I used the 5 s's for the first time. I was able to get a bath, some lunch and some relaxation time in for me - for the first time in weeks! I feel like the book paid for itself with that first day of use. Since then I can calm the fussies within a minute or less during the day and the technique works great for getting him settled for the night.If you are going to get expectant parents any gift, this is the one. Dr. Karp is sensible and gives real advice that a parent can use. His directions are easy to understand, which is critical for those of us functioning with tired brains from no sleep.Dr. Karp deserves a big hug for writing such a great book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book saved me! This is the only book that thoroughly addresses sleep and comforting fussy babies during the first three or four months. Most books offer only a cursory discussion, and little helpful advice. Dr. Karp gives helpful tips, whether you co-sleep or put your baby into a crib at night. His tone is completely non judgmental; he doesn't make you feel like a bad parent for not wanting to carry your baby around all day - an impossibility for a mom of twins.I bought this book 2 days ago. One of my 2 1/2 month old twins was sleeping through the night, the other was up every 1 or 2 hours. After following the suggestions in this book, especially swaddling, my poor sleeper slept from 11 to 2 the first night, and went right back down after she was swaddled again at 2 - without a snack! Last night she went until 4:30, and again went right down until 6, without eating or fussing. I am a new woman! I will be giving this book to all my newly pregnant friends."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Review by Dr Tobin, Author of The Parent's Problem Solver: One of the most frustrating things for me as a pediatrician, is not to be able to offer my patients solid solutions. When a mother would come to my office with a colicky baby, I could reassure her nothing was wrong with the baby and I could offer her my support. But I didn't have a solution---until now! Thank you, Dr Karp, I truly appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A must read for all new parents. Our colicky newborn son quickly pointed out who was going to be boss in our family. My husband and I read all of the &quot;colicky baby bibles&quot; to no avail until we followed Dr. Karps instructions. His mix of sound, movement and swaddling stopped our baby in the middle of a crying fit. The best part was the following day when I performed the same mix and heeded the same result. It literally changed my life to be able to calm him down in minutes instead of over an hour. We will forever be thankful and only hope others share this monumental break through."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"For a very long time there has been a need for a book like this. It is not the &quot;Ferber method&quot; of doing things, that leave mothers with a churning gut and a heavy heart but a vey intrinsic way of connecting with and &quot;wombing&quot; your baby. It speaks on levels throughout the ages of women who did things that came natural to their indigenous roots. Dr. Karp very naturally brought this all together in a well written and lovely book. It is witty, clever, and so easy to read. Any frustrated parent who can't get their baby soothed will know the tools of satisfaction after reading this book. Every now and then we do need a recipe and you will find it here. A wonderful group of priceless information that will comfort your baby and get them to sleep. You can't help but be the happiest parents after all."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It's interesting reading all of these posts, and I'm happy that these methods worked for so many people. However, they did NOT work for us. My second son is now 10 months and he's delightful. However, he screamed all the time until he was 4 months old. When I read Dr. Karp's book I was sure that I could make life easier for the baby, but he resisted all of the &quot;S's.&quot; He hated being swaddled and still hates being pinned in or down, meaning that he hates the carseat and always hated the swing and the infant carrier. He rolled over at 3 months and started to crawl at 5 months. Saying &quot;SSHH&quot; to him? HA!! That just angered him more. Seeing how active he is now and how much he loves to communicate with us through sounds and gestures, I can understand how difficult infancy was for him. I appreciate the idea of the 4th trimester, but I wish that there was some indication in the book that some babies, quite typical and even wonderful ones, will resist these methods. I'm writing this post for those parents at the end of their ropes -- hang in there. If the baby is crying a lot, as long as you're doing all you can, just know that things will eventually improve on their own!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a pediatrician, this is one book I often recommend to parents at their first visit. Once you already have a sleeping problem with your child, it's too late, or at least harder to fix. The advice is practical and easy to follow. It's not gospel though, it may not work with every child and you may want to read more than one book. One problem with swaddling though is learning when to stop. Our child fought being swaddled, but wouldn't sleep unless we did it. It gets hard trying to swaddle a 9 month old."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It's great, he explains why (in his opinion and studies) the 4 S's work.

The content of the book was good. I enjoyed reading it and feel like it gave me a lot of ideas and prepared me for soothing a baby. However, it did not translate well to the Kindle. Almost every page had some sort of typo. I could usually puzzle the word out in context but it made it harder to read. Other Kindle books I've bought have been perfect. There's no reason for this to have so many errors and that's why I rated it just 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Never in a million years do you think that sweet baby you brought home from the hospital is going to cry all night, and all day, and every hour in between. Never do you think they will HATE their bouncy seat, or the swing, or the bassinet. But if you are blessed to have one of these \\"high needs\\" children as Dr. Sears (highly recommend as well!) calls them, then this book will help bring sanity and sleep back into your home. It was a lifesaver with our sweet boy. I will say though not to have unrealistic expectations. Most of these \\"high needs\\" kids are just that. Once they hit about 6 months the fussiness will start to go away as it is replaced by curious wonder and need for stimulation. This will never be the baby that you can plop down in the bouncy seat for an hour while you make dinner. So get a sling or an Ergo, wear your baby, and enjoy every stage of amazement and wonder."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Every mother should own this book!

I used to read this book in the passenger seat while my husband would drive around town to calm my first newborn down...that was the only peaceful time I could get some reading in!! Nothing seemed to stop him from crying after 6pm...until I read this book and did what it said!! I have many friends who have tried this approach and all have had success. This book is worth the money:)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My first child was apparently able to soothe herself well. My newborn - not so much. About 2 weeks old he started crying and kicking in the late evening for no reason, I ordered this book. We already swaddled but didn't know any of the rest. At first we didn't have the white noise loud enough, then a few days later I cranked it up and my baby fell asleep in minutes, no screaming, no fussing...nothing! Maybe some of the people displeased with this book aren't applying the techniques right? Now, he sleeps great, not all night but at least there's no fight and no tears.I like the 1st part of the book that explains the reason the methods work. I'm the kind of person who needs to know 'why?' or I won't do it. I loved the whole book and even some of it is repetative but that helps drill it into your head, otherwise I wouldn't have known I had the white noise too quiet.My oldest loved being swaddled. It makes sense that babies need a transition period. Any help I can get to help them adjust to the new surroundings is welcome! You cannot spoil a newborn- a 4 yr old is another story...."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am a first time parent and although my baby is not due for another 2 months, I decided to pick up this book based upon a friend's recommendation and high ratings. Dr. Karp's theory of \\"The Missing 4th Trimester\\" as explanation for colicky babies makes good sense. His approach is developmentally-appropriate and I can see how the soothing combination of any number of the \\"Five S's\\" would work to calm fussy newborns. Some reviewers have complained that Dr. Karp does not provide any way of transitioning your young baby away from the five S's, but I did not find this to be the case. He provides a brief timeline of when and how to \\"ween\\" your baby off of the five S's, and also explains why they are important to ween (e.g., weening baby from swaddling will teach them how to self-sooth and put themselves to sleep, etc.), as well as signs of readiness parents can look for.My husband is also reading this book, and we are looking forward to having these \\"tools\\" tucked away to use with out daughter in a couple of short months!So BOTTOM LINE--buy this book and read it before baby arrives--especially if you are a first time parent! It has made me feel a little more prepared and the thought of caring for the strange little creatures we call newborns a little less daunting."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The information in the book is easy to follow, has solid logic backing the information, and helps adults understand the needs of a newborn during the \\"4th trimester.\\" I would definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book contains simple, essential sanity information for the new parent.

The book only applies to babies 3 months and under, but it's a lifesaver.The concepts aren't wild and there are not 200+ pages of instructions to follow. Karp is a bit wordy, but he gets the point across and provides some theory and general support for why his ideas work. You could get the same thing from a 10 page pamphlet, but without the explanation, you would miss the details (which are critical) and you probably wouldn't believe enough of it to give it a try."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is only effective until the baby is ~2-3 months old.

Check out the DVD first."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a quick read and a good reminder of the things a new parent needs to know to get a newborn to sleep. Despite the claims of some of the more disparaging reviewers of this book, many parenting classes (mine included) do not teach you how to swaddle, or teach you all five of the methods Dr. Karp outlines. Yes, it's a fairly easy concept to grasp -- swaddle, shush, swing, side, suck -- so you can get through the book quite quickly if you want to. What I found most valuable was the reminder to use all five together. My newborn has needed all five at once to get to sleep, although in no particular order, so having the reminder that there are 5 S's to run through was the most valuable takeaway from this book.That said, Dr. Karp, like many other parenting book writers, overstates the effectiveness of his methods. Again and again throughout, he cites examples of the miracle cure that happens when you apply his method to a fussy baby for the first time. Nothing is a miracle cure -- this certainly isn't. When my baby is overtired, no dose of the 5 S's will get her to sleep sometimes. So Karp's tone can grate, and the book does often read as a bit of puffery for his practice. Dipping in and out, and avoiding the examples in the boxes, helps to avoid having to read his fluff. The book also works best in conjunction with other books on sleep (e.g., The 90-Minute Sleep Program): read them for advice on setting a routine, making sure the baby gets enough sleep, etc., and use Karp to actually get your newborn to sleep.Overall, I feel four stars are warranted for putting together all 5 techniques. The swaddling demonstration alone is worth the price of the book (the nurses at our hospital were extremely perfunctory when I asked them to demonstrate how to swaddle, and it was hard to learn a tight swaddle from them, so I referred to this book instead). Get this book for the basics and ignore the rest. Master them, then pass the book along to other new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's methods work very well and within almost seconds.

The 5 S's: swaddling, side/stomach position, shhh sounds, swinging and sucking. I wish that I'd had this book when my daughter was born (now 2)...but am soooooo pleased to have this information in time for her new baby brother! I can remember times when I tried swaddling alone, or shh sounds alone, or swinging and shhh sounds, etc...but never did I put them all together to create the magic cocktail of Soothed Baby. My daughter refused to take a paci when she was screamie and inconsolable...and now I know why. Another reviewer said that every new parent should get this book at the hospital, and I agree. It's an easy, quick read. It's inexpensive. And it just may be the most valuable resource an exhausted and overwhelmed new parent can have.

The suggestions are rooted in what has worked for centuries, but what we seem to have strayed away from -- basic comfort methods, such as swaddling, shhh'ing, swaying/rocking, and back patting.

THANKS Dr KARP!!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We received this book as a shower gift and read it before the baby was born. Well, she turned out to be the \\"perfect\\" baby - rarely cried, went down to sleep easily, very calm. We still used the techniques in the book to help her sleep, and they were useful when she occasionally became fussy. Although she wasn't much of a crier, it was lifesaving to have useful techniques when she did get upset.Then, about four weeks into her life, she was TRANSFORMED. We suddenly had a red-faced, shrieking, colicky baby on our hands and egg on our faces after how much we'd talked about how lucky we were with our \\"easy\\" baby. We started to use Dr. Karp's method constantly, and WOW. It calms her within minutes - she goes from shrill screaming to calm like magic.A recommendation with respect to swaddling blankets: we made some out of old t-shirt-material jersey sheets (no need to hem this type of material) after she outgrew her Swaddleme. It turns out the homemade swaddling blankets work better than the Swaddleme! They have a little stretch to them, so it's easy to get them tight enough. They actually stay on all night (whereas our wiggly baby would get her hands out of the Swaddleme most nights). Don't bother with receiving blankets (too small) or fancy baby blankets (most aren't square, which is necessary)."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I highly recommend this book as well as \\"The Happiest Toddler on the Block\\" (see my review) to all parents. I've read several baby books and Dr. Karp's is by far the most insightful and helpful.He refers to the first three months of an infants life as the fourth trimester, explaining that babies aren't really \\"ready\\" to be born yet. That is why the 5 S's work so well, because they ease the transition from the womb into the world.While this book is mostly about calming your fussy baby, I found a lot of other helpful and reassuring information in it as well. For example, he addresses sleep patterns, the importance of holding and bonding with your baby, advice for exhausted new parents, etc.I can't say enough positive about Dr. Karp. I would give this book six stars if I could. His approach is so loving and helps you keep your sense of humor!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great book! I recommend the DVD b/c it is quicker to get through especially with a colicky baby...who has time to read?! But the book has a bit more information than the DVD.

Although I tried to put him on a schedule he just wouldn't sleep during the day, and he'd only sleep for a few hours at night. When I tried to lay him down for a nap he would shriek, as if in pain. Many of my friends ended up putting there babies on there stomachs to sleep but I just didn't want to do that. The only way he would sleep for an extended period of time was if he was in the swing, but I felt guilty for letting him sleep in the swing, as if I was getting him addicted to something. Last night after reading some of this book I swaddled him, put on a cd of ocean sounds and put him in his swing, he slept for 8 hours (he's 7.5 weeks old). He's also been taking naps between feeding for the first time! I don't worry that he'll be addicted to the swing(because I know he's in the 4th trimester as explained in the book) and I'm now able to do housework and spend time with my husband.

I learned early on in my first pregnancy that there is WAY TOO MUCH information out there and if you read long enough (books, blogs, mags, etc) you'll find both an author who agrees completely with you and an author who is at total odds with you. Sanity came for me when I allowed myself to remember that I am a fairly intelligent person and that I should trust more of my own judgement and instinct - even if this was our first child. Anyway, this book, to me, just made sense. The author talks about a \\"4th trimester\\" during which your newborn adjusts to his new surroundings. Compare the environment a newborn leaves when he's born: a loud, motion filled, warm and very snug home listening to Mom all day long - to what he's usually delivered in to (especially a first child): a quiet, still, very open environment. How would you react to such a drastic change! :) If nothing else, learn the way to properly swaddle - I promise you will be glad you did.

My son was fussy and would cry in the early evening every night. I tried the methods described in this book (the 5 S's) and he would calm down right away. I found that swaddeling him at night with a snug swaddle (I use the kiddopotamus swaddle me blanket which worked like a charm-Kiddopotamus & Co 100% Cotton Knit SwaddleMe Circle Bear - Small)and he was sleeping through the night at 2.5 months. This book is wonderful. I appreciated the author's perspective that you can not spoil an infant and embracing the idea of the \\"4th trimester\\" did the trick to calm him down.

I highly recommend this route, as new parents--are you going to read that much?? We really struggled with our newborn at the end of 2009. He cried all the time, constantly needed to be held, didn't sleep much..the life of new parents. My husband and I were on the brink of crazy when I ordered this.Magical. Wonderful. Amazing. Of course, it's all common sense...but when you are sleep deprived and walking around like zombies, that all goes through the window. We noticed a huge difference in our baby's demeanor when we used all 5 of the S's. We would swaddle him, but him in the swing and pop on the white noise, and he slept like a dream. I took the one track of the heartbeat in the womb and looped it on my ipod and played that for a couple hours each night for him to fall asleep.I don't have anything bad to say about this.

Our baby is fussy in the early evenings and the techniques in this book have made a huge difference. It can be a little long-winded but I think that is because the author is making every effort to get the reader's buy-in. That said, there are some excellent job aids that distill the techniques excellently.As I said in the title, this will make a great shower gift. Every parent should have a copy."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"All I can say is that this works! Being new parents(baby born 1/1/2011), we were skeptical of just how this would work. After a few sleepless nights and not knowing why our daughter was still crying after being changed, fully fed, and obviously tired, we thought about this book that was recommended by a few nurses we know. Our baby slept for 5 and half hours the first time we used Dr. Karp's 5 S's. It is not a radical ideology, just swaddle and sway essentially. We loved the book and got the DVD as well. I enjoyed this Dr's approach to parenting and that the first 3 months we should think of new little ones as fetuses. This is a great little book with helpful insights in calming fussy babies. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The negative reviews of this book largely focus on the simplicity of this method, and claim that it's common sense. Obviously babies like to be bounced, and shushed, and swaddled, and whatever the other two S's stand for.However, having just spent a week with a newborn and his attentive, empathetic and intelligent parents, I have to attest that the specific technique in this book is not in fact common sense. Using these techniques you sometimes do the opposite of what feels natural.For example- the parents I was visiting, when trying to quiet their infant, shushed and murmured quietly to him, the way you would speak to an older child to calm them. The baby kept wailing. But having read Dr. Karp's suggestions, I took the baby, put my cheek to his cheek, and made a LOUD shushing noise, louder than the baby's own cries, close to the baby's ear. It worked like a charm- he not only stopped crying immediately but his eyes got this dazed, dreamy look. It continued to work every time he was fussy all week, unless he needed to be fed or changed.It's not magic- I would say stimulating the 'calming reflex' lasted for about 2 to 5 minutes on this particular baby. If he still had gas pains or discomfort he started crying again, and I had to do the wrap, bounce, shushing sequence again. But it's still a significant benefit- if it takes 45 minutes to put the baby down, using this technique that time will be spent with a calm and soothed baby as opposed to a squalling one. You still have to put your energy and attention into keeping the baby calm, but you're happier and the baby's happier while it's happening.I will say that I don't think the swaddling technique in this book is the best. It's more complicated than it needs to be- there are plenty of simple and effective swaddling techniques on youtube."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I just recieved the book yesterday and by the end of the day i was done reading it.

Film buff's will love it.There are some very interesting and surprising anecdotes concerning the restoration of some of our favorite films: the restoration of the &quot;snails and oysters&quot; scene in SPARTACUS, needed to be re-recorded since the original dialogue track was lost. Tony Curtis recorded his lines in Los Angeles, while Anthony Hopkins recorded the late Lawrence Olivier's lines in London! Stanley Kubrick re-directed the scene by fax!

Nevermind that ARPANET was at that time a toddler and what they call \\"structured programming\\" only barely resembles the accepted definition.While these particular errors do not relate directly to the relative merits of the usability advice this book offers, they do illustrate a careless quality in the research.

The actual content is not particularly useful either. Instead of giving practical, real-world advice, it spends too much time waxing strong about a stupid model called &quot;scenario-based development,&quot; as I remember. This is basically the common-sense and annoying pet theory of the authors.Finally, the examples and interface illustrations in the book seemed so out of date for a book copyrighted in 2002.

Plain Jane Smith decides to overhaul her life - ditch her dull name and job as an accountant and go out on the limb and become a columnist at a local weekly rag.Jane adopts the name Stella and immediately gets in over her head. Stella begins receiving letters from the lovelorn - and one letter in particular touches her heart (as well as her psychic senses). Looking for Lochinvar wants to find a love to die for - something that Stella would like to find as well. Stella (and Jane for that matter) also has a penchant for sexy lingerie and goes to her favorite shop Little Nothings to celebrate her new job. Then she has a vision of death and the next day her favorite designer goes missing.Not only does sexy Detective Stokowski think she did it but the list of suspects contains way too many of her friends and neighbors. Did Stella do it during one of her &quot;fits&quot; or is someone trying to frame her?Not only is Christine's writing style quick, playful and fun (as are the characters) but the plot moves well and is enjoyable.

The following chapters represent an attempt to formulate psychological principals in terms of conduct or behavior.The authors believe that this functional point of view in psychology offers a helpful perspective upon the problems of classroom teaching, explaining many of the phenomena with which every teacher must deal, and which, unexplained, tend to irritate and confuse; and providing at least a few guiding principles that may be directly applied to the solution of troublesome problems in instruction and management.It is hoped that the book may prove useful to the large numbers of young men and young women who each year enter the service of the public schools. It has, indeed, been written with a distinct recognition of the immaturty and inexperience which these beginning teachers represent. Every effort has been made to select the topics that are most closely related to the work of teaching; to treat these topics concretely, enforcing each principle with a wealth of illustration drawn partly from classroom practice, and partly from the affairs of everyday life; and to simplify the terminology, without, at the same time, sacrificing accuracy of statement."},{"Title":"My Life in Three Acts","review":"Helen Hayes (1900-93), the \\"First Lady of American Theatre\\", is one of only 12 people to have ever won the quadruple crown - an Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony. In her case, she was the first woman to achieve this status and she ran up a total of 7 - 2 Oscars (\\"Airport\\", \\"The Sin of Madelon Claudet\\"), 2 Tonys (\\"Happy Birthday\\", \\"Joan of Lorraine\\"), 1 Special Tony Award, and 1 each for an Emmy (\\"Harriet Beecher Stowe\\") and a Grammy. Her life was more devoted to the stage, and hence most readers will not have seen this work, but she managed 50+ performances on TV and 20+ films. My favorite Hayes performance was from \\"Anastasia\\" (1956).\\"My Life in 3 Acts\\" is the third of Hayes' recollections and was published just 2 years before her death. It is a fairly superficial account of her personal life and a mere accounting of her stage and film appearances. There is little depth and no appendix with a list of her performances, as so many of these celebrity biographies contain. On the positive side, the book is well written and makes for an easy read.Here are a few of Hayes' comments about her collaborators over the years -* John Barrymore - \\"America's great actor [had ] a tempestuous personality\\"* Ethel Barrymore - \\"an actress of great beauty, dignity, and warmth\\"* Joan Crawford - \\"a vulnerable insecure woman behind the tough mask...not quite rational in her raising of children.\\"* Lewis Stone - \\"a fine actor\\"* John Ford - \\"as celebrated for the extraordinary number of great films he turned out as he was notorious for his drinking.\\"* Marion Davies - \\"warm, effervescent, and very generous...a gifted comedienne at her best in light romantic comedies\\"* Charlies Chaplin - \\"an incomparable comedian on screen, he as funny in real life [but] could be an awful bore\\"* Frank Borzage - \\"had a wonderful for intimacy: he knew how to get inside an actor's heart and mind, and that rapport gives a special glow to his films.\\"* Louella Parsons & Hedda Hopper - \\"these two women were tough, mean monarchs, reigning over the movie colony with their viper tongues.\\"* Booth Tarkington - \\"a likable, unusual man. He used to drink a lot but got control of his habit before it destroyed his health and writing career.\\"* Clifford Odets - \\"the most appalling guest, a crashing bore\\"* F. Scott Fitzgerald - \\"used alcohol as a stimulus until it became a stumbling block.\\"* Anatole Litvak - \\"a tough taskmaster, though he did turn out good films.\\"* Lee Strasberg - \\"one of the founders of the Actors Studio, which I blame for many of the things wrong with the American theatre then and now.\\"* Richard Burton - \\"cared only for himself...he felt deficient because of his blemished skin.\\"* Kim Stanley - \\"was gifted and she drove herself mercilessly to discover \`the dramatic truth' of whatever character she portrayed.\\"* Maurice Evans - \\"Almost singlehandedly he made Shakespeare popular with the American public.\\"* Dean Martin - \\"was a dedicated professional.\\"In summary, this is a well written easy to read book, but it is relatively superficial with regard to Hayes' personal and professional life."},{"Title":"My Life in Three Acts","review":"For more than fifty years, Helen Hayes has been a star on stage, screen, and television. In that time, she crossed paths with some of Broadway's most famous stars: Charlie Chaplin, Scott Fitzgerald, Gloria Swanson, and many more. As for being acclaimed First Lady of the American Theater, Hayes starred in her first play when she was just six years old. My Life In Three Acts tells about Hayes's hit play, such as Victoria Reigna, and about some of her not so respected plays. In her autobiography, Hayes speaks with wit and wisdom on topics that are both public and private. She expresses her thoughts on World War Two, and about the assassination of Kennedy. She reflects on the mournful parts of her life: the death of her husband and daughter, and the alcoholism of those dear to her. Hayes also supplies amusing anecdotes about her friends, which include John Ford and Al Capone. After finishing her career as an actress, Hayes expresses her opinion on what is wrong with the American theater today, such as how porn theaters are taking over classic Broadway theaters.I found My Life In Three Acts to be inspiring by how Hayes improved her life everyday. Throughout Hayes's career, her life was rousing in every aspect. \\"George Tyler, (a movie producer,) once told me that I were only four inches taller, I could reach the heights too.\\" I liked this quote because I could tell that throughout Hayes' acting days, she was growing by exceeding heights and overcoming problems. Such as after a horrific event occurs in her family, Hayes finds a way to deal with the problem by taking sympathy from others, moving homes, and doing what she does best; act. Hayes was able to capture her emotions and to put them into words that made me feel like I was engaged in the experiences as well. For example, she wrote about a delightful childhood treat of hers that her grandmother used to prepare for her. \\"She would cut a hole in the orange, insert a peppermint stick, and then we'd squeeze the orange and suck the juice through the stick.\\" I felt as if I was enjoying the treat myself.The events Hayes encountered were very detailed and made My Life In Three Acts exciting. Some of my favorite parts of the book describe the stirring parties Hayes attended. \\"The people who sat around that table in the Algonquin Hotel's Rose Room set the style for New York, dictating what one should read, think, wear, eat, what plays to see, what opinions to have, and so on.\\" Not only did this quotation capture \`the style for New York,' but it also described the style of the kind of people that were at the parties and in Hayes's life. I thought that it was also exciting to hear about the different places Helen toured through throughout her career, from France to Oklahoma City. One time while touring, Hayes got ready for bed on the train and saw a breathtaking site; the stars in the night sky seemed close enough to touch, and the snow sparkled like diamonds. Hayes then rushed to tell the rest of the actors on the train, and they became enthralled too. This scene in the book demonstrated all of the simple things in Hayes's life that she appreciated and didn't take for granted. Everyday there seemed to be excitement in Hayes's life. Because of how inspired and excited I felt reading this book, I can defiantly call it an engrossing memoir that is able to take a reader back to stimulating theater life in the mid-1900's."},{"Title":"My Life in Three Acts","review":"Helen Hayes whose life story would be fascinating to all fans of Broadway and/or Hollywood pretty much squanders this effort by traducing a large assortment of individuals. What makes this badmouthing all the more unpleasant is the fact that most of her targets were deceased at the time of its publication and unable to present their side of the story.While the recurring instances of charcter assasination are the book's biggest liability, the First Lady of the American Theater also comes off as somewhat self-centered and shallow.Those who respect the many noble actions which typified Helen Hayes' final decades will be disappointed and likely disturbed by this autobiography that does not do her memory justice."},{"Title":"Zambia (Lonely Planet Zambia)","review":"As any world traveler will tell you, Lonely Planet Guides are the best.

But at the same time, it is an introduction to that debate, and has great relevance to theocratic tendencies in American science and government today.I became interested in reading after reading Stephen Hawking's &quot;Brief History of Time&quot;. It was interesting to me that even so reknowned and path-breaking a scientist as Hawking is still promoting belief in god. Even the &quot;scientific&quot; community is subject to religious superstition.Written in 1908, in the demoralizing aftermath of the defeated 1905 Russian revolution - the book powerfully upholds Marxist materialism and refutes the idealist wavering of some so-called &quot;Marxists&quot; and scientists of the day, showing the inherent self-contradictory nature of idealism and the reactionary conclusions it leads to."},{"Title":"Materialism and empirio-criticism","review":"\\"Materialism and Empirio-Criticism\\" must be the most boring work ever written. My sympathies go to the poor Czarist censor-bureaucrat who had to sift through this book before it was published. I tried to read it three times, but never managed to do the same. (I suspect the censor was cheating, too.)In a way, however, I also empathize with the author, V.I. Lenin himself. (The book is actually Lenin's philosophical magnum opus.) \\"Materialism and Empirio-Criticism\\" is an attack on the philosophy of Mach, Avenarius and some of their epigones. It can hardly be denied that the empirio-criticists were full of crap. Lenin must have felt a great amount of frustration when attempting to prove that, really guys, there is such a thing as a mind-independent world. The Machists had great trouble explaining where the mind-dependent world might have been before the emergence of humans. Was the world dependent for its existence on the mind of an ichtyosaurus, a worm, or what? And what if humanity would disappear? Would the world disappear with it? Et cetera. Poor Nikolai Lenin, being forced to argue such trivial points with a bunch of ivory tower intellectuals. I suppose he later got his revenge - and his own censors!Still, those parts of the work I somehow managed to read, contain obvious contradictions. Lenin regards dialectical materialism as absolutely true, and opposed to both metaphysics and relativism. According to dialectical materialism, there is such a thing as absolute truth somewhere \\"out there\\". Humans can never fully grasp this absolute truth (presumably because humans are finite). What they can do, however, is to constantly come closer and closer to it. With this sleight of hand, Lenin solves the contradiction between abstract metaphysics and pure relativism.But how does Lenin know that materialism is true, if humans can never reach the absolute truth? Obviously, he doesn't. Yet, he vehemently insists on materialism actually being absolutely true. A regular atheist would presumably point to science as proof of the materialist pudding. But Lenin doesn't. Quite the contrary: he sharply rebukes science for not understanding the dialectical method. Thus, the absolute truth of Lenin's particular version of materialism is *not* based on scientific exploration. Therefore, it can only be based on philosophical speculation - i.e. metaphysics. Yet, Lenin claims to have rejected metaphysics! At one point, he calls dialectics a \\"method\\", but on what is this method based? How does the Bolshevik leader know that this \\"method\\" is the true method? After all, the scientists (including Mach) disagrees with it. Once again, it must be derived from metaphysical speculation. Which, of course, it is. Every child knows that the idea comes from Hegel.When looking through \\"Materialism and empirio-criticism\\", I sometimes found myself wondering who Lenin really saw as his main opponent. On the surface, it's Mach, Avenarius and their epigones in both Germany and Russia. On a somewhat deeper level, the book is actually a factional document. Lenin was incensed at those Russian Marxists (including some Bolsheviks) who accepted empirio-criticism. He believed that a consistent revolutionary line must be based on dialectical materialism. Empirio-criticism was reactionary, bourgeois, etc.However, it seems that Lenin had another and even deeper opponent as well. He considered Machism to be a form of subjective idealism. In its crypto- or pseudo-sollipsist form, idealism is (of course) crackpot. The only consistent way to defend subjective idealism is to claim that the subject is eternal.And that's what we call God.V.I. Lenin knew this very well. Indeed, one of his main objections to idealism - perhaps *the* major objection - is that it opens the door to \\"fideism\\", by which Lenin meant \\"clericalism\\". That is, organized religion. In order to appease the Czarist censors, Lenin replaced the loaded word \\"clericalism\\" with the more neutral-sounding \\"fideism\\", but he is obviously having religion in general in mind, not just specific clericalism. At the time, there was a pro-religious group even within Bolshevism itself, the \\"God-builders\\" around Lunacharsky.The real point of \\"Materialism and empirio-criticism\\" is therefore to weed out religion. In Lenin's mind, idealism (at least subjective idealism) is on a slippery slope to a religious worldview, and for that reason every concession to Machism or Neo-Kantianism is philosophically pernicious.I can't recommend this book. Only a sense of duty can carry the reader through \\"Materialism and empirio-criticism\\". The Book of Mormon and the Pauline epistles are (arguably) more exciting.Fideism, anyone?"},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"If his own principles had been applied to the book it could be reduced to a a few bullet points.*the web is slow, less is more.*tell people what a link leads too before they press it, and make sure it does.*use standard fonts in easy to read colours.*use standard web conventions where ever possible as they are familiar.*check for spelling mistakes and grammar errors.*write concisely and arrange depth of detail in hierarchies, like they do in errr reference books.*tell the user where they are, and how they got their, um like a path prehaps.*some people have small screens, some don't even use microsoft browsers, not everyone has the latest plug ins, allow for it.*don't employ frustrated artists to design your site, use an engineer.Jakob proudly states he has multiple patents in the field of usability, maybe following this book will infringe them, or maybe he just kept the good stuff for himself."},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"As a Web site designer, I've long been an advocate of JakobNielsen's ideas -- to an extent. Usability is arguably the mostimportant aspect of any design project, and an aspect too often ignored by many software and Web site designers.Mr. Nielsen, in his book, very aptly points out typical errors and common stumbling blocks of interface design, and presents very convincing arguments and methods for solving these problems. However, strict adherence to Mr. Nielsen's interface design techniques, at the expense of less easily measured human factors, will often result in a sterile and boring product. Both are eminently efficient and usable, but are also wonderful examples of visual blandness -- nearly devoid of the human and aesthetic factors that contributes to a depth of personality and a richness of sensory stimulation.Although Mr. Nielsen never specifically advocates this, the logical conclusion of his approach is an interface design whose personality and soul have been stripped away in a slavish preference for pure, unencumbered efficiency and usability. Contrary to Mr. Nielsen's examples, the quest for usability should not abrogate the need to avoid ugliness.For the sake of efficient usability, I wonder if Mr. Nielsen has replaced his impractical, hard-to-maintain backyard lawn with efficient asphalt paving. Or maybe pulled out his expensive, hard-to-clean, dirt collecting, living room carpet and replaced it with an efficient concrete floor. I'm joking of course, but even if Mr. Nielson thinks this way, most do not. Yet, this is the result achieved by many of his user interface examples.Perhaps on the planet Vulcan where everyone thinks like Mr. Spock, Mr. Nielsen's conclusions and methods might be the eminently rational final word on good interface design. But on Earth the value of his conclusions and usability tests must be weighed against the somewhat hard-to-measure and difficult-to-quantify factors of illogical human personality and perception.Although Mr. Nielsen's observations, conclusions and suggestions continue to be very valuable in helping to pull interface design towards much needed greater usability and functionality, his mistake seems to be that this is all he sees as being important.Cory Maylett"},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"If your specialty is the user interface, you need to read this book. If you are interested in developing a user interface design process, you should read this. If you are a software developer who wants to know how to build good interfaces, skip it. It is too much about perfecting the design process.I was looking for 'use this button for x and this widget for y'. In other words, here are the rules for a good user interface. What I got was 'here is the process for studying users and their interfaces, and here is a mountain of statistics to back it up'. No fault of the author, I just mis-understood what I was getting.Having said that, if you want to make your living studying and perfecting interface design, read this book."},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"I've read some of the criticisms of this book - its wordy, hard to read, etc. I have to say I don't agree. Whenever people ask me to recommend books on software usability, this is always one of the top 5 that I suggest.Its a textbook, not a novel, and it has all the advantages (precise, scientific language) and all the drawbacks of a textbook (dry, dense).However, there isn't any better source on things like how to put together a usability test, how to cost justify usability in the overall design process, or even simply, what the usability process is all about. You can't be serious about software usability if you haven't read this book!And while Jakob's book &quot;Designing Web Usability&quot; is more popular, to me, this one is the better book."},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"Although Neilsen has a lot of good information in here, the information is hidden beneath layers of writing. Every point is repeated several times, and the author is incredibly wordy. As a professional writer, it astounds me that someone could go on about usability without having the faintest idea of how to make his own writing usable. If edited properly, this volume could be reduced to half the size and give exactly the same information. The passive voice just about slaughters this book. One gets the impression that the author thinks he must write in this boring, textbook style in order to be considered &quot;The Book&quot; in the industry. This is unfortunate, because many readers simply won't make it through this book, despite the important information it has to impart."},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"This book is not perfect, but some of the critique is a bit too harsh. The book is not verbose, it is just user friendly =). I mean, really, the book is a breeze to read, it is clear and not once was I unsure about anything it said. There is only a little more than 250 pages of actual text to read. Then there are excercises which I found helpful. Then there's a long list of references, which some people may find helpful when trying to find more information.The most incredible part of the book, in my opinion, is the chapter on inexpensive usability engineering methods, that can easily be adapted by small companies without large budgets. They are really worth reading the book!I believe everyone who wants a career in UI design should read this book first, before proceeding further. Those who are not usability engineers per se, will get all they need from this book (about interface-design), the UI pros will probably want to read other material too, but this is the place to start.I would give 4.5 stars if possible. The book is not perfect. But I gave 5 stars to help the average rise a bit... ...hopefully."},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"If you are an experienced user interface designer who thoroughly understands what usability is about you probably don't need to read the book (although I would find it strange that you are experienced and did not read this book which is attributed to have coined the term &quot;Usability Engineering&quot;).So who should read the book. Everybody that is going to develop any form of software. No, it won't make you an expert, but it will get you thinking.On the negative side, some of the examples may some be slightly old (but its a 1993 book!). Sometimes you're also going to feel that you could stress this concept in half the space. However, the information and the thought process behind the information is extremely relevant and is well-worth the effort of reading the book.If you are new in software development this book is an absolute must. In a sense it helps you develop &quot;a way of thinking&quot; rather than giving any specifics.However, if you are looking for specifics, Chapter 5 deals with usability heuristics, presenting 10 of them. When looking at the list of 10 heuristics, they may seem obvious, trivial almost. It is quite amazing, however, how often those seemingly trivial things are overlooked or ignored. Just use some programs on your PC...I think it would be worthwhile any software developers time to read Chapter 5 and think long and hard about what is said - then go back to your software and be honest with yourself. It might be some of the best lessons you'll ever learn.In lots of ways this book has everything that classics are made of - except occasionally the ease of reading."},{"Title":"Usability Engineering (Interactive Technologies)","review":"One of the best ways I judge whether a book is useful for me or not, is to look through the Table of Contents.

It is a good description of this book. In page 115 it says: &quot;User interfaces should be simplified as much as possible,...&quot;. And then it takes almost 8 pages to explain it. Read it. His advices are pure gold. But don't build your user interface like this book was built: overcrowded with unnecessary details. There's another funny thing about this book.

Knowing the actual time that a task takes is essential to making a realistic bid.Bid too high and you wont win the business.Bid too low and you lose money. This happens way too often by people who are overly optimistic and do not figure in all the effort that will really be used.With data on what other people take, combined with your own metrics (you do keep records of what you do and how long it takes dont you?) you can maximise your profit while minimising your risk.Undercut the greedy competitors by being realistic and still making a good profit. Let the low-ballers lose their shirts while you bid high enough to make a fair profit.This book is also good as a benchmark to see how your productivity stacks up. If you can do things faster then you have more profit potential. If you take longer than others you know where you need to improve your processes so you can make more money.Bob Brenner has done the hard work of gathering and sorting all this data. (See his other related books too!) He is well respected in the industry. His accompanying explanations and other information enhance the usefulness of the raw numbers and help you get the most from this information.If you are in this business you need this book.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"CHERNEVOG","review":"Cherryh is one of my favorite authors, but this book disappointed me. As a folk tale, or combination of many folk tales, it was interesting, and the exotic, tsarist Russian location was very appealing. I liked the way the author brought together many magical beasts and beings, most of which would be unknown to a Western reader. However, the characters spend too much time arguing, worrying, and talking at each other about their anxieties, and they never really get around to interacting. The theme seemed to be something to do with &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; but the lesson was lost in the confusion. The bad guys weren't so much evil as conflicted characters, and even they spent a lot of time justifying their actions and feelings to the others. In short, there was just too much talk! Most folk tales have good and evil and the line between them is broad and obvious; but in this book, everyone seemed to be on the same side. It made the story plodding and not much fun to read. I'm not sure whether Cherryh was trying to write a different kind of fairy tale, or had some other target in mind, but she didn't make it work."},{"Title":"CHERNEVOG","review":"Cherryh sets the book in old Russia and explores the old admonition, &quot;Be careful what you wish for. You may get it.&quot; The characters spend much time worrying over unintended consequences of disturbing nature and run afoul of situations and villains as a result. Their indecision is often painful to them and readers alike. The characters are well developed and the story interesting. My only regret is that I can read faster than she writes."},{"Title":"CHERNEVOG","review":"Chernevog, Rusalka, and Yvengie are the greatest books. I enjoyed the atmosphere. An old-time russian fairy-tale. This series pulled together bits of all folklore I know, and even taught me some things I wasn't aware of. The characters are likeable, even the truely evil ones. You can imagine where they are coming from and why it is they are acting like they are. Perhaps it is a bit predictable, but it's a fairy-tale."},{"Title":"CHERNEVOG","review":"I read this book when I was in fifth grade... I just now found it because I had forgotten the name... I mean that was quite a few years ago. This book had made an impression, for the longest time I've tried to remember the title, I kept thinking it was Cherevnog so I'd do searches with it... but my search would come up empty. Finally after nearly 15 yrs I found the book that had caught and kept my attention at such a young age. This was the first and only fantasy novel I had ever read and it captivated me. Great book a MUST read, I will be purchasing a copy for my library."},{"Title":"CHERNEVOG","review":"Good but not great. Better than Rusalka, because it enters the story with the characters more fully defined and fleshes out the relevant backstory and cosmology more. It also begins with the characters is a higher state of stability and happiness and then brings them crashing down threatened with utter ruin, which works in a classic dramatic sense. This is the way to make this kind of scenario play out, and shows Jim Butcher quite fully as the third rate hack he is by comparison. Nevertheless, as the series proceeds some of the appeal thorugh deconstruction of Western fairy tales and horror elements wears off somewhat, and the final arc somehow lacks the full urgency implicit to the scenario.Worse than: Finity's End by C. J. CherryhBetter than: Rusalka by C. J. Cherryh"},{"Title":"CHERNEVOG","review":"I had read tripoint, and so bought this book since I had liked the other one. I found chernevog to be virtually unreadable. Perhaps that is why it is out of print, even though she is a popular author. It was boring, and really didnt make much sense. Once in a while it seemes she had a potential plot, or the seeming villian might get interesting, but the she ababndons even that. Skip this one, try tripoint, or stuff in that world."},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"In this volume Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky gathered together 35 authoritative papers that demonstrate through well-designed experiments and through observation the hard-wired biases and heuristics that influence (or define) the way humans go about making choices when the outcomes are from certain.There are a raft of biases, and just one example is the Anchoring Effect. If you asked 100 people to guess the population of Turkey, what you'd probably get is a wide range of answers. If you broke the question into two parts: first by asking whether the population is higher or lower than 14 million - and then by asking the respondents to guess the population - you'd find that the answers would gravitate around our arbitrary 14 million mark.The Heuristics we use to weigh up and evaluate data provide a second family of biases. Here, the human brain is shown to go about problem evaluation along certain pathways and shortcuts, and the route we take tends to define where we'll emerge. By way of example, we tend to give undue weight to highly retrievable or available data: and treat this as representative. So in the wake of Katrina, you or I would be fairly excused for judging 2005 as a particularly bad year for global weather-related disasters. In probability, 2005 was not particularly unusual on a global scale.This volume is an important collection of papers, with relevance to anyone working in fields where decision-making is at the core. You might be in market research, medicine, social sciences, economics or other fields: this book contains material of direct relevance to your work. The conclusions from the papers range from disturbing (the judgments of professional medical and psychological experts, we see, can be alarmingly biased!) through to illuminating.Just as gamblers feel sure that after throwing six heads in a row, the coin is \\"overdue\\" to throw tails (as if coins have a memory) even professionals have an amazing propensity to run roughshod over their own understanding of probability.This book makes for serious reading and delivers good value. It makes an absorbing, more focused twin-volume with CHOICES, VALUES & FRAMES which I'd say, however, is a more important book that encompasses much of the thinking here. I've take a star off here because some papers are written not in plain English but rather in densely mathematical language. I work in statistics, but our English language is quite adequate for the task of telling the story, isn't it? For this reason readers of this volume will appreciate the incredibly readable, yet hugely informative, volume \\"The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making\\" by Scott Plous. I refer frequently to both these volumes and find both extremely useful."},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"Of course, my humble opinion relative to Nobel award committee will hold little intrinsic value, other than a layman's interpretation and application.An economist myself, I found this book very interesting and educational to read. Although the book is quite verbose, the fluidity and organization of the content facilitates a smooth read - not a bludgeoning of the mind.I found this book particularly applicable to research in market behavior, systemic analysis (because this book outlines the individuals and how they act within the system); even policy development (uncertainty).I would recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology, social psychology, economics, policy, and politics.Regards,Tyler Markowsky"},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"I've never seen better explanations of how probabilities should be calculated. And the book is fascinating -- especially what the authors describe about the results of surveys designed to reveal the most common mistakes people make when estimating probabilities."},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"Before seeing this collection, I had been excited by what I knew of these researchers' work in uncovering surprising aspects of human decision-making. And I was initially thrilled to be given this book as a gift. But at this point, though my opinion of their lifetime body of work is unchanged, there are other sources on the topic that I'd recommend first.Many of the chapters have a didactic, laborious tone. The various authors seem only partially aware of what one another are saying; material has a way of resurfacing in slightly modified form, making one unsure whether seeing a new finding or a restatement of an earlier one. The many lessons drawn, which individually often seem brilliant, never quite coalesce. I found material a little harder to retain than in other books on judgment and uncertainty.Three chapters that were especially lively and readable were Robyn Dawes' \\"The Robust Beauty of Improper Linear Models in Decision Making\\"; Baruch Fischhoff's piece on hindsight; and John Cohen et al.'s chapter on compound probability and sequential choices.I would recommend the collection as an important resource for a serious student of the topic. Others would probably learn more and derive more enjoyment from Daniel Gilbert's Stumbling on Happiness or from one of the non-technical books by Gerd Gigerenzer or Daniel Ariely."},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"...and especially for the non-thinking person! This book, a popular classic for the past 25 years, opened my eyes to the prevalence and scope of biases in our thinking. The authors take great care to identify and define biases using rigorous, scientific measurements. Their experiments to uncover various types of biases are as fascinating as the end results. There were many occasions when I remembered or referenced this book in the last two decades. I have also recommended this book many times to anyone who expressed even a whiff of interest in decision-making, the workings of the human mind, psychology, etc.In fact, I think an abbreviated version of this would be perfect at the high school level. Some of these experiments (or a carefully modified version of them) can be performed by high school students, and it would be invaluable in teaching them (a) how to design experiments to uncover even abstract and subjective thinking patterns, (b) the prevalence and scope of biases, and (c) the power of the scientific method in general.Our schools most likely will not follow my recommendation (probability = 0.98). So, if you have a child in junior year or older and is 'intellectual' in outlook, or has expressed any interest in philosophy, psychology, law, etc., I strongly recommend that you give this book as a gift."},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"The lessons here are so profound, so sweeping, and so upsetting that even progressive, radical and philanthopic movements generally only vaguely recognize them.With detailed studies, this book spells out real trouble for humankind, because it demonstrates that even experts -- in a variety of fields -- don't understand quite simple issues about probability and risk.Even as someone who spent years managing and running projects in a NASA research center, the incapacity wasn't apparent to me, because we invest too much faith in experts' mastery of their field, and not enough questioning the essential abilities that they found their opinions upon.Potentially one of the most important books ever written."},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"We read this book in our microeconomics and public policy class. What Kahnemann and Tversky add to the understanding of human bias and misjudgment is quintessential."},{"Title":"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases","review":"The essays contained in this book show convincingly that the standard decision theoretic model taught world wide since the mid 1940's,the subjective expected utility model based on the subjective approach to probability of Ramsey,De Finetti,and Savage,is not supported by the experimental evidence.The essays successfully show how the use of Prospect Theory accounts for the underweighting(subadditive-subproportional) and overweighting(superadditive-superproportional)of decision weights(non linear \\"probabilities\\").Three basic judgmental heuristic operations are preformed by decision makers in the real world.These operations are intuitive and based on the perceptions of the decision maker.The first heuristic that decision makers use in making probability evaluations is called representativeness.Judgments of probability are based on what is perceived as similar.The second heuristic is the availability heuristic.It,like the third heuristic,specifies that decision makers concentrate only on that evidence,upon which the probabilities will be estimated,that is most easily obtained or is immediately available.The third heuristic is called the anchoring heuristic.Decision makers use only that evidence that comes first.Tversky and Kahneman,as well as all of the other essay authors,argue that their experimental evidence demonstrates or shows that decision makers do not understand the mathematical laws of probability(additivity of probabilities,addition principle,multiplication principle,marginal probability,conditional probability,joint probability).They also do not understand basic statistical concepts(regression to the mean of a probability distribution). In 1921,in his A Treatise on Probability(TP),J M Keynes pointed out that the purely mathematical conception of probability was a very small subset of what he called the logical theory of probability.In order to apply the purely mathematical laws of probability correctly,a decision maker had to have a complete sample space of all possible outcomes specified in advance.An equivalent assumption is that the decision maker knows for certain what the particular probability distribution is.Secondly,probability preferences would have to be specified by a complete order that was linear or proportional.Any decision situation that did not satisfy these conditions had a weight of evidence less than one.Keynes specified a variable,w,called the weight of the evidence,that measured the completeness of the relevant,potential evidence that was available to the decision maker.It was defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,just like Ellsberg's rho variable that would serve as a measure of the ambiguity of the evidence.The existence of ambiguity automaticaly will lead to violations of the purely mathematical laws of probability.Contrary to Kahneman and Tversky,Ellsberg,like Keynes before him,argued that these calculations are not erroneous and the decision makers are not irrational or biased.The claims made by Tversky, Kahneman and their many followers(Shiller,for example),that the subjects in their experiments are probabilistically and statistically illiterate,makes no sense because the problems that are presented to the experimental subjects do not allow the subjects to unambiguously define a unique probability distribution or a complete sample space of all possible outcomes(some examples are the blue-green taxi cab problem,the rare Asian disease problem,the battlefield problem,the Linda-bankteller problem,and the lawyer-engineer problem).Let us now turn to the representativeness heuristic.The representativeness heuristic turns out to be none other than Keynes's degree of similarity or likeness or resemblance discussed by Keynes in chapter 3 and Part III of the TP.The anchoring and availability heuristics are identical to the statement that the weight of the evidence is less than 1 for a real world decision maker.Keynes showed that decision makers would usually be able to use interval estimates(upper-lower probabilities) only.You automatically will violate the mathematical laws of probability,which only hold in the limiting case where w=1,given linear probability preferences.Keynes also showed this in his examples of his conventional coefficient of weight and risk,c.The answers obtained when one applies the c coefficient will be sub and super additive.Keynes ,however,would argue that these are not biases or errors,but correct calculations obtained with incomplete information.The vast majority of decision makers are attempting to reason probabilistically without the benefit of knowing a unique probability distribution,a complete sample space,or being able to specify a complete order over all outcomes.They are rational.Tversky and Kahneman are requiring \\"SUPERRATIONALITY\\".Every calculation of a probability estimate that does not have a weight of 1 or violates Carnap's rule of total evidence will violate the mathematical laws of probability.L J Cohen,repeating Keynes's argument,spent 20 years trying to get this point across to Kahneman and Tversky in the journal Brain and Behavioral Science(1975-1994) .Tversky's support theory is a belated attempt to remedy their omission,but it has not been successfuly integrated into Prospect theory(1979)or Cumulative Prospect theory(1992),where the weighting function is still a function of a single variable representing probability,although additional parameters have been incorporated into the model.One could argue that it is Tversky and Kahneman who are irrationally insisting that decision makers use the mathematical laws of probability in situations where those laws are not applicable."},{"Title":"K.C.

Bomber (Tru North Mystery/Janet Mcclellan, 1)","review":"Characters come and go without making much of an impression or advancing the plot. The most intense part of the story - a chance sexual encounter in a lesbian bar - occurs in the third chapter. The reader should really dislike the bad guys and root for the good guys. There is an evil boss, but he's a cartoon character - utterly predictable, speaking dreadful dialogue. He gets his due &quot;off stage&quot; and not at the hands of our hero. The author invested little in the way of defining the bomber's actions, motivations, or pathology. The protagonist's love interests are neurotic, controlling women. This odd treatment - no definition of the antognist, pathological characters supporting the protagonist - left this reader with no sympathy for the hero or the outcome of the book. Rather than write an ending, the protagonist falls unconscious and it remains for minor characters to finish the story."},{"Title":"K.C.

However, \\"Self\\" is an essential masterpiece, and the others are high quality. Anyone wanting a sampler could do worse, but the essays are widely available in far more comprehensive compilations, and this is hard to justify unless one sees it for a good price.\\"Self\\" is Emerson's most famous essay and is rivaled only by \\"Concord Hymn\\" as his most famous work. It is also his masterpiece; one often hears - sometimes disparagingly - that Emerson tried to fit his whole philosophy into each essay, and this comes remarkably close. There is far more depth and subtlety here than the length suggests; one would be very hard-pressed to find another work so densely packed. The words are few, but the implications are enough for a lifetime. \\"Self\\" is a seminal masterwork; a founding Transcendentalist text and American Romantic cornerstone, it is central to American thought, culture, and literature. Anyone even remotely interested in any Americana aspect must be intimately familiar with it; aside from the Declaration of Independence and Constitution themselves, perhaps no other document is so vital to the American spirit.Reading \\"Self\\" is perhaps more necessary than ever - not only because it is eternally relevant but also because it is often misrepresented. The term \\"self-reliance\\" is now almost entirely political, almost synonymous with libertarianism, and the essay is frequently touted along such lines. However, these things are hardly more than implied here, and though the definition of \\"liberal\\" has greatly changed, it is important to remember that Emerson was one of his era's leading liberals. His prime meaning in any case is self-reliance intellectually and in everyday life. He urges us to trust ourselves, to recognize human divinity and avoid imitation. It is a simple message but all-important - and far easier said than done. Emerson explores all its ramifications - philosophical, practical, social, political, economic, etc. - and outlines all its benefits. The case is beyond convincing, but he can do no more than show us; the rest is up to us.This profoundly individualist message is another reason that reading \\"Self\\" is so necessary. Emerson now unfortunately has a reputation for being somewhat impenetrable and/or hopelessly impractical; this is a true shame, because he wrote for the masses. Unlike nearly all philosophers, he does not rely on jargon or polysyllables; he truly wanted to be understood, and all it takes is will. We must open our minds to him, and once we have, they will never be closed again.Though greatly revered with many and diverse followers, Emerson's intention was not to be loved but to inspire; he wanted all to find individual genius. His work is thus the truest and best kind of self-help manual, and \\"Self\\" is its apotheosis. It has inspired millions in the more than century and a half of its existence, including me. I have read thousands and thousands of works, but this is one of the handful that truly changed my life. Emerson's greatness always shines through, but reading him at the right time can make an astonishing difference. He was more popular in life with the young than the old, and I can easily see why. I was lucky to read him at just the right time, and \\"Self\\" spoke to me more powerfully than almost anything else ever has. Without hyperbole, I can say that I would not be doing what I am today and would have abandoned my goals and visions without reading \\"Self\\" and Thoreau's \\"Life without Principle\\" - a somewhat similar essay highly influenced by Emerson - when I did. I was wracked with self-doubt and getting nothing but indifference, bafflement, or hostility from others; these works gave just the kick I needed, and I will never look back. \\"Self\\" has the potential to be life-changing as almost nothing else does, and I highly recommend it to all; you can hardly be unaffected and may never be the same. However, I especially recommend it to the young; its importance to them - and Emerson's generally - simply cannot be overemphasized.Emerson is a signature American stylist, and \\"Self\\" is near his height. His writing is always memorable and often highly lyrical - about as close to poetry as prose can be. However, his essays were almost always painstakingly composed from lectures and journals, and the effect was sometimes choppy. An Emerson-loving professor of mine once joked that no one can find the topic sentence in an Emerson paragraph, and his transitions also frequently leave much to be desired. However, \\"Self\\" is near-seamless, a true masterpiece of style that flows smoothly and often waxes beautiful. This is all the more remarkable in that it was assembled even more than usual from disparate sources; entries that ended up here came as far as eight years apart, but the whole is admirably harmonious.\\"Self\\" is a preeminent example of how Emerson delights in paradox. Anyone who reads him closely sees that he is as complex as he is simple. Thus, despite - or perhaps even because of - apparent straight-forwardness, few texts are more ripe for deconstruction. \\"Self\\" fans after all love a text that tells us not to love texts, are inspired by a man who tells us not to be inspired by men, and are convinced by a text and man both of which tell us not to be convinced by either. But this is only the beginning. \\"Self\\" works because it tells us exactly what we want to hear and, in striking contrast to innumerable self-help books, does so in an intellectually and even aesthetically respectable way. This is fine for me and (hopefully) you but could of course be taken to heart by Hitler as easily as Gandhi. The thoroughly optimistic, mild-mannered, and physically frail Emerson may not have foreseen his revolutionary text being put to nefarious use and probably would have been unable to believe in even the possibility. However, the danger, if we choose to call it so, is very real. \\"Self\\" could easily have had the same effect that Nietzsche had on Nazis, and that it has not been taken up by anarchists, radical terrorists, and the like is perhaps mere luck. One at least wonders how it avoided preceding The Catcher in the Rye as the work synonymous with unsavory people. That said, it is likely unfair to Emerson to say he did not anticipate this; he after all takes his views to the logical conclusion. He surely saw it, and it may have given pause, but he persevered because he was faithful to his intuition just as he urges us to be to ours. He truly believed in self-reliance and was ready to stand by it no matter what befell - nay, thought it his only choice. His optimism must have told him that the doctrine would not be abused, and he has been right - so far. Only time will tell if this continues to hold, but \\"Self\\" remains essential for all.Though far less great and universal, \\"Manners\\" is one of Emerson's more historically interesting essays. It is essential to recall that his era perhaps emphasized manners more than any other in history; they had an importance of which we cannot even conceive. All had to deal with them regardless of personal views, but virtually all seemed to agree - or at least convinced others that they did. Thus, though it may initially seem somewhat surprising in light of Emerson's trademark liberalism and originality that he (begrudgingly) accepts some conventions, the small extent to which he did so is truly remarkable. The essay goes a little into various manners' pros and cons, but the core points are elsewhere. The first is that manners are relative; Emerson begins with some striking anthropological examples of this all-important fact and otherwise drives it home. An extension of his core self-reliance doctrine, the second is that the great make their own manners - and make others respect them. \\"Manners\\" is one of Emerson's least transcendental works - in any sense -, but comparing and contrasting its message to today's society and competing views can be instructive, and it is a valuable timepiece.\\"Friendship\\" is also very good - one of Emerson's most affecting and thought-provoking works. His view of the ubiquitous subject is unsurprisingly original and engaging. He believes that friendship can exist only with real equality and sees it as a sort of springboard to something higher. His demands are great, and the work is eye-opening in the sense that almost no one has a friend by his definition. Like his best work, \\"Friendship\\" can easily make us question beliefs and preconceptions - and perhaps even make us better friends.\\"Compensation\\" is one of Emerson's most representative essays. The staunch optimism so essential to his thought was perhaps never shown so clearly or thoroughly elsewhere. Emerson begins by saying he had wanted to write about compensation since he was a boy, and it shows in his enthusiasm. He works himself up almost to a rhapsody, giving example after example in clear, beautiful prose that remarkably never becomes dull and is often near-lyrical. The essay details Emerson's belief that everything balances out, even if we cannot see it, and that good and evil have their own earthly rewards despite appearances. He may not convince cynics, but his argument is certainly compelling, and his critiques of conventional Christianity and other traditions are very intriguing.\\"Nature\\" has many of Emerson's key concepts: nature's all-encompassing beauty and force, our place in regard to it, art's role, and of course deduction of God from nature. Some speculations are more philosophical, historical, or critical, but all lead to these basic points, which are Transcendentalism's cornerstones. Emerson's characteristically optimistic thought is here in full, as is his signature poetic prose.These essays are essential for anyone interested in Emerson, whether read here or elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Villa Fiorita","review":"An Englishwoman divorces her husband and leaves her children to go and live in Italy with a film director. This is an incredible and horrifying event to the two youngest children; their mother has always been shy, self-effacing, and self-sacrificing. Rebelling at the thought of watching helplessly while their home is torn apart, they concoct a plan to go to Italy and bring their mother home. However, when they confront her, with her new life and new love, unanticipated emotions and realizations surface, and the conclusion is not what was expected. This is a thought-provoking novel that explores marriage, divorce, and family life with wit and sensitivity."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Villa Fiorita","review":"The Battle of the Villa Fiortia is truly a book that was a joy to read. The plot does start out rather rocky, and at times, it it difficult to distinguish between a character's flashback and the present events. As the book progresses, the children of the story reveal just how deeply their mother's marriage to a film director is affecting them. Set in rural Italy, it's a very exotic setting, which contributes to the intrigue of the story. Humorous at times, very dramatic at others, the mood of this book is excellent. There are many instances of symbolism throughout the book, each presented clearly yet subtly. Toward the end of the book, I was beginning to realize how a divorce can affect a family, and how it can hurt the children more than the adults. Like the children of the Villa Fiortia, I was horrified, startled, and angered at the adults' immature decisions, and I was entertained by the children's insufferable &quot;battle plans.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Battle of the Villa Fiorita","review":"When a proper Englishwoman leaves her husband and children and goes off to Italy with her film director lover, the two children manage to get themselves to Italy all by themselves with the plan of bringing their mother back home.

It's so well-written, witty and charming, but it's also heartbreakingly sensitive.Read it."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Villa Fiorita","review":"One of Goden's strengths is that her characters sometimes do the unthinkable but quite credibly, and another is her portrayal of the incredible pain of adolescence. Both shine in &quot;Fiorita&quot;. I always enjoy her descriptions of English families discovering Europe and the life lessons they learn, and the young heroine of this book is very appealing. Godden is a convert to Catholicism and her dislike of divorce is particularly evident in this novel, yet she depicts sympathetically the force of romance in a middle-class existence."},{"Title":"Charles Ives: A Portrait","review":"Thinking that the passage of a year, from Wooldridge's 1974 \\"From the Steeples and Mountains\\" to this 1975 \\"Charles Ives: A Portrait,\\" might have been sufficient time for the author to have corrected a few of his more outrageous claims, I acquired this edition too. It is in fact the same book, photolithographed in the U.K. from the U.S. plates, with all claims (and errors) intact. The 1974 U.S. printing is of higher quality; it is recommended over this one for those who MUST have a copy of this book. A slighly-revised review of that 1974 U.S. edition appears below.-----------------------------------------------------------No, gentle reader; this is not Dickens. But it might be about giving someone the dickens for taking excessive liberties with an interesting subject. Nor is it about \\"...the best of times and the worst of times.\\" But it might be said that this book once had its \\"best of times,\\" and that its \\"Use By\\" date is long gone, making six-day-old cod a rather more appealing olfactory experience.Consider two readers, separated by three decades.Reader No. 1, an Ivesian flush with the excitement of the 1974 Ives centennial, looking for biographical material on Ives beyond the 1955 book by Henry and Sidney Cowell, acquires this book when released. He struggles with the unusual prose style, a nearly indecipherable mix of \\"original Wooldridge\\" narrative, quotations from Ives's \\"Memos\\" and other documents, and parenthetical \\"asides\\" by Wooldridge that tease but do not satisfy. Nonetheless, he perseveres and comes away with an Ives \\"psychobiography\\" that to him seems \\"about right\\"; nothing of importance appears to have been overlooked, and if Wooldridge's insights into Ives come across as idiosyncratic, well, Ives WAS idiosyncratic.In the process, Reader No. 1 doesn't pay heed to a Wooldridge account, on pp. 150-151, about Gustav Mahler performing Ives's 3rd Symphony in Munich in the summer of 1910, nor does he rise to a tantalizing follow-up to this event, described on p. 206. He is, after all, interested in Ives, not Mahler.Reader No. 2, a Mahlerite as well as an Ivesian with a different set of priorities, finally - nearly three decades after its publication - acquires this book. He knows it by reputation only, one based on references to it made by writers on Ives and Mahler. (These references are too numerous to elucidate, and, in any event, it is perhaps best that these writers NOT be named. A minority of them openly question the Wooldridge account; in fairness to those who did not, it's best not to mention even the doubters.)He is well aware that Ives knew Mahler by virtue of attending Mahler-led performances by the New York Philharmonic-Society Orchestra. (Ives mentions Mahler not only in his 1931 \\"Memos\\" but in his much earlier \\"Essays Before a Sonata\\" as well.) Perhaps on factual grounds, or simply as an \\"article of faith,\\" he accepts that Mahler visited Ives's copyist, leaving the establishment with an inked copy of the full score to the Ives 3rd Symphony. He is not entirely satisfied with Ives's dating of this event as being in 1911; it would have had to have been in the early months of 1911 for this transaction to be possible. As for Mahler performing it in 1911, he knows this is impossible; Mahler's failing health - beginning in late February and ending with his death in May - ensured that it didn't happen in 1911. But did it perhaps happen in 1910, per Wooldridge?Having his newly-acquired copy of Wooldridge, he turns to pp. 150-151 and reads about the \\"Munich account.\\" It is - let him not mince words - fantastical. Alarms go off, sending him back to the beginning of the book, to gain a better sense of context.His struggle with Wooldridge's stylistic idiosyncrasies matches that of Reader No. 1. With the benefit of three additional decades of Ives scholarship, he recognizes that Wooldridge's \\"psychobiography\\" is premature, incomplete, and full of solecisms too numerous to detail; the book is \\"damaged goods.\\" Most remarkable of all is that there IS no context surrounding the \\"Munich account\\"; it is a total stylistic anomaly, seemingly dropped in gratuitously. And, while it answers no questions to anyone's satisfaction, it raises many, including:* Did Walter Damrosch do a \\"reading\\" of Ives's 3rd Symphony, against indications to the contrary?* If this reading led to Mahler's telephoning Harmony Ives, did she record it in \\"Our Book\\" (the diary that the Iveses kept)?* Who was the American conductor who, in 1954, conducted the Ives 3rd in the Munich Deutsches Museum performance attended by Wooldridge?* Has anyone done a handwriting analysis of a note, allegedly left by Mahler at the Deutsches Museum in 1910, referencing the copying of parts that might have been for the Ives 3rd?* Does the Mahler note in fact even exist?Yes, gentle reader, you have me correctly figured as Reader No. 2. And that I have some research yet to do.In fairness to Wooldridge, he provides a helpful overview of Ives's songs and their background. For this, I give him one additional star above the bare minimum.As for the rest, well, you were amply warned, weren't you?Those wishing to know about the life of Ives are recommended to read Jan Swafford's \\"Charles Ives: A Life with Music\\" or Stuart Feder's \\"The Life of Charles Ives\\". The aesthetics of his compositional process are well set out in his own \\"Essays Before a Sonata\\" and in J. Peter Burkholder's \\"Charles Ives and His World.\\" Recollections by people who knew him are splendidly captured in Vivian Perlis's \\"Charles Ives Remembered.\\"And, finally, if you have your heart set on reading about Mahler's Munich performance of the work, you owe it to yourself to read Carter Scholz's title story in his \\"The Amount to Carry.\\" It is hardly more fantastical than Wooldridge's account, and much better written besides.Bob Zeidler"},{"Title":"Teaching physical education for learning","review":"This was a required text for my degree but has proven to be a go to tool and reference book."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Book of Sixteenth-Century Verse (Oxford Books of Verse)","review":"The selection of sixteenth century poetry here is representative and generally sensible. The important names throughout -- Skelton, Wyatt, Surrey, Sackville, Gascoigne, Spenser, Sidney -- are given a fair showing, and I have only two notable quibbles with the selection. The first is that the Faerie Queene selections are too patchy to give a good idea of Spenser's narrative method, and the second is that Skelton's magnificent \\"Colyn Clout\\" is left out. (I don't know much about the minor poets of this period, so I can't really say much about the editors' selection there.)The one thing that's really unsatisfactory about the Oxford Verse series is the silliness of its period divisions. This book consists of English poetry 1500-1600, and if a poem was written in 1601 it's put in the Seventeenth Century book. So several poets get split up between the volumes, and each volume on its own does a very inadequate job of representing authors who straddle the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Some of Donne's and Jonson's earlier work is in the 16.c. book; Campion, Chapman, Greville, and Drayton are split down the middle; a couple of very good poems by Daniel show up in the 17.c. book; and so on. It would have been better to decide (albeit a little arbitrarily) that Daniel was a 16.c. writer and Donne was a 17.c. writer. Or, if each volume had to be made comprehensive, to duplicate selections."},{"Title":"Grammar-land, or, Grammar in fun for the children of Schoolroom-shire","review":"Love it.

Good read."},{"Title":"A Deeper Sea","review":"A Deeper Sea has been unfairly criticized, I think, because reviewers were looking at it mainly as hard science fiction. And, certainly, the hard SF elements are there. This book includes plenty of scientifically credible portrayals of marine mammal communication, underwater and space exploration, and so on. And it's humorous that the dolphins, whom we tend to sentimentalize, turn out to be SOBs when they start talking.But the real focus of this book is the main character's spiritual journey, as he is gradually transformed by guilt and self-punishment. There is much meditation on the nature of god (in the generic sense) and human responsibility toward the divine. Though it's been a few years since I read Dostoyevski's Crime and Punishment, I think A Deeper Sea has much the same agenda. It's probably not a coincidence that the main character is a Russian, of the gloomy and philosophical variety.Those who enjoy a strong character study and the pleasures of philosophy will find this unusual book a rewarding read."},{"Title":"A Deeper Sea","review":"Alexander Jablokov's account of man's first contact with Dolphin's, A Deeper Sea refuses to stick to any fomula, repeatedly taking the novel in unexpected directions and refusing to romanticize anything, especially his Dolphin's. A Deeper Sea is a quirky, intelligent novel, full of surprises."},{"Title":"A Deeper Sea","review":"Well, this was a very interesting premise for a book - sort of a darker version of Grimwood's _Into The Deep_. The dolphins were certainly not cute and cuddly. It was a rather grim, but fascinating story. As it moved through time, it was a bit... abrupt. The story didn't flow all that smoothly, but it certainly was interesting. Although, Jablokov's 2015 was not remotely similar to Back to the Future Part II's 2015 - not a hoverboard or flying car in sight!"},{"Title":"A Deeper Sea","review":"This was a very interesting book. Jablakov does a wonderful job in a futuristic story about the interactions of Dolphins, Whales, Humans, and the God that is waited for. A definate page turner, worth the wait of finding an out of print copy."},{"Title":"A Deeper Sea","review":"This could be the best book ever written. And by best, I mean Most horrible. Holy crap. We start out with torturing dolphins until they basically say (in English) \\"Fine! Jesus Christ, Man! Stop torturing me! I can talk, alright?! is that what you wanted to hear?!?!\\" Then we fast forward five (yes five) years, where we have cybernetic dolphins who shoot laser beams out of their frickin heads. We have a dolphin, who is a total jerk, who gets rich off of the stock market by looking at it like he is swimming through a coral reef. We have a bully dolphin. We have a group of Killer Whales who chase a poor humpback onto a rocky island just to watch him die. Then we get weird. Space suits for dolphins. A spaceship with a whales brain going to Jupiter to talk with the giant gas whales who live there! Seriously! Oh, did I forget to mention that one of the dolphins is Jesus? Fricking Dolphin Jesus. again, totally serious here.When I want my friends to laugh at a party, I start describing this book to them. They thought I was having hallucinations about something like this until I found it on my shelf and proved that it existed. My wife couldn't believe it was that bad, so she read it.

Also, the storyline is good, action-packed in places leaving room for the development of the plot as well. If you are a Wilbur Smith fan, you'll love it. And lastly, for the reviewer above, if you have a problem with Wilbur Smith's symbolic use of names, at least quote them correctly when you criticize them: The main character is Nick Berg, not Alex Berg. Alexander is the villain of the story!"},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"This book is the story of a man who wins back his fortune and life from very difficult circumstances. He faces incredible storms and temperatures to salvage a boat with passengers off the coast of Antartica. He next saves an oil tanker who is also carrying his ex-wife and son.As usual, Wilbur Smith writes in excesive detail, but makes every scene, every place and situation seems very real. The characters are also very life-like and you warm up to them imediately.If there was anything I could say against this book, it would be that the author seems to spend too much time describing every scene during the storms and salvages, when it is hard to follow because it gets very technical. Also, the ending is a little disappointing because after he has warmed you up to his ex-wife and son you are left not knowing what happens to them.However, it is overall a very good book and always a pleasure to read a book that is entertaining, alive and written in such a complete way."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"I am a very big fan of Wilbur Smith.

The first part is packed with fast paced, riveting scenes and the ending is also exciting. But there was a long and tedious portion in the middle of the book concerning relationships and business deals. The characters were an interesting mix. Those aboard the tug, Warlock, were fresh and original. Others were somewhat transparent and predictable. I realize that the character of Duncan Alexander needed to be exaggerated for dramatic effect, but his extreme stupidity only made him less believable, in my opinion. Still, a very worthwhile read, especially for aficionados of ships and seafaring adventures."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"I actually never finished this one. Came recommended to me by a tug boat captain who started it while waiting for a dredge to fill up his hopper barge. I know how boring it can be steaming to and from the dumping grounds, especially at two knots, but a person would have to be lost on a deserted island to find this book even the slightest bit captivating. It starts out interesting enough, with some high stakes backstory about a captain going out on a financial limb to start his own salvage business, but it quickly degenerates into a cheap Hollywood actioner, complete with plastic characters and a forced romance to boot, which happens as soon as the main character reaches the antarctic to rescue a stricken cruise ship. If you ask me, you're better off with Jan De Hartog, Farley Mowatt, Joseph Conrad, Jack London, and for more contemporary sea fare, David Poyer."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"I have read this book many times and each time my pulse races as Nick and the crew of Warlock salvage Golden Adventurer.

This book is fantastic, a nonstop adventure"},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"I hope that I can find the right words to get you to read this one. This novel is by far one of the best that I have ever read. I have read many and when I think of most of them, I can not tell you much about them. However I will tell you honestly that I can remember a lot about every one of Wilbur Smith's novels which I have read. Wilbur Smith has a writer's ability to reach this reader's heart and sole with words and make a lasting impression.In reading \\"Hungry As The Sea\\", I found myself at times crying and laughing out loud. Nicholas Berg is builder and Master of the huge Tugs that tow stranded cargo ships and ocean liners to safety. His salvage company operates out of South Africa and Bermuda. The author's vivid writing of the salvage rescues had me holding tight to the railing on the huge tugs. It was fantastic to live the life of these fearless and skilled seaman; to learn the many unique skills that are involved in these rescues at sea.Literally in the middle of two huge rescues, Wilbur Smith, gives his reader a heart warming romance. Several years after a bitter divorce, Nicholas meets Samantha who sets his world on end and his emotions spinning. Here again like every great writer, the author has the ability to give the reader a warm and loving romance without the raw descriptive sex. You will not be dissappointed because this love story will warm you inside.Finally, I was very surprised to find that this novel was written in 1978. This is truly a story that could be taken from the headlines today."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"Hungry as the Sea is a fine example of the literary talent of Wilbur Smith. Once you start this book you are carried along as though in the eye of a storm. Yes there is peace around you, but how long will it last, where will I be taken next. Not only is this a tremendous read, but also one of the first books that was concerned with conservation and trying to ensure that we look after our planet and its wonders. When you start reading, if you are like me there will be no putting it down. Enjoy the read, purchase more of the same from the kindle store at amazon.com"},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"This book is why I always read Wilbur Smith . Non stop adventure and intrigue, a really good read.Thoroughly reccomend this book as his research and knowledge in this book is excellent."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"This is a great story I enjoy reading every year or two. It sweeps me up every time in its drama. Unlike other Smith books it doesn't have a military focus or background for the characters and that makes it more unique. In this story an elite group of men who are among the best of the best in competence and determination as sailors, mechanical and electrical engineers, radio operators, etc. doing maritime rescue and salvage in the extremes of the Antarctic and southern latitudes below Africa.This book seems as contemporary as when originally written, with focus on tankers and global oil transport, the threats of human impact on the oceans due to carelessness, greed, and the colossal demand for oil. The portrayal of the oceans for their majesty and awesomeness is there as always.The characters may be over drawn, but I like heroic, bigger than life characters. They are well beyond average in their own unique ways, from the glowing young female adventure tour guide, who turns out to have a PH.D in marine biology, to the motherly, flamboyant gay ship's cook who earns his berth on a top paying ship not just for his gourmet class edibles in tough conditions but also has several years of med school to serve as ship medic."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"Will Smith books are always good. Some better than others.

Didn't much care for either of the women characters in the book, though. One thing I've noticed in Mr Smith's writing, is that he's never seen an ugly woman. They're always amazingly beautiful and well, that's cool and all, but he doesn't need to keep reminding the reader how attractive they are in order to tell the story.Otherwise, a great book, and I'm slowly going to make my way through everything he's written--he's becoming my favorite author."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"As with all of Wilbur Smith's books - this one was different but nevertheless very interesting as well as excellent!"},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"What a trip, you learn about environmental concerns, deep sea salvage, ship building, the whole nine yards.

He signs a ten-year contract to carry one million ton loads of crude oil from the El Barras field on the south Arabian Gulf to the Orient Amex refinery in Galveston, Texas. The problem is that the design of Golden Dawn is far from flawless and that the El Barras crude has a cadmium sulphite constituent of between 2000 and 40000 parts per million. There has probably never been a more deadly cargo in the history of seafaring. In spite of Nicholas Berg's persistent efforts, nothing can stop Duncan Alexander. The Golden Dawn is about to undertake her voyage from the Arabian Gulf around Good Hope, one of the most dangerous seas of the world with a cargo that could wipe out virtually every creature living in the sea..."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"I have just finished reading the book on 26 Feb 13 and I found it to be well written with a good story.

Smith!"},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"I first read this novel in a British edition in 1978 while on vacation in England. The story line, the narrative detail and the sheer beauty of Smith's written vision captured me from the start. I've long since worn out the original paperback and replaced it a number of times as this is a story I've read and re-read countless times, enjoying it every single time. Now, at least, I have an e-book version and won't have to replace worn out pages!!Smith's attention to detail and fabulous story-telling puts you on the bridge of the Warlock with Nick Berg and you never want to go back to land.The story is riveting and vividly realistic. Once you pick it up, it's hard to put it down.&#34;Hungry as the Sea&#34; started me on a life long association with the works of Wilbur Smith and I've never been disappointed. From the Courtneys to ancient Egypt, the trip has been fantastic."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"This storyline is so technical about the running a tug to rescue a disabled ocean liner that I had to give up 27% through the book. Paragraph after paragraph went into such detail about cables, machines, motors, etc. that the storyline was lost. Too bad because I really like Wilbur Smith. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"I'll read anything that has storms and ocean-going salvage tugs. This book has both, in addition to a vendetta, corporate and individual malfeasance, and romantic rivalry. The parts of the book dealing with those latter elements are the weakest. But Smith writes really well about ships during storms; the salvaging of the ocean liner in the beginning is riveting. One reviewer on Amazon complained that Smiths gets too technical and detailed during the storm scenes. Hell, man. That's the best part!There were times, however, when I felt I had fallen into an As the World Turns version of Alice in Wonderland. The story revolves around the rivalry of Duncan Alexander (the bad guy) and Nicholas Berg (the good guy) for control, of Christie Marine and the attentions of Chantelle Christie, owner of the company and a large fortune. The \\"child\\" at issue is the \\"Golden Dawn,\\" and immense (7,000 foot) super tanker (my incredulity at the size was beginning to become an irritant) designed by Nicholas but built by Duncan after Duncan forced Nicholas from the company. The inevitable then takes control of the plot, you know, Duncan cuts corners, the ship in Nicholas's view is unsafe, and the maiden voyage will be carrying Nicholas's son by Chantelle. Yawn. Nicholas, meanwhile, has built his dream salvage tug. You can guess where this is going.Four stars for the storm scene in the beginning; one for the soap.Read Jan de Hartog or Farley Mowat instead."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"A wonderful Wilbur Smith adventure with a contemporary bent.His ability to build suspense on the sea is just as accurate in the 20th century as it is in the 18th."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"Immense and satisfying attention to technical detail. Wilbur Smith's novels are educational - placing the reader inside the vernacular of the setting. I was very disappointed in the shallow female characters with an annoying overemphasis on physical attractiveness and sexual prowess. Relationships were stereotypical and predictable. If Mr. Smith is going to venture into novels about relationships, he should'n leave the reader handing. I read a review below suggesting that he got tired writing the novel and simply quit a chapter or two early. I agree."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"This was my first Wilbur Smith and the one that got me hooked to this writer. Action, adventure, romance, exotic locations. This book has it all.After reading several other Smith books you realized most of them have similar structure; roaring action at the beginning and at the end with a somehow sallow middle part. But still highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"The first part of this book is mesmorizing, I couldn't put it down. However, after the first big adventure, the story rapidly deteriorates. The ending was a HUGE disappointment.

It is a shame as this book had great potential."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"This is another very exciting book by my favorite author.It is not only intertaining but also educational,as so many of his books are.It tells of the extreme cold of Antartica,beautiful discriptions of light on the ice bergs,and info on disappearing species from the seas and what is causing it.Just the right mix of romance,suspense, education and excitement! and"},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"Wilbur Smith might have created a new genre with this book -junkscience-fiction.The first quarter of this book draws the readerinto the action as the protagonist effects a harrowing rescue/salvage operation at sea in seemingly impossible conditions, leaving the reader hungering for more. Unfortunately it never comes.After the initial fun, the story turns into a shipwreck of ridiculously exaggerated characterizations and baseless political rhetoric. This is a shameless tactic usually employed only by second rate authors.The main character is portrayed as truly god-like, defying death at nearly every turn, able to rule all who encounter him with little more effort than a single glance. Of course, this infallible hero eventually becomes the champion of the political statement which, make no mistake, is the underlying purpose of this book.The drudgery of reading the last three-quarters of the book rewards the reader with nothing more than thinly veiled political/environmental demagoguery where facts are irrelevant, environmental-whackos are saints, and capitalists are evil who shouldn't be, and often aren't, allowed to live. Smith tries to spin a yarn of certain extermination of nearly all life on earth if one particular evil capitalist is allowed to have his way....Next to the word &quot;hyperbole&quot; in the dictionary, one would expect to find a picture of this book.The writing is rough and doesn't flow smoothly. You'll find yourself periodically checking to see if you accidentally skipped a few pages, wondering how you got to this point. The authorship is as poor as the quality of paper it is printed on.This book went adrift early, and never recovered. If you are going to spend the time to read a book, don't waste time with this one. Upon finishing the book, I felt cheated as will you if you read it."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"You know the feeling... every page you turn you already know what is going to happen.

One of my friends named his boat &quot;Warlock&quot; after this book:I wanted to sink her..."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"Smith accomplishes a near-impossible feat. One of his characters is a Persian/Iranian woman, and he fails to convey her beauty, allure, and mystery to the reader. Since (IMHO) these women *are* incredibly beautiful, alluring, and mysterious, Smith's failure is especially egregious. His other heroine is a near caricature American woman: bold, aggressive, interested in causes. Conclusion: Smith can't write about romance, love, and intimacy.In addition, his book should have been reviewed by an American before publication. Americans do *not* eat &quot;shrimps&quot; any more than they eat &quot;trouts&quot; or &quot;turkeys&quot;. In that context, these are nouns of mass, not nouns of number. Also, there is no United States Coast Guard Service. It's just the U.S. Coast Guard.Finally, Smith starts with a thrilling tugboat-liner rescue, then bores the reader to insensibility with interpersonal relationships among the main characters, and then ends with the extremely unsurprising rescue of another ship (kind of) by our hero in his tugboat. When I can summarize a book in one sentence, it's always bad news. &quot;Tugboats save some ships, some lives, and Planet Earth.&quot;Finally, compare Smith's action/inaction pattern with someone like Dean Koontz, who almost always grabs the reader on the first page, keeps up the suspense and thrills, adds a *believable* romantic subplot, and ends with a satisfying and frequently happy conclusion. Smith could learn a lot from Mr. Koontz."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"Until the age of 25, I never read fiction.

It takes you in from page one. Both female and males can identify with the characters. This is about the tenth time I've read this book, and it still holds me captive from the time I pick it up until I put it down.

From icy waters to the warmth of the tropics your attention to this story is not neglected."},{"Title":"Hungry As The Sea","review":"The first section of the book about the salvage of the Golden Adventurer is good fun, though the technical details are pretty amusing. Anyone doing what Nick Berg and Beauty Baker attempt, won't salvage anything and will certainly get killed. There are some nice characters at the start, such as the \\"camp cook\\" angel and the unsociable radio operator.The final climax is also great; but again pushes your margins of belief to the limits. None of that actually matters, the first and last sections are a good tense read and well worth it.The trouble is the middle section. As with all of Smith's novels he has to bring a love interest in and the interaction between \\"love interest\\" and hero is mostly teeth grating stuff \\"Sunlight was made for Samantha..and on it goes with a middle aged guy having excellent times with a happy pleasent 24 year old beauty, who is also a PHD; I had to flip over these sections. Then there is the ice-cool beautiful Ex Wife, who having shafted the hero royally, now wants him back, a revolting character I also had to flip over.Much more entertaining is the nasty sauve Mr Alexander, Nick Bergs enemy - but we go in the same direction as Bendict Van der Byl and Johnny Lance in the Diamond Hunters; so it is pretty clear where it will all end up.But who really cares?

These include On Liberty by J. S. Mill, Leviathan by T. Hobbes, Capital by K. Marx, and The Social Contract by Frenchman Jean Jacques Rousseau. This book examines the origins, nature, logic, and inner workings of relationships between three entities. These entities are man the individual, men as in a collection of individuals, and the state, where the state includes laws, government, and other institutions. I first read this book in a high school class. I tried to read it later when in college. I could not finish this book either time; this is the most difficult book I have ever read. Unlike other discourses on politics, this book is heavily influenced by philosophy, and written like a text in philosophy. I would not recommend it for any but the most determined reader."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"200 years can't make a bad idea good. (Heck, Christianity has proved that 1700 years can't make a bad idea good) Rousseau bogs himself down in the same contradiction that has plagued all followers of the right hand path- the fact that there is no &quot;great return&quot; destroys his entire thesis. Skip this guy- read Thomas Hobbes, Nicolo Machiavelli, or Friedrich Nietzsche. They were political philosophers. Rousseau was just a sophist."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"From page 186:\\"It is impossible to live in peace with people one believes to be damned\\"From page 187:\\"But anyone who dares to say \`outside the church there is no salvation should be expelled from the state unless the state is the church and the Prince the Pontiff\\"The Social Contract was written in 1762. It is my understanding many of the Founding Fathers of the United States had read the book and this work certainly had a major influence on French thought, therefore on the French Revolution. French society suffered many wrongs because of religious intolerance and it had a major effect on the author's thoughts. In my Faith, in my thoughts those who do not accept Jesus Christ as their Savior are damned to Hell. I believe there is one true Universal church. A church not made bricks and mortar, but of souls. While this definition of church does include a denomination, the theology is in disagreement with what Rousseau believed to be of a benefit to social cohesiveness. He be believed people should only have positive dogmas which did include earthly punishment for sin, that people should seek to do God's will; God has a watchful eye over people and government. The author certainly had a problem with one believing that God damns those of other Christian constructs. He wanted to outlaw or redefine the Catholic Faith and Protestantism to fit into his idea of social cohesiveness. His idea of religious tolerance gets a more sympathetic ear today then when written.Rousseau contributed to the thoughts of man. That man gives up certain rights in a civil society. That only through government does anyone truly has his rights protected. That it is only through some sort of social agreement that ones civil rights and property rights are protected. My physical security is no longer just dependent on me. It is through the organization of men I can own, I can do without fear that another will deny simply because of my absence or more might.Partiality and equality. Equality is not to have a right beyond that of another individual Partiality is to have more rights then another individual because who your Father is, wealth, friendship with the Prince, or any other reason. Rousseau did not dismiss partiality from society, but he did ask it only be set up through the general will of the people. He therefore argued that people should associate together for the purpose of forming a political argument. He wanted each person to come to conclusions based on the strength of argument. How debate could not be obtained without alliance and organization of debate is not dealt with. Freedom of association is not dealt with in the book.The General Will is determined by the majority. Rousseau recognizes the particular will of the individual is often in disagreement with the general will. Compromise is needed and an individual is generally better off because of government action then if no action were taken. The author decries sectionalism ( beliefs or ideas that grow out of living in a different geographic area and beliefs coming forth from other associations). He does not have an idea how this can be eliminated.The author speaks on many topics on the determination what is the best form of government. The author makes a distinction between the prince as the one who enforces the law and the lawmaker. Rousseau discusses how population, climate, geographic landscape, beliefs of the public and education effect the form of government and the ability to be governed. This book I believe made a major contribution on how we think about government and society."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"I picked up a copy of this book in a shop in Hong Kong with high expectations. I had heard of it but had not yet read it and was rather shocked to find an english language copy in a place like Hong Kong. It is very persuasive in some of it's arguments but is essentially little more than a book advocating totalitarian government systems and as I read it I couldn't help but wonder if the former Texas governer had a member of his staff read it to him sometime during his recent administration.Aside from a few clever quotations and a few speechlike chapters this book is little more than a more elegant political pundit book. It proves little more than one Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh would reason if they had a stronger command of the English language. One difference would be that Rousseau believed, at least in some parts of the book, that religion weakened government."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"Rousseau made a following statement: \\"Men was born free, and everywhere he is in chain.

Rousseau wrote this book and ideology based on the equality of men. In this book, Rousseau gives the reader detailed information on his view of the model society. The reader is consumed by the principle stating that no man has any authority over the other, and the balance of man's losses and gains gives the reader a sense of hope in this form of community. This is a must-read for any lover of deep thought and classic literature."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"This is a valuable historical document, because it shows us the thinking that led up to the French Revolution. Rousseau wrote: \\"Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains.\\" What Rousseau means by this is that Man is born free in the State of Nature - it is society, government, and urban life that are the corruptive forces. Without those things, Rousseau argues, man would exist in peaceful co-habitation. What is striking to the modern reader about this claim is how blatantly wrong it is. Rousseau was trying to refute Thomas Hobbes who wrote that the State of Nature is the same as the State of War. Apparently Hobbes got the better of the argument because, as soon as the French Revolution took effect, peaceful liberty went out the window in favor of the Reign of Terror.But, back to Rousseau. He claims that, even though men in nature peacefully co-exist, it is more beneficial for them to come together to form a society. Thus they SHOULD come together and form a Social Contract. The ideal contract for Rousseau would entail the individual GIVING UP ALL HIS RIGHTS on entering the contract with the understanding that he will get them all back from the Sovereign. Who is the Sovereign? Well, for Rousseau, the Sovereign is the People. If Rousseau's Ideal State were an organism, it would be a large one-celled organism with no differentiation. This is very much unlike Hobbes' Leviathan, with the Sovereign at the head and each part assigned its individual task. For Rousseau, only the SOCIETY AS A WHOLE has the right to govern.Of course, this system is incredibly unwieldy, that is why - in Rousseau's world - there are a whole bunch of little city-states, like ancient Athens. HERE COMES THE SCARY PART. Once the whole population gets together and makes a decision, that decision is infallible. \\"THE GENERAL WILL CANNOT BE WRONG.\\" Those minorities who are disaffected by this general rule shall be \\"FORCED TO BE FREE.\\" In the case of the French Revolution, that was the freedom of one's head from one's shoulders.According to Simon Schama in his wonderful book, Citizens, the importance of the Social Contract has been overestimated. Rousseau's love of the State of Nature (which was the spirit of the French Revolution) had more of an effect on the public through his novels Emile and La Nouvelle Heloise.The Social Contract must be viewed in its historical context as a piece of history in itself. If one reads it for philosophic reasons only, it will come of sounding either frightening or painfully nave. One sentence caught my imagination however - Rousseau saw the island of Corsica as the perfect candidate for his ideal state. \\"I have a presentiment that this little island will one day astonish Europe.\\" It did. It produced the greatest warlord the world had ever seen - Napoleon."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"Jean Jacques Rousseau is truly a great intellectual.His Discourses and The Social Contract are some of the best in Enlightenment thinking. In the Discourses Rousseau exalts the \\"noble\\" savage free from the corrupting influence of modern civilization. He believes that civilization has corrupted man from his original, yet ignorant state. I found the Discourses to be a little flighty and unrealistic. The Social Contract was a different story altogether. This is a monumental work. In it Rousseau shows his vast knowledge of the Roman Republic and Empire and the reasons for it's rise and collapse. Rousseau also denounces monarchy and aristocracy as forms of government and exalts republicanism. He also decries the power of organized religion in the oppression of mankind. With his \\"General Will\\" theory of the social contract he shows true brilliance. A great buy."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"\\"The Social Contract\\" is an important read that marks a crossroads in Enlightenment thought. This crossroads has made significant differences in the past 300 years in political history.The crossroads specifically begins, to me, with philosophers John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. I, for one, am a Lockean. The influence of Locke is best observed in the USA's Constitution and emphasis on the \\"Rule of Law\\" (though this has waned over time due to the popularity of Rousseau-like ideologies). Locke, considering his reasoning was perhaps not sexy or exciting enough, was the philosophy road less traveled. His view was summarily that man was an individual who had rights to liberty and property. Governments were formed among men to protect individual liberty and property through means of negative rights.Rousseau, to me, is Locke's polar opposite. His view is \\"Rule of the People.\\" The descendants of his philosophy can be seen as early as the French Revolution that led to the Reign of Terror. Robespierre was an avid follower of Rousseau. Rousseau's ideas can be greatly seen in Socialist and Communist philosophy as well.One should definitely find the time to read Locke. In regards to \\"The Social Contract\\", Rousseau has moments of contradiction and obscurity. He writes that \\"man must be forced to be free.\\" A paradox that sums up Rousseau.Rousseau believed that man is selfish without the State. With the State, man goes from being an animal to truly being a man. Through the State, man acquires moral liberty. The State is master of all goods. Every man has a right to everything he needs. A man must occupy only the amount he needs for subsistence. A man's estate is always subordinate to the community. These are the only ways to make man equal.The State is progressed by the General Will. The General Will tends to equality and public advantage. The General Will is always right. The People can never be corrupted. The State must have a Universal and Compelling force. The Social Compact gives absolute power over all of its members. Every citizen should render his services to the State when those services are demanded. Life is to be devoted to the State.If a Prince of the State says, \\"It is expedient for the State that you should die\\", he ought to die, since the State has provided security up to this point. The people will always do good, but at times should be enlightened. Each citizen should resort to nothingness so that he cannot do without the rest. There will be equality in morals and talents. In times of attack upon the State, a dictatorship will be instituted silencing all laws for a moment.There are brief moments of Lockean ideas in \\"The Social Contract\\", but are so flittering that there is no point in elaborating upon them. Rousseau contradicts himself within the next paragraph which renders those Lockean ideas moot.The most dangerous and most significant of Rousseau's ideas is found in the last chapter, \\"Civil Religion.\\" It is here that one can trace the Salvation of Mankind theories seen in Communism, Socialism, Black Liberation Theology, etc. There is to be a civil profession of faith established. Man can be banished from society as an anti-social being, through death if needed, if he behaves as if he does not believe the profession of faith. It is impossible to live at peace with these who are regarded as damned and they must be reclaimed or tormented. The Church can only offer Salvation if the Church is the State.We can see where Civil Religion has led to the massacres of millions in the 20th Century. I won't lay blame completely upon Rousseau for these tragedies, but for one to speak of murder and torment of his fellow man so easily, he indeed has blood on his hands."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"Rousseau's treatise on the nature of people and their government has left a lasting imprint on political discourse. Though at times passionate and persuasive, most of the short book was simply too vague for Rousseau's semantic games to be indisputable, and sometimes even comprehensible. Some of his ideas are simply wrong, such as the &quot;noble savage&quot;, while others quite clearly debatable, such as the social contract itself. I, for one, would fear to live in Rousseau's ideal world, where every right I have is only mine so long as the majority (who never can be wrong) wills it.Whether you agree with him or not, plowing through Rousseau's 150 pages is a necessity for anyone who wants to carry on high-level political discourse."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"The issues of liberty and democracy, monarchy and legitimacy, are never better explained that in The Social Contract by Rousseau. Rousseau explains every thought on to the page, from the most abstract thoughts of the ideal society to every day issues of Lobbying (which he finds a major detriment to society) and Suffrage (which Rousseau demands of society). The book is wonderfully written, every word is deliberate (I must pay my respect for the translator on such a splendid job) and shows how important understanding language is in order to understand the great ideas that are discussed by language. Liberals will see this book as a beautiful light of democracy, conservatives might see this book as proof of authoritarian beliefs. The truth is that both can be read in the book. Because the book not only conveys to the reader what Rousseau thinks, it inspires the reader to think for him or her self."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"I am a huge fan of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, and was hoping to appreciate this book just as much. There is a telling irony in that in the former text, Rousseau sees civilization as incapable of being repaired, and the source of most of the problems of inequality through wealth and politics. Private property is an overall pariah to him, which ought not to exist.As Rousseau got older he seems to have changed his mind a bit, and tempered that anarcho-primitvism. In the Social Contract we see Rousseau setting himself the task, he would have once found impossible: developing a legitimate state, in the interest of the sovereign, that constantly develops towards equality, and not away from it. Unfortunately we are given zero insight into how the old ideology of the corrupt states, and rotten civilization are to be overcome at the moment of developing this grandiose social contract; this is a serious problem of praxis, probably not fully taken up until Gramsci.Now it is worth pointing that Rousseau's contract is significantly more radical, or left-wing, than anything Locke, Hegel, or Hobbes proposed. Rousseau does see excess property as a problem (unlike Hegel), and unlike Locke, Rousseau does see the origin of property as corrupting, and not beneficial. Moreover, Rousseau categorically rejects the idea of slavery, and a wage slave. Locke doesn't touch upon the former, and in a single line in his entire Treatise, says a wage slave is A-OK. Given the overall momentum of the Treatise, it's a perplexing passage. Rousseau asserts that labor ought to create products for itself and some excess for the community (so long as the community is doing the same), but not for private owners to capitalize on.Rousseau believes government ought to work for the general will of the sovereign, and the sovereign ought only to meet and conduct legislative that serves the interest of the general will. The general will is to be distinguished from the particular will, and an example of healthcare should suffice. It is the general will that each of us ought to have health coverage, i.e., because each of us desires particularly and also generally, and our desires ought to be towards equality. The particular will would desire health care, and if it comes at a cost to the general population, it ceases to be a product for and by the general will. I.e., I start a health care corporation so I get free benefits, and my family gets free benefits, but all my customers pay excess in premiums and co pays. This is the very the system that we have come to live in, where we are \\"free\\" to \\"purchase\\" in the \\"free market.\\" Rousseau would roll in his grave and point out the lunacy of atomizing society into particular wills in competition with one another, as a true travesty, acting against the general will.Although all these points are correct, or at least I appreciate most of them, the book still deserves 3 stars for a few reasons. There is certainly a tyrannical streak in Rousseau, of supporting the death penalty, and demanding people be \\"free\\" by \\"force\\" and \\"execution.\\" Moreover, Rousseau, like most social contract theorist, fails to consider the consequences of a minority who at first accepts the direction of the government, even if it votes against him constantly, to at a future date, resign his participation from a government he can no longer identify with; due to gradual change. Socrates made the same absurd point in I believe the Crito.Also Rousseau at times is extremely contradictory, on one page arguing against tyranny, on another vesting individuals with tyrannical amounts of power; or demanding we are all free on one page, and on another that we are enslaved (at the same time). His notions of democracy are not properly fleshed out, and he believes one single law giver ought to bestow the contract in the communities' interest. While at the same time believing no human is capable of developing a lasting constitution. He implores us on one page to generate a government of everlasting and perennial general will; while on another saying no government whatsoever can avoid receding into tyranny and despotism.His logic is frequently atrocious, and entirely emotional. This isn't inherently bad, emotion has its place in guiding reason, but do not present logical formulas as logical, when they are in fact entirely emotional. Be candid. Also, there's a constant reliance on appealing to authority -Grotius- as whatever he says must be true, when Rousseau decides to appeal to him.Still, if one finds themselves reading Locke, Hegel, and Hobbes, or Rand and Hayak, maybe even Novack, they ought to temper themselves with a good dosage of Rousseau."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"When the Social Contract was published in 1762, Rousseau became a wanted man in France and Switzerland, but in 1794 after the French revolution, his remains were buried in Paris as an international hero.In 1814, religious fundamentalists stole the remains of Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and dumped them in a pit full of quicklime, a cruel burial reserved for individuals condemned by the church.In the Social Contract, Rousseau postulates that a legitimate political authority in a civil society comes only from a social contract intended for their mutual preservation and agreed upon by all citizens (the sovereign). The sovereign that expresses the general will that aims at the common good has absolute authority over public matters. The state that is protecting citizens should follow laws of equality and liberty that are interestingly created by non-citizen lawgiver, and the state should also have a government to exercise executive power and daily business.The social contract might sound very basic, utopia like and naive to many readers but considering the political nature of that time and the topics debated such as liberty, free will, and the state of nature, this work is absolutely a rebellious scream, which was much needed at the time.Rousseau dreamed of a civil society, but given alone the way his remains were treated in 1814, it seems unlikely a civil society will ever exist. However, if we are not free in any way (or as Rousseau puts it: Man is born free, but he is everywhere in chains), we are still free to dream. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a free spirit who dared to dream, though imperfectly, had the courage to speak up; and for that alone his dream should be praised."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"Deeply influential book, &quot;The Social Contract&quot; is a &quot;must read&quot; for anybody interested in the history of political ideas, or even in history.

He explains us, among other things, the reason for the formation of political society, and the origin of the social contract.I believe this is a good book to start a study on political ideas. It is simple and well written, it has had an important political impact and can make you curious enough to know more. If you are interested, read also a book about the history of political ideas (for example the one written by George Sabine), because it can guide you to other interesting books, and can give you a deeper insight into the ideas, circumstances and life of Rousseau."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"Rousseau is one of the most influential of all social thinkers. He is generally considered to be a major influence in creating the climate of opinion that brought about the French Revolution.The myth of a primal virtous state of human nature which is increasingly corrupted by human civilization is presented in his work on \\"Second Discourse in Equality\\". Here he develops the mythic idea of a human social contract in which individuals sacrifice certain liberties to come together and form one unified General Will.A scatching critique of his ideas is presented in an article from \\"The Catholic Encyclopedia\\".\\"It is quite intelligible that the Contrat Social should have come to be considered by some as the gospel of freedom and democracy, by others as the code of revolution and anarchy. That it contains serious contradictions is undeniable. For instance, Rousseau assigns as the essential basis of the general will the unanimous consent of the people, yet he assumes that this general will is expressed in the plurality of suffrages; he affirms that parents have no right to engage their children by a contract, and yet children from their birth will be subject to the primitive contract; he affirms that a man has no right to alienate himself, yet he bases the social contract essentially on the total alienation of personal rights and personality in favour of the community. If there are some true considerations and reflections in this book--as, for instance, on slavery and the dignity of man, on the adaptation of the divers forms of government to the character of the people, etc.--its fundamental principles--the origin of society, absolute freedom and absolute equality of all--are false and unnatural.\\""},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"It is not difficult to portray Rousseau's ideas as authoritarian or totalitarian. He denied citizenship to women (though this was normal for thinkers of his age). He used language such as\\" forced to be free\\" and \\"trained to bear with docility the yoke of the public happiness\\". The Censorial Tribunal and the insistence on a civil religion seem illiberal to the modern mind. He argued that monarchy (single ruler) is best in large states, and elsewhere aristocracy (preferably elective) is generally best because democratic governments often suffer internal strife: \\"If there were a nation of Gods, it would govern itself democratically. A government so perfect is not suited to men.\\" He requires citizens to cede all rights to the community, whereas modern democracies invariably stress rights. Finally, Rousseau condemns representative government and dislikes political parties and pressure groups, for they tend to create mini general wills that make it difficult for the General Will to emerge.Some of these points can be countered more or less successfully. On the question of language Rousseau is employing rhetorical flourish. On democratic government, Rousseau's preference for aristocracy is not all-important because the democratic elements of his theory concern the sovereignty of the people, not the form of government. On pressure groups and political parties, Rousseau wishes to discourage rather than ban them, and Rousseau has certainly not been the only critic of representative government.In what ways is Rousseau's thought democratic? The elements are consent, participation and majorities. Locke had postulated consent in the Social Contract and \\"tacit\\" consent thereafter, but for Rousseau consent requires all (male) citizens to meet regularly to determine the laws, for only thus could a general will emerge through which men find true freedom. Though this direct democracy is impractical in modern states (too large), the concept of participation won many supporters in the second half of the 20th century who argued that modern representative government provides inadequate opportunities for participation. The claim that people - all the people - must be the author of the laws is Rousseau's greatest claim to be a democrat. Others were later to assert that a \\"general will\\" existed in society without reference to a popular assembly, and Rousseau would have had no truck with that.One idea that makes Rousseau seem very modern is his claim that freedom requires sufficient economic equality for no man to be dependent on another: that freedom and equality are inseparable. Not all modern democrats follow Rousseau in emphasising equality but an important group does.Of the arguments for seeing Rousseau as authoritarian or totalitarian the most important is the extent to which Rousseau assumes each man's interest are synonymous with the common good. Rousseau says men must vote in the assembly on what they believe to be the general will and if in a minority should tell themselves they were \\"mistaken\\" rather than simply on the losing side. It is true that Rousseau constantly reminds us he is writing of small and homogeneous states, but even in the smallest states there are surely greater differences of wants than Rousseau supposes, and greater differences of opinion as to what constitutes justice.The key feature of an authoritarian state is that decisions are made by a minority without majority participation in the previous discussions. The tools considered necessary by modern liberal democrats for \\"participation\\" and \\"discussion\\" are missing in Rousseau, for he discourages interest groups and political parties. However, the reason they are missing is because he insists on popular sovereignty, with the participation of all citizens in making the laws to establish a \\"general will\\". On the other hand, it is in this concept that elements of totalitarian democracy appear. Pluralist democrats assume men differ and that politics is the resolving of conflict between them. Rousseau assumes that politics is consensual, with a solution (a general will) waiting to be found. The word \\"authoritarian\\" is perhaps inappropriate, but his collectivism surely has totalitarian overtones. Yet Rousseau is perhaps more democrat than totalitarian by modern standards, arguing as he does that \\"each citizen should come to his own opinion.\\" I don't think Stalin, Hitler or Mao ever said that."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"'The tyranny of the majority' - a brilliant phrase coined by the author of 'Democracy In America' and a brilliant chink in the armour of Rousseau's societal vision.

Their very individuality is subsumed to serve the will of the collective. This cannot be right. Minorities must be protected. If not, they will find a way.

Rousseau claimed that a perfect society would be controlled by the \\"general will\\" of its populace.While he does not define exactly how this should be accomplished (as there are many possible ways, each suited to different situations), he suggests that assemblies be held in which the every citizen can assist in determining the general will. Without this imput from the people, there can be no legitimate government. Importantly, this input cannot come from representatives, but must be from the people themesevles.\\"THE Sovereign, having no force other than the legislative power, acts only by means of the laws; and the laws being solely the authentic acts of the general will, the Sovereign cannot act save when the people is assembled.\\"[Book III, 12. HOW THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY MAINTAINS ITSELF]\\"Every law the people has not ratified in person is null and void -- is, in fact, not a law.\\" [Book III, 15. DEPUTIES OR REPRESENTATIVES]\\"The legislative power belongs to the people, and can belong to it alone\\"[Book III, 1. GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL]The Social Contract was a progressive work that helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. The Social Contract finally expelled the myth that the King was appointed by God to legeslate; as Rousseau asserts, only the people, in the form of the sovereign, have that all powerful right.The stated aim of the Social Contract is to determine whether there can be a legitimate political authority. \\"Man was born free, but he is everywhere he chains.\\" In order to accomplish more and remove himself from the state of nature, a man must enter into a Social Contract with others. In this social contract, everyone will be free because all forfeit the same amount of freedom and impose the same duties on all. Rousseau also argues that it is illogical for a man surrender his freedom for slavery, and so, the participants must be free. Furthermore, althought he contract imposes new law, especially on property, a person can exit it at any time (except in a time of need, for this is desertion), and is again as free as when he was born.Rousseau seems to prefer a benevolent Tyrant over any other form of leadership (including a true democracy); however, he remains obscure on this point.Rousseau posits that any administration, whatever form it takes, should be divided into two parts. First, there must be the sovereign (which could be the whole population if that is the majority's desire) who represents the general will and is the legeslative power within the state. The second division is that of the government, being distinct from the sovereign. This division must be since the sovereign cannot deal with particular matters (it is then acting as particular wills and not the general will--the sovereign is no longer whole and therefore ruined), like applications of the law. Therefore a government must be sperate from that of the sovereign body.[Rousseau] claims that the size of the territory to be governed often decides the nature of the government. Since a government is only as strong as the people, and this strength is absolute, the larger the territory the more strength the government must be able to exert over the populace. In his view, a monarchal government is able to wield the most power over the people since it has to devote less power to itself, while a democracy the least. In general, the larger the bureaucracy, the more power required for government discipline. Normally, this relationship requires the state to be an aristocracy or monarchy. In light of all this, Rousseau seems to prefer a benevolent Tyrant over any other form of leadership (including a true democracy); however, he remains obscure on this point.Main IdeasOf the State of NatureRousseau scorns the state of nature as a state of perpetual war. In this state there is no private property--in fact, the only property that is truely one's own, is property that no one else wants.In this state of nature, strength rule, not by legitemacy, but by force itself. It is in this way that in a state of nature, man is only as free as he is strong. Furthermore, there is no pretection from others.It is from both of these detestable qualities that people enter into a Social Contract; it is to empower themselves to thereby be able to accomplish more--with the help of others--than would be possible in a state of nature. The elementary point in this social contract though is legitemate leadership and freedom. The freedom to be the same as others (no special burden unique to one person) and the freedom to leave the social order and revert back to a state of nature.Of WillsOne of the most important distinctions throughout the treatise is that of the seperate wills of people and government. For the people, there is the general will, the personal will, and the will of all. The general will desires what is best for the society as a whole, the personal will wants what is best for an individual, and the will of all is the summation of all personal will--not the general will. In government, there are three wills again: the general will, the coporate will, and personal will. The general will of the government is the same as those of the populace (as members of said populace make up the government), the coporate will desires the longevity of the government, and the personal will, as in the former case, is merely what people want for themselves.Of Government\\"Every free action has two causes which concur to produce it, one moral--the will which determines the act, the other physical--the strength which executes it. [...] The body politic has the same two motive powers--and we can make the same distinction between will and strength, the former is legislative power and the latter is executive power.\\" (Book III, Chater 1)The quintessential form of this Social Contract would be a democracy; however, unless, as Rousseau states, the population is one of Gods, this true democracy is impossilbe and, therefore, the state must be either an aristocracy or a monarchy, or a mixture of any of the three. The only duty of the sovereign is the embodiment of the general will, and when the general will fails to dictate the laws of the society, the sovereign has failed. To protect themsevles from this, the people should have an active role in the government election of officials and the passage of laws and must not pass their rights off to representatives. As an example of this, Rousseau gives ancient Rome with a monarch and the three lawfully convined assemplies known as comitia. Through these assemblies all citizens were represented; however, the emperor had much power in all. As for the discussion and voting in assemblies, people should vote not according to their personal interests but according to the general will. If the executive (government) goes against the general will, it breaks the social contract and should be dissolved. Rousseau furthers this idea and suggests that the sovereign, like those in Rome, should legislate clear times for assemblies to be held which cannot be posponed by the leader(s) of the state. This safeguards the people from a government that is acting not for the general will, but for its own, corporate will by trying to extend beyond its constitutional power and act only in the interests of the administrations longevity.Rousseau adds a caveat: in times that require a swiftness which a bureaucracy cannot attain, it is important to act quickly and in one of two ways: appoint one or two magistrates to act as the government, or place one man above the law--a dictator. Both are only temporary solutions and as soon as the danger that catalyzed the change in government abates, the officials must abdicate their position. This is in keeping with the general will because the safety of the state is its foremost concern and the suspension of laws and due process is sometimes, albeit rarely, the only method to ensure this.Of ReligionRousseau breaks religion into two catagories: religion of the man, and religion of the citizen. Religion of the man requires only an inner belief in a supreme being, the religion of the citizen, however, requires dogmas, rituals, external forms of worship, and views other religions as alien and backward.Rousseau continues and adds that there is a curious, third form, that \\"one might call the religion of the priest.\\" (Rousseau, 1762) This form bestows upon men two rulers, two motherlands, and two legislators, thus, placing the citizens in a paradox. Due to the inherint contradiction between church and state in this form of religion Rousseau declares it to be fatal to social unity and therefore utterly useless. He considers the religion of the Lamas, the Japanese, and that of the Catholic Christianity to be such religions. Due to their inate flaw, he does not expound further on this form, but focuses only on the first two.The second form of religion is excellent for the state as it binds men to it via a divine being. Therefore, obeying the laws of the sovereign is, by proxy, obeying the laws of God. Similarily, dying for the state is, by proxy, viewed as dying for god, et cetera. In this case, the government is also the clergy (this is not the same as the clergy being the government). This form of religion does have its downsides though in that it decieves men and thereby makes them \\"credulous superstitous\\". Furthermore, this form of religion breeds intolerance and propagates bloodthirst because the citizens believe it a holy task to kill those that believe in other deities.The first form of religion is more or less inert. It does not place men at odds with one another, but it also does not unite.According to Rousseau, the dogmas of a \\"civil religion\\" must be simple and small in number. He gives as examples of positive dogmas: \\"the existance of an omnipotent, intelligent, benevolent being that provides and forsees; the life to come; the happiness of the just; the punishment of sinners; the sanctity of the social contract and the law;\\" et cetera. The only negative dogma Rousseau allows is for no intolerance. \\"Intolerance is something which belongs to the religions we have rejected.\\"The most important idea stemming from this chapter is the seperation of church and state. According to Rousseau, when the church becomes the government, the sovereign are no longer sovereign. Intolerance leads directly to this consequence. Due to this, there must be no national religion, but rather all should be embraced. The only exception to this is a religious dogma that forces people to be bad citizens--this must not be tolerated.Interestingly, although Rousseau proves slavery unjust, he also posits that it maybe the only way for a society to be free. In otherwords in order to be free yourself, you must enslave another lest you both be slaves to someone else."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"Rousseau's ideas are well known.

Rousseau's ideal reminds me of a perfect democracy in that he wants all involved and the body of the people make an irrevocable law. However, one of my big problems with a perfect democracy is almost the same problem dealt with in our republic (and here I mean our notion of a republic, not Rousseau's definition of any legal framework ruled by the people)-- that is the vast amount of laws and the girth thereof make them unwieldy.

The use it makes of the short moments of liberty it enjoys shows indeed that it deserves to lose them.\\" The same could be said of these United States.'\\"In a well-ordered city every man flies to the assemblies: under a bad government no one cares to stir a step to get to them, because no one is interested in what happens there, because it is foreseen that the general will will not prevail, and lastly because domestic cares are all-absorbing.\\"He had a few chapters where it argued that different people need different government because their differences in diet, consumption, and climate. It seemed ridiculously immature given today's global economy.He talks a lot about all of the people being involved and that they cannot be wrong and that they have no will. However, what about the tyranny of the majority? What about the preservation of rights of those that are under represented?On the joys of being stupid: \\"Men who are upright and simple are difficult to deceive because of their simplicity; lures and ingenious pretexts fail to impose upon them, and they are not even subtle enough to be dupes.\\"On religion: \\"Every religion, therefore, being attached solely to the laws of the State which prescribed it, there was no way of converting a people except by enslaving it, and there could be no missionaries save conquerors.\\"Overall, a recommended read for all."},{"Title":"The social contract;: Or, Principles of political right, (Social science series)","review":"Anyone wishing to study political philosophy should read this for sure. It sets up the standard theory for the structure of society as the social contract or pact that is made up of the passive state and active sovereign. Within this The Prince rules. Jean-Jacques Rousseau adheres to his political beliefs and especially his strengths in knowledge of the state of nature of sociey that must turn to its general will and its body politic to achieve its goals. All is brilliant in this book except the end, and although Rousseau has an extremely strong point of view, it criticizes Christianity a bit too harshly without giving enough merit for what it represents.

What a shame that it's out of print.In it, the courageous Ellen Plasil details her horrifying experiences with \\"Objectivist psychotherapist\\" Lonnie Leonard, a manipulative sexual predator who nevertheless somehow managed to pass muster among the ranks of Ayn Rand's \\"Objectivist\\" movement (with the blessing even of the movement's \\"official\\" psychotherapists).Plasil's upsetting account of Leonard's monstrous behavior should be read not only by those interested in the misuses and abuses of \\"psychotherapy,\\" but also -- and especially -- by those who still think Rand's \\"Objectivism\\" might somehow be philosophically respectable if only it were purged of some of its personal elements.On the contrary, those \\"personal elements\\" infect very nearly the entirety of Objectivism, and Leonard's behavior (particularly his manipulative technique) is demonstrably connected to Rand's own \\"philosophical\\" premises.And the Objectivist _movement_ (for the propagandistic support of which most of Rand's nonfiction writings were expressly developed) was never anything more \\"respectable\\" than a psychologically totalitarian personality cult that allowed Rand and her protege Nathaniel Branden to exercise personal power over their unwitting victims in the official name of \\"reason.\\" Objectivists won't like being reminded of this book's existence and will undoubtedly claim that Leonard wasn't an exemplar of Rand's principles. And it is true that Rand would have been horrified by Leonard's behavior.Nevertheless that behavior was merely a physical implementation of the mindrape Rand and Branden had been committing all along, as described in the posthumous Rand biographies written by the two Brandens. Readers familiar with Objectivist history will also see parallels with Rand's manipulative treatment of her own unemployed and dependent husband in securing his \\"permission\\" for an adulterous sexual affair with Nathaniel Branden -- and with her self-serving contention that any _real_ man should have found her sexually irresistible even if she were eighty years old and in a wheelchair.This interesting approach to romantic love was, of course, offered in the name of \\"reason,\\" and that is just how Leonard presented it to his own victims. Nor is it an accident that the movement tended to attract the sort of \\"true believer\\" who would fall for such stuff. Objectivists may say that Plasil herself (and Leonard's other victims) should have known better, but they will merely be calling attention to their movement's callous and utterly irresponsible treatment of those whom Rand would (and did) dismiss as, quite literally, subhuman.And the fact that the morally corrupt Leonard was able to pass for so long as \\"one of them\\" says something crucially important about the movement's standards and purposes: namely, that it _is_ awfully hard to tell a devout Objectivist from a narcissistic, manipulative sociopath. I wonder why. (Hint: it was hard to tell Rand from one too.)At the very least, \\"Objectivism\\" has a tremendous (some of us would say impossible) burden of proof to meet. Anyone who still sees any merit in \\"Objectivism\\" should try to scare up a copy of this forgotten book -- and reconsider."},{"Title":"Therapist","review":"This was an important book in my regrouping after harmful therapy.It illuminates the dangers of the paternalistic model which the psychotherapists call healing. Power corrupts."},{"Title":"Therapist","review":"Blaming Ayn Rand or her philosophy, Objectivism, for the misdeeds of Dr. Lonnie Leonard, is like blaming Jesus, or his philosophy, Christianity, for the misdeeds of Christian serial killer Robert Yates (which, by the way, were a lot worse than those of Leonard).The other reviewers claim that adherence to Objectivism MUST lead to the behavior exhibited by Lonnie Leonard, but they fail to explain why most Objectivists (including many mental healthcare professionals) DON'T behave that way. The fact is that Lonnie Leonard pretended to be an Objectivist, and he fooled a lot of people (including some real Objectivists) into thinking that he was. Being an Objectivist (or practicing any other philosophy) is no guarantor against being fooled by a clever fraud."},{"Title":"Therapist","review":"Plasil's account of how her therapist, Dr. Lonnie Leonard, took advantage of her emotionally fragile state to turn her into his own private sexual plaything is not for the squeamish. But the book is important nonetheless for the light it sheds on what can happen when individuals turn away from traditional sources of social support like religion and instead try to follow some sort of rationalist ideology. Dr. Leonard had no trouble passing himself off as an important follower of Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy. Allan Blumenthal, the leading Objectivist psychotherapist of the time, described Leonard as &quot;the only psychiatrist I would recommend.&quot; Plasil herself was an Objectivist--as were all her friends and acquaintances. She would learn from brutal experience what happens when all one's friends are true-believing ideologues.Normal people--that is, people who are not adherents of some rationalist ideology--look for emotional support in the social and moral bonds of traditional social groups, such as the family or church. But when these social and moral bonds are destroyed through rationalist criticism, human beings are left without any support whatsoever. This is what happened to Plasil. At the time of her therapy with Dr. Leonard, all her friends and acquaintances were Objectivists. They were, as Plasil herself put it, her &quot;entire support system.&quot; If they abandoned her, she would have nobody. So what happened when Plasil finally stood up to her therapist and accused him of shamelessly exploiting her? Did her Objectivist friends stand by her and give her the support she needed? No, of course not. In keeping with the heartless rationalism which is at the center of Rand's ideological philosophy, Plasil's Objectivist all sided with Dr. Leonard. &quot;I received innumerable phone calls, from men and women alike,&quot; she later recalled, &quot;who condemned me for terminating my own therapy and for the reason they had learned was behind my doing so. In one call, I was accused of 'destroying the closest thing Man has ever had to a god.' In another, I was threatened with retaliation for causing the closing of Dr. Leonard's practice.&quot;Here we have an eloquent example of the subversive effects of rationalist ideology. Rand's morality of &quot;enlightened selfishness&quot; and excessive individualism had, like a corrosive acid, eaten away the tradition-based social bonds that are suppose to hold a community of friends and acquaintances together. In the absence of these social bonds, the individual is forced to rely entirely on his own private judgment in dealing with the immense complexities of social reality. Because this is not in fact possible, what happens instead is that the individual attaches himself to any charismatic figure who is willing to fill the void left by the absence of all those uncritically accepted traditions that give people the sense of community they need.Once this is understood, we can begin to understand why all of Plasil's Objectivist friends abandoned her and sided with Dr. Leonard. They sided with Dr. Leonard because he gave them the emotional support they desperately needed and could not get in any other way. Bereft of any sort of religious or communitarian support system, they had no choice but to become abject followers of a common charlatan and sexual malefactor. This is always what happens when some ideologue or philosopher attempts to replace the common sense ethics of traditional morality with a &quot;rational&quot; ethics of intellectualist speculation or &quot;reason.&quot; Instead of liberty and independence, we find blind loyalty to some sort of self-appointed messiah.This book is important because it gives us an idea what an Objectivist society would be really like. If it were possible for Objectivism ever to become the dominant ideology of society, what we would find is not an individualist paradise of rational, independent thinking men and women, but a dysfunctional society made up of clueless true-believers finding themselves inexplicably exploited by ruthless predators like Dr. Lonnie Leonard. Such are the fruits of any rationalist ideology, regardless of the intentions of its creators."},{"Title":"Warthogs in the Kitchen A Sloppy Counting Book","review":"My son (age 2) loves this book.

This book has three themes, the disappearance of two young women; an elderly pedophile released from prison; and a severely abused housewife. Ms. Rendell writes so well, detailing the hellish life of the housewife in stomach-roiling detail. She also includes some of her deliciously psychotic character studies, and of course all this is seen through the eyes of dear familiar Insp. Wexford. There is a trace of humor in this book involving the inhabitants of a lowish class housing development picketing the old reprobate's apartment, singing &quot;Stand By Your Kids&quot; to the tune of &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;, and similar silliness that would make Jerry Springer feel right at home! Sally Jesse, Maury Povich, and Jenny Jones would fit right into this modern day England, and not a vicar in sight! I am only giving it 4 stars because the stories do not tie together and they meander somewhat, this is not Ms. Rendell's usual top=notch work. Also, Ms. Rendell and Insp. Wexford are both getting up there in years, and I hope she goes on writing forever, but there are hints the refined and compassionate policeman may be getting weary of the crazy modern day world that is not only lived in England, but all over. I hope Ms. Rendell has many, many more novels in her yet and we will see her policeman back on top of the game. When she is great, words cannot express the deep emotional impact her novels have on my psyche. When she is merely good, as in &quot;Harm Done&quot;, she is still sublime. Rather than 4 stars, let me give this a &quot;9&quot; on a one to ten scale. I look forward to her next books, both Wexford and non-Wexford."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"Her previous Wexford novel 'Road Rage' was always going to be hard to follow, but once again Ruth Rendell has demonstrated why she has been dubbed the modern 'Queen of Crime'. 'Harm Done' broaches the subjects of paedophilia, domestic violence and abduction, managing to be as addictive as it is disturbing. In the end is left to the reader to decide whether the end result of the major crime is justified by the means - and the novel is as suspenseful as ever. Wexford continues to delight, and it is difficult to imagine Rendell ever writing a less than superb thriller. Right out of the top drawer - in other words, a normal day at the office for Ruth Rendell."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I have been reading Ruth Rendell since I was in high school, 30 years ago. I thought when I read &quot;Judgement in Stone&quot; then that mystery writing could not get any better than that. How wrong I was. At a rate of two or three books per year, Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine has honed her craft to a point where, I believe, no other mystery writer before or since has ever achieved such heights of excellence in brilliant prose, high-tension plotting, fascinating character study, as well as thought-provoking social commentary. Her body of work stands as a shining example of a writer's growth. I used to think heaven would be a warehouse full of undiscovered Dorothy Sayers manuscripts. Now I think heaven would be if Ruth Rendell goes on writing forever and that one can read her in the after-life."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"This Inspector Wexford mystery is definitely not Rendell's best. I have read most of her novels and there are only a few that are not absolute masterpieces. This one had too much social commmentary for me and a &quot;red herring&quot; that took up 3/4 of the book made me feel deflated. And why was there a pedophile theme in the middle that had nothing to do with the plot? If this book is your first encounter with Wexford, please don't give up on Rendell. She's an author well worth reading. This just isn't one of her best books. Harm Done just didn't contain many of the elements fans read the Wexford series for."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I have just stumbled upon some of the great books by Ruth Rendell, the first being &quot;A Sight for Sore Eyes&quot; which I absolutely loved. &quot;Harm Done&quot; was the 2nd book I read (actually listened to on audiobook) and liked it too, but not as well as the first. I was really getting into the story line about the girls who mysteriously disappeared, then returned in a few days unwilling or unable to tell police what had happened to them. I was sure the pedophile brought into the story was the culprit, but the two things had nothing to do with the other. I was a bit disappointed when the explanation came out midway through the book and it wasn't anything to get too worked up about. Then the author went on a completely different track with the abused woman plot. I guess they did all tie in together as the abused woman's baby had turned up missing too. I liked the book and will be reading more of Ruth Rendell's work, but I prefer the books that are more suspense and less Inspector Wexford."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"Rendell's Inspector Wexford is a wonderful character. He is not flashy, but he is thoughtful, witty and insightful. I always enjoy reading about him and his cases. This book deals with the abduction of two women and one little girl. It also explores the issues of domestic violence and its ramifications, and the problem of the mob mentality and its destructiveness. As you can see, the book is too busy. It has too many themes and they don't mesh well. The middle of the book flags, although it picks up some steam at the end. To Rendell's credit, she doesn't attempt to tie up every loose end, and she fleshes out most of the characters. She would do well to make the plot more focused, as it was in her last novel, &quot;A Sight for Sore Eyes,&quot; a truly horrifying thriller."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"An imperfect Rendell novel is still better than 99% of the crime fiction available. That said, this one isn't perfect. It definitely pales in comparison with *Simisola*, which dealt with similar issues in a tighter and more devastating way.I would have expected Rendell to weave together the 3 sub-plots (the abducted girls, the pedophile, and the kidnapped toddler) in a shocking, revelatory way, but she doesn't. The book feels more like 2 novellas and a short story, with Wexford as the common thread.I appreciate the feminist consciousness that Rendell's been weaving into the Wexford novels; it makes a great counterpoint to her visions of female evil and criminality.However, I found the presentation of the battered-woman plot strangely cold. Even the sympathetic &quot;good man&quot; Wexford remains an outside observer, unable to comprehend the horrible events he discovers, and so the reader does too. *Harm Done* falls short of the tragic power and immediacy of Roddy Doyle's *The Woman who Walked into Doors*."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I had never read one of Ruth Rendell's works before, and based on this one, I probably never will again. I thought her book was infinitely boring, the plot developed so slowly it was like watching paint dry. In addition the characters were two-dimensional, and Rendell's (too) many plot lines were disjointed, the abduction of the two girls having absolutely nothing to do with her main theme of domestic abuse. The only reason I kept reading was that I expected it, or hoped that it would get better. Needless to say I was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"My first Ruth Rendell novel, listened to on CD. The reading is very good, but the novel is longwinded and relatively boring. Between spousal abuse, bigotry, low life prejudice and multiple police cases, Rendell has taken on way too much here and done a satisfactory job of little. What stands out and suprised me most, tho, is her portrait of the British provincial police as small-minded and not particularly bright. A strange sort of detective fiction that left me wondering if she is really mocking the police. Part of what makes for the longwindedness is how many obviously false leads the police conjur up in long discussions, that then have to be played out in visits to imagined suspects.One thing about some of the reviews. It strikes me that those who complain about her \\"political correctness\\" ought to quit whining and just come out and say they think spousal abuse, lynch mobs bigotry, etc., are unworthy subjects for policiers (and other types of fiction?)."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"This murder mystery was captivating, dark and insightful.

She is probably one of the premiere novelists out there. In this book she takes on the topic of \\"wife abuse\\", and builds a mystery around it. There are a number of things at play here. There is society dealing with the release of a convicted pedophile, there is a young girl who finds herself pregnant by an older man, and there are some girls disappearing for two or three days, and the stories they have when they get back make Wexford shake his head. But overriding of all of this is wife abuse, and the havoc it wreaks on families.

While it may (or may not) be her best Wexford installment, her latest \\"Harm Done\\" certainly is one of my favorites. The author--ever so aware of current issues--does not shy away from yet another socially significant and controversial issue. In fact, she tackles more than one in this thriller.For starters, a pedophile is released from prison to live in one of the councilhouses in Kingsmarkham. Naturally, the community is literally up in arms. And, more to the point, this novel addresses spouse and child abuse in its various forms, and the readers cannot escape this thematic approach to another of our societal aberrations. Along the way, a policeman is killed by a mob protesting the pedophile's presence, and, eventually enough, there is a murder for Wexford to solve.The inspector is not without his trusty assistant Mike Burden, and plod they do to solve the case, as much by intuition as by logic and cold facts. Wexford has made a reputation for being able to \\"sense\\" the solution in the previous Rendell books. Kingsmarkham, too, has become a regular community in literary geography. The book begins with the disappearance of a teen aged girl, who, miraculously re-appears three days later; in one week, another teenager disappears, and then re-appears. The third person to go missing, next, however, is a three-year old child and the community becomes aflame with violence, as they lay the crime to the pedophile. Mob action follows and in their \\"reactions,\\" the policeman is killed by a firebomb.Rendell's penchant for social issues makes her works worth reading anyway; if nothing else they raise a sense of social consciousness and awareness. In \\"Harm Done,\\" she takes us from one set of family suffering from abuse to another, but not in the sense that it's overkill (pun intended). There is a feeling of disquietude, even depression, as she lays bare the abuse. This is not a book that will fill the reader with gaiety and humor; nor should it be. She is serious about her subject, and it's a subject that her readers, themselves, should be serious about. She also makes a stab irresponsibility of the tabloid press!Thus, the novel progresses and subsequently ends. And another chapter in the Wexford family has been unveiled. The inspector is a deeply fair man, one who firmly and fully believes in justice and it is his determination to uphold justice that makes us appreciate him so.Rendell, who also writes under the name of Barbara Vine, has been labeled the \\"Queen of Crime,\\" as well as having been awarded a number of prizes for her novels. Her works are thought-provoking and far from simple. One cannot read her without being affected in some positive way. It is a pity that the BBC's \\"Ruth Rendell Mysteries\\" do not play in America, as most of her Wexford mysteries have been filmed--and fortunately remain true to her books. Her contribution to the genre is far-reaching. \\"Harm Done\\" is not to be missed.(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"rendells latest is fine story and character wise, however her voice of disdain for &quot;lower class &quot; problems and habits is a little too much to bear.

It was ever so much nicer when they were insulated from these distractions because we became insulated along with the Wexfords as we turned the pages and vicariously lived in the lovely Kingsmarkham mythical town for a time.Well, Harm Done, is still a page-turner and not once did I not enjoy the novel. It was a bit tepid when stacked up against the wonderful, A Speaker Of Mandarin, and earlier Ruth Rendell Inspector Wexford fiction.

But I look forward to her return to form."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"Ruth Rendell is surely the best writer I have ever read. She is a magician a psychologist and a suspense master all rolled into one. Her insight and her spellbinding tales are second to none. This is another great Rendell foray into the inner life(s) of her fellow man and woman. Shes just spectacular. Read all her books, especially the middle ones from the 1970's. The next book you read after hers will seem tepid and shallow. I promise!"},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I admit that this author is one of the very few whom I have finished every book by her that I started, no small achievement! As a \\"non mystery\\" examining the lifestyles of the rich and poor in current England, it is a wonderful multi-layered book covering social problems like wife and child abuse, disappearing young ladies, mob psychology, pedophiles, and lots more. The descriptions and interactions between all the actors here are right up to top of RR's books. Some of it is beautifully written, and flows along wonderfully. However, this novel does not supply the usual amount of creeping menace that really makes RR among the top in her field. So, since this is a slightly flawed mystery with all the elements of literary razzle dazzle usually associated with the author, it may not be among her very best. Plus the ultimate resolution seems a bit stilted, if not downright unrealistic. Nonetheless, another outstanding journey thru contempoary English society, with the police procedural angle not quite up to her best. In other words, this would be \\"5 Stars\\" for about anyone else, but not quite for this top drawer author!"},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"Rendell layers her stories, and it is always fascinating to see how the plots and characters intersect. This novel of kidnapping, spousal abuse and murder was my first encounter with Inspector Wexford, and I found him rather uninteresting. Ultimately there are too many characters, and several plots that are not integrated well enough. The kidnapping starts out as the major plot but ultimately fizzles out, the key murder occurs 4/5ths into the book, and a second death is not resolved well. The elements are all there, but perhaps she should have spent more time on this novel. When a writer is as good as Rendell, she raises the bar for herself as well as others. Her previous book, &quot;Sight for Sore Eyes&quot;, was a hard act to follow. Despite of the above criticism, it is nonetheless very readable."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"Inspector Wexford is called upon to solve a very strange case. Young women are being kidnapped and forced to do housework. In another case a small child is kidnapped. In the midst of all this, a pedophile is released from prison. The violence resulting from the public outcry results in the death of a policeman. Wexford's daughter is working in a home for abused women, and contributes her expertise to the case, especially the kidnapping.This was a very busy mystery, several plots intertwining. Ms. Rendell manages to tie them all together rather neatly at the end, keeping the reader engrossed in each detail of each plotline."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I think Ruth Rendell is on the best writers in the world! That said, her latest is great to read but it lacks the usual punch that her novels usually have. There is a lot going on in this one and you keep thinking that the different sub-plots will weave together with the others in the end but they don't. I thought that the book should have been shorter and there is a lot of detail, such as the pursuit of a suspect that does not pan out, that could have been left out. The villan, in this case a wife beater, is a deliciously despised character and the reader will get a smug satisfaction when he gets his punishment."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"In \\"Harm Done,\\"Kingsmarkham, Sussex, the country town where Chief Inspector Wexford tries to keep the peace, a lot is popping all at the same time. The local ecologically-minded populace has just succeeded in beating back a motorway bypass; there are some hard feelings remaining. A convicted pedophile has been released from prison, and come back to his registered home in the Muriel Campden Estate, a council estate packed with vulnerable children; the estate is in an uproar. A young girl from the estate, Lizzie Cromwell, has been missing for three days and then comes back, seemingly unharmed. Another local girl, the middle-class Rachel Holmes, is snatched soon after, and also comes back unharmed after a few days. And then two-year old Sanchia, daughter of Stephen Devenish, a local wealthy executive, is taken from her bed in the middle of the night.It's odd, I've not thought of Lord Byron, famed English Regency poet, in years, and suddenly, I'm living in a Byron festival, and he turns up in everything I read. In \\"Harm Done,\\" the writer describes a good-looking lad as a \\"young Byron.\\" Rendell, of course, is an excellent, fluid writer, with fine qualities of wit, observation and imagination, and, as ever, she has woven an original, off-beat, intricate, many-layered plot here; nor does she take any of the lazy shortcuts we're accustomed to seeing on American television mysteries. However, although two deaths occur, the book isn't properly a murder mystery, I think. It's more a manslaughter and miscellaneous illegal behaviors mystery; the one murder that occurs does so late in the book. We've been waiting for it, and we sorta kinda know \\"whodunit,\\" from the start. I do find Rendell has a tendency to get a bit preachy, on environmental issues; and, particularly, on women's issues[...] Of course, few people favor our ripping our environments to shreds, and fewer still, I hope, favor wife abuse, or sexual slavery: I wouldn't think her crusades were controversial, but to me, at least, they detract a bit from the mysteries. But the mysteries are excellent."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the audio CD of Harm Done I recently bought turned out to be an abridged version. I was wonderng why it seemed to include a lot less detail than I recalled from reading the book a few years ago. A clue to do with knives--which emphasized the book's themes--simply wasn't there, for example.I don't see mention of abridged vs. entire story (unabridged) on the descriptions of this product that are currently online."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I have read 1 other Ruth Rendell book, and one Barbara Vine (her pen name) book and can tell you that Ruth Rendell strikes me as a good writer. This book is well written, but somewhat hard to follow. To me, the problem was that the book tackled too many story lines. She started with an abduction story, moved to a pedophile story, and ended with a spousal abuse story. Yes, the three stories all tied together, but not well enough (as far as I can see) to justify the book. I would have loved to see the abduction story developed into a full novel instead of being used as a filler in this book.I will admit I was disappointed in the book, but not because it was a bad book, rather because I expected more from the author. I will definately read another Ruth Rendell book as I believe this book just falls into the \\"not one of her best\\" category."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I've seen so many reader reviews who say they're bored with Wexford. I find him very refreshing and down-to-earth compared with the psychos he's dealing with. He's no saint; he's just a regular guy. Many of Rendell's characters are SO creepy that I need a little normality in there.This book, politically correct or not, was scarier than any of her others, because it's real and happens every day, everywhere. And it's practically invisible. Rendell gives this &quot;P.C.&quot; novel her own Rendellesque twists, which makes it well worth reading."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"In her 18th novel featuring Inspector Wexford Rendell weaves together multiple plots involving two missing teen-age girls, a convicted pedophile returning to his residence in Kingsmarkham and the mob violence his return touches off, and a little girl missing from an upper middle class home. Not all of these plots work well together, which is why I have given it only 4 stars.However, the central plot about the missing little girl is what captured me. The story that Ruth Rendell tells of the effects of domestic violence on an entire family is chilling and heartbreaking. Not only does the wife and mother suffer extreme mental and physical abuse but the two children remaining in the home are clearly adversely affected. The effects of domestic violence will be felt in this family long after their escape from abuse. Rendell builds an atmosphere of suspense and dread that can only be a small reflection of the terror of living in such a situation, but the empathetic reader will be much affected. There can be no real happy ending to this story, at least not immediately. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys well drawn and believable characters, especially that of Inspector Wexford who is faced with a real moral dilemma."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I've read one other Rendell book and enjoyed it. However, this one left me disappointed. As several other reviewers noted, the three plot lines about the abductions of two young girls, the pedophile and the wife beater never come together. I also felt both the social commentary and characters were shallow. The book would have been better if one or more of the plot lines were dropped and the remaining plot lines followed in greater depth."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I really liked this book. Other reviewers have written that they thought there were too many unconnected stories. I think it just shows you what a mix of people there are in this small town in England. Crime touched all neigborhoods it seems.The explanation for two of the disappearing girls was touching. What would you do in Vicky's situation?I even liked the part about the lost raincoat. The author has a nice, typically English sense of humor."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book very much,however there were so many people in it that I had a hard time remembering who was who.I think with her next book that I read,I will write names down and what they are in the story.I am now starting another Ruth Rendell book and will try this."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I read all the available Wexfords and most of the other Rendells years ago and I thought I'd go back and catch up on the stuff she'd written since then. Ugh, was this one a stinker. Not a person in the book is interesting enough to keep you reading and the pace is slow, circular and monotonously unenthralling. The author's notion of \\"casting a cold eye, on life, on death\\" is simply to disapprove of everyone, their housekeeping, their child-rearing and their lifestyles. And social outrage -- nomatter how sympathetic -- does not human interest make. Dull."},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"I really don't require a lot action in my mysteries, but this one really seemed to drag. Other reviewers have mentioned the distraction of too many plots, which also bothered me. Except for Wexford, Sylvia, and a few of the townsfolk, most of the characters were undeveloped.My main problem with the book, assuming it was indeed supposed to be a mystery, was that it was very quickly apparent to me who wrote those letters since there was such a very large clue pointing to the writer. I assume that Wexford and at least some of his minions are supposed to be reasonably intelligent and observant; how could they have missed it? SPOILER:(Yes, I realize that didn't really matter in the end, but it was still a problem.)Unlike another reviewer, I got really tired of Wexford's endless ruminating about his lost raincoat. Rendell pounds us over the head with that so much, it lost its value as a red herring. I just kept thinking, \\"Ruth must want me to think that the murder weapon is going to turn up in the pocket of that stupid raincoat, so it must not be important.\\""},{"Title":"Harm Done: A Chief Inspector Wexford Mystery","review":"Two young girls are kidnapped and shortly returned home with no harm save to their dignity.

Not her best but better than many other authors."},{"Title":"Commonsense Betting : Betting Strategies for the Racetrack","review":"This book explains the science and mathematics of \\"Wager Value\\" like no other. After reading this excellent book you will understand why the secret of handicapping is NOT determing the horse most likely to win and then betting on that horse (and you will learn Dick's number one rule... \\"no value, no bet\\"). As a student of probability I found this work top notch and consider it one of the most overlooked handicapping books ever published. ...it is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Commonsense Betting : Betting Strategies for the Racetrack","review":"Dick Mitchell, Commonsense Betting (Morrow, 1995)When one picks up a handicapping book by Dick Mitchell, one can be assured one is getting good stuff. Mitchell, a college statistics professor, knows his math. Granted, his style of relation may be annoying at times (after the fiftieth sentence starting with the word \\"please,\\" perhaps one will pick up on the not-so-slightly condescending tone), but if you can get past it, the information to be found here is great stuff. (And really, Mitchell's not as bad as some other handicapping writers.)If you've read a number of handicapping books, especially Mitchell's other works (and Winning Thoroughbred Strategies is one of the best handicapping books on the market, and should be read by every horseplayer, casual and serious), much of what's here is going to be another look at the tips and techniques we've seen before, but through the lens of money management as applied to various types of bets (exactas, pick threes, etc.); stuff the average player could probably figure out given an unlimited amount of time, computer power, and the knowledge of the right questions to ask. But why expend the energy? Get back to handicapping and let Papa Dick do the work for you.The book's real gem, though, is the last chapter. (And this will probably be a controversial paragraph with horseplayers, who are wondering why the thing was even in the book in the first place.) Mitchell abandons handicapping, racing, the whole bit altogether, and gives the punter a lesson in money management 101 for the time you spend outside the racetrack. As with his work on handicapping, Mitchell documents everything he says nicely and leaves a long, glowing trail of other reading for the handicapper to pursue; the only difference here is that Mitchell is praising the likes of Bill Donoghue rather than the likes of Jim Quinn. One you've figured out that the last chapter ain't about horses, please, don't skip it. In fact, even if you couldn't care less about horses, beg, borrow, or steal a copy of this book and read the last chapter (unless you're already familiar with outside-the-racing-world money management books by authors like Donoghue and Peter Lynch); it's stuff we could all use, and most of us don't. ****"},{"Title":"Commonsense Betting : Betting Strategies for the Racetrack","review":"This is a very good book on attaching value to your horse racing (and other) bets.

I also have stage 3 Lyme Disease and I constantly look for good information on this disease. My Doctor has tried several treatments or medications mentioned in this book that have had little or no effect on my Lyme yet. But I am reviewing several of the cases that sound similar to mine and we are trying some of the treatments. It takes time for the desired results, so I am still hopeful for a cure or improvement.This is a disease that needs to be re-defined by the medical community and recognized for the many different types of life-changing symtoms that affect so many people. Our medical insurance, if you have any, many times will not cover the types of treatments needed to aggressively fight this disease and the costs can become huge.This book has been both saddening and hope-building for me. Each chapter is an individual's journey from when they first realized that they had something wrong with them that most of the normal medical community still doesn't even want to recognize, much less treat. Their frustration, pain, and their own willpower to not give up make each chapter a story that shows you can, and sometimes must, be the person that works the hardest to improve or even save your own life."},{"Title":"Confronting Lyme Disease: What Patient Stories Teach Us (IPPY Award Winner - Health/Medicine/Nutrition)","review":"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for writing this book!!!

I wish there were books like this for other chronic diseases. I came to know about this book when I was trying to help a Lyme disease victim, a friend of a family member. I got this book for them and they said it was very helpful for them. After they returned the book I read it and found how ignorant I was about this disease. This is probably one of the worst diseases to get. Considering all the hurdles these people have to go through having to get proper care. Misdiagnosis seems to be the normal pattern I see for all these brave worriers. My heart goes out for them.One interesting fact about this book is the authors have provided all the references for people to get additional helpful information. Practically all the symptoms have been listed in the stories of these victims and it is easy to compare with your own symptoms.I am not new to misdiagnosis by medical doctors. I have seen it all my life and experienced it myself many times. This is a must read book for all the people and not just Lyme disease victims. The most important facts to remember is \\"Doctors are not gods. They do not know everything. Medical science is very complicated.\\" I only wish some of them are not arrogant but humble and listen to patients. There are a few good doctors we have to be lucky to get them.

She has Ph.D. from an accredited university and not a mail ordered degree.

It dispels the myths of lyme disease that it is easily curable, and readily addressed by the medical community. Often, patients such as myself, suffer severe disability , financial losses, and difficulty in obtaining treatment. A divided medical community, who do not know the full extend and effects of tick borne diseases, unable to reach consensuses what the diseases are , what the full effects are and the pressure from outdated studies and insurance payemnts contribute to the nightmare. Tick borne diseases have systemic effects beyond what can be described by other illnessses and chronic conditions that are already known. It defies being compared to any other disease process that is currently known to mankind. This is a must read. It is an excellent resource. The only perceived flaw that I could indicate as a lyme patient is emphasis on coinfections. The general public is unaware of the dozens or hundreds of other virsuses, pathogens and bacteria the tick carries to cause addtional harm to the victim. Sadly, the medications that treat lyme do not always control or cure the other diseases that the tick transmitts. This is a book that every family should own. One must not have a false sense of security as now most tick bites occur within several yards of the home. Any one, any where is at risk: the risk will continue to propogate. For myself? I was bitten by a tick that got into my apartment ina major East Coast metropolitan area. No camping, no hiking, no major risk factors.

Each story is the same in at least one way. No matter how many times Lyme illiterate Doctors in mainstream medicine told these sick people that there was \\"nothing\\" wrong with them the patients and their families pressed on knowing in their gut that the Doctors were wrong...it wasn't in their head.

As a Lyme patient since 1993 I would have loved to have information and the courage that this book gives you to be your own advocate and keep searching. This book tells you to never give up. It tells you where and how to seek help. I recommend this book to anyone who is chronicall ill so they may learn how to help themselves or others who need an advocate. It also gives caregives an understanding of this devasting disease. We aren't crazy, we are sick and need help. This book needs to be in every library including medical school libraries.

It is full of patients telling their stories concerning their battles with Lyme disease. It never ceases to amaze me how I can see so much of my story in the stories of others! Though we each have a unique experience with Lyme disease, so many similar things happen to each of us. This is a great book to share with family and friends. When I was first diagnosed, it was very difficult for those around me to understand how I could be so sick. Many (even the supportive friends!) thought maybe my symptoms were \\"psychosomatic\\". When I had those folks read a book or twoabout Lyme they often said, \\"Oh my God! This sounds just like you!\\" With that they quickly came to understand that these symptoms were in fact real, not induced by any psychological problem, and that I WASN'T the only one around with these same strange symptoms. Confronting Lyme Disease is not one story that shows how disastrous this disease is but FOURTEEN stories!These fourteen stories will not only help friends and family understand what you're going through, they will also help the patient understand and offer all affected by this disease hope for the future. This is definitely going to be a book I always keep extra copies of around so I can readily share it with others.Please note: I authored a small section in this book. I did this because I think this book has SO much to offer the Lyme disease community. I have no financial gain in this project and will be purchasing my books like everyone else. In fact, I will immediately purchase ten books for my family and friends to help them continue to understand what I have gone through and what I continue to deal with.

I admit mystery/thrillers are not my preferred genre, but even beyond that prejudice I found the book to be so astoundingly awful that it is still burned into my memory a decade later.Suspense? I think I was one chapter into it before the &quot;hook&quot; became obvious. Then I had to slog through a few hundred excruciating pages to watch the predictable plot line drag out. As I recall I finally skipped about a hundred pages in the middle and didn't notice the difference. I wish her editor had noticed the same thing. You could easily lop off a good third of the book with absolutely no loss whatsoever (this is generously assuming you want to keep any of it at all).I kept hoping the not-so-subtle hints in the plotline were red herrings and there would be something to surprise me, but no.There are books that are trash fiction that are just fun to read without being works of art, and I appreciate those books for what they are. I didn't appreciate this book for anything. It was just awful."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"Amnesia is the most overused plot device in popular fiction.

See cannot remember her name, if she has a family, her address. The only clues she has are a scrap of paper with a name and time written on it, a large amount of cash, and a dress covered in blood.The suspense builds as we, along with Jane, have snippets of her memory shown to us. Michael Whittaker, the man claiming to be Jane's loving husband, plays a very convincing part, even to the end.(TV movie starred Joanna Kerns and Michael Ontkean.)"},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"About the book:Jane Whittaker wakes as if from a dream at the corner of Cambridge and Bowdoin. She knows where she is going and what she planned to buy but not her name, her hair color, or her age. The first pages of this book describe what Jane remembers and what she doesn't giving the reader a feeling overwhelming dread and sympathy. Then we learn she is covered in blood under her coat and has a pocket full of money.From there, we follow Jane as she searches for help, finally landing at the hospital where her pediatrician husband, Michael, is well known. Something is her core being tells her she doesn't want to go with the man everyone says is her husband but she doesn't know why. At home memories start to surface. She realizes she has a daughter and asks about her only to be told (at first) the seven year old girl is staying with friends. Meanwhile Michael and her housekeeper, Paula, continue to insist Jane take the drugs Michael has prescribed to help her through this time of despair and insist Jane is not well enough to see her friends. But Michael's story begins to change.My take:This is a suspense mystery that you will not want to put down. The conclusion is a terrible surprise, one that many of us can relate to unfortunately.\\"See Jane Run\\" moves quickly and the sense of foreboding keeps the reader engaged throughout the entire book. It is cleanly written with a good understanding of what people in this situation would feel. The story keeps the reader guessing until quite close to the end and even then the reader wonders how Jane can ever come out of this.One of the things I most liked about the book is how the main character grew from dependency to being independent in just a first short weeks, as if the fire of this crisis made her discover what she had inside all along. By force of will she is able to put things in motion which actually help her when the reader thinks all is lost.While this book may hit too close to home for many readers, I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"Like any Joy Fielding book, this was one you could not put down from front to back.

I will admit that most of the plot was predictable, but there were a few twists and surprises, which made the book of a little more than above average rating for me.I think some of it's strongest points are the unique opening, which drew me in, and the way the entire plot is pulled nicely together to the end. Her writing is never \\"sloppy\\" and leaves no details unforgotten and no questions unanswered by the time you come to the finish.I kept getting the feeling there were probably several stories out there similar to this one, in the typical setting, characters, etc., but this was still a pretty good book that I read in two days.

Then you've got the sense of just how true the devotion of a Mother to her child/children is. Not to mention that you always &quot;just have to read one more page&quot;.This story makes you realise how terrifying it would be to have amnesia and sets you into a spiral of confusion and fear. You wonder, along with Jane Whittaker, who is lying, who is telling the truth, and whether or not she is in fact, caught in the middle of some huge conspiracy.I suspected a couple of things before they actually happened, but overall, this story was full of suspense and written in a great, readable style.

I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense and a good mystery!"},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"In the last 6-1/2 hours, my blood pressure has probably risen to unbelievable heights. I've been frightened and perplexed, I literally gasped for breath more than a few times, and I'm probably doomed to weeks of nightmares. I feel like I just ran a marathon. In other words, I read this book.I wanted to scream to Jane exactly what she should do next, as if I were actually living in her character. I could feel her frustration and helplessness. Then, at the horrifying moment when Jane learns the truth-all of the truth!-her reactions are vivid, poignant, and absolutely realistic. I really appreciated that, and after reading only my second of Joy Fielding's offerings I have a great respect for this portion of the book.This packs a wallop like few others I've seen. The villain of this piece is far creepier and more rage-worthy than anything Stephen King has invented. No loose ends and no disappointments, either.Run, don't walk, to the bookstore for this one!"},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"This book is one of the best I've read. I actually re-read it every couple of years or so (my copy is so old, it has a different cover to this one). It gets you right from page one and doesn't let go. I personally didn't see the end coming, but I've read almost all of Joy's books and this is the best by far. It's so good and if you are a fan of a good thriller, this is what you are looking for. I highly recommend it. It's one of the few books I've read from front to back without stopping (except bathroom breaks)."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"One late afternoon, a young woman finds herself wandering around the shopping centre of her town, with no idea of who she is, where she is or how she happened to get there. She discovers to her horror that the expensive but simple dress she is wearing under her coat, is covered with blood and that nearly $10,000 in hundred dollar bills, is stuffed carelessly into her pockets. Overcoming her initial fright with a huge effort, she books into a hotel for the night but feels herself growing progressively more shaky and in danger of losing control, so she reports herself to a police station. The police send her to a public hospital for examination by a psychiatrist and while she is being examined, a staff member recognizes her as Jane Whittaker, the wife of a prominent and well respected pediatrician, Dr Michael Whittaker. Her husband shows great concern for her welfare and takes her home to be cared for by a housekeeper who, under Michael's instructions, keeps her constantly sedated. Michael does a great job of \\"gaslighting\\" her to the point that she willingly accepts the sedation, believing his story that she is violent, has an uncontrollable temper and was responsible for the deaths of her own daughter and mother. It's a terrifying scenario, the reason for which I luckily did not guess, which made it even more horrifying."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"Jane Whittaker is suffering from a case of amnesia. She is found roaming the streets of Boston with thousands of dollars in her pocket and a cryptic note to call someone. She does not recognize the writing or the name of the person on the note.Jane's husband, a well-respected pediatrician is directed to Jane and returns her to their lavish home. Once at home, Jane is treated like a bird in a gilded cage. Is her loving husband someone she can recognize? Is he the same towards her before or after her amesia? And what motive does her odious maid Paula have for dismissing her claims and denying her access to other people? I detested Paula and thought she was for the birds. I loved the part where Jane exacts revenge on her. Jane suspects she is being drugged. Is there any validity to that claim? Does Jane really need to run for her life?Villians change shape and form and motives become even darker. The real question is whether or not Jane is able to recover from her amesia and unmask the villians, if any."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"Excellent--the best of Fielding's books. The most fascinating aspect of the book is that we, as readers, are gradually learning about who Jane Whittaker was, and is, at the same time that Jane is recovering from her memory loss. Jane is a very memorable character, and the subtle descriptions of her personality traits and tendencies make for a very interesting read. This is not a &quot;predictable mystery&quot; by any means, although certain people are not what they appear to be. The only problem I had with the book was Jane's nosy neighbor Carole. Would any neighbor, even a NOSY one, call your doctor husband in the middle of a scheduled surgery and tell him to get home right away just because YOU LOOKED DISTRAUGHT? I didn't quite buy that one, but overall, every minute detail about the characters and events flowed smoothly. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"See Jane Run was my first Joy Fielding book. I thought it was a great book.

Believe, you won't be sorry"},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"I read at least a hundred suspense novels a year, and I really believe that Joy Fielding is one of the best writers in the business. She is very gifted with language, and is able to create characters that are very realistic and three-dimensional. In some ways, her psychological thrillers resemble those of Mary Higgins Clark, but a little more graphic in the violence and sexual content.SEE JANE RUN is probably Joy Fielding's most successful novel, written over fifteen years ago. Many fans consider it her best. The story is relatively simple, and deals with a woman with amnesia who is desperately trying to find out the truth about her past. The story starts with a bang and is very gripping until the very end. I really enjoyed it, and I found this book very difficult to put down.If you've never read Joy Fielding before, I recommend starting with this novel. Some of her later work is uneven and sometimes features characters that are difficult to like. This novel does not have that problem, and is a great all around suspense story with a likable heroine.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"Like many readers, I was captured after the first sentence. There is something around every little corner, thus making it difficult to put down! It's smart, suspenseful, and engaging. You have no idea what lies next for Jane, who has lost her identity. Fielding gives very little away, but just enough to keep you behind Jane & her gut instinct in finding the real truth! I was not expecting the outcome at all.I also recommend reading Fielding's \\"Whispers & Lies\\". Another good one!"},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"This book starts out with a great premise: A woman finds herself walking down the city street wearing a trench coat with pockets full of money,covering a bloody dress and no memory at all. Doesn't that sound promising? It kept me interested enough to finish it, but it's about 200 pages too long. I knew very quickly that the husband was not what he pretended to be, but Fielding chose to beat the clues into the reader long after there was any suspense involved. Something of a disappointment since it was recommended highly by a friend."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"Most of the book provides a great deal of psychological suspense as Jane - and the reader - vascillates between what they believe to be real or not. Most of the book forces you to question whether or not you can ever take your own identity, memory, or very sanity for granted.Once you find out what's really going on, however, the books departs from the psychological horror, loses most of its suspense and intrigue, and begins to follow a far more predictabe woman-in-peril sort of plot. The final two chapters are particularly sudden and somewhat unbelievable.In my opinion, a more ambiguous ending - or one that leaves us some more room to doubt in Jane's reliability - would have been more interesting and been more effective in impressing upon the readers how subjective reality and memory can be. In turning the book into a thriller with a very clear resolution, the author succeeds in satisfying our curiosity, but is still somehow feels as though she - and we - have taken the easy and overly-simplified way out.That said, much of the book remains quite an enjoyable and thrilling read, and it is easy to forgive the author the ending when you remember how much you enjoyed getting to it.It is particularly interesting to re-read the first few chapers and catch on to all the clues that you may have missed the first time around."},{"Title":"See Jane Run","review":"This was my first time reading a book by Joy Fielding. I thought she did a great job. From the beginning of the book to the end it has a great mystery to it. You really want to know what is wrong with the character and you want to help her.

Just prepare yourself for an afternoon of suspense.Jane comes to and doesn't know who she is. All she knows is that she has blood on the front of her dress and she has thousands of dollars in her pockets but she doesn't know her name, nor does she know what she likes. She has no memory of who she is. And why she was standing alone on the busy streets of Boston. Amnesia. A scary psychological disorder ~~ and when she turned herself into the police, they sent her to the hospital and one of the psychologists on staff told her that something really stressful must have happened to her to block out who she is.Jane's husband rescues her ~~ and Jane tenetatively explores her life again ~~ trying to figure out who she is and why she has lost her memory but she ends up being drugged. And the story keeps getting more suspenseful ~~ you know something is going to happen, but just not what. It's great! And Fielding keeps you enthralled as you turn every page.If you are looking for a good read to sink into ~~ this book is it.

It summarized rather clearly many important points of the &quot;fish wars,&quot; tribal treaties, government-to-government relations and tribal sovereignty, family and tribal traditions, timber and dam effects on river/fish sustainability, and much more. It is clear that the author put a tremendous amount of time and energy into the research and ideas behind this book. And it is not just a &quot;history rewritten&quot; book or an attempt by one cultural group to get their two cents in on the events of 30 to 150 years passed. It's about an Indian world view, and how saving the salmon and the rivers they run through is part of the Indian way.Another aspect that I liked about this book was the lack of white bashing, and also the tremendous respect for the law of the land. This book provides many examples of the patience required to work through the American judicial system, and how the positive results of that patience can be cultural, environmental, and social... things that are impossible to measure in terms of dollars.A hint of hope is intertwined through the chapters as various governments and cultures -- people with sometimes conflicting goals and values -- are able to successfully work together as &quot;good neighbors.&quot;Inspiring and even humorous at times, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the Pacific Northwest, the environment, Indian culture, and/or the law. It would be great if this book ends up in classrooms at the junior high level on up. It also includes many excellent, crisp photos."},{"Title":"Messages from Frank's Landing: A Story of Salmon, Treaties, and the Indian Way","review":"Messages from Frank's Landing is a unique examination of a turning point in Indian sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest. For nearly 12,000 years the Nisqually and Payullup Rivers have provided food, a way of life, and a spiritual force to the Indians of the Puget Sound region. Encroachments on their land and their fishing areas began in 1833 when the Hudson's Bay Company founded Fort Nisqually to enhance the fur trade. Their reservation was decreased significantly in 1854 through a perfidious treaty agreement, triggering the Leschi War, named for the Tribal leader who lost his life for the cause. During World War I, the U.S. government broke part of the treaty, and transferred a section of the reservation along the river to the army as part of Fort Lewis. Three years later, Billy Frank bought six acres along the river which became known as Frank's Landing.In the 1930s, the salmon count fell victim to unregulated offshore commercial boats and to hydroelectric development. The end of World War II signaled a massive population increase, and many non-Indians took jobs as offshore commercial fisherman. This population boom proved disastrous as hydroelectric dams, timber harvests, road and highway development, and pesticides used in forestry and agriculture combined to endanger the rivers. By the 1960s, Indians without fishing permits were the victims of constant raids and sting operations. In this context, Frank's Landing became the focal point for the tribal assertion of treaty rights in the Northwest.In 1962, the state mounted a major raid on Nisqually fisherman during the winter salmon run. The Nisqually's passive resistance was caught on film and ended up in front-page photographs. Frank's Landing gradually became to be recognized in the 1960s as a place to go and honor a noble cause. In 1970, the United States filed United States v. Washington, on behalf of the tribes in the Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula areas that had been included in the 1854 treaties. On February 12, 1974, the Boldt Decision, as it came to be known, reaffirmed the treaties, and allocated 50% of all salmon harvested to the Indians. Indians made up less than one percent of the population, and had previously been taking only about five percent of the total salmon harvest. This was a drastic blow to the commercial and sport fisherman, and an extraordinary victory for the Indians. More significantly, the opinion recognized the tribes' sovereignty and ruled that tribal governments had the authority to regulate their members. Led by Billy Frank, Jr., the Tribe announced an ambitious program to restore the Tribe's fisheries, which had been devastated by years of pollution and misuse. To save the watershed, Frank, Jr. cooperated with two Washington state fish and wildlife agencies to find a way to operate the river for both salmon and power-production. Several projects over the next few years would ensure the livelihood of the salmon and their habitat for generations to come.Billy Frank, Jr. has served as the chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission since 1977, which includes 19 Tribes, and a staff of fifty professional biologists, ecologists, computer modelers, policy analysts, and lawyers. Billy's sister, Maiselle Bridges, founded the Wa He Lut Indian School at Frank's Landing. The founding of this school, the refusal to relinquish the right to fish despite the state's exertions, the restoration of the Nisqually watershed, and the work of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission all reflect the struggle of Indian people to endure as peoples. This book is a testament to this struggle and to this endurance. The author relies on archival research, newspaper and media accounts, secondary sources, but most of all, personal interviews and experiences with Frank, Jr. and the Nisqually people. Activist Hank Adams provides vivid photographs which document the struggle as well as the beauty of the landscape. Wilkinson provides a thoughtful and well-written narrative, and concludes by examining the global implications found within this story. Frank, Jr. ends with an offering of hope for the future: \\"We're the advocates for the salmon, the animals, the birds, the water. Put out the story of our lives, and how we live with the land, and how they're our neighbors. And how you have to respect your neighbors and work with your neighbors. So what you do is, you do what you can in your lifetime. Then that'll go on to another lifetime (104).\\""},{"Title":"Messages from Frank's Landing: A Story of Salmon, Treaties, and the Indian Way","review":"Indian law professor and scholar Charles Wilkinson has written an accessible and poignant book about a noteworthy Native American that all Americans should get to know. Billy Frank Jr. (Nisqually) has dedicated his life to protecting of the habitat, natural resources, and way of life for Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest.At age fourteen, he was arrested by Washington state wildlife wardens for fishing in the Nisqually watershed. During the 1960s, African American civil rights \\"sit-ins\\" inspired Native American \\"fish-ins.\\" This focused national attention on Frank's Landing as a key battleground for Indian demands that the federal government uphold treaty rights to end a century of Washington state interference that jeopardized tribal survival and sovereignty.This struggle created a new level of awareness about Indian fishing rights in the United States. Billy Frank's forebearer Chief Leschi insisted that the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty secure the reserved \\"right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations ... in common with all citizens of the Territory.\\"This treaty provision was violated by the state of Washington until in 1974 federal judge George Boldt ruled that \\"in common\\" meant that Indian fishers were entitled to half the harvestable catch of salmon. Despite the resistance to this decision by state officials and commercial fishing interests, the end result has been cooperation between federal, state, and tribal governments over fisheries co-management since the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Boldt decision in 1979.Billy Frank, Jr. galvanized and sustained Native American efforts that produced the most significant Indian rights case of the twentieth century. He is now the chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission fighting to restore the environment and natural resources of the western Washington treaty tribes. In 2004, Indian Country Today newspaper presented him with its Inaugural American Indian Visionary Award.Wilkinson tells Billy's story in a circular Native American style that is a welcome respite from textbooks or linear accounts of American Indian history. This book is suitable for high school students, the general reading public, and college under-graduates, and a \\"must read\\" if you live in the Pacific Northwest."},{"Title":"Contemplations on the Historical Passages of the Old and New Testaments","review":"Bishop Hall was a court preacher in the court of James I of England.

Henshaw/Boxed Set","review":"I'll start with the books I haven't read. Because I haven't read &quot;Dear Mr. Henshaw&quot; and &quot;One Eyed-Cat&quot; I had to give this collection only four stars though I'd love to give it five. &quot;Dear Mr. Henshaw&quot; was part of my elementary school library. Everyone was demanding that I read Mr. Henshaw, but there were so many other books to read so I never got around to it. I had never heard of &quot;One Eyed-Cat&quot; when I was young, but from what I hear it is worth the read.Scott O'Dell is one of my all time favorite authors. I have read &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot; a million times and would read it a million more. It is the story that first drew me to the Native American culture and his other works were equally enticing. The story of Karana's survival alone on the island of her birth and the life and family she makes for herself there is magnificent. Her neverending yearning for her people, but continuing love for the home she makes creates a bittersweet ending when she leaves for her people. It is made even more sad when in his author's notes O'Dell revealed that her people never made it to their new home and that is why they never sent for her. Scot O'Dell writes an alluting tale of a woman who must survive on her own. I would heartily recommend any book he has written.Elizabeth George Speare is not far behind on my favorite author list. I also read &quot;The Sign of the Beaver&quot; a million times. It is a wonderful story of a wary friendship between a teenage white settler left to care for their new home while his father goes to fetch his mother, sister, and the soon to be born baby and a teenage Indian who has inherited the bitterness of his culture to the white man. Together they teach each other what is needed to know to survive in the other's world. Another bittersweet ending, this is a wonderful story about how two radically different people can learn to respect the other and what they have to offer. &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; is the story about a girl from the Caribbean who is tossed into her own survival story when she must live with her Puritan relatives. Here, her culture of clashes with the rigid structure of the Puritan people who consider her a hopeless sinner. They radically distrust her and it comes to a head when she is accused of witchcraft. The only drawback of this story is that it helps to understand the Puritans and it is my experience that their history is learned in highschool when one is just a tad old for her works."},{"Title":"The Newbery Award Library: Island of the Blue Dolphins/The Witch of Blackbird Pond/The Sign of the Beaver/One-eyed Cat/Dear Me.

Irigaray demonstrates how to dislodge, disrupt, and destabilize the barriers founded by certain academic standards. She dares to use words to describe the futility of words.&quot;...if your words have such seductive power, such a potent charge of investment, is it not because they come to fill the place of a desire deprived of words? Borrowing their strength from energy free from any declaration. A fundamental misunderstanding lies within your language: what it carries of persuasive power does not belong to speech but to what it covers in silence.&quot;(36)Another way Irigaray problematizes the othering of the spirit world is through exploding linear, normative conceptions of time and space in her reconstruction of infinity. She speaks of the current model of time as something which holds power by relying on a timeless void as its opposite. She defies this dualistic construction, describing not an abyss which relies on fullness and definition, but a fullness so vast it has the capacity to lodge emptiness within it.&quot;That invisible presence bearing you, supporting you there where you set up an opposing illusion of indifference as limit to your own desire. As a stasis at each point, guarding against the risk of overflowing which would lead to your downfall. Your vanishing into the immense space where you place that void which maintains your coherence.&quot; (Passions, 20)This book is a delightful contrast to the cold, hard and cerebral discourse most noted for contemporary theories of psychology, philosophy, feminism, and politics!"},{"Title":"Hungry Thing","review":"My daughter loves this book.

The authors have given us a work that is full of historical, linguistic, and archaeological information, a great majority of which is still quite current. They perform very admirably, as well, in refuting the rationalistic Biblical criticism of their day and in upholding the veracity of the Scriptures. A word of warning, however, is in order. Hendrickson Publishers (who is responsible for this edition) has done a less-than-thorough job of editing the text. I have had my set for less than a year and have done in-depth study in only two of the volumes. However, both of these have been riddled with typographical errors. There are several punctuation mistakes, but the real problem lies in running words together (for instance, the phrase &quot;it has been&quot; appears as &quot;ith as been,&quot; and so forth). These can be mildly annoying but, in the end, the sheer value and richness of the commentary overshadows these problems and should not deter the interested reader from taking advantage of the tremendous learning of Messrs. Keil and Delitzsch."},{"Title":"Commentary on the Old Testament","review":"Keil &amp; Delitzsch is a great help that I use quite often. Sometimes a little dry, and not the best book to read while you are sleepy, nevertheless K&amp;D will give you a wealth of information as to what the original Hebrew says.I've found these volumes particularily useful studying the prophets. When there was a point of comparison in the Hebrew poetry that I didn't understand, K&amp;D came through for me with a clear explanation.An even better OT Commentary is the one by Leupold. I find his &quot;Genesis&quot; clearer and better written than Keil &amp; Delitzsch. Unfortunately, Leupold did not write a commentary on the ENTIRE OT, so K&amp;D remains your best source for sound commentary on the whole Old Testament."},{"Title":"Commentary on the Old Testament","review":"It's like plowing in fertile soil to peruse the volumes of Keil &amp; Delitzsch. The authors examine the cultural aspects that background each Old Testament book, and squeeze the Hebrew and cognate languages to provide the best possible interpretation. Nor are the authors myopic; for they note within the text and within rich footnotes the conclusions of others --even those with whom they disagree. One does not always have to agree with an author's harvested conclusion in order to find benefit in study.

We read it every night before bed). At first, when I read it, I wasn't impressed with it at all. But then, the more we read it, I became wrapped up in the story through my daughter's enthusiasm of finding the little mouse in the pages and realized the sheer joy of her learning experience through reading and imagination. The lines are very short so little ones won't be easily bored waiting for the page to turn and it is so much fun for her to find the little mouse in each colored page, to watch her put her little finger to her mouth and whisper 'hush' with the little old lady in the corner, and to point out other objects in the room.The story is based on a little bunny going to bed and saying goodnight to various items in his room and with each turn of the page, the light in his room grows dimmer. '...Goodnight mush/And goodnight to the old lady whispering \\"hush\\"/Goodnight stars/Goodnight air/Goodnight noises everywhere' and with that the room is dark and the bunny is fast asleep. The book alternates between color pages and black & white pages during the story. The pages show full color the little bunny's room where a little mouse hides in different areas and is waiting to be found by little searching eyes. Then the pages alternate to black and white that show other items that are found in the room that the bunny says goodnight to.I have also found that if my daughter is hyper before bedtime, this book helps calm her down through the repetition of saying goodnight, by lowering my voice with each page that we turn and it actually helps prepare her for bed just like the bunny.This is a very short, very colorful and very fun book for little ones.

The pages are colorfully and the words are small and easy for your little ones to say.It's a book that every child should have in their collection."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"To be honest (and you know I always am), I really hate this book. I hate reading it. I find it boring and redundant and mind numbing almost. But, as much as I hate the book itself, I absolutely adore what it has done for my daughter.Yes, no matter how I feel about the book in general, I must admit that it has had some wonderful affects on my child. The book is simple enough to inspire her to read. Sure, she is not yet two and so she isn't quite READING yet, but the simple wording and straightforward pictures have caused my daughter to learn what it is she is saying \`goodnight' to. As a parent I can say that there is nothing more rewarding than watching your child learn and grow, and regardless of how much I hate this book as an adult I can see why she loves it and watching her love it makes me love it.Does that make any sense?If you have children I'm sure you get what I'm saying.Now, I will tell you just why I'm not the biggest fan of the book itself. I do find the illustrations to be very old fashioned and the overly simple nature of the story (there is no story) leads to redundancy. Each page feels like the page that came before it, and thus it feels like it never ends. When we first got the book and my daughter was too young to really react and or repeat anything I was saying I found the book a nightmare to get through, but now that she does repeat and say pretty much word in the book it is not such a pain. They could modernize this with some nice illustrations too. I mean, one of the things I love about children's books is the vibrant colors and the crazy art inside. This book is rather dull in that regard.So, in the end; it is a great learning tool and it is a book that your little one will enjoy very much, but I urge you to wait until they are a bit older and can actually learn something from the book; that way it won't be such a bore.I can't give this a really poor rating because it's not a book for me. If this were a book I read and not my daughter it would have a D at best, but the expression on her face when we read this before bedtime says it all. I'm giving it a B. To her it is an A, but really, it could have been a lot better."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 2 boys love this book, as do I.

Unfortunately, Mr Dress-up is no longer with us, but &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; is and what a delightful book it is. It serves to tell children that we are not all the same, our rooms are not all the same, but that it is okay to be be different because we are all special in our own way. The illustrations are wonderful and a pesky little mouse will peak out from everywhere. Children will remember this book for many years to come...and so will you."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I remember having this book read to me as a young child and now enjoy sharing those happy memories with my infant son.

This is a great book for kids 5 yrs. and under."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is my daughter's favorite book and she loves to read it each night before we go to bed.

I'd never heard of it but we all immediately loved it. When my daughter was three, we had to move. To prepare her for the move, we explained what was going to happen and gave her a chance to run around the new house. Especially, we read Good Night Moon every night for two or three weeks before the move. After the bunny said good night to everything in his room, I would say good night to all the important things in my daughter's room, pointing to them and making sure she saw them. When we moved, we set up her room first, and that first night, we read Good Night Moon and said good night to everything in her room. Not a peep that first night. Worked like a charm. Very smooth move for her.The real bunnies are long gone but they helped introduce us to several good rabbit stories. We give GNM and The Runaway Bunny to friends who are new parents. Now we're going to begin adding Guess How Much I Love You."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It's a classic, and I would recommend owning it, but it's not a top-ten story. Our daughter shows little interest in this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It is so bad that I periodically hide it from my son so that I am not forced to endure it. When he finds it, I sometimes make up my own words to amuse myself and my husband. Boring pictures, no story line, poorly written text (ex. rhyming moon with moon...the author couldn't come up with anything else?). I dread seeing my son coming towards me with this book.That being said, the tot loves this book. I take no credit for his bad taste. However, since it is HIS book, it gets 3 stars to reflect our combined feelings about this piece of literature."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I first have to say that I am 30 years old at the time of writing and I had never read this story as a child. I bought it recently for my three-year-old nephew because of its reputation as a classic children's story, and I read it for the first time when it was delivered. Before receiving it, I read some of the negative reviews and wrote them off as \\"just not getting it,\\" despite the fact that I hadn't actually read it yet. I just figured a classic story such as this couldn't possibly be bad.Unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the negative comments I've read. This book's reputation seems to be based more on good memories of having read it as a child than of it actually being a good read in itself. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but there are certain things I look for in stories that I buy for my nephew, and this book did not have them.Ironically, what I think is the biggest problem is probably what many people find so appealing about it: the simple phrases of \\"Goodnight X, goodnight Y\\" are simplistic to the point of stupidity, and that's the entire book. Each page has one or two of these phrases, which means you will be turning the pages rather quickly. Granted, you can dwell on each page and study the items in the room, and let your child find the mouse hidden on most (but not all) pages (which my nephew enjoys doing), but there are two problems with doing this: 1) I read to my nephew with just a bedside lamp on, so it's difficult to lie there and study the page up close because the room is fairly dark (and don't we want it dark when they're trying to go to sleep?), and 2) this severely breaks up the rhythm of the story -- not that there is much of story anyway, but saying \\"Goodnight socks\\" and then spending two minutes looking at items on the page, then turning the page and saying \\"Goodnight mouse\\" is not my idea of a compelling story for a child to learn from.I also don't understand why every other pair of pages is in black and white. If the writing isn't so stellar, then the artwork should be, and it is fine on the colored pages, but the black and white pages are rather boring.What I'd like from a children's book is a story interesting enough to capture my nephew's imagination and keep him interested in the characters or events. I'd also like more sustained writing so that he can hear the flow of sentences and enhance his vocabulary. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" offers neither of these things."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I'm not a big fan of this book. My two year old seems to like it but I'm grossed out by the illustrations. Luckily, I got this through my Border's rewards and I didn't pay cash for it. The Sleep Book by Dr. Seus is my recommendation."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son LOVES books but has no interest in this book - NONE. I probably read 30+ books a day to him. At 12 months he can sit through average length books (e.g. Brown Bear Brown Bear, What Do You See?) and some longer length books (e.g. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom - his favorite). He won't even sit through the first half of this book and it's relatively short. I don't understand what people see in this book. The black & white pages are very dull and the objects that are mentioned in the book are so small I have to look for them. Neither the illustrations nor the wording hold a young child's attention. There are so many other nighttime books that are more appealing to young children. Save your money and space on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Saying that this is book is wrong on any level. Approx. 1-2 padded cloth &#34;pages&#34; with very little text - no story at all! All I can say it is good for is for gumming. It says hardcover, but don't let that fool you; the only paper is the flimsy cardboard it comes in. Not the classic we brought our children up with - very disappointed that I had to return. A waste of my time. I had to go elsewhere to find my grandson a replacement for his favorite book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Everyone was telling us we had to get this book, so I got it and I'm not all that impressed. I thought it was pretty boring and my one year old did too. She won't let me get even half way through it before grabbing for another book. The bunny that came with it was cute! Maybe she'll enjoy it more when she gets older?? As of right now, though, it's not one of our favorites. I know it's a classic, but I really don't see what all of the hype is about."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is much lauded, but makes little sense. There's a creepy old lady whispering \\"hush\\" and an intentionally blank page, and half the pictures are boring, tiny renderings in black and white. Do not recommend."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This Plush book is TERRIBLE only two pages I don't even understand why they would make this what a rip"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Perhaps the reason Goodnight Moon is still a classic piece of literature is because the three people who composed this work were at the very top of their game: Author Maragaret Wise Brown, illustrator Clement Hurd and editor Ursula Nordstrom. This combination of exquisite, mature talents has rarely been seen or duplicated in children's books. What they accomplished was so amazing that on a publishing level alone, this book deserves its top ranking. This is a complete work because these three people were completely in rhythm.Speaking of rhythm, what I love best about this book is the way the lyrical cadence of the story is perfectly matched to the pictures by a classic one-two-three beat. There are two facing pages of black and white text and pictures (the one and the two beats) followed by the double-page color spread (the third beat). This pattern is represented throughout the story. It's little wonder that children are both lulled by and glom to the heartbeat of this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Summary:An older book (about 50+ years), that is entertaining for young children, with a cute &quot;rabbit&quot; main character. It lets children know that when they go to bed at night, they safely go to sleep with their &quot;friends&quot; (inanimate objects) around them making &quot;sleepy-time&quot; a time of warm and simple magic.Educational Summary:Simple soothing words, good rhythms, a few primary colors, simple story, simple and common objects.Story:A rabbit goes to bed and says goodnight to all the objects he sees in his room (mittens, mouse, clock, etc.), and outside his window (moon).Negatives:First, kids really love this book, so my negative may not really be important. But, the book is not really very colorful, and the story seems a bit slow. But, my kids really liked to have it read to them and never seemed to tire of it. So, what do I know?!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"&quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; was my granddaughter's (who is going on seven) favorite bedtime story. It is the only book that she would allow my son to read to her before going to sleep at night. No matter how many times he read it to her, she never got bored with it. When I, her grandmother, took care of her at times, I also had to read this book before she would close her eyes to go to sleep. As she grew older, before I could point out the various objects in the book, she was way ahead of me and said the names of them before I could utter a word. I am a retired school teacher, and I believe books like &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; help children become familiar with &quot;beloved&quot; objects, and the repetition of them, I believe, leads to &quot;letter&quot; then &quot;word&quot; recognigion as they grow older. It is a wonderful, and beautifully illustrated book for children and was a joy to read to my granddaughter no matter how many times I had to read it to her!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son received this set as a gift last year, at ten months old, and of course we thought he looked all too funny wearing the slippers.

I thought it was going to be forever before I got any use out of it. I was told that it is good to read to your baby even when they are really tiny, so I did. I would set my daughter in my lap and read to her. She start following the bright pages as soon as she could focus. She loves to look at the pages and she is now starting to laugh at different pictures on the pages. We look for the mouse all the time.

I am glad it is a good sturdy book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"As I have read several other's reviews of this children's classic, I see there are some mixed emotions about it. I can only tell you how my 14 month old nephew responds to it, as it was one of the very first books I bought him. My sister-in-law tells me it's one of his most favorite books. They read it almost every night as she's preparing him for bed. It is very simplistic in it's reading, but perhaps has a rhythmic type flow that really captures my nephew. Or it may also be the alteration of colored and B&amp;W pictures. Whatever it is, my nephew loves it! It has a soothing type of effect on him. In fact, I'll somtimes quote parts of the book to him and he always looks at me and baby jabbers, as if to say he recognizes those words. Essentialy, this book is about the goodnight wishes a little one can relate to and in the process of reading it, I believe contributes to the development of his own speech, just as many children's books do. By the way, I also bought my nephew a stuffed version of the &quot;Lil Bunny&quot; in the book. He loved it. I think he doesn't pay as much attention to it now that he's a little older, because he's so busy exploring other things but, it makes for a nice gift to include with this book. Not too expensive. I realize different children like different kinds of books but, Goodnight Moon is pleasurable and I think it would be worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When I first received this book I was a little surprised.

She will be four soon and still loves this book! She enjoys the rhymes and bright, bold colors--and the bunny.I think what makes this book so special, among many things, is that it's short, full of contrasting, bright colors, and the fact that \\"Mommy\\" is reading it. I cuddle up with her and have the lights dimmed and she's dressed and ready for bed with her favorite blanket, relaxed and ready to look and listen.The part after, \\"Goodnight comb, And goodnight brush,\\" where it next says, \\"Goodnight nobody,\\" I have placed a baby picture of my daughter and we say together, \\"Goodnight________,\\"(her name.) She enjoys seeing herself in the book and I think it's great for her to basically tell herself to go to sleep!The last full-page spread (which by the way, every colored page is a full-page spread) is particularly pleasant; the lights are dimmed in the baby bunny's room, he's in in his pajamas in his bed under the covers and the only things that are dominant and glowing are the moon and night stars, the fire in the fireplace, and the toyhouse's lights. Looking at that, what else would a child want to do but follow the bunny's lead and go to sleep? Goodnight Moon! (Big yawn...)Suggestion: If your child doesn't want to let you leave after reading the book, you can make up your own \\"Goodnight ROOM\\" story and help him/her say goodnight to objects in his/her room.

It didn't stop me from buying one for my friend though."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book for my daughter - in paperback, hardback, coloring book, etc.!

It's hard to believe that it was written 60 years ago, but that's what classic children stories should look like. My toddler loves it, and so do we. It's interesting that we didn't read a book for a couple of months, then returned to it and realized that she actually remembers it very well and is able to supply the next word in the story. It's not as entertaining as her other bedtime selections, but it's very calming and I think that this book will have a long lasting life in our library."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a delightful book and a wonderful addition to any child's book collection. As a little girl, it was mine and my sister's favorite book. Having just announced her pregnancy to the family, we've all commented that Goodnight Moon will surely be read to my sister's little one often. In fact, the baby will probably end up with more than one copy!The rhythmic text detailing a nightly routine reassures little ones as they prepare for slumber that all is well. Read before bedtime, the simplistic nature of the book enables even very young children to remember the story and relate to the little bunny's experience. Goodnight Moon helps children realize that bedtime is normal and routine and nothing to be anxious about. I remember saying goodnight to some of my toys and knowing then that it was ok to fall asleep. It's just a wonderful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Having 42 grandchildren and 46 great grandchildren and being an advocate for reading, reading, reading I believe this book is the greatest for children to hear as first words from parents (well, first words after \\"I love you, darling.\\") I have testimonials of positive results from grandchildren of the effect the reading of this book has on even infants."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We read this every night and has helped to establish a good bedtime routine, and ease off the bottle"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 2 year old daughter was given this book by her Grandad, and it has become an integral part of the bed-time routine. Every night I read her a couple of other stories and then she asks for 'Moon'. She settles down in her bed, just like the rabbit, and points to everything that is mentioned in the story, counting the three little bears sitting on chairs and the two kittens. She then waves goodnight to everything and whispers \\"hush\\" with the little old lady. By the end of the story the gentle wording has lulled her so that her eyes are heavy and she easily sleeps.I love this book, because with it my daughter and I share something special every night that parents and children have shared together for generations. It is a timeless classic because it understands how children see the world."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love the night light. It's just enough light to avoid stubbing a toe. Love the book too."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter LOVE this book. They especially love that on every colored page there is a tiny mouse hidden somewhere and they always race to see which one of them will find it first. I HIGHLY recommend this book and if anyone knows of other books with hidden pictures I'd love to hear about it!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book was my son's favorite story. We read it every night until we had every word memorize. When I was a pre-school teacher, I would read it to them. Children love this story. They would learn the words for different items in their own rooms. They love how the words rhyme and usually finish the sentence. The tape is wonderful. One side tells the story so your child can \\"read\\" along. The other side is soft soothing music that will put any child, (and Adult) to sleep. I have loved this book for years and have bought this set before. It is one of my favorites, my son's favorite and my 4 yr old class favorite."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This short children's book was my night time lullaby for many years. The sweet rhyme schemes and flowing rhythm of Goodnight Moon would shuttling me into a soundless sleep. Just hearing the title makes me relax and feel safe. My reasoning for a perfect five star rating was that, the end rhyme is creative and flows perfectly off the tongue. The illustrations are quaint, and calming. But among all else, I love the mouse that finds its way onto ever page, as a kindergartener I would play with my family a game we made up with the book, \\"who could find the small mouse first.\\" Even at that age I memorized where the mouse was on every page and I would win the contest with my family every time. I will treasure this book forever and I plan on reading Goodnight Moon to my children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book in one of my daughter's favorites and I read it to her every night before bedtime for a couple of years. It's a classic with not only captivating prose, but great illustrations that your child will love. I'd recommend getting the companion book, \\"My World\\" also by Margaret Wise Brown. It's more of a 'daytime' book, but still a wonder."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"What can you say? I think every parent has this book in their library and it's just so fun to read, as well as having your kids point out everything on every page. It's just one of those books that you don't think about having in your home. It's just there period. And if not, you can be sure grandma will get it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Our 7 and 8 year old boys each had their own \\"Goodnight Moon\\" books. When our baby girl arrived a year and a half ago, we read one of the boys' books to her until we realized it was the ONLY book she wanted to hear. At 4 mos. when we'd try to read some of our other family favorites (Guess How Much I Love You, Wheels on the Bus, Chicka Chick Boom Boom and other GREAT classics) she would actually lean forward and shove the book away. She'd continue to do so until we'd pick up Goodnight Moon. Needless to say, the \\"old copies\\" were bound to get pretty ratty with so much use so we asked Santa to bring her a Goodnight Moon of her very own. She was so thrilled and she LOVED the bunny slippers. Unfortunately, the slippers were a bit too small but she'd squish her feet in them and waddle around anyway! Now, I've convinced her that her big dolly has cold feet so dolly is allowed to wear the adorable slippers! And, while we still sit down and turn the pages of \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and read it the \\"traditional\\" way every now and then, it's become a nightly ritual -- after prayers and \\"tuck in\\" -- to recite (from memory) the story as we tiptoe out of the room. By the time we reach \\"goodnight nobody\\" our baby's eyes are closed and we don't hear another peep till morning. God bless Margaret Wise Brown!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Although this book is an abbreviated version of the full text, the story is complete for the newest of babies.

Since then I've read it to my girls (age 1 and 2) several times and always enjoy doing so. My now 2 1/2 year old loves reading it because its easy for her to identify objects and read back to me. Great for bedtime, excellent for infants and toddlers. Definitely would reccomend."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book for my friend's little girl. I was hesitant at first but glad I bought it. It is cardboard but very strong. Its held up very well :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this for a friend's son, becacuse my family read it to me as a baby. It's simple, adorable, an easy read for Mom, and a classic that every baby should have, and the best part is, you can read it over and over again, and you'll never get tired of it. Well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My kids love this book and I enjoy reading it as well.

However, some things should be pointed out.1. This is a BEDTIME book. It is about saying goodnight to the world so it isn't overly vibrant or involved.2. Newborns and infants are not typically overly fascinated with ANY night time book because they have soft colors and are like a lullaby. When this book will really impact your child is when they are 18, 24, or 30 months. They will hear the rhythm of the poem with the rhyming in place and before you know it, your 2 year old will know that when you say \\"2 little kittens and a pair of...\\" it is time to say Mittens.3. The book works better once you memorize it. Then you can let your child have control of the pages which they always appreciate, plus you can get the rhyming more in tempo which helps the interest of the book.4. Yes, there are black and white pages. black and white is engaging to a young child and good for their development also. AND to the person who swears that when they were a kid, they liked it so it must have been more vibrant, doesn't know what they are talking about. My copy is 30 years old and it looks exactly like my sons board book copy other then the size (the paperback is larger in size then the board book version but the content is exactly the same.)This is a perfect book to read as a last book right before turning out the light and singing twinkle twinkle etc. I did this just an hour ago (well he \\"made\\" me read it twice) and had a 2 year old fall to sleep right away upon being set in his crib...no crying, no problems."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is without a doubt my 3-year-old's favorite bedtime book of all time! He's been having it read to him since he was around 18 months old, and still asks for it regularly.The book is quick - a few words on each page - and maybe a couple dozen pages long. It's set in the room a small bunny is going to sleep in, with a large number of details. The bunny says goodnight to the objects in the room one by one, including pictures and characters in the pictures, \\"and a comb, and a brush, and a bowl full of mush.\\" If you get this to read to your kid, you'll have it memorized in no time! On the bright side, it's pleasant enough that you won't regret that fact :)I've tried to figure out exactly what my son loves about this book, so I can buy other similar books. So far, no luck. Regardless, you can't go wrong with your toddler using 'Goodnight Moon' as bedtime reading!The 'board book' is nice, because it holds up to the grasping hands of toddlers without being destroyed. This is the form factor I'd recommend.I'd buy this again in a heartbeat if I lost it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son is almost three, and loves his books at bedtime. Of all the books he has, there are only about five that he asks for by name, and \\"Goodnight Moon\\" became one of them within days of owning it. It's a nice book, and the narrative is great for reading slowly and quietly, winding down to the final \\"good night,\\" so it makes a great last book of the night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Such a fun book for baby and is a good teaching tool for toddlers.Also check out the Good Night (Denver, DC, Philadelphia, etc.) books.Nice collection to keep."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book was given to me as a baby shower gift from a dear friend. When I first looked through it, I didn't see what all the fuss over this book was about. The pictures are not lively, some of them are even black and white. I thought it was just okay. With that said, my 8-month old daughter loves this book. She loves when I read it to her before bed. It is the only book that we have that she will sit through repeatedly. Everytime I try to throw a new book in she starts fussing half way through. So, I usually just end up reading this book over and over again. Great for small children! Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Does it go without saying that this book is classic? Touching, yet simple, never cloyingly sweet. The brief good-nights are easy for young children to remember, and the phrases tend to stick with you into adulthood, carrying with them sweet childhood memories (I say that, and I'm a die-hard cynic).I'm writing more to recommend this board book edition as a great baby gift. For that kid who's going to have everything he or she NEEDS and who's had a hundred baby showers already, a book is a PERFECT gift. And, as a librarian, I can vouch for the fact that board books are multi-purpose items: for whatever reason, toddlers love to carry these things around like a favorite stuffed animal. And what better way to get them started on the path to reading?So, there you have it: a timeless children's classic in the ultimate child-friendly form."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic, I read this to my 7 year old when he was a baby, he now reads it to is 7 month old sister. Full circle joy. Great bed time story, makes bedtime fun time."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was the first book I bought for my nephew when I learned that my sister was pregnant. It is also the last book I read to him every night before bed when he sleeps over at my house. He just loves the calming rythme and the soothing words. At 2-years-old, he is beginning to recite the words on his own. It is so wonderful to see him loving something that is not noisy and battery-charged! I know that he will love this for some time to come, and perhaps even pass it on someday. As for me, I love the classicly drawn illustrations (alternating black and white with color) and the coziness of it all."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic bedtime book! I love the mix of color and black and white illustration. The pages are easy to turn for little hands and the book is full of vocabulary words to introduce to budding talkers!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Good Night Moon is a simple bedtime book that is perfect for sharing with little ones ages six months to three years. It begins by naming various items found in a little bunny's \\"Great Green Room,\\" and then goes on to say good night to each one of them.Reading Good Night Moon nightly is not only a lovely bedtime ritual, but also a great way to begin building a vocabulary for a little one. My children also enjoyed looking for the little white mouse in the illustrations. Trying to remember where the mouse was on each page was a great memory booster. I believe that this classic bedtime book should be on the bookshelf of every nursery."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 23 Month Old loves this book before he goes to bed. He loves pointing out the cats and the mittens and the moon and the stars and of course the little mouse. We have read this book so many times to him that he reads it to us now!Great Book!!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When I first read this book I thought it was sort of dull, but my kids without fail have loved it and it has become their favorite (I have 4 children). Also as I have read it over and over, and over I have noticed some of the nice touches in the book like the little mouse that moves from place to place (kids like to find that as they get a bit older) and the fact that the bears on the chairs have a picture on the wall that is the same as.. well I won't give it away. Margaret Wise Brown created a treasure when she wrote this book. Start them off with books like this and then when they get older move them onto Roald Dahl, you won't go wrong."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love this classic children's book. It's about the wonderful patterns of life. I bought this for my niece. She loved it. I was looking for a book called \\"I AM A TREE\\" by R.A. Lupo and found this one. She loved it. [...]But it is classic children's book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is so rightly a classic.Simple, but not as simple as it seems.The drawings and the text are repetitive, but not exactly, giving a growing mind tiny differences to notice and comprehend, to the delight of child and adult alike. Read aloud gently, it really does lull.Of the many children's books I have shared with my babies, this is the one that we (adults included) have yet to find tiresome (even with multiple readings a night at times). We're on our second copy of the board book -- the first is tattered from too much love."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is a bedtime classic, and here's why. Most children benefit from a bedtime routine. It's smart to have them do the same things in the same order, as it establishes a pattern that they can count on, all leading towards a good night's sleep. This book allows a child and their parent to create a pattern of repetition that leads towards sleep. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has a cadence and a pattern to it that allows the child to both add to the 'goodnights' as well as participate in the ritual of getting sleepy."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I cant believe what an instant hit this book has been. Our two year old has a collection of 20 or so books, all of which he plays with but is never that interested in being read the stories. We needed a book to become part of a night time routine and this book became an instant favourite. We have to negotiate maximum number of times we read it before starting!He loves finding the pictures mentioned in the poem, also joining in when he hears the word \\"hush\\" and I love how the pictures get darker and darker until you see a room at night time, really sets the atmosphere for going to sleep.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a \\"calm-me-down\\" book; a \\"getting ready for sleep\\" book. I have read this book countless times. Children find the text slow and comforting. They seem to find comfort in the clear,uncluttered illustrations. They have seen the same views from their own windows and seem to find peace as the text is read. There is no exciting story and no tremendous message or lesson, but what there is is a readiness for sleep and the assurance that all is well."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The book has pictures in both color and black&white. Hence its meant for babies in their early days and lil later. The rhythmic sound of words makes my son jump with joy. This is my baby's first book and I'd say the book is worth it. But pairing the book with the lil toy isn't good for money. The stuffed toy is very small in size (would easily fit in your palm). You can buy just the book (board) for half this price."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I got this book as a gift when my youngest son was born. Like others, I thought it was a stupid book, but it was simple and he seemed to love it. We would read it over and over. The book disappeared over the years, but my son is now 22 with a daughter of his own on the way, and this book was at the top of his list of most wanted items for her!11/29/11The baby mentioned above is now two. Every time I babysit, we have to read this book multiple times. I still think it is stupid but she loves it :-) She loves to point out the different objects and tell me what they are."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a pretty good bedtime book because it exudes a very mellow mood. Some of the illustrations are also quite nice and children are drawn to some of the images - the moon, fire, mouse, etc. I personally find the book a bit boring and overrated, but my kids seem to like it fairly well, and as I said, it's a good book in terms of being relaxing before bedtime."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter is 20 months old, she has to take this book to bed with her EVERY night.We always read it before bed, at night or at nap time. Its become our favorite story, hands down. I highly recommend this book, i loved it as a child myself and I've rediscovered it through her eyes again.The flow of the words, the illustrations, even the way in which the room becomes darker and darker from page to page... it all prepares your little one for a good nights rest. It leaves you with such a warm calm feeling. On the last page, Sophie always points out that the \\"bunny seepin' ..sssshhh ni nite.\\"Your child's bedtime story collection isn't complete without this book!!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is so simply yet magical. I read it to my daughter at bed time because it's soothing and it calms her down. Must have!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I still own the 1947 edition of this all-time great children's book. There are few children's books ever written that are more special. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is perfect for putting the kids to bed with. It will gently induce them to a state of serenity as the young rabbit in the great green room says goodnight to all in its surroundings. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" offers the coziness of goodnight to kittens and mittens, clocks and socks, mush and the old rabbit lady whispering \\"hush.\\"The atmosphere is still. The pages with black & white illustrations are good but not memorable; the color illustrations, however, are classic. The great green room is balanced heavily with red and also with other colors. Does the texture everywhere tell us we in a cottage? Perhaps, but regardless the pictures are surreal, very enjoyable as the colored pages fade from bright to dark as the night sets in. The calming images in \\"Goodnight Moon\\" -- with the unforgettable cow jumping over the moon -- and the simple rhymes of the words truly became a part of me. Expect the kids to love it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I received this book as a shower gift and thought it looked outdated.

I will buy a copy for every expectant mother I know along with \\"Peek a Who\\" - our other household favorite!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son and I read this book for the very first time this past week. At only 7 days old, Gavin found this book fascinating! I was amazed how he stared at the pictures, taking it all in. He loves this book! I sit the bunny next to him and we read the book every night at bedtime - usually 3 times through and he is quiet and attentive the whole time. He's only 2 weeks old now and I can't wait for him to grow older with this book so he can start pointing out the things in the pictures that have him so spellbound. I plan to get this book for all my expecting friends."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great book - my baby loves having it read to him, and will amuse himself for minutes at a time (a big accomplishment, believe me) flipping through it on his own, too.

Now, I love the fact that I can share that experience with my daughter, and enjoy reading it to her, much the same way as it was read to me.I find the simplicity of the story, drawings and language near perfection for a 'night-time' book, and still feel a sense of 'magic' of when reading it today. I look forward to sharing this with my children for years to come."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a simple book based on items in the bedroom as a bunny goes to bed at night. It is a classic, never-ending tale of a bunny fighting to go to bed at night. So he tries to prolong the inevitable by naming everything in his room and saying good night to it.

The pictures are gentle and sweet and only enhance the text.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"In our family \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has become a \\"read-every-night book.\\" As the bunny calmly says goodnight to everything inside and outside the window, our children seem to feel a comforting sense of predictability, security and peace as they wind down for sleep. Part of our current bedtime ritual also includes pointing out the mouse in each color illustration. My husband and I enjoy reading picture books with our two sons, ages 2 and 4. Many are simply for pure fun and enjoyment together. However, we have also found that some books serve as a wonderful opportunity for us to continue teaching a lesson about our family rules and values. For example, we can calmly revisit a situation with our boys by reading a picture book, away from the heat of the moment of their ocassional, embarrassing, angry behavior by reading \\"Elbert's Bad Word\\" or \\"How Are You Peeling.\\" When we find ourselves searching for the appropriate words to use, we discovered that a book can often get the point or lesson across to a young child in just the right way. Sometimes, the text or pictures encourages our children to ask questions or make comments, thereby giving us a clearer sense of their understanding. Then we can focus further discussion as needed. We found a great little book with an awesome annotated listing of over 100 excellent picture books to read with a 2, 3, 4, or 5-year-old called \\"The Pocket Parent\\". This quick read parenting guide addresses many hot-button issues we have experieneced with our toddlers--such as Bedtime, Bad Words, Morning Crazies, Thumb sucking, Tantrums, Whining and more. Reading appropriate books, like \\"Goodnight Moon\\", is definitely one effective way that helps me establish comforting routines with my children while keeping lines of communication open to discuss concerns and solve problems together when needed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is delightfully winsome and charming. The illustrations are wonderful. I wish my home were as cozy as that little rabbit's sometimes...Perhaps best of all, the poem is very easily memorized. I can turn off the light near the end, while tucking my daughter into her crib. Or even better, while traveling, I can recite it and let the comforting rhyme soothe her, even if I forgot to bring the book. Heck, I even think it to myself when I'm having a tough time falling asleep!An indispensable classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When I first bought this book I wondered what why it was always listed as a favorite.

They have piles of books but demand that we read this one every night -- sometimes multiple times.I can understand that some kids just don't like some things but some of the negative reviews (a small minority) are just bizarre. For example, it's creepy that the old lady disappears? Um, how about she sat up with her grandchild until he fell asleep, then continued her knitting in another room?What did immediately strike me about the book (it was not part of my childhood so I had never seen it before) was how big and well-appointed the bunny's room is! How many little children had phones next to their bed in 1947?? I wonder if kids ever ask if the bunny is rich.In any event, based on how much our kids love this book (our hardback copy is slowly getting destroyed), it is well deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I think I have given \\"Goodnight Moon\\" to every small child or baby I know over the years. And it has always been a beloved favorite. Clement Hurd's illustrations are bright and colorful, and Margaret Wise Brown's rhythmic prose is easy to understand and sounds soothing when read. If the child is sleepy enough it will lull him/her to sleep. But no! It is not a boring book! Wide awake baby? There are enough objects to point out and find on every page to keep any child's interest. The board book, a big plus, is extremely hardy and very difficult to love to death.A small bunny is stalling at bedtime and has to say goodnight to everything in sight before he'll close his eyes, including the moon and the old lady who hushes him.Children love \\"Goodnight Moon,\\" which also teaches them the names of so many objects. Parents love the book too. It is fun to read while snuggling. And it makes a terrific gift!JANA"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is ok. There are other books that have a better more interesting story &amp; melody to them such as &quot;Is Your Mama a Llama&quot; and &quot;Polar Bear Polar Bear What Do You Hear?&quot;."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Repetition is an essential criteria in developing language skills in young children. This enchanting and lovable book offers objects and life to acknowledge at each bedtime. The best stories for young children are simple and colorful. This book provides all that. Each time the story is read and reread, new discoveries are made within its pages. I know because I still have the copy that was given to me as a young child. I read it with my own son who is now in college. A gem! I can look at it today and think, &quot;How wonderful ! Someday I'll be sharing it with grandchildren !&quot;"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"As a small child I had the good luck to have a mother who worked in the childrens' department of a large local bookstore. We had every imaginable childrens book of the late forties through the fifties. Two of her coworkers went on to write and publish childrens books of their own, one becoming a collossal lifetime success achieving great recognition.I say this as a preface to the high esteem I place on Goodnight Moon among many others of the period, many now forgotten. We kept most of the childrens books long after my sister and I out grew the ages they were intended for.Goodnight Moon became like a beacon in my mind and was the one I recalled in times of trouble and distress. When I married and had children I located my severely worn copy and repaired the binding and some of the pages. I was glad to have an excuse to read this book aloud again but it was as an adult that I came to really recognize its magic.Goodnight Moon is somehow more than just a superior bedtime book for small children. I see its power as existing on a level not unlike the wisdom of Lao Tzu or William Blake. Perhaps this sounds hyperbolic but when the text is as short and condenced as Goodnight Moon it takes on the aura of a mantra, a chant or an invocation to the spirits of calm and safety, security and serenity. It functions as a spell or enchantment to address that part of us whether adult or child who can recognize the magic power inherent in words written with such certainty and confidence. It verges on being a prayer or a hymn.I still have my copy and will only relinquish it or other books I retain at the time when and if I become a grandparent. If I should come upon a small person in need such ministrations before then I shall consider myself truely lucky indeed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Have been reading this to my 2 yr old son and he can't get enough with it. It has now become one of his routines to read this before he goes to bed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The book looked a little frayed around the edges like it was used. I ordered a new one.It was a gift. I didn't have time to get anoher so I gave it anyway."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I'm not sure why exactly, but since my son was about six months old, Goodnight Moon is the only book that he has shown any interest in. I've tried other books, including a ton of inherited Dr. Seuss books, however he won't sit still for any of them except Goodnight Moon. It's amazing to witness how immediately happy and calm he becomes once he sees this book.True, it can be very boring for parents to read over and over, but the important thing is that my son loves it, so I'll gladly reread it if it makes him happy. As soon as my son sees the book, he snuggles in my lap and waits for me to start. And for that, I gladly give this book five stars."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It's poetic, rhymic phrases help lull the child into bedtime mode.

And you will never tire of reading it to them."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter loves this book! She is only 10 mos old now, but points out the \\"red balloon\\" to me when we read it before bedtime. There are so many things to talk about on the pages as you read the story. I like to play \\"where is the little mouse\\" because he is in a different spot on each page.I have 2 of these books: one with the tape and the larger book, and the other one is smaller, and harder. I think by the time my daughter can talk she will know this book by heart. It's one of her favorites!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a wonderful early childhood book about getting ready for bed. The first half of the book simply identifies the different things the baby rabbit sees in his room. The second half has the little rabbit telling everything in his room goodnight, from the moon, to his comb and brush. On the last page, he says goodnight to the noises everywhere.This book is perfect for very young children because it relates with something they do everyday. Brown has done a great job in using simple vocabulary, which rhymes, to interest the child. While the illustrations in color are a little cluttered, those in black and white are very simple and easy for the reader to recognize. The book itself is smaller than most books, and is made more durable by using cardboard instead of regular paper.Overall, this books serves as a perfect early child book. It is a great, realistic story with fun pictures and easy text. This book would be perfect for use with any young child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Notwithstanding the story is very simple, this book deserves its reputation as a classic for toddlers. My daughter loves it and despite a wide range of other options after more than year she still takes it. The beautiful pictures and the every day life objects in it are comforting. If you don't have it, buy it. Now! A last advice: take the larger boardbook, it's impressing."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"As the mom of a toddler, I loved the Goodnight Moon board book. Before he was ready for paper pages, Goodnight Moon was our favorite book. The colorful pictures of everyday objects and peaceful rhyming words have made it a family favorite."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"If I could, every new family would get this book to go home w/ them for their baby's library - and it whatever language they wished. No matter what translation, the theme of the book is a wonderfully soothing way to end the day. Snuggle up to your little one, lower the lights and enjoy. Don't forget to play \\"where's the mouse?\\" on each of the color illustrated pages. This builds recognition, spacial and cognative skills in early readers! It's never to young to start reading to your children and you can never read to them too much!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"First time I read this to my son I thought it was a little weird, colored pages then black and white pages, etc. I guess that was educational for him though. I read this to him every night before he falls asleep. He now kisses the baby bunny night night and he is starting to put his finger to his mouth (mostly to my mouth) when I get to, \\"...the quiet old lady whispering hush\\". He likes the rhyming and the predictability. It is now ritual and a classic. I'd get it for a friend's baby!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is absolutely, bar none, the best book for toddlers. My two year old finally started to speak, in imitation of it, once we started reading this. I warn you against the sequel/companion book, however, which is confusing and just plain WEIRD...skip it!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"\\"In the great green room, there was a telephone and a red balloon, and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...\\" As I read this soothing classic to my littlest one, I hear echoes of my own mother's voice reading the same bedtime story to me (the copyright says 1947). I have passed on the tradition of letting my toddler stall for bedtime by bidding goodnight to everything around her and, of course, I make my voice fade into a whisper when I read the last lines: \\"Goodnight stars. Goodnight air. Goodnight noises everywhere.\\""},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I read all the reviews and I purchased it for my two girls ages 4 and 2. They absolutely love this book, they ask for it all the time for their bedtime story. It is simple enough that they try to read it themselves. Would highy recommend!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 15-month old daughter is thrilled each time she spies this book. We started reading this to her after her first birthday, as we were choosing our new bedtime ritual. She and I sit in the rocker and her father sits on the floor next to us and we alternate reading pages. This book went over so well, that she began requesting I read it before naps too.Now she picks it up and \\"reads\\" it on her own, which is how we ended up needing a second copy. She is pretty tough on her books, so she has her own torn and taped up copy and we have a fresh one for our pre-bedtime readings."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Each of our children have grown up with the Goodnight Moon Book and this board book is my little girls favorite. I simply cannot imagine an infant growing up and not getting a chance to enjoy it. I know your children will enjoy it as much as mine."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have been reading this book to my 18 mo old since he was tiny. Not only is it one of his top choices but one of mine. I have always pointed to the objects as they are mentioned but in the past 6 mo or so he has done most of the pointing. We also have to go through all the clocks, the elephant, the bunny ect... This is the best part of our nightly ritual.Just to mention, the daytime fav. is \\"Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb\\". As you read it this one sounds like a steady drumbeat and he still goes just wild for it. When he gets truly upset (shot time at the doctors for example) I just start quoting that book and he usually calms right down. It is also repeated in the car almost everyday. If it keeps him happy then I'm happy."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Summary: A young rabbit says goodnight to everything in his room while he prepares for bedtime.Evaluation: This is the perfect bedtime story for any young child. The illustrations cleverly get darker from page to page as the sun sets and it is time for the rabbit to go to sleep. Children will enjoy finding all of the objects within the illustrations that the rabbit says goodnight to. What is especially challenging is finding the small mouse in every picture. He moves every time you turn the page!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was one of my children's favorite books. I started reading it to them when they were 3 or 4 months old.

I think that says it all."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I don't see what all the fuss is about over this book. It's rather stupid, really.

Why the black, white, and grey? It could be much better if the pictures weren't so terrible."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I really hate this book - I became so irritated with it that I threw it in the bin today so I didn't accidentally pick it up again... really really painful to read."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Well, almost! What an absolutely over-rated book. I wanted so badly to like this book. My son is only 18-months-old and we own over 125 books--a mixture of newer books and vintage classics. I went to Target to specifically get THIS book, and you wouldn't have believed the look of shock on my face as I finished the last page.I nearly fell asleep standing there reading it. I guess it serves its purpose then, huh? So, yeah, if you are merely trying to get your kid to fall asleep, then PLEASE DO get this book because it's guaranteed that your child will Bore N' Snore within about 2 pages.Just a simple book (simplicity is great in most cases, sadly not this time) about a bunny saying goodnight to the objects in his room. Every other page is done in black and white illustrations. Can't believe this actually got published with all the competition out there.It really is a shame...good childrens' books are getting harder to come by these days as far as newly written ones go. As far as older classics--I would never classify this book as one of them.Oh, and by the way...negatively rate me as much as you want...I find it funny that people give negative ratings when people give plenty of information on the product, but simply because they disagree they have to say it wasn't helpful. Whatever...have fun :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this for my baby thinking it was a great book since it received so many raving reviews. I was so disappointed when I received it.

She really has never seemed to enjoy it either. Both my husband and I like the Animainacs parody better."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book for my 6 month old baby based on the mostly good reviews it had. However I found that it is very hard to put the book in front of her and read aloud as she tended to grab the pages of the book. It would be great if the book is a board book. The pages of the book are also big and thin which made it quite difficult to flip the pages. I found the colors very dull but I guess there might be a purpose to it as it is a goodnight book. I have stopped reading this book for my baby and will probably try again when she is older."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Okay, ummm...Somehow, all of my ratings and reviews for schlocky Japanese movies, Czechoslavakian animation, classic foreign films, experimental shorts, classic novels, and post-modern literature led to the recommendation of THIS. Granted, it is a classic: at 60 years old and counting, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has apparently charmed generations of children and become a dependable picture book for parents. However, I am an unmarried 22 year old college student with decidedly adult tastes and less than half a thought to a future of having children. This makes me definitely not the target audience (newborn to 3 years or parents of such) for this piece.That said, it's not like I can't see the qualities in this book. It looks to be a very effective nighttime story for putting toddlers to sleep: the repetition of and rhythm of the words creates a mantra-like effect to help calm the mind, the drawings are appropriately balanced and the colors a pleasant mute to keep the eyes from being over-stimulated while remaining interesting, and the theme of going to sleep can be pretty suggestive. Even as a story-book for non-nighttime uses, it's division between a broader view of the room and then a focus on the details could potentially help kids develop the abilities to identify and distinguish. As best as I can figure out child-rearing theory from this piece unto itself, it seems like a pretty good deal to get this book for your tiny bundle of nerves and wakefulness. But what would I know about it?So why did I bother rating and reviewing this product if it's not \\"for me\\"? Well, simply because it amuses me that it somehow went to the top of my recommendations, plus the open-mindedness behind the idea of taking the Amazon engine's recommendations at face value. Hey, it wasn't a wasted two minutes it took to read this. And of some note is the page of the book within which nothing is drawn and the words say, \\"Good night, nobody.\\" That page struck me because it seems pretty random in context of the work itself plus the idea behind children's development literature itself. I think it was included mostly to fit everything into the syntax and structure of the book, but still I think it's quite profound to include, among aspects of a room and its details, the sense of nothingness in between all the somethings. A children's book that recognizes nihil? Who knew?!My three star rating of this product does not reflect the quality of it: it gets five stars because it seems like a well-crafted picture book. The lower rating reflects Amazon's specific recommendation of it to me. I mean, I know how it came to be... you rate some dark movies, it recommends Sweeney Todd, you rate that, it recommends Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you rate that, it recommends some Roald Dahl books (which I'm looking forward to revisiting if they get recommended, too), you rate those that you've read, it recommmends some children's lit, and before you know it you're rating The Paperbag Princess which you remember enjoying quite a bit when you were little. All because you liked the Rocky Horror Picture Show! Can't say I'm really complaining, though, because this has been a fairly fresh and unique review to approach writing. I've never really had to consider the qualities of picture books before, but their graphic presentation and concise wording present interesting things to think about unto themselves.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Thinking on my seven years old child, I bought this book.

Acid red and acid green are the dominant colors and they tend to vibrate and irritate our eyes when we read this room in a softly lit bedroom.

Our toddler lost interest in the book at age 2."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book has a wonderful reputation, but it did not live up to it in my mind. The story line is practically nonexistent as a child tells of the things in his bedroom and then says goodnight to each one in turn. The repetition and rhyming couplets aid in the decoding of words and rhythm of the speech. However, the rhyming and too frequent use of the word \\"and\\" mimic neither speech patterns nor the conventions of writing. It must be explained to children beforehand that the text is poetic and not prose. The text can be hard to read in places with red lettering over a purple background. The illustrations switch from colorful, rich cartoons to black and white isolated sketches, which is characteristic of the times when it was published (to save money). But, they do give a feeling of discontinuity.

The illustrations and prose are beautiful. And as one reviewer said, there is a meditative quality to the book that makes it a wonderful good night book.

And our child hunts in all the places and, happily finds it. A lovely shared reading."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"In \\"Goodnight Moon\\" a young rabbit is preparing for bed \\"in the great green room\\" and says goodnight to every object in sight.But first the book mentions all the things that are in the room: a telephone, a red balloon, a picture of the cow jumping over the moon, and a picture of three little bears sitting on chairs, two little kittens, a pair of mittens, a little toy house, a young mouse, a comb and a brush, a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady who is whispering \\"hush\\".Finding all the items being mentioned on the pages of the book is a good bedtime activity. The drawings are full of the little details to notice and point out, especially the hidden young mouse that reappears on each page of the book.Repetition of the phrase \\"Goodnight...\\" and revisiting of all things in the room is a good bedtime routine that is easy to remember and understand for the kids.\\"Goodnight roomGoodnight moonGoodnight cow jumping over the moonGoodnight lightAnd the red balloon ...\\"Peaceful rhythm sets the tone for dozing off to sleep.

Just get the board book and don't clutter your house with the plastic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Publisher's SummaryA little rabbit is lulled to sleep surrounded by all that he knows and loves best in the great green room of his house.*********************I don't think it's really complicated why this is popular. The story is not exactly mind-blowing or wonderfully heartfelt. HOWEVER, this has a lot of repetition of a lot of big words for a baby and it's done in a way that (yes, it can be boring to some) when read prior to bedtime can set a tone for the evening. Now, it does not work for my son as far as making him ready for bedtime but then I also read it at any time of the day I want along with his other books in his library.What I think is unique about Goodnight Moon (as well as other familiar old classics) is that it takes some rather big words (no, it is not the \\"Cat in the Hat\\" but we love those type of stories also) and makes them into a story that can be read over and over and over and by the time you are most likely truly tired of it...and all, if you are reading it regularly enough. Your child may start to really get used to hearing the words and then one day...before you know it they can read some it.That is powerful, teaching your child to read. Now, you can try to teach your child with any book but Goodnight Moon isn't a decent effort for some children. It has some color and for newborns the black and white. I like the fact that this book is actually going to be easy for my child to read it himself when he hears it constantly."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A bedtime favourite of our 2 year-old girl.

I heard of the great reviews of this book and when I saw it at [...] I kind of thought, it looked boring and dull because the illustrations just didnt' look appealing to me. But i gave it a shot and got it for my 2 year old daughter. The first time I read it to her right before her bedtime, she was fascinated by the illustrations and sat on my lap. She hardly would sit for a book. But she would for this book and she even followed me and repeated what I read in the book. Many words like, mittens and kittens, house and mouse rhymed so it was easy for her to copy. She even woke up in the morning and asked me to read \\"goodnight moon\\". For some reason, she loved the dull illustrations and black and white illustrations. I guess they're simple for my daughter to understand and relate to."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Book is being sent as a present to our nephew who is under 2 years old.

Like many others, I didn't get the appeal of this book at first. Once I read it to my son, though, it clicked. It has an almost hypnotic quality that both of us find calming. It's usually the last book before sleep and I can feel him settling down as we read. It also helps his vocabulary as we point at all the different items in the little bunny's room. Every child is different and some may not have the patience for such a simple book, so you may want to get it from your library before purchasing. For us, though, it has a permanent place on our bookshelf."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"this book is pricless. i think the hole word knows good night moon . and if they dont well they are missing out . seller was great , come fast . good price."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great story, one that you don't mind reading over and over again!The kids love it very much!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Before I had kids, I had always thought this book was sweet, but simple and kind of boring. But my two year old loves it. It's one of his very favorite books. The rhythm is very comforting to a young child.

It is the story of a rabbit bidding a \\"good night\\" to every object in his bedroom. There is a melodic cadence to it, and with repeated use, would seem to be an effective tool in the Pavlovian or Classical conditioning of your child in going to sleep during or shortly after its reading. The animations are made so that the rabbit's bedroom gets darker as the story unfolds, and it is truly bedtime for all, upon the book's conclusion.This is a very good (if not \\"definite\\") selection for toddlers and perhaps preschoolers. I recommend."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter and I read this every night...and we have been doing so since she was a few months old. Start your own bedtime ritual with this classic. Goodnight stars, goodnight moon...and goodnight baby."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because I love it. This book is a must have.

As a kid i absolutly loved it! I loved the way the pictures were so cheerful and bright, but yet some are very calm and make you very relaxed. I would reccomend this book to any mother with young children anywhere from ages 3 through 10, even not in my teen years I still find this book very interesting and when I am a mother I will definitly read this to my child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a classic book for the under 1 crowd. It is very lyrical and enjoyable for the adult to read. I don't understand why all books in this genre aren't this good."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a wonderful book. My mother bought this book last Christmas for my almost 2 year old and it is his favorite book. We have to read it all the time. He is starting to tell us the story. We take forever to read because we have to point out everything in the pictures and discuss what they are. This is the only book he'll sit through from beginning to end and over and over again. This is a must have book for toddlers."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We discussed this book in a children's lt class I took in college. As a class we agreed that this book was a stand out. The cadence of the story is just perfect for winding down and settling down for bed for a baby or child. Some other books are too \\"busy\\" for bedtime, imo. Add this one to your collection."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a sweet, sweet book. As a writer, I know how difficult it can be to express something simply and clearly. Ms. Brown was a genius in creating a mood in a few words. Goodnight Moon has a soporific, drowsifying quality. There is a rhythm, a cadence to her words. It's almost as if you are singing to your child, but without a melody. And the pictures by Clement Hurd create a nice counterpart to Ms. Brown's text. (Keep your eye on the mouse!) I think that every parent with a young child who reads to her or him at bedtime should buy this book. It is a true classic, and rightly so."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the book that makes bed time bearable for our 20 month old. It has been her favorite book for about 3-4 months now. She loves it. As her vocabulary has expanded, she points out & says more items on the pages. Sometimes we don't even read it but just point out different things, but we both have it memorized anyway! :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"She is entranced by the illustrations, both colorful and spatially beautiful. The lines are clean and the drawings are not contrived. Nor are they messy like too many illustrators are doing today. Children like shapes they recognize.My little girl also loves the repetition of the phrase, \\"goodnight\\" and now she loves to say goodnight to everyone and most everything in our house as well.What a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Clearly this was my daughter's favorite as evidenced by her requesting this nightly read for 4 months in a row. Further evidence of the quality is that I actually enjoyed reading it to her for 121 consecutive nights.Fun story, great illustrations, catchy and precise prose, sturdy board book, all composed to a gradual winding down that has my daughter sleepy and ready for bed when we finish.What more can you ask for in a bed time book?"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is great! I think it's going to become such a classic. My son love it, it's the only story that he want to be read at bedtime. The only other book that he also likes is the little boy by rohan hall. That book teaches kids to appreciate what they have.I think those 2 books are a \\"must have\\" in your library."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the best children's bedtime book because it is so clever at \\"tricking\\" your mind into believing it is time for bed. It has one beautiful color illustration of a bedroom that is repeated every other page. As the story progresses, the very colorful and bright room slowly gets darker and darker until it is definitely nighttime. In between the color illustrations are black, grey and white imagines, I imagine a take on how things start to look in the dark. It's a marvelous concept and does a great job at making you feel that night has slowly come upon you. I loved this book growing up and my son is absolutely mesmorized at the images every time we read it to him. It really does help to put him in a sleep-mode before bed. I can't recommend it higher!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book deals with nearly everything in a child's room and house, and page-by-page, it says \\"Goodnight\\" to real items as well as some that had their birth in fairy tales. It says \\"Goodnight\\" to these items, ending with \\"Goodnight noises everywhere.\\" All of this is from the perspective of a rabbit in bed that children seem to \\"know\\" represents them. I cannot add much to the existing posts, but I think I understand why the mother of 23-month old twins \\"just does not get it.\\"Twins have a very close sibling to share scary sounds like things that go bump in the night, while most children do not.This little book is very rugged, so you do not have anything to worry about if your child plays with it.I rate this book five stars, and I believe that it will remain popular as long as hardback books survive. The back of the book reads, \\"This classic bedtime story, which has lulled generations of children to sleep, is the perfect first book to share with a child.\\" That, it is."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son has loved this book since he was 3 months old. He loves turning the pages, and the color and black & white alternating story is just delightful. We read it to him every night, and it has helped give him a tear-free nightly routine. I recommend it to every mommy and daddy within the sound of my voice and the site of my review. Enjoy your babies!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is one of my 1-year-old son's favorite books. I read it to him every night before I put him to bed, and he also likes to fish it out of the book bin and look at it on his own. I also have fond memories of it from my own childhood. BTW, the little mouse appears somewhere in every color illustration--it can be a fun game for a toddler to find it!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Perhaps I am of the wrong generation to appreciate this book, but I find it rather depressing. The illustrations remain stagnated in another era and the text is dull. We ended up donating our copy to make room for better books on our shelves."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I agree with \\"Out on a limb\\", this book is not at all what I expected it to be. I think it is very weird, and not at all what I want to read over and over again to my daughter every night. I recieved two copies of this for my baby shower, and would've returned them if they hadn't been inscripted in by the giver. They both just sit on the shelf collecting dust, 'cause this mama ist't going to read them to her little girl.Original posted July 2005Updated February 2007OK, I may have been a BIT harsh in my previous review of this book, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone who loves this classic story. My daughter, now 3 1/2 pulled this book off the book shelf, and asked me to read it to her. She wanted me to read it every night for a week. She likes to 'read' it to her teddy bear and her other 'friends'. She likes the darn thing, so for her sake, I'm updating this review."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I purchased Good Night Moon for my baby Grandson. I thought this was the most over rated book ever. I told myself maybe I am old fashioned and remember the books I read to my children. after reading all of the reviews written in by customers, I finally found a couple of \\"Men\\" that see it my way. \\"Dad\\" and \\"Book Dad\\" hit the nail right on the head. I also think all of these people love this book because they think they have to like it for some reason. This Grandma can not recommend this book when there are so many better ones out there."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon? Ha! What a joke. Margaret Wise doesn't seem too wise to me, writing foolish books about bears in chairs and bowls of mush. What is mush? What is that? It looks utterly disgusting, like something they would feed you at a nursing home.I also don't want my child (who is a beautiful baby boy) saying goodnight to his food. That's just plain weird. Even though I never intend to feed him the \\"mush\\" the mother forces down her child's throat in this gut-wrenching novel, I don't want kids to make fun of him on the playground when he waves goodbye to his PB&J; as he throws it out.If you want messed up kids, read them this book. It'll mess with their heads. Goodnight bowl of mush? Are you serious? What is mush? Don't even get me started."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I hate to disagree with everyone else that raves about this book, but... I don't see the allure to this book. My son found it acceptable, but nothing special. I didn't enjoy the cadence, premise, and it made no sense to me at all."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have a 26-month-old who is on par with 5-year-olds for his vocabulary. He loves books, and mostly longer books that tell a story. I saw this at the library and decided to see what the hype was about. I was so confused as to why this is rated so high. My son asked me \\"Mama, what's mush?\\" Um.....I didn't know what to say. What is mush? Is that even a noun? I know mushy is adjective of course. Then the \\"old lady\\" aka a rabbit - so confusing! My son again asked \\"what's an old lady?\\" Well an old lady ISN'T a knitting rabbit. He clearly knows what a rabbit/bunny is. He knows what a noise is, since he always asks \\"What's that noise?\\" when he hears something. At the end when the author writes \\"Goodnight noises everywhere\\" makes no sense.All in all, I think this book is confusing and detrimental to a toddlers vocabulary. So glad I didn't pay for this one and I recommend you don't either! There are books out there that are so much better and valuable!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"\\"Goodnight Moon\\" should have been shipped Oct. 27 or 28.

I ordered the book to share with my 14 months old grand daughter while visiting Houston from Nov. 2 through Nov. 12.

Well everyone says its a classic and how great it is so I wanted to see what all the hype was about. As soon as I opened it up I was sorry I wasted my money on it. Here is my take on it . . . Of all the books I purchased I thought this was the most boring and the strangest of the lot. The book begins by describing what objects are in this \\"great green room\\" and then one by one says goodnight to each of the objects. There are even some black and white pictures on some of the pages. What kid wants to look at black and white illustrations? Even many adults will find it boring. The book has an illustration of a rabbit sitting in a rocking chair knitting in this green room, she is described as \\"a quiet old lady\\" . . . ooooookay very spooky.My 23 month old twin boys have never been interested in this book they never look at it twice. When I read it to them, I get a blank look on their faces. For our nightly storytime they bring me tons of books to read but they never pick this one up and they completely overlook it. I think both of them and myself would like to forget that this dull book is in our home library and really wouldn't mind if it just disappeared altogether.Trust me, save your money - and don't buy this old book. Not everything classic is good. Our kids live in an age of Elmo, Blue Clues, Dora and lots of other fun colorful characters, that are doing a great job at keeping their little minds positively engaged in a fun way."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"What is it about this book? My kids were indifferent and I went nuts trying to keep it sounding like poetry when I read it aloud. Can't be done. Isn't getting little kids to sleep hard enough without trying to force writing into a rhyme and metric scheme? Give me Dr. Seuss any day!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Book was a little more \\"used\\" than described, back two pages were all but completely ruined and peeled apart, you can barely see the pictures...."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter (I bought the book when she was 6 months and she is now 14 months). She is totally not interested in the book. I personally did not like the book also. No story and boring... simply did not make sense. Pajama Time !

The objects in the book were very small, on some pages they were in black and white and some of the things in the room arent very topical or relevant. I tried reading to my daughter from this book. she was happy to bang her hands on the book generally and try to turn the pages but the pictures werent in the least bit interesting to her and the lyrics didnt have much of a soothing effect either. i find it hard to believe that america finds such a third rate book such a classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Man, those other 1-star reviews were right: this book sucks! I tried to read it to my son when I first got it, and he was like \\"Dad, I'm playing Halo! Get out of my apartment!\\" Oh well, one down. Maybe my other kids'll like it, or so I thought...After that, I went and tried to read it to my youngest daughter and guess what? She fell asleep halfway through! It's so boring that it put a 6 month old to sleep. What a ripoff!Finally, I read it to my 3 year old daughter, and she was more impressed by myThe Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee! In a moment of genius, I replaced the word \\"Goodnight\\" with \\"Three Wolf\\" in the story, and it was like a flock of angels came down and ripped an awesome power chord- rocking my daughter to sleep."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Never mind that I don't care for this book (I agree the bunnies are creepy and there are wierd things going on). My 10 month old son also has no interest in this one at all. If I try and pick it up, he pushes it away and reaches for other books. Very overrated."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book, while a classic, has been repackaged far too manytimes! The publisher is killing it! Not to mention the fact that theslippers included in this package have rubber soles, yet are too small for any walking toddler. PLEASE, let this classic rest."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I know I am probably the only person in the world who will give this book a negative review but I honestly think the illustrations are very poor, I hugely dislike the black/white images on every other page, the bunnies look creepy instead of cute and cuddly like a bunny should look....and I don't like how the bunny says \\"goodnight to the old woman in the chair\\" or something like that and then on the next page or previous page, the chair is there and the woman is gone. It just feels spooky to me. Is it the bunnies grandma? Why couldn't it be \\"goodnight to my grandma or mom who is sitting in the chair whom I love or who loves me\\"? or something sweet like that? Instead, the whole book has this strange feeling to it and I just do not like it at all. And again, to go out on a limb, I think Margaret Wise Brown books tend to be like this- they are so close to being cute books and have that cute/catchy idea but then when you read closely or look at the photos, there is always a spooky undertone- a mouse beside a clock but inside the clock is a face of a cat that looks evil like it will eat the mouse and then you notice that the mouse's face actually looks scared. Why would I want to read these kinds of books to my kids?? This book gets my biggest thumbs down for a goodnight book or a book for kids in general."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is somehow unsettling and very boring at the same time. I'm not sure where all the hype came from but this is the least favorite of mine among my seven month old's book collection. He doesn't much like it either -- looks away and actually shuts it or squirms out of my lap after a few pages."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book makes no sense.

The story isn't exceptionally good or well written. The illustrations aren't particularly good. Some parts of the book rhyme, and some don't, which is a bit inconsistent. Some parts don't even make sense (i.e. \\"Goodnight nothing.\\" ?????). The only good thing about this book is that it is a board book and a good size for smaller hands. One other good thing is my infant likes to chew on it. :) This book was included in a baby wash and lotion set that was gifted to us. I would not buy this book for myself, and I would not recommend this book to a friend. However, it's just okay if you can find it for 10 cents at a yard sale or thrift store."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A must for every child!This book is a classic,and the lap version easy for little hands to hold.My purchase was a necessity.

Buy it if you get the chance."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My two year old son Ethan was afraid of the moon so a coworker told me to buy this book to show him not to be scared of it and now instead of being scared of the moon he says \\"Hi\\" to the moon, so my family and i love this book and we read it every night to him before bed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My niece is two and I have a feeling that we read it so often that she can recite it word for word. If you get tired of reading the passages you can always say good night rug, good night lamp. My niece reads it and says \\"good night hushing lady.\\" Again she is two and now can read it to us. Its a book that gives back."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is an outstanding book that has a magical quality of quieting the busy mind and touching the spirit. Great for children, and their parents.I do however, like the cardboard version much better, as the colors are much more vivid, and feels more special as you turn the pages."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a fabulous book for little children and the grownups who read to them.

A must have for every child's library!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I received this book as a gift well before my first child was born. Of course, I had heard of it, but after reading through it a few times, I became enthralled by the book's magical and hypnotic rythms. The spare choice of words, the repitition, the soothing rhymes and the mysterious house, illuminated in the darkness, reveal something different in every reading. You can read it to your baby to get her ready for sleep, to your one-year old for the sound of the words, to your 2 year old for the rhymes--one of the books that you will put in your treasure box and save forever."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Remember the simplicity of childhood? That simplicity is contained within the binding of this book. This was and probably still is my favorite book. I wish that I was but a child again, to be able to enjoy and bask in the simplicity. This book is remarkable, so sweet & important. I loved when my mother read it to me, and I cannot wait to be able to read and instill the same love and simplicity to my children. Purchase this book, and you will not be disapointed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I read this story to my 3 smallest story every night before they went to bed for years. They all loved it and still remember me reading it to them. Wonderful memories for myself and my children. You can't go wrong with this one!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is one of the few books my 14-month old will want to read again and again. It grows with kids. At first they love looking at all the bright colors on every page. Later you will be able to ask them \\"where is the kittens?\\" or \\"where is the red balloon?\\"get it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I've been reading this book to my daughter for 2 years and it's wonderful.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We read this book at least twice a night before my daughter goes to bed. It's just wonderful."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Our first copy fell into tatters. Our second copy is on its way out. Our third copy waits for us at Grandma and Grandpa's to ensure we never make the horrible mistake of forgetting our copy at home. What more need be said? We have been reading this book to our 26 month old almost since birth. He's gone through chewing on it to pointing to it to now requesting it by name before going to bed. It's the perfect length for a good night book for little kids. There are just the right number of words per page so the pages turn quickly. The cadence and repetition is soothing, the colors pleasing. And for more stimulating play, you can always ask them to spot the mouse in each panel (though be forewarned, we once had to play find the mouse a dozen times in a row). There's no \\"message\\" or \\"lesson\\" and no, \\"years of scientific research into reading habits and patterns\\" did not go into this book--it's just a lovely quiet simple book that children love to listen to."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My children loved this book as a favorite before bed, so now I have chosen it for my first grandchild. They love the rhythmic pattern and repitition of telling things and people goodnight."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the only book by baby would actually sit and listen to ever since he was about 8 months old (he is 11 months old now). We do read him other books, but this one is definetely the winner with him. He likes to play with it too. We are going to buy another copy because our first one is falling apart from the extensive usage! I personally don't know why he likes this book so much, I don't find it to be anything special, but he is the main judge here."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My ten-month-old loves this book! And we've been reading it since she was three months old. It's just so sweet, with the bunny saying goodnight to everything in his room. When my daughter is older, we'll look for the mouse on every colored page -- he travels around the room! I read in The Read-Aloud Handbook (by Jim Trelease) that this book has every sound in the English language. Another plus! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son loves this book. It is his favorite bedtime story. He always wants to sleep with the book and look at the pictures."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a classic children's book and is great for a baby shower gift.

May be the alternate color and B&W pages or something else..But 5 stars for this book which somehow intrigues my otherwise naughty and restless son. All other night time books like pajama time etc were waste of money for me."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"10 out of 10. 1 and 2 year old are drawn to this book more than any other in our collection. i don't know what psychology is underlying in these pages but it just works. can't wait to buy the other 2 books."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter absolutely loved having me read this book to her when she was growing up, and took great pleasure when she could finally read it herself with me at her side. She now has a daughter of her own, and this is the very first book that she and her husband bought to read to her. That basically tells you the impression that this book made upon my daughter as a child. I have read some of the negative reviews, and can say only that based on my own experience (my son liked the book also when he was growing up), this is a timeless children's book that will delight any child.Update September 9, 2012: This is my 20 month old granddaughter's favorite book to have read to her at bedtime. She looks forward to it each night. And whenever I get the opportunity, I just love reading it to her and watching her face light up as she hears the story."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight comb, goodnight brush, goodnight nobody, goodnight mush.

I don't think I'm alone there. While the former is great at prepping kids to do the things they need to do before bed, this is great to read to them (or with them as they try to find items throughout the book) as they drift off to sleep. I'm sure if you're reading this you have kids - or are looking for a gift for someone with kids - this is a must have!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"my daughter adored this book when she was around 2-3.

She has been searching all over town for ths book to read to her little one as he drifts off to sleep so i was very pleased to find it with the bunny just in time for his Easter Basket."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this set for my daughter (20 months)to put in her Easter basket. I wanted a board book and a bunny and this certainly fits the bill. I think that board books are generally over priced so the inclusion of the stuffed toy softens the sticker shock a bit. The bunny isn't anything too special really, but as anyone with a toddler, or anyone who has ever bought a happy meal know, it needn't be. The book itself, is a faithful reproduction of the original, in a sturdier form. I am sure my daughter will enjoy eating it. I am pleased with this purchase and cannot wait for Easter."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I've been giving Goodnight Moon as a gift to newborns and young children for about 25 years now and never met a child or parent who didn't love it. It's an all time classic children's book and has won a many awards in the children's book categories. It's an all time favorite and simply an imaginative, wonderful, and compelling read for a child. Diseptively simple: saying Good Night to familiar objects page after page. In no time at all, the child chimes in with her/his goodnight. A pure classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"As a bedtime story, this children's book is universally loved for it's sheer simplicity. A perfect read to your baby book and they'll soon be reading for themselves. Colorful illustrations and easy to read words have made this a classic for years.

The book is an \\"I Spy\\". The intent is for the child to find what is being mentioned. It provides interaction for the parent and child. You can do this with any picture book, but this one has been specifically illustrated to do so (on a much simpler scale then others)."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Our child has us read this book to him so many times in a day that it has been worn out to the point that a second purchase is nessessary. The words just flow from page to page keeping his interest. The contrast from black and white to the color pages keeps him searching for the items that are read. This book is a must for any parent!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is a must for all first time parents. The pages alternate between black and white, and bright cheerful colors. The text is wonderfully written, and gently calms things down. What a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Even though it is a children's book, I still love to read it at night when everyone is asleep. It was good because the pictures where not like regular books, but that is just my opinion."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"In this fast paced world, sometimes in the simplest of things the most pleasure and reassurance can be found; such is the case when reading Goodnight Moon. Uncomplicated in her presentation Ms. Wise, utilizes repetition of images and familiar items, to make her bond with the youngest of readers. The beauty and consistency of the moon which shines brighter with every turn of the page adds depth to the appealling illustrations of Mr. Hurd. My son and I read it every night before we go on to our &quot;new&quot; works. This gives us a familiar place to start. A common place regardless of where the day has gone. In our own &quot;great green room&quot;. A place which is ours...and too can be yours...Goodnight Moon!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"quite simply, the book that started me reading, and that soothed my weary soul for innumerable evenings when i was a small boy. i can still, after many years, see the pictures and feel the words, which should be a testament to the lasting appeal of this book. share it with your children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"No childrens book I have ever read is sweeter than Goodnight Moon. My son and I have read it together nearly every night for the past eighteen months, often more than once a night!

Our time together with this book will be one of my fondest memories of his youth."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I read this book to my daughter twice every night before she goes to sleep I have been doing this every night of her life (all 11 months). (Just as I read it to my youngest brother now 27 every night before he went to sleep). My daughter will not go to bed without this book being read to her and most nights takes it in her crib and turns the pages until she falls asleep with her book and her Goodnight Moon Bunny. If there are a pile of books she will not pay attention until we first read Goodnight Moon. Nicole"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I loved this book. I am 12 now but when I was a child I really adored it. It says goodnight to everything and made me fall asleep. I reccomend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the first book I have read to my 3-month old son that he pays attention to. He loves the colors and the rhymes. I love it, too, short enough to keep him interested the entire time, and the text is cute enough to keep from being monotonous (plus easy to read with feeling). I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the book I was read goodnight to every night as a child, it is a soothing book that is guaranteed to have the little ones snoring by the end. The pictures are fascinating for children too, the little mouse is in a different spot every page...find him!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was looking for a large board book (the size of the book in the picture). What came in the mail was a small board book! This picture of the little girl holding the book (under the book for sale) is a trick. It is nowhere near that size and this should be considered to be FALSE advertising! I was extremely disappointed! I must emphasize that the book is great, I was just deceived by the size."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Awww. =3 What a cute book.It's all nice and stuff, but it would be pretty boring if you read it to your child. Good night mittens, good night kittens, good night blah blah blah. It's simply a rabbit saying goodnight to a bunch of things. Find something more interesting and imaginative for your child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was a little disappointed that the book was so small. I was hoping that it would be like some of the larger books that I have purchased in the past. It is not an easy book for older children who are physically and mentally challenged to handle.

If I knew that it was going to be this small I would have purchased it at a store where I could have seen the size of the book. Thank you K.Riding"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Our eighteen month old has long ago shelved this book, and I must say I support his &quot;decision.&quot; I guess its okay for a bedtime book, but there is no plot, the illustrations are uninspired, and it fails to engage the little ones I've read it to. We got it as a gift, but certainly would pick other books to give as gifts to others."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight room, goodnight moon. Perhaps a cry for help from some tortured soul, or perhaps a yearning for an apocalyptic solution to existence. Maybe it is none of these things, but images of a green room suggest an allegory of the American Democratic System (playing off of the asian themes of Red, Blue, and Green energy) and the eventual transfer of power to the people (or in this case, the rabbits). But all things come from the earth, and to the earth they shall one day return; if anything, Goodnight Moon reminds us of our mortality and search for self. And that is the greatest gift of all."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter likes this book and my son probably will too, but it reminds me of the book version of Barney; kids love it and parents don't. None of the adults in my family who have read this book like it.The book it a rhythmic poem. First we learn about what is in a little room and then we say good night to those things (Good-night, Mush?). The artwork, like in the author's Runaway Bunny, is better in the black and white drawings than it is in the color panels.The Rhythm can be relaxing if read properly and its completist use of phonic makes it good for children to read themselves, but otherwise I just don't get this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is not what I had expected. I expected a hardback book as the description stated plainly. I wont return this item because it will cost additional money to do so."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I don't mean to be a downer but I don't really understand why this book is such a classic.

He doesn't seem to care for the illustrations or story line and I have to admit it's rather boring...."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I got the book for my 4 yr old and 2 yr old - but neither of them like it much. My husband and I don't like reading it either, and here's why:The text is quite disjoint, like bits and pieces of other fairy tales and nursery rhymes put together. It seems like the author has just put down random things together - there's no rhyme (literally!) or reason for any of the pages. It does not flow lyrically.The only interesting aspect is the black and white illustrations on some of the pages. This offers a striking contrast to the color illustrations. However, the whole book has not been put together well, and the quality of illustrations is just so-so. So the impact of the b&w; is also pointless.Compared to other wonderful books like the \\"Hungry Caterpillar\\" or \\"Ten Little Lady Bugs\\" or \\"The Firefly's First Flight\\" which we all really love, this book definitely is not worth having in the childrens' bookshelf.I seem to be among the minority in disliking this book on Amazon - perhaps I am not seeing something that others are.. But hey! this is truly my opinion!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I'm a pre-school teacher and I have to say that this is one of my personal favorites! It's true that at first glance, it seems too simplistic - maybe even boring. After you've read it a few times, however, you are bound to realize that this book is a perfect way to settle any toddler in after an exciting day of fun and adventure.Margaret Wise Brown knew exactly what she was doing when she wrote this book. The rhythm and pattern of the words really do calm the reader and listener down with each turn of the page.A must have for any children's library!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I hadn't read this book since I was a very little girl, but remembered a warm, fuzzy feeling about it. After ordering the book, I wondered why. It's poorly written, and the colors are wierd. But as I read it to my 8 1/2 month old son, both of us are soothed by the rhythm of the words, and he is fascinated by the illustrations, which seem to have just enough detail to be interesting but not so much as to be overwhelming. Works for us."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter received 3 copies of Goodnight Moon when she was born. This was my first clue that Goodnight Moon is a special book. We now have 3 children (and about 5 copies), they have all loved this book.

This one, however, slipped by me until I received it as a gift for my baby shower. I proudly displayed it among all of my daughter's books and didn't think much of it the first time I read it. I knew it was a classic, but I didn't see what was so exciting until my 12 month old began to request it be read each and every night. At 18 months we are still reading it every night...only she helps out by reading several words! We have memorized the book by now and know that it will forever be one of our favorites. We love it so much that we give it to everyone we know who is having a baby. This is a definite must have for any child's collection."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great book. The reading is easy and it reads like a melody. The pictures are bright, but not jarring... the images relaxing.

Easy to memorize text and few words per page make it fun and easy to read to kids."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Although this book has some pretty graphic drawings reminiscent of Paul Rand, in nice primary colors, I found the characters to be rather one-dimensional. Their development is entirely absent, and even a method actor couldn't find their motivation.

There is the \\"before bed\\" first act, and then the denouement, in which the protagonists sharing their cozy middle class abode wish each other \\"goodnight.\\"I found Eugene O'Neill's \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\" to be a more thought-provoking and cathartic study on a similar theme.

He is very active, but stops long enough to look at each page. In other books, he is turning the pages as fast as we can read them.

I have passed on the tradition of letting my toddler stall for bedtime by bidding goodnight to everything around her and, of course, I make my voice fade into a whisper when I read the last lines: &quot;Goodnight stars. Goodnight air. Goodnight noises everywhere.&quot;"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book was written to be very boring, very calming.As a result, many adults simply cannot stand it. I firmly suggest that you read the book before purchasing it or putting it on your baby registry. If you remember it from your childhood, re-read it - many childhood books seem different once you've grown up.Then, if you still love it and don't mind the thought of reading it every night for a year (children *will* get their little fixations), go ahead and buy it! (This is actually good advice for any children's book, but especially the ones in the \\"lull them to sleep\\" group.)If you find it a little too much... get something else.I will note that even if you do not buy the book, many people find that saying goodnight to everything in the room (or good-bye if you're leaving the house instead of taking a nap) is a good transition activity for little children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Okay, I'll admit it -- this is not my favorite kids' book in the world.

Goodnight mouse. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight kittens.\\")). But my children -- all three -- have adored this book and begged for it over and over again.Let's face it -- We're not reading for ourselves; we're reading for them. So give in and get this book.

Never knew the appeal, but it doesn't matter what I think because my toddler ADORES this book. He loves to look at the detail in the illustrations and try and find each item that is being goodnight-ed. He was even the one that noticed that the mouse is in a different location on each page and makes a game of trying to find him (he's got it down pat by now). He's gotten to the point where I start the sentence but he \\"reads\\" the last word. So I say \\"good night bears and good night...\\" and he says \\"chairs\\".

The book itself is a soothing lullaby with a very catchy rhythm. But the reason I rated it five is that not only did my boys enjoy the book, but the older one, at a very early age started this little Good Night Moon game, in which he'd look for the mouse. It seems that Clement Hurd, the illustrator, did this intentionally (and quite ingeniously) as the mouse is not always easy to find! But my kids always had a blast looking for that little mouse!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was one of the first books I ever read to my child.

It's a keepsake."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Some books become experiences in themselves, and as any parent who cherishes this book can tell you, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is one of those books.The lush illustrations, full of detail and delight, give us a good view of the bunny's room as he gets ready to say goodnight and go to sleep. At the beginning of the story, his room is still light. Bunny is protracting the bedtime like any self-respecting toddler--in his case, he is saying \\"goodnight\\" to every single object in his room.My children and I read this in a cadence that became part of the book. They chanted it along with me, and never tired of finding the elusive mouse, whose whereabouts change from page to page. We all said goodnight to everything in the room together--the comb and the brush and the bowl of mush were huge favorites.Finally, the room darkens, the bunny's eyes start to close, and hopefully, one's own children are in the same condition. I love this book, as do my children, and hopefully when the time comes, their children will as well."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"By far, my 16-month old son's favorite book.

I've finally found a non-Barney, non-Elmo, non-Rugrats item that my two-year-old loves. Unfortunately, it hasn't been quite the bedtime story I'd hoped since she now repeats every page. We simply moved it from the bedroom to the playroom. This book is a must-have for ANY family."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My two year old grandson loves being read to. He has many books but this one is his very favorite. He doesn't tire of having it read over and over again. He noticed the position of the moon changes in the window in each frame and the young mouse is in a different place as well. Buy it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I gave this story a 5 stars rating because as a kid i loved it and i felt like everything,even though it is not real should be said goodnight to. I believe it gives kids a good imagination and I would highly recomend it to any young reader."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the best book in the world. It's about a little rabbit that is going to bed, but he wants to say good night to everything in his room before he does. This is a wonderful childrens book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"After wearing out the first board book with our first child a second one was bought. The kids love this book---- all of the nuances. The clock shows a change in time as well as the movement of the moon and the darkening of the room. Where is the mouse now (all over the place). Both of our children still adore pulling this one out. It has been read over and over, been taped, is dog-eared, etc. To show how much it is loved one of our two copies is already in the &quot;memory&quot; box to pass on in later years. This is a wonderful addition to the library anyone with young children, particulary if they are just starting out."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We're creating a ritual: we read Goodnight Moon every night and now my daughter (at 5 months!) is conditioned. She knows Goodnight Moon means it's bedtime! I remember this book as a child and it's fun to create this memory with her! I love this book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I liked this book because it talks about the moon and sleeping. I thought it was very colorful."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"There is something so classic and sweet about this book, from the illustrations to the words. It's one of those books that I want to read to my kids and someday read to grandkids. And a book that I think most people should own."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter is 14 months old and loves this book. She is really trying to mimick me when I read it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We love this book. My son adores it. After bath time, we put him in his crib and give him a book to play with while we read him another one. Goodnight Moon is one of the very few books that he has no desire to play with or read another book while we are reading this one (Guess How Much I Love You is another).We love this story because it is so interactive. Now that he is getting older, he points out all the things in the story, he counts to three (three little bears sitting in chairs) and he says Night Night after each Good Night page. We just love it.As I said we are going on book number 2 here. The first book is too well loved and we need another copy of it.Truly a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"While you're out getting \\"what to expect while you're expecting,\\" be sure to pick this one up as a companion book. It's a classic for every library and one that is sure to help calm the fussiest of babies. It's just so cute to see the little bunny going to bed, stalling as long as he can and trying to get away with it even with his grandmother in the room. I think it's funny he calls her \\"old lady whispering hush.\\" Why not grandma? :) Maybe he's too young to know who she is at the moment. It's just so neat to see the fireplace burning and on the last page, all the lights are out but you can still see the moon in the photo and the fireplace burning. Just a neat, neat soothing book, one that every toddler just loves and mine is no exception. It gets read every night and then some! Highly Recommend!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Many rave about this book, though there are some detractors. Personally, this was the first children's book I have ever read. You see, I didn't grow up being read to. When I was doing my teacher training, we were each asked to read a children's book to the class. So I chose this title. I liked its repeating lines, which were comforting and hypnotic. I liked the surrealness of the cow jumping over the moon. This book is simple and yet irresistible. I have since read many other children's books, but this one still holds a magnetic pull on me. That probably says a lot about me."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is THE book to read to children from day 1. The lines never tire, the pictures never fade, the contentment and draw of this book never diminish.This book is THE read it again-and-again-and-again-and-again favorite of all time. I do encounter children who have not heard its gentle lines which makes me very sad. Every child should hear this book when they are young. Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd made magic with this book and it stays with you for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Have you ever taken care of children that refused to go to sleep? To aid you in the process of getting them to snooze, read children this soothing book. Goodnight Moon is especially relaxing and everyone will adore it. This book makes you feel like whispering goodnight to the things you love. The main character is an adorable bunny and the setting is his bedroom. The word \\"goodnight\\" is on every page to help your child think about sleep. Children and adults alike will love this book because it is interactive.Clement Hunt, the illustrator, draws a charming mouse on each page that children of all ages will delight in finding. Personally, I enjoy finding the mouse because he is always in different poses.I recommend this book to people of all ages because the process of getting ready to sleep at night can be relaxing, no matter what your age. As a twelve-year-old girl, I would rate this book a 5 out of 5 stars because I enjoy the feeling I get from reading Goodnight Moon. No one can resist Margaret Wise Brown's book, Goodnight Moon.Leigh, an avid reader"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is THE bedtime classic. As your child gets older, encourage him or her to find the mouse on every page. It can make the \\"last book of the night\\" a bit more engaging!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I purchased this book for my twins because we needed a good bedtime story. It is a great story to read at bedtime. It has become apart of our nightly ritual. For those needing a little help developing their bedtime routines, I would highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"What a great gift for my new grandson. My three daughters loved this book and I just had to have one for him.

Simple and sweet."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I had never heard of this book until my firstborn came along and someone gave it to us. I read this book at least a couple hundred times; well, repeated it because after a few readings you have it well memorized. The book lends itself to your reading it with inflection and even whispering. A terrific gift for all new parents or grandparents."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"How wonderful to locate reasonable prices on ageless classics such as \\"Good Night, Moon.\\" Watching a 3-year-old grandson enjoying the same pictures that your own children loved - life doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"You must get this book for your kids. It is the best board book, in my opinion. My kids have learned to listen to books being read, learned to talk, and learned to read with this book. One of the top 5 books your kids need in their home library from day one."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I read this book to both my kids before bed for months. It is a good way to settle down to nightime. Good pictures illustrate the story too. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic! I read this book many times to my daughter, who is now 15. I ordered it for my nephew. \\"Modern Moms\\" might not be aware of Margaret Wise Brown's books, so let's carry on the tradition!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book for my 2 yr old son a few months ago. He loves it. We read it almost every night. When I tell him to pick out a book he always requests \\"The Moon\\". He has learned the meaning of whisper from the old lady, what rooftop means from the little toy house, what the moon is and when we read goodnight air he blows air out. Great book I can see why it is a classic. We also like The Very Hungry Caterpillar, The Big Red Barn, Llama Llama Red Pajama, The Sandra Brown books and Dr. Seuss ABCs just to name a few."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is just the SWEETEST little set! \\"Goodnight Moon\\" was a top favorite when I had little ones; it's a great book for very small children because they love to point to the various characters, animals, and items in the pictures. The words, when read soothingly at night, always helped them to calm down and settle into \\"sleepytime\\" mode. My children are grown now; I purchased this set for a friend's grandchild.She gets to have the little stuffed baby bunny, which wasn't around for my little guys. I know she'll just love to have him! In my opinion, this is THE best book for pre-bedtime storytime for small children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is an amazing book, written simply & creatively, almost how a child himself may have written it. BUT this cloth version excludes a large portion of the text & images of the original. I suggest buying the original hardcover, & not the cloth cover version."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"For those of you who have read this board book to your little ones ten thousand times, you may know the answer to this trivia question: How long does it take little bunny boy to settle down and go to sleep?The artist, Clement Hurd added fun detail to his pictures. The first is the addition of a tiny mouse in almost every scene. My son had lots of fun finding him and pointing him out as I read. Once he got older, he added a side dialog as to what the mouse's name was, what was he thinking, where was he going, etc.The second fun tidbit is the clock. We start the story at 7:00 pm and finally close the book at 8:10 pm. Parents, we've all been there. It's nice to know that even fictional characters take a while to fall asleep."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It is perfect!! It was just what I was looking for. Thank you so much! When I was pregnant, the first gift I got was Goodnight Moon with bunny. My son from 3 months on needed to hold it and turn the pages after we read it to him. When my son was about 10 months old, he started chewing instead of just looking and destroyed the book. I went to 3 different bookstores trying to find the book, but they all had the new version with the seal in the corner. I started searching Amazon, but they too only had the seal version. I saw the book with the nightlight, but I thought he wouldn't like the nightlight since he's just used to the hall light. Since it had been 3 months since we read Goodnight Moon, I ordered it anyway. The look on his face was worth the extra for the nightlight! He got this big smile and squealed with delight. He also does like the nightlight. Thank you Amazon for giving my son his \\"old\\" Goodnight Moon back!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I must admit that the only reason I bought this book was because people said it is a classic and any web site about children's books named this one. I did not relate to it, because when I was growing up in India, this wasnt popular. When the book arrived and I actually looked at it, I did not understand what the hype was all about and did not really read it to my son until a couple of weeks ago. (I bought the book about a year ago when he was just 4 months :) )I must admit, when I read this book to him every night before going to bed both of us love it!!! (He is 16 months now) I have to read it atleast 5 times. My son would ask me to read it a 6th time, except that I tell him it is time to go to bed and put a stop to it. This book is indeed a classic!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is by far my kid's favorite baby/toddler book. I have read this to them since before they were born and still every night we go to bed as a matter of routine. It has such a harmony and flow about it and so soothing and calming for bedtime. I am sure when they outgrow this stage and I reread this book much later on in life, I will just bawl buckets over this one. Its such a classic and such a bonding book for parents and little ones."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Margaret Wise Brown has written many books adored by readers of all ages. From a teacher's perspective I would recommend this book to every parent out there. The book has a pattern and cadence that will support your child's reading fluency. Pattern books are always encouraged for the beginning reader. Moreover, the book reflects how the world is seen through the eyes of an innocent child (in this case, a bunny). For example, how many of our young children have made that connection with inanimate objects as if they were filled with life? I would also recommend you buy Brown's other classic book, \\"The Runaway Bunny\\";especially if you are a parent. It will surely touch your heart."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon has been around for nearly 60 years and remains a best seller in childrens books. Being unimpressed with this CLASSIC is similar to saying you are not impressed with Shakespeare...it says much more about you than Shakespeare. Unless you are the type to read COSMO to your kids at night, this book must be on your shelf."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My two sons wore this book out and now my grandaughter has worn one out so I'm getting a replacement along with The Runaway Bunny. The repetition, rhythm, and calming of this book have been favorites of all the little ones in our family. Now baby sister is getting old enough to want to hear \\"Moon\\"."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The book Goodnight Moon, is a very simple little kids book. It describes what is in a room and it says goodnight to all of the items in it. I do like this book because it was an easy book for me to read and to understand as a small child. I liked that it was very simple and there weren't too many things going on that would get the reader or me distracted from the actual story. I would recommend it to small children because the pages only have a few words, it is kind of a fun book because you can look for all the objects as they mentioned in the room, and it is a good book to read to get a small child to go to sleep because it is a very calming and quiet book about bedtime. All together, I liked this book when I was younger and I would recommend it to little kids because they would all like it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I must have read this book 50 times to my little ones as they wound down for sleep. Now they like more sophisticated books, but this one will always be dear to my heart.How many times my daughters heard in hushed tones, \\"good night stars, good night air, good night noises everywhere.\\" (Kiss) \\"Good night, I love you.\\""},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Until I started reading to my older son, I didn't really understand what was this book's unique hold on people was. However, from my first reading to him, I did! There must be something magical about this book and the way children love it. It's very comforting to them, with the easy to memorize lines and the gentle arrival in the great green room of nighttime. However, it's also full of little details for them to notice and delight in--the hidden mouse, the dollhouse with lights on, the pictures on the wall. It's the perfect book to start kids &quot;reading&quot; themselves---leave out the crucial word in a line and wait for them to say it---&quot;a bowlful of....&quot; &quot;MUSH!&quot;, they scream with delight! And they all love the &quot;Goodnight Nobody&quot; page best---I think it really gets kids thinking in a philosophical way---How can you say Goodnight to Nobody? This book is a true, true gem and belongs in every library."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I got this book (in the board version) for a shower gift for my now 2-year-old daughter. I didn't remember reading this book as a child and at first it seemed a little odd -- the pictures weren't tremendously appealing and the rhyme scheme seemed strange. I have, however, been converted. After reading the book several times to my newborn daughter, I noticed how soothing it was to her. She seemed to be able to see the pictures and, as she got older, would reach out to touch elements in each. We read it every night for months, because it seemed to set a good tone for bedtime. After learning a little more about how children think, I began to understand what made it so appealing -- the ritual of saying good night to familiar objects helped reassure her when she had to say good night to her mom and dad, which can be scary for tiny kids.Now, of course, she's a big girl and says it's a &quot;baby book&quot;. However, it's still by her bed and I've overheard her &quot;reading&quot; it to herself or to her baby brother many times. It's an excellent choice for a baby you love."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a book that I read every night to my children. For years, I could not quite put my finger on its appeal. Finally, it clicked one day. There is a cadence to the story that is like a mediation mantra, quietly and gently calming you and your child down. In addition, the book's text and illustrations are matched in away that it is natural to point out the words and pictures to your child, and for them to do the same as they grow older. This means that you are also starting to teach reading in natural, relaxed way. In addition, we all tend to see the glass as half empty rather than as half full. Goodnight Moon encourages a sense of gratitude for whatever is around us. That is a profound and wonderful lesson for everyone to have. Finally, children are fascinated by how another child's room might look. So you also help them to understand the differences among families. How many other books do you know that accomplish so much? Best of all, you and your children (and grandchildren, perhaps) will have wonderful memories to share. That's fantastic! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We received this book/plush bunny set as a gift. We love the Goodnight Moon story, and read it almost every night. Our 8 month old daughter, while she thinks the board book is delicious, has adopted the 5\\" Bunny as her very favorite Lovey, and won't go to sleep without him. He is just the right size for an infant. He has a grey faux-fur head and \\"hands\\", and wears blue-striped pajamas with textured feet. His eyes are the bead-type, rather than embroidered, but they are very well attached. The ears are long enough to get into her mouth for serious sucking, and the arms are well-stuffed, making for good gnawing. His body is stuffed with the microbeads, and my only complaint (thus 4 stars, not 5) is that he is labelled \\"surface wash only\\". I have, due to the daily baby-spit, given him many baths, and he seems to dry out just fine."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"At the risk of sounding redundant, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; succeeds in entrancing every toddler (and every toddler's parent) who sees and hears it. Unlike many other books suitable for children at an early linguistic level, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; manages to capture both adult and child in its charms. The repetitive structure never bores, as it constantly surprises with its rhymes and subjects (I still laugh at the blank page where it goes &quot;Goodnight nobody&quot;). My daughter is now three, and she isn't quite as excited by the book as she was when she started hearing it at one, and when she insisted on it every night when she was two, but she still likes to take it out every once in awhile. I still love &quot;Goodnight Moon,&quot; however, and look forward to reading it to my next child, and to my grandchildren. I only wish my mother had known about this book when I was a child!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my sixteen month old and hefell in love with it.

She wants to &quot;read together&quot; all the time , as she calls it , and she loves to search for the little mouse on all the colored pages!

A timeless classic!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon was a part of my prekindergarten class and is now a part of my 9 month old son's bedtime routine. The CD includes a reading of the story and, in my opinion the best part, the story sung as a lullaby. The lullaby is soft, calm and beautiful with guitar adding to the soothing sound. As a teacher, I used this song to transition to our quiet time and as a mother I play this lullaby while feeding my son his oatmeal bedtime snack. We then say good night to several items in his room before going to sleep. The CD is not over the top or cooky, like many children's songs. It is simply a beautiful lyrical version of one of the best bedtime stories."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is my daughter's favorite book!! It's so simple, so touching, so sweet.

Only now, she enjoys reading to me (and I find the mouse)."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book has a cadence and rythym that my daughter found very comforting. It was her favorite book as a toddler - the one she wanted read every single night. I read it to her so many times, I no longer looked at the pages - I just recited them from memory as she sat in my lap and turned each page.That time is gone now (my daughter is 16), but she still remembers the time sitting in my lap and the reading of this book - over and over and over... Much later we graduated to the Harry Potter series (I read the first 4 to her, then she got too impatient to wait as each new one came out) but Goodnight Moon was our first shared literary experience - and for that precious time, I say this truly is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the book that I always give to newborns.

I recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was practically the first book I read to my son, from the time he was one month old. It's got a beautiful rythm, and is the perfect length for a first baby book. The story is very simple: a young bunny says good night to everything in his room, which is great so that a baby can first familiarize himself with his surroundings. I've read that some reviewers didn't like the black and white pictures in between the color ones, but I think the alternation (color, b&w;, color, and so forth) fits very nicely and is a good way to keep the attention of a very small baby, as well as the change from looking at the whole bedroom to a particular object on each page, which helps the baby learn about context and to focus. Once my son was older, we had lots of fun looking for the mouse in all of the color pictures.Frankly, I read the poor reviews and I don't agree with those opinions. One of the complaints was that the story was too simple, but I think that they might not be able to see that a very young baby needs a very simple storyline, a month-old baby couldn't follow a more complex story like \\"The cat in the hat\\" for example (which I love, don't get me wrong!!!). I just think that those who reviewed this book poorly can't look through the eyes of a very young baby, or bought it for an older child and of course couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. My son is now 3y.o. and we hardly ever get this book anymore, but I can't wait to be pregnant again to start reading it to another baby..."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Maybe it was supposed to be obvious, but I never would have purchased this if I'd known it was an abridged version of the book.

(The information says 8 pages because it's counting each side of each page, including covers.)

He was very interested in this book, looked at it intensely, and by the time I finish those short verses, he is already sleepy! It's almost magical!Now this book has become part of his sleeping routine and I read it to him every night. I add good night mom / dad / Snoopy / everybody... at the end and it really sets him into the sleeping mode. Now I think this book is the perfect length because you can't read a full complex story to a baby trying to get him to sleep. Also love the cover material, it's very soft.

As we strongly believe in the value of reading to young children, we now give this book as agift to anyone whom we know who is becoming a parent or grandparent. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" belongs in your children's library, and to be savedby them to read to their children!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Its a great book for babies, I have given several of them for baby gifts.

I always get mine on Amazon, its cheaper."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I've read this book to both of my boys (now aged 3.5 and almost 2) and they both still enjoy it. They love looking for the mouse and identifying all the interesting things to see in the pictures. There are newer books for parents to read to their little ones, but this book should always be on the reading list."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I personally didn't care much for the book when I received it as a gift fom my 1 year old. However, this book became his absolute favorite from day one! He loved to point at pictures (cats, ballons, moon, etc) and LOVES (to my great surprise) black and white drawings. For the past 8-9 months we've been reading this book daily, at least 5 times before he goes to bed, and sometimes just because. He LOVES the moon and stars, always points to them if we are reading something else, or if there is one to be seen from the window. \\"Moon\\" was one of his first words!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When I ordered this wonderful book I was not aware that it was the small card board edition I purchased. Thus, i was disappointed to see that the wonderful illustrations were scaled down to a format that does not give them justice. Hurds illustrations need far more space to get the most out of them."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My children enjoyed this book as children. My mother bought it for them.

I still have my old copy, complete with scribbles and dog-eared pages.When my first daughter was born, we ordered a new copy in the board-book format.

It is a lovely book that is a classic for obvious reasons.Probably our most enduring bedtime story."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I remember reading this book as a child and I would often ask my mom to read me it as a bedtime story at least once a week. Even now at the age of 22, I still have my old copy of the book. It's a timeless classic that will last through the ages!Allison"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Don't know what it is about this book, but it is amazing. The illustrations are repetative, the text sometimes ridiculous, (\\"goodnight nobody\\"?!) But it works magic. It simply reads like a lullaby. My children have each loved it as toddlers, and number six is proving to be no exception. (We have bought her a new copy as our old one is falling apart from being so well loved!)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Ever had trouble getting your baby to sleep?

We were told to write a message to \\"Baby\\" in the book. I thought this was a really cute idea and had never heard of anyone doing it before!

I figured now it can be \\"Baby's\\" favorite book as well!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"She sees me whip out the book and quickly realizes that means it's bedtime. It was actually a fun read for myself as well (at least the first 17 times or so I read it)."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My only complaint with the product is that the size of the stuffed animal was a little deceiving.

Good night all"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"&quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; is a magical time with your children. And that all depends on how you are reading the story. As rabbit begins his journey to sleep so does our journey into his room. We begin with reading in a normal volume and point out where the moon is in the window and always ask &quot;Where's the mouse?&quot;As the rabbit's room darkens our voices become softer and softer until we are whispering for our children to notice the postion of the moon, the growing darkness in the &quot;great, green room,&quot; and always whispering &quot;Where's the mouse?&quot;This is one of those all time childhood favorites that we read with as much drama as my grandmother put into the story when she read &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; to me back in the early sixties. As a child it drew me to comforting sleep and I always delighted in finding that tiny creature in the pages of the room when my grandmother asked &quot;Where's the mouse?&quot;Your children too will someday ask their children &quot;Where's the mouse?&quot;"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is my two year old son's favorite book next to 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar'. It is a sweet little rhyming poem that he is now starting to say along with me. When he was younger, he would just point to things when I would say them. Later as he learned to speak, he began to identify them and call out their names. Now as I read, he finishes the sentences.This book is simple and elegant. I never tire of reading it to him, nor does he run out of enthusiasm for it. Long after he forgets this book, I'll remember the joy on his face as I read him 'Goodnight Moon'."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight moon is an excellent bedtime story for preschool age children. In the story, to postpone his own slumber a little bunny says goodnight to everything within his sight, toys in his room, animals outside the stars and the moon. I liked this book very much the slowly darkening pictures are sure to put little ones to sleep, the way the story ends in a whisper only adds to this dulling effect. Overall a very good story."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love Goodnight Moon! It's a true classic, great for reading aloud. And the cuddly slippers are so adorable on my little one... wish they came in adult sizes, too."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a wonderful book. The words are lyrical and soothing. But, the pictures are even better with intricate details that foster memory and concentration. The flow of the book is an ideal addition to any bedtime routine."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have 2 daughters, one 6, the other 18 months. This book has been in top rotation since the birth of our first. What a classic.Goodnight Moon is a great combination of art work and story, and should be on every new parents \\"must buy\\" list. Our family has most likely read this book together over 200 times."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"\\"Goodnight Moon\\" appears to be a simple children's book on the surface, but it is so much more! When my daughter was 2 or 3, we got this wonderful little treasure to read before she went to bed each night. The simple poetry is easy to memorize, and the illustrations are gentle and comforting. But as the pages turn, time passes in the bunny's room - the clock advances, the moon rises, the light in the room dims - all in preparation for tucking the bunny in for the night. The little mouse moves about the room, making for a wonderful game of \\"where's the mouse\\"! If you look closely at the pictures on the wall and the books in the bookcase, you realize you've seen them before in other classic Helen Wise Brown books like \\"The Runaway Bunny\\". What a treat for the senses, and what a wonderful way to introduce reading to your child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Can't wait til my grandson is a little older so I can read this book to him. Actually I read it to him now but I think he'll get more out of it as time goes by. It's the perfect book in its' simplicity. The words flow in a natural bed-time kind of rhythm and it conjurs up those kinds of images that make you remember what being a child was all about.The pictures in the book are very nice too, very wise use of colour but the story holds up even if there were no pictures.I read this to my kids when they were very young but they still remember it like it was yesterday...and so do I....that's what makes it a classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We have loved this book so much over the past 5 years that we had to buy a new copy :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great book. I read it to my son right after his bath (think wailing time!) while his father dresses him for bed. While I read my 8 months old is very attentive and forgets to scream as the pajamas go on. To me, that's a winner.On a serious note, I read all the negtive reviews to try to figure out why someone would NOT like it and the most people say it's boring... Well I find MOST books written for babies and toddlers boring. I would be very surprised and dissapointed in myself I found a kid's book fascinating."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown was my favorite bedtime story as a child. There are many reasons why this book is loved by so many. Brown's simplistic poetry in this book is easily understood by children because she writes how a child would see something The illustrations are excellent in this book as well. The colors and shapes are all very soft and the colors seem to dim as the story comes to an end.Although I had not read the book in years, I soon remembered how well I liked the book when I read it to my neice the other night. The story itself is about a little bunny telling all the familar things around him goodnight. The little bunny even remembers a goodnight for the \\"old lady whispering hush\\". It is an extremely adorable book and suitable for all children who just need a little something to help them fall asleep. I know it will cause a few yawns among even the oldest of children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Although I didn't fall in love with this book on first sight, it has grown on me over time and it's now both my and my son's favourite bedtime read.Its simple rhyme and illustration was an immediate hit with my toddler, and as the text is so minimal in relation to the pictures there's lots to look at (and say goodnight to!) and a new story to tell every night.No wonder it's a classic!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is very adorable. I read it all the time to the kids I babysit, and it always puts them fast asleep. I remeber when I was little even I loved the book and had memorized it. The book really is adorable, so if you've got little kids around, DEFINITLEY read them this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is as fresh and poignant as the day it was first published more than 50 years ago. The author taps into a child's world and gives us a perfectly crafted accompaniment to bedtime in words and pictures. This little story told through a child's eyes is in tune with the experience of any child safely in their bedroom at night time.I came late to Goodnight Moon, having been brought up in England where it isn't well known. But now I have a daughter and our bedtime routine is all the better for Goodnight Moon. I'm now reading it to her from memory every night. The rhythm of the words and phrases is like a piece of music: it's a complete and satisfying bedtime lullaby in words. And you can pick up something different every time you read it.The sense of warmth and security coming through the pictures and sounds in Goodnight Moon is unmistakeable. A word to those adults whose own childhood experiences of bedtime were not so sweet -- watch out: reading this book to your child can be a healing experience for you!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Was disappointed when I looked at the book and it was just a little tattered around some of the edges!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Adorable book. Nice little story. We think this is great for little ones everyone. Anyone who has a baby could enjoy this with their kids."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The book was recommended as a great children's book. I haven't read the story so I'm not sure about it as a children's book. I can speak to the quality of this book. I bought the paperback because I prefer that over hardcover, but the pages are all in black and white, which is very disappointing for a children's book. I think the best part of children's books are the large colorful images."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My Grandson loves this book,especially the pictures. He loves anything that has to do with the moon,so it was perfect."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Got this book for my son he likes it. I got it for a great deal and will most likely try to get as a gift for a baby shower or a birthday."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was hanging around with my 2 yr son and he found it at the shelves in one store. Since he wanted all the books he liked at that time, I took only 2 among the huge pile he fond of. Sadly, one day after he told me he wanted &#34;Goodnight Moon&#34; (Buenas noches luna, he said). Now you guess why I bought it and I can say he enjoys it every night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a wonderful children's book, a classic that endures. Great for a bedtime routine for your youngest or even beginner readers."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"great book! I'm sure he'll chew the edges, very &#34;baby friendly&#34;.... its has nice thick pages and is very colorful!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"i thought this book was so boring when we first got it, and my 1 yr old wasn't attracted to the pictures. my daughter is now 2 1/2 and she loves this book and so do i. became one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A gift for my baby nephew. I love this book, it's a classic. I wanted the board book version but accidentally bought the hard cover version. Still, in great condition, he just can't hold it for a long time, too young."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I teach kindergarten and love to read children's stories. My class of four and five year olds are always impatient and can't sit still long enough to listen to most stories. However, they love this book. The story is engaging and the text is simple. It's a wonderful book to read before nap time."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I am six years old and I love Goodnight Moon - it's my favoritebook! My cousin's birthday is soon and he's turning one - I'm gettinghim this! I think this book is good for anybody who loves MargaretWise Brown's books.

Your kids will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 5 month old loves this book more than any other one...it's a great story ="},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"At 11 months old, my son is already pointing to the pictures as I read the story. The one line format is perfect for a first story for babies. They happily anticipate the next line, and can participate by finding the objects as the story is read. It is a &quot;must have&quot; book in every children's library, and is a joy at any time of the day, not just at bedtime."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon fulfills two very powerful needs to small children - to keep their mothers close to their sides as long as possible and to make closure on their day by telling each object goodnight. Fantasy is interwoven with basic human needs in the sweetest way. Goodnight Moon is also great for the beginning reader due to its limited vocabulary, beautiful illustrations and super sequence skills. It makes even moms and dads feel that all in well in the world"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This charming story of a young rabbit's bedtime ritual invokes the kind of cozy quiet that invites the peaceful security of pleasant dreams. This book is a &quot;must have&quot; for any parent of a young child, as it weaves a cloak of peacefulness around reader and listener alike, fostering a quality of warmth that lives happily ever after in childhood memories"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have never read this book before, but knew I wanted to read it to my daughter Ryan, especially since our last name is Moon. Ryan just loves this book at bedtime and the bunny is adorable."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Somehow \\"Goodnight Moon\\" just keeps on trucking along. It is the number one bedtime story parents have sought out for years and years and years. It is colorful and sober. Elegant and peachy keen. The truth of the matter? I was never too attached to \\"Goodnight Moon\\" as a child. Raised on a diet of Steven Kellogg and Richard Scary I had a hard time adjusting to the low key murmurs and repetitive phrases of this most ancient of picture books. Looking at it now I am bowled over by its original publication date. 1947. Amazing. Who would or could have thought that this little unprepossessing story would come to win the hearts and minds of as many millions of parents and children as it has? And, more importantly, continues to do so.You all know the story but I'm going to sum it up for you anyway. There is a bunny. It is attempting to go to sleep as an unnamed old lady says hush. The viewer is given the chance to look and and peruse the various objects around the room. Everything from the two kittens on the rug to a brightly lit little toyhouse. As we watch, the shadows lengthen and the room grows dimmer. Time on the clock passes. Finally, the restless little hare resigns itself to sleep and even the kittens cuddle together in the still quiet night.Brown has written the book with enough simple but easy-to-understand words for your average preschooler. I have always felt that the point in the book where she cheats a little is when she writes, \\"Goodnight comb, and goodnight brush, goodnight nobody, goodnight mush\\". Goodbye nobody? Surely something could have been drawn there instead of a blank page. Nonetheless, it is not a boring book. Sleepifying, yes. Drowsy-making, yes. But not dull. As I've said, it is not my favorite children's picture book, but even I can see that it is well-constructed and well-written too. With the derth of really effective bedtime books out there that have the ability to put you to sleep on purpose, a title like, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" stands out with its simple methodical goodnights."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Your youngest children will love the alliterative style of \\"Goodnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown, Clement Hurd.The repetition and sing-song quality will help your child remember and process language. The colorful pictures will help keep him or her involved, and you'll both love this book as a tool for bedtime preparation.On par with \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\"? You betcha! \\"Make Way...\\" is for a slightly older reader, but the same connections of pictures and words, though in very different styles, can be found.I fully recommend \\"Goodnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown, Clement Hurd.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"In the great green roomThere was a telephoneAnd a red balloonAnd a picture of -The cow jumping over the moon.So begins this timeless classic, first published in 1947. As I write this, fifty eight years later, the MS Word grammar checker takes issue with the use of \\"was\\" and mistakenly suggests \\"were\\" in its place. Yes, this is a book from another time, and so with its simple charm, it enchants, even today.The cadence and rhyme flow together ushering in an almost hypnotic sense of peace.And there were two little kittensAnd a pair of mittensAnd a little toy houseAnd a young mouseAnd a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mushAnd a quiet old lady who was whispering \\"hush\\".The illustrations complement this spell and draw the reader into a world of lengthening shadows as the light goes out to be replaced by moonbeams and the twinkling of the stars outside.Goodnight starsGoodnight airGoodnight noises everywhere."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My cousin bought this book for my son when he was just a couple months old, we have been reading it to him since then...he is now 18 months.

He loves the pictures, the gentle rhythm of the verses and the soothing way I read each verse to him.

At the end when the little rabbit is saying goodnight to everything we continue by saying goodnight to one another. I just ordered another one for my 4 year old niece. We actually read it so much we all know it by heart. I'll be buying this book for my grandkids many years from now."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I grew up loving Goodnight Moon as well as some other books by this author and illustrator (Runaway Bunny). It was a childhood classic, and I read the same copy that was read to me, to my children. They never complain, and now that they are older, 7 & 5, they help me either read or finish the sentences. I definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We have many copies of this book around the house. Our son is 22 months and has loved this book since we started reading it to him. He loves finding the mouse that moves around the pages and pointing out the different items we say goodnight too.Well worth it"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the greatest book, I never got tired of reading it to my children and love to give it as gifts. This was a great transaction!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Everyone has mentioned all of the great things about the book. I will just mention that if you didn't have it when you were a child, you will enjoy it yourself. If you did...you will delight in reading it to your own child. It is just one of those classics that every child's library should contain."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Once again, great service. Book arrived well on time. Came with a cute lil bunny. Read so many reviews about this book decided to just buy one for my lil one to-be too, which I have already begun reading to him:) (Am due next month)I liked the way the pictures were done with the pages getting darker and darker towards the end before the final GOOD NIGHT."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 2 yr old son loves this book and loves going through and looking at the pictures. We ask him where something is and he finds it in the picture. Entertains him for quite awhile. Its not too long of a book either so it holds his attention perfectly."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"great book every night coming home my son waves goodnight to the moon and stars and then once we are home and settled we read this book and we love it"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a classic for children. The story is simple and the illustrations are beautiful, taking you and your child into a world of pure fantasy. I am only disappointed that the book (purchased NEW) arrived with \\"scuff\\" marks. It came in a package with 2 other books and they were fine."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Sent this book as a baby gift. Everyone knows how amazing Goodnight Moon is (super amazing!). No problems with the seller."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Anyone who has a new baby coming or already have one at home has to get this great book.Even before my grandson(who is now 11)came into this world my daughter this to child while still in her womb and after arrived everynight.And calot other times of the day,I enjoyed reading to him also. So now when I am invited to a baby shower or when a child I know is born I give them a copy.So Parents and Grandparents picvk up a copy,Its a classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Such a wonderful comfort this book is at any time. I never tired of reading it to my daughter, the countless times we read it together. It is now the book she gives to all of her friends for baby shower gifts.I wasn't going to write a review after seeing SO many reviews.However, I noticed in the reviews I did read, they did not mention our favorite thing in the story.On every page the little mouse is hiding or peeking out from a different spot.We always looked for the mouse...where is the mouse?\\"THERE he is!\\"It makes me smile to recall those golden hours with my little girl on my lap, reading this sweet and comforting book.She is 35 years old now, and hoping for children of her own. Someday she will the pleasure of her own child cuddled on her lap, reading Margaret Wise Brown's forever relevant ode to the ritual of saying goodnight...and building lasting memories for them both."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Love this book! Although it is a bit above my son's head (he's 9 months old), I still notice that he's interested in this book both for its bright colors and for the rythm of the text as it's being read. It's definitely a book that will be used for several years!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is wonderful. I started reading it to my daughter when she was a baby at bed time, and even though she's 5 now she still pulls it out of the bookshelf at least once a week as part of her nightly reading ritual.The reason why this book is so beloved by both children and parents is that it helps get them ready for the ritual of going to bed, relaxing their minds and bodies. Who amoung us as parents haven't had our children say good night to everyone and everything, inanimate objects included. The boy in the story as he's going to bed an getting ready to sleep says goodnight to everything he sees in his room and when he is finished he knows that it is time to sleep. When reading this story to your child slowly soften your voice as you turn the pages until you are just whispering at the end. Have your child try to find the mouse on each of the colored pages and say goodnight to some of the objects in their room as they lay down for the night.It seems the majority of bad reviews for this book are based on the idea that it is not colorful enough or an exciting read. That's sort of the idea. Little eyes and minds get enough stimulation during the day and a lot of it isn't positive or good. This book helps children notice the small details of their surroundings, to use their imagination, all in the process of going to bed.This is one of the best, if not the best, night time book out there and I would highly recommend to parents with small children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Love love love this book. My children all enjoyed it - we've worn out 3 copies. Now I love giving it as a gift to new little ones. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"ok, so we first got this book as a gift @ the hospital. I read it to my baby once, thought it was stupid and never thought about it again. He's two now and LOVES this book. We got him the oversized (lap) version, and he won't put it down. I don't know why kids loves this book so much...Who says \\"Goodnight Nobody\\"...?..Whatever...If he likes it, I love it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is an apparently simple bedtime book whose appeal has endured for over sixty years. In it, a small rabbit delays bedtime by saying goodnight to all the objects in his room. The text is soothingly rhythmic, and the well-conceived artwork depicts the same bedroom from different perspectives in two-page colored spreads, alternating with close-up pictures of individual objects in shades of gray. As the bunny slowly subsides into bed and sleep, the light in the room dims until shapes are nearly imperceptible. This warm and comforting story traces the emotional transition of a young child from active relationship to restful solitude, all in the context of a stable and secure home emblemized by the unchanging objects in the room. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I'm very satisfied with this book. It's a wonderful story and the little stuffed animal with it was anunexpected plus. The book arrived quickly and in good condition."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I've been reading this book to my son since the day he was born. He's almost a year old now and all I have to do is start reciting the book to him and he smiles and giggles. When I ask him to go get me a book, he ALWAYS grabs \\"Goodnight, Moon.\\" The illustrations are very appealing to the baby's eye. We're at the point now where I'll ask him where the cow is and he points to it, etc.If you're expecting Shakspearean literature, this book is not for you. If you want an easily read book for infants, this is it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughters love this book. My 4 year old \\"reads\\" it to our 1 year old. A calming, soothing book that should be in every nursery."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My youngest really enjoyed the book. I had great time as well. It's so much fun and wonderful way to interact with the baby. The illustrations keep her attention. A perfect gift book! Another book that I think is definitely worth the money is I Have a Problem by Carolyn Apel. My 5 year old daughter loves this book. She requests it almost every night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 13 month old daughter loves this book. She is so attracted to the illustrations and studies them intently. As we put her and her brother to bed at night we say good night to our cat, the outdoors, the mirror at the bottom of the staircase, light fixtures, etc.--she likes it, it's a good transition to bedtime and she'll remember it as she grows up."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A while back I wrote a negative review of this book because I thought it was strange.(I deleted the review only a day or so after writing it, however). Like some others, I could not see the appeal of this book and didn't understand the particular writing style. I had read it to my child a few times and then stopped for a while.Well, a couple of months ago I started reading this book at bedtime some and guess what - the baby really likes it! Now if my child likes it, then I cannot help but like it! He is 13 months old now and this is one of his many favorite books. It is part of our bedtime routine and is special to me now because I share with him each night. I am sure when he grows up I will have fond memories of \\"Good Night Moon\\", and may become sad when he thinks he is too old for this story.Somehow, I do feel it is a sweet little book. We received 2 copies as gifts - I doubt I would have ever bought it on my own - but it has become a special tradition for us!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I loved this book when I was younger. I recently bought this book for my cousin who also loved it!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This story is just perfect for quieting your little ones to go to sleep at night. It's a very sweet and simple story. Your children will start saying good night to everything in their room though :-) A must have for your children's library at home."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon was one of my favorite books when I was young, and now I have the privelege of reading this book to my own children. With it's simple, yet myseterious-looking pictures, and it's rather intriguing repetition, what's not to love? It's one of those books that never gets old. I've had my copy since 1987 and it has never collected dust. It's a favorite of my children now, and has almost become a \\"comfort\\" story for them. I reccommend this book to everyone, adults and children alike."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"my two year old loves this book, picks it out constantly even though he has over 40 books on his shelf, my four year old also enjoys it still, very good book to have"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We are now on our third well-loved copy of this book. I originally bought the book when my son was a toddler, and it quickly became his favorite bed-time story. My daughter carried on the family-tradition of having this story read to her each night.By now I know the entire story by heart, and on occassion will recite it on car trips to help settle the kids. The book itself is lovely, but the cadence of the words are so gentle and seem to lull any child that hears it into a sweet slumber. I've actually just recited the story to my youngest (6 month old) niece, and she fell asleep in my arms just listening to the words.A wonderful addition to any child's library!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"What a dumb book!!!! Thankfully I didn't waste money on it. I know it's one of the most popular baby books out there, but I don't get it. There are a million better books... this one is terrible."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"According to my mom I loved this book when I was a baby. She thinks that the one I had was all color and more vibrant than this edition. Half of the pages of this new edition are black and white. Very uninspiring. Out of 100+ books that my 17 month old son has, this is his least favorite. I read it to him a few times but his eyes seemed to glaze over with boredom (in a way it's actually kind of cool to see him discriminate between good and bad \\"literature\\"). Now it is gathering dust."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is not a board book, it is a regular copy of Goodnight Moon, and frayed around the edges to boot. We sent it back and were told that they would refund our money, but it has been a few weeks and we haven't heard a word."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter never liked this book. My husband nor I ever cared for it either. It didn't keep our daughter's attention at all nor did it \\"soothe\\". It just didn't live up to all the hype. We read to our daughter all the time and have since her birth and she loves almost all books, but not this one. She much prefered Sandra Boynton's board books."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Never heard of this book before about 10 years ago. It was never on my bookshelf as a child (I'm 32) or any of my older siblings. Got it as a gift, and simply don't see what the fuss is about. There are more engaging bedtime books (Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book, and Sandra Boynton's Pajama Time! and The Going to Bed Book among them). Or, look around the room and make up your own, e.g. Goodnight walls/floors, windows/doors, smoke detector, etc. There--just saved you the cost of this book.Ultimately, it probably doesn't matter *what* you read/sing to your kids to wind them down, but *how* you read/sing it to them. Slower, repetitive, deep, more drawn out you-are-getting-sleeeeeepy delivery, etc. Not rocket science. This book fits that pattern, but coupled with the bizarre coloring of the illustrations, mismatched repetition, and hard to read in dim light printing, it's just not worthy of the hype, IMO."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We were given this books as a gift. I really dislike it--there seems to be an upleasant undertone: \\"bowl full of mush\\", \\"goodnight nobody\\". I find the illustrations equally unpleasant (or maybe that's why I find the book unpleasant). I recycled it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Everyone told us we had to get this book and someone even bought it for us at our shower. Neither my husband nor I can figure out why this is such a classic. It is inane. Ridiculous. No cute story, no message, not even a good rhyme. Millions of people have been hoodwinked in to buying this book. Please, save your money."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I still haven't received the book \\"Goodnight Moon.\\" I ordered it over a month ago. Can you tell me why it's taking so long?"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I cannot believe the number of positive reviews about this book. This is a case of nobody being able to see that the emperor is naked except the little boy. This book was so obviously poorly written and illustrated. Most authors of children's' books have a special talent. I think most anyone could have written this one. It's even a little creepy."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I cannot believe most reviewers say it's a classic. It's so boring my 20-month old son refuses to be near the book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"a great book for kids at bedtime.a must have for little ones.also loved Kyle's First Crush, Fancy Nancy, and Mean SoupLeah Orr, Children's book author"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I can safely say that since my 22 month old son became obsessed with this book, we have read it atleast 4 times a night for the past 5 months. I know it by heart, and often recite it to him before a nap (we save the book for bedtime). Its hard to believe anyone hasnt heard this story. My son has the copy which I had when i was a baby. Definetly a story that stood the test of time, which is rare in the children's world."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I took this book out from the library in 1959 for my first child. It has never ceased to charm me through 5 children and 13 grandchildren. What is the magic? \\"Goodnight Moon\\" succeeds in entrancing everybody who sees and hears it. Unlike many other books suitable for children at an early age, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" charms adults as well. The repetition never bores, and surprises with small jokes like \\"Goodnight Nobody.\\" I ended up knowing it by heart. There's just some essence of the lyrical that is fully captured though you can't put your finger on it exactly. Maybe the author's publisher was right, \\"She's a genius.\\""},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My baby loves this book, she even learned to turn the pages herself! Great for bedtime."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is a great bedtime classic that stands the test of time. I remember fondly and vividly having this book read to me as a child and the warm and cozy feelings of being safe and sound and ready to be tucked away to bed that it evoked. Rereading it now, as an adult to my son, I've noticed that part of the appeal may be the contrast and back and forth between the simple black and white pages and the detailed colorful (yet nighttime muted) room. This seems to capture my son's attention. On a humorous note, someone pointed out to me recently that the old lady whispering hush (rhymes with mush) is really a large rabbit in a dress. Just makes this great classic all the more whimsical and appealling!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great book for small children, toddlers. The kids are drawn to the book and they can point to objects in the book when prompted by the parent. Both of my children love this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son and I have enjoyed this book for years. It's his favorite and it's easy to remember that it has become a classic bedtime story for decades. The book is available in different sizes and formats so be sure to pick the appropriate selection."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Every child should have this book...I love it, as do my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic book..... we LOVE it....great pictures & wind down to go to bed!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is a \\"Family Tradition\\" and anyone who has a baby in our family is sure to get this classic,wonderful bedtime book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 2 1/2 year old got this book for Christmas last year. It is her favorite book. It is also lots of fun to read. I don't know why something so simply written is so good, but it just is. The pictures do alot to keep her attention and stir her growing imagination. I highly recommend this book for young children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This seemingly simple book is my son's absolute favorite! I had no idea it would be such a hit, now I know why its a classic.The illustrations are very simple and seem old fashion compared to most newer books out there. The colors you see on the cover are all the colors you'll find inside the book. And the pages do alternates between color and black & white, and yet... this book is completely adored by my 17 month son.Great for bonding. He hands this book to any relative or friend he sees and then settles himself in their lap for a reading. I've never seen my child more animated with a book.He roars \\"balloon!\\" and points to the drawing of the red balloon and also says 'chairs', 'mush' and 'hush' and yes, he was only 17 months old. :)He just loves it, I often see him flipping thru the book on his own.We have the lapbook edition with is also a boardbook but much bigger, however I would recommend buying this version.The Lap book is difficult for my son to pick up and 'read' by himself and has gotten very bent up because of his laying on one side while trying to read the opposite page. Also the lap version is too big to throw in the diaper bag.I also recommend purchasing the HBO special on DVD \\"Goodnight Moon and Other Sleepytime Tales\\".Goodnight Moon and Other Sleepytime TalesMy son saw this after we bought the book and it was so neat to see him run and get his book, making the connection between the book and the visuals in the dvd.The dvd is completely wonderful in its own right. It features Susan Sarandon telling the goodnight moon story twice, in the beginning and the end of the dvd. She is an excellent narrator. :)The goodnight moon graphics are the exact same as the book but are animated, just a little bit.It also features Tony Bennet singing Dreamland, Lauren Hill singing Hush Little Baby, Natalie Cole, Aaron Neville and my son's favorite song on the dvd, Twinkle Tinkle Little Star sung by Patty LaBelle. My son says 'tinkle!' whene he knows its coming and actually sings along! The visuals are gorgeous of a little girl playing among the stars.Over all the dvd is very soothing, my son watches/listens to it after his dinner as a wind down and before we read him the Goodnight Moon book and tuck him into his crib. :) Buy this book and also buy the dvd, your child will love them both."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},A={key:1};function L(n,o,s,u,r,i){const y=b("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(e(!0),t(m,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(e(),g(y,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",A,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(N,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-d5200dae"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/33.md","filePath":"quotesmag/33.md"}'),G={name:"quotesmag/33.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[f(q)]))}});export{D as __pageData,Y as default};
