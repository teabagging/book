The book is divided into three sections: a preliminary one that interprets the relationship between faith, scripture, and ethics; a middle one that explores various traditions in Christian ethics; and a final one that offers treatments of specific moral issues.The first part is the most satisfying of the three. Rowan Williams' lead essay, &quot;Making Moral Decisions,&quot; masterfully argues that Christians make moral decisions pretty much the same as everyone else, except (and this is a big &quot;except&quot;) for the fact that the decisions are made within the context of a community of faith and reflect that community's worldview. This means that the Christian should also seek to exemplify divine holiness in her moral decisions, and that she should take seriously disagreements in the community that also strive for such an exemplification. The other essays in the first section take their cue from Williams' approach, carefully examining whether scripture is a set of definitive moral guidelines or whether it instead is an interpretive tool that invites contemporary readers to examine the issues confronting them in light of the Gospel message. The latter approach is endorsed.The middle section discusses several traditions including natural law ethics and virtue ethics, but for my money Lisa Sowle Cahill's essay on gender and Tim Gorringe's on liberation are the most interesting. They're also the most unsatisfying, because space constraints prevent Cahill and Gorringe from providing more than sketchy overviews.The third section is the most uneven part of the book. R. John Elford offers a rather uncritical endorsement of just war theory, thankfully offset by Robin Gill's reasoned but passionate argument that the arms trade is unacceptable from a Christian moral perspective. Max Stackhouse's essay is a strangely heavy-handed endorsement of neoliberal capitalism, but is balanced to some extent by Duncan Forrester's more reflective essay on social justice and welfare. Michael Northcott's essay on ecology is quite good, but Don Browning's on world family trends is overblown--one of his basic contentions is the (surely eurocentric) claim that father-less families are devastating in their consequences--and James Childress' on biomedical issues is a rather ho-hum rehash of standard issues revolving around abortion, euthanasia, and reproduction.One interesting note: the influence of Stanley Hauerwas is evident throughout the essays in this volume. There are more references to him than to any other Christian ethicist-- including Thomas Aquinas, Augustine, Karl Barth, Martin Luther, and St. Paul!"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Christian Ethics (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"This book is a very good survey of the breadth of issues in Christian Ethics and the Christian moral life, with insight into the possible responses that many Christian thinkers have given to those issues.

Emphasis is on the analysis of variance and various designs for linear models. Includes some early work on missing data. The book was not revised and hence is not up-to-date on many topics. It does not cover computational aspects of statistical analysis and if it had it would not be very helpful in today's changing world of fast computing. It is sometimes worthwhile to go back and see the way statistics was viewed in the past. Many statistician started rereading the seminal papers of R. A. Fisher in the 1970s.

The lives of this Beaver family comes alive through the eyes of author Hope Ryden. You'll begin to feel you're right there with her as she studies this Beaver family over the course of four years painstaking work. Ms. Ryden does an excellent job of conveying what this family of Beavers is up to and you learn an outstanding amount of information about the natural history of Beavers. You become both attached to Ms. Ryden and the family of beavers, feeling both her joy and pain as you see their lives progress before you. I even shed some tears..it was that good.

I finished it in 2 days, it was phenominal. The way she talked about the beavers was like a sitcom, but at the same time you learned so much. I didn't have to force myself to concentrate, like I normally do with text books, for one second, but the abundance of information I got from this book never fails to amaze me. I have to give Hope Ryden 2 thumbs up for this book. It's one you can't put down no matter how hard you try.

I really had no interest in beavers. I was suprised I could not put the book down. It is wonderfully written. Like a funny movie, I feel better after reading this book. The insights into the life and habits of beavers are overwhelming. I had no idea these creatures were so human like. The story is often funny, but we see the sad side when some punky teens try to destroy the beavers home. I have lent the book to many friends, after working hard to convence them it really is a great story. Each person, male and female, loved the story. I just bought multiple copies to loan, and some for gifts, something I have never done with any other book."},{"Title":"Lily Pond","review":"Hope Ryden describes the natural world like no other author.

You'll find guidance for most of the things that is required to live in harmony and peace with oneself. From self-esteem, to understanding, to being a woman of virtue, Armstrong has tackled the topic. This book tugs at our psyche and compels us to take a deeper look within. Armstrong encourages us to reach outside ourselves and climb our personal mountains.Although the book offered sound guidance and explored several topics, there was nothing in it that has not been covered in similar books. The way in which Armstrong presented the material, however, was unique and concise which made her book more interesting than most. From short stories, to bible verses, to poetry, there is a little something for everybody.If your soul is in need of solace, I recommend you pick-up a copy.

I promptly sold it back as soon as I could replace it with another med-surg book. The content of this book is quite comprehensive, however, my major complaint is the book's readability.

Instead, she attempts a historical reproduction of the lives of American Black women and American white women, two collective voices which are all too often forgotten in the sexualized debate over race relations and slavery. Rather than seeing that debate as a battle between Black men and White men Stevenson's work is meant to compliment the works of earlier researchers, notably Blassingame, Genovese, Herskovitz, and Jones to provide a complete and concerted picture of slave life for all involved: black and white, male and female. By providing the evidence of primary sources she lets the dead speak for themselves about their conditions rather than creating academic hyperbole in an Ivory (or Ebony) Tower. Any dismissive criticisms of political correctness or sanitized objectivity directed against this amazing accomplishment miss the point entirely. Stevenson is being academically precise, intellectually faithful, and ethically professional in detailing these stories that would have otherwise been smeared in the miasma of American history. In distinguishing heterosexual relationships from homosexual, which are increasingly coming to light as more and more evidence of the truth of slavery is exposed, her book signals a change in historical materials that seek to be more comprehensive in examing past lives. Her book is a necessary element in the ongoing narrative of American history."},{"Title":"Life in Black and White: Family and Community in the Slave South","review":"I began reading this novel hoping to gain new insights into social life in the American South. Instead, I discovered a moderately interesting social analysis of the South that focuses a bit much on the psychological aspects of southern life without telling me why they were unique to the time period. For instance, Stevenson devotes an entire chapter to the challenges of marriage and the conflict between financial success and the marital bond. She doesn't always say what makes this problem unique to the South. I also noticed a creeping political correctness in her writing (e.g. &quot;heterosexual&quot; marriages among slaves) that she doesn't justify with historical evidence. This book served as a reminder of inequality, but maybe used too modern a standard to criticize a not-so-modern society."},{"Title":"Global Electronic Commerce: Theory and Case Studies","review":"Global eCommerce is a good text book for eCommerce.

They contend that what we see now is the current stage in several decades' evolution of business automation. This evolution has progressed from the back office, to the desktop, to the Web. New technologies build on old, and the 'new economy' is not really that new. It was interesting to see the variance in reviewers impressions. This is a textbook rather than trade press (e.g., 'Customers.com') and is challenging to read cover-to-cover. Perhaps it is better used as a reference. The authors give little attention to dot.com retailing, but contend that this is not where e-commerce will prevail. The crash of dot.com stocks has validated their claims."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The book is preachy. The characters are not credible. The plot is thin. The writing is horrible.

Although, it's not a surprise that he ventured out to write something other than medicine because we all know how great of a writer he is and how intelligent he is. After the initial shock, it was just like his other books, just couldn't stop reading it."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I didn't read Amazon's reader reviews on this book until afterward, but they all seemed to mirror my own assessment of &quot;Abduction&quot;. My first thought was 'Did he write this in high school or what?'. This novel was definitely not up to Robin Cook standards in comparison to his many wonderful medical thrillers. His characters were nothing short of juvenile in behavior, and his overuse of the word &quot;surreal&quot; in one chapter had me about ready to scratch my own eyes out! I think Dr. Cook had better give up science fiction and go back to doctors and hospitals, where he excels as a novelist."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This novel tells the story of five people who are sucked into an undersea civilization very much older than our own. The plot hinges on two of the &quot;suckees&quot; - deepsea divers - acting like oversexed Neanderthals who become rapacious killers in a Utopia that knows no violence. The characters in this book are so unreal, their actions so inexplicable and &quot;far out,&quot; that the novel becomes laughable. The premise, the plot, and the characters are so cartoon-like that the reader weeps for Robin Cook; to think that a well-known author's gift is revealed as so thin and fragile. This book is a literary suicide. Avoid it!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"After reading that Robin Cook is supposed to be one of the good medical thriller authors, I decided to give him a chance. He definitely didn't pass my test! The main thing that really irked me about this book was his portrayal of blue collar workers. Just because he is a doctor with a degree on his wall doesn't mean that he is better than everyone else. His portrayal of blue collar workers shows them to be idiotic, homophobic and purely hostile when it comes to conversations with the more \\"civilized.\\" One word to describe this book: disgraceful."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"In spite of all the negative reviews i really liked it. Is it as well written as his previous books? No, but is it a page turner? Yes. Perfect for a flight or on the beach. The end sure is a twist. Lighten up everyone."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Abduction by Robin Cook was a fun read but it had the feel of, to put it very crudely, Michael Crichton's jealous and much less talented younger brother trying to prove to the world that he can do it too. Yes, Robin Cook isn't Crichton's relation at all but I compare every author who tries to pull off ridiculous stuff like this to him because I can't help but think that Crichton either could pull it off, or would no better than to try and do so. Cook is known for his medical thrillers, a couple of which I have read and found overwhelmingly boring, and, although I am criticizing this novel, Abduction is my favorite Cook novel. Fiction is fiction. It doesn't always need an explanation but sometimes authors forget this and try to slam one in there and it makes the story funny when it isn't supposed to be. I enjoyed this quite a bit and I think that James Rollins fans would too, but keep that younger, less-talented brother comparison in your minds if you try it."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This was totally different from Robin Cook's other books , and I really liked it.

In good science fiction there is some attempt to conform to the laws of physics, etc., and the alien civilization has some limitations. In \\"Abduction\\" Cook makes no effort to conform known genetics, physics, geology, etc, and the power of the \\"first generation humans\\" is almost unlimited.The \\"first generation humans\\" are essentially immortals and capable of intergalactic and time travel. They intercept and study all of the radio, television, etc. communitcations of the \\"second generation\\". They can mask their undersea mountains from Geosat satellites. Yet, implausibly, they need to abduct a few ordinary \\"second generation humans\\" to ask them about the state of deep oceanic drilling. Huh?And of course, the \\"first generation humans\\" conform to every adolescent vision of a utopian society. They are masters of extremely advanced technology. Slave robots to do all the actual work, appearing almost instantly with anything desired. Doors disappear into walls. They are apparently vegans, and the food tastes different to each person depending on their preferences, etc. Of course the inhabitants barely bother with clothing, apparently love-making is about their only activity. They are pacifists who abhor violence of any kind. And yet they are just ordinary folks?Why do they have large refrigerators in their apartments, particularly in their microbe-free environment? Haven't they managed to miniaturize refrigeration? And for that matter, what do they need refrigerators for when robot slaves appear almost instantly with anything requested?How plausible is it that offered immortal luxury, the entire \\"second generation\\" crew (with the exception of a woman) are obscessed with escape?VERDICTFor a 12-year-old author, this would have been a fine effort. But for an established adult author, the novel was a great disappointment."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This was a slow, painful journey to the center of the earth.

However, that has not prevented me from reading several books by Robin Cook and, for the most part, enjoying them to varying degrees.The strength of Cook's other work was that he stuck to what he knew - medicine. Granted, the writing was sophomoric and the plot usually the same old recycled \\"Docs stealing bodyparts/drugs/fill in the blank for profit\\" plot but the ride was usually pleasantly diverting and painless.TILL NOW!This book offends just about every sense that it can, from the absurdly childish plotting to the incredibly hack nature of the prose. This book actually insults cliche's...it sooo bad I can barely find words to describe my amazament at the book - (The horror - the horror..)Be warned - books rarely get as bad as this. It is poorly plotted, written, conceived. That any of the characters in the book can be viewed favorably is impossible. Everyone's a dolt or selfish or stupid. (No one is as stupid as me for actually reading this to the end - just shoot me for god's sake)Have I made it clear? A 1st grader could tell a more compelling and captivating story.

I am a huge fan of Robin Cook and can hardly wait until his books come out. This book had me giggling in some places, though I don't think that was his intent. It seemed to be something a &quot;budding sci-fi writer&quot; might do as a first book, not a seasoned writer of medical thrillers. I did donate it to my High School library, as the kids might enjoy it if they don't know who Robin Cook is. When they check it out, I will tell them not to judge his writing on that book alone and recommend another to them."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Disappointing.

The plotting, characterization, and style is at the fifth grade level.

For heaven's sake, don't encourage them and pay money for this trash. Read Verne. Zero stars."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I like good Sci-Fi, but this book doesn't qualify. The book's beginning is good, the middle boring and trite, with an ending that is very weak. In some respects, this book is a take off on H.G.

Pass on this one, but if you have not read other works by Robin Cook do so. This book is not typical of his usual fine writing."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Having read all of Robin Cook's novels, I anticipated another exciting story. I was disappointed. Although well written, I found the subject a little too far-fetched, and not the usual Robin Cook excitement. Having also read &quot;Invasion&quot;, I feel that Robin Cook should keep to the medical themes that he obviously knows so well. His medical stories are always &quot;can't put down&quot; believable."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I liked Abduction. I've read all the Robin Cook novels, and while this one is certainly a departure into sci-fi for him, Cook's usual character development was as strong as ever, making you care about each character. I think he did a fine job of creating an alternate world and he had some fun with it. Anyone familiar with his other books should give this one a try."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I can see from the other reviews that this is not an especially loved book by the crowd accustomed to Cook's medical thrillers, but I think this is his best book yet. For one of his first attempts in the world of sci-fi, this is amazing. The sheer believability of it, despite the mythical theme, was enough to keep me reading for six hours straight- including two meals, an hour-long car ride, four complete CDs and half an hour of radio. I have been an avid reader of Robin's books for several years now, and have read every book he has had published up to date. I found this a refreshing break from reality. On another note, if you would like to read a much less sophisticated book with a similar underlying theme, I suggest Sang Spell by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I just finished this book and then read some of the reviews. Unlike everyone else, I liked it. I stayed up late dying to see what was going to happen. I've read many other RC books also. I thought it was great, and I recommend it to anyone with an open mind and who doesn't stereotype Cook as just a &quot;medical author&quot;."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I agree with almost everything the other reviewers have said. The only thing that pleased me was that I didn't pay the full price for the book! Hopefully RC will read a few of these reviews and see the error of his ways.

I would like to hear what Cook had in mind when he wrote this novel.And if it is a earlier work,just released.Several things make no sense such as why abduct the divers when all they wanted was the woman.And Mr.Cook should meet some military vets,because while the two divers are not completely impossible the retired vet was way off base.I served as did my father and an officer as most vets can leave it behind once retired."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Can this book really have been written by the Robin Cook, whose previous books I have thoroughly enjoyed?

I sincerely hope that Mr. Cook will return to what he does best: writting medical fiction."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The premise was excellent, but the execution of the story was too derivative and clumsy. Most of the characters were self-absorbed caricatures, rather than people you could identify with or root for in any manner. Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jule Verne and The Time Machine by H.G. Wells are more enjoyable science fiction classics. Robin Cook is usually much better than this effort."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Loved it best book I have read in quite a while. Will definitely recommend to others. Can't wait to read more"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I love novels about things that could happen, no matter how impossible they may seem. Not particularly well written, but the intriguing story line makes up for the overuse of the word : surreal. I recommend for any ocean lover"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I've read a bunch of Robin Cook's medical thrillers, most of them good, some better than others, he's a good writer. I've never thought of them as five star books. I downloaded the audio book of \\"Abduction \\" read by Dick Hill, and had no idea what I was getting into. (I didn't read any book liner info) It starts with a very tedious set-up - kind of boring, then excels into a great masterful Sci-fi drama that blew me away.I thought Cook did a great job of making something so fantastic - plausible. After awhile you just go with it. I don't read much sci-fi, so this story was very original for me. I would hate to tell anything about the story, wouldn't want to ruin it for you. Just read it, it's the best story I've read from this author. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I LOVE THE STORY BUT YOU MISREPRESENTED IT AS AN AUDIO BOOK. DUE TO THAT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. THE BOOK IS GREAT, AMAZON SERVICE IS NOT."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I had read this years ago, and didn't remember for sure till the ending....A bit different for Robin Cook. Still a FAN!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"If this were written by someone known to write science fiction, I would not have even started the book. Robin Cook writes terrific medical thrillers and he should stick with it."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The book was an interesting and light read. But too many things didn't make sense. The underwater people have sex but they don't know what kissing is? They monitor life on the surface but don't know what a Frisbee is? They have all that scientific knowledge but can't recognize a $2 piece of plastic as some kind of a toy? It stretched the imagination, especially when they have brought other surface humans down there and surely one of them could have told them what a frisbee was. I mean really, in all of history the Interterrans don't have not one video of people playing in a park? They could poke into any other point in time, but not that. Plus, they had access to all television stations. It's impossible to believe that they never saw a frisbee. As you can tell, this is where the story really went south for me. That and the fact that they wouldn't clean up the items in the museum, but they fixed the Oceanus.But the worst part was the non-ending. Cook couldn't come up with a 3 page epilogue? Come on. But even before that, it felt like he stopped writing. Like it was a made for TV movie and he realized it was 9:50 pm and he needed to wrap it up by 10. The book begged for at least 2 more chapters. At least it could have been wrapped up in a neat bow and readers could forget some of the nonsense."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Excessive exposition, two-dimensional characters and illogical plot points. Surprising from Robin Cook - possibly a ghost writer? Premise was promising but poorly executed."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Thsi has to get 4 stars because it is plausable.I found it wonderful fodder for a sci-fi movie[I love scifi movies]and it impresses me that Robin Cook is galactically creative as to write sci-fi as well as medical thrillers,[and do a great job on both] what a combination! The ending was totally unexpected and definitely possible."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I've read every one of Cook's books; he is after all quite prolific... But having seen the reviews on here first, maybe my expectations were low. Surprise -- I liked it a lot! OK, maybe it was pure escapism, but I found it a welcome switch from the medico-suspense genre typical of Cook (ala Sphinx, showing another side of Cook's dexterity and topical brilliance). Admittedly not a sci-fi dabbler at all, I found the adventure underwater, followed by the discovery (albeit, via abduction) of Interterra&quot; (Utopia) quite amusing. His &quot;explanations&quot; of various scientific mysteries at least bordered on possibility (hey, this is fiction after all!), including the story of Atlantis and similar phenomena. I did think the ending was a bit abrupt; I might have voted 5 stars if he could have handled that a little better. In fact, I'd argue the escape element near the end was virtually the only segment of the book with little or no plausibility.Anyhow, I enjoyed. While I often criticize Cook for his unbelievable action (as opposed to premise or plot), his vivid imagination is in fine form here for an &quot;airport&quot; paperback."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"If you are thinking &quot;typical Robin Cook&quot; you won't be able to appreciate this book. But if you just read without those expectations I think you will enjoy this new type of story with Robin Cook. I couldn't put the book down! It was so unlike anything I have ever read......very creative. I was sorry to reach the end of the book. What an adventure! More please, Mr. Cook."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is a well-written tale about Atlantis by a professional wordsmith, with flying saucers, and ancient civilizations--all of the elements to maintain your interest, while not enthralling you with their plausibility. In other words, it is pure entertainment and obviously not intended to create emotional investment.While drilling into a sea mount near the Azores, exploring for an oil field, two of the ship Benthic Explorer's divers and the two man one woman crew of their deep diving submarine are sucked into a submarine canyon and into a world under the sea, populated by beautiful people with vastly superior technology and, of course, vastly superior social moir&eacute;s. Of course they don't believe in violence, and the two roughneck divers live and breath for violence. It is more or less of a typical pot-boiler in the SF area.Joseph H. PierreAuthor of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The only abduction here is that of the reader's time and money. The idea of a secret city under the sea (in the earth's crust) seemed a little out there, but then do so the stories of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and M. Crichton, so I kept reading hoping something interesting would turn up. Alas, it just got more boring and trite as it went on. I skipped a big chunk and went towards the end, again hoping for some twist or something to justify my having bought it. No such luck. I can only believe that this book was published because of the author's very well-known name. Please, Dr.C., stick to medical thrillers or you'll lose a ton of readers."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"With a bookshelf filled with Cook's previous efforts, and an equally large number of sci-fi, I was pleasantly surprised at his delving into the sci-fi genre. His thugs were properly Neanderthal, and his technical details were enjoyable as always. I look forward to future efforts in this direction, as well as his more traditional medical thrillers. Hey, how many series does Tom Clancy have going at this time? Go for it, Robin..."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I eagerly await Robin Cook's novels, although this one was not written in his usual style.&quot;Abduction&quot; is more of a sci-fi thriller and I enjoyed it immensely.The ending was excellent.I do hope his next book &quot;Shock&quot; will be in tune with a medical thriller novel."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have read almost every one of Cook's books, and I found Abduction to be such a disappointment. It is sort of a combination of Man from Atlantis and Lost in Space, and not done as well as either of those B-grade t.v. shows. The premise of the book was far-fetched, and the characters were fairly steroetypical. I got lost in the technical jargon during Arak's explanations to Suzanne (the glossary in the back of the book helped, but not all of the terms were there), and I don't like to read a fiction book with the aid of a dictionary. The ending was very trite, not all that surprising, and disappointing in that the reader never really knows what happens to Suzanne. I get the feeling that Cook was writing this one to sell as a made for t.v. movie and lost sight of the higher quality writing that he is capable of. If you are a Cook fan like I am, read it so that you can say you've read it; otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"One of the things that I find is that when someone has either a favorite author or has read several of one authors books they tend to place him or her in a box. Dr. Cook writes, and I have read only one, medical books, and he is good at it. He's a doctor after all. We tend to expect a certain type or style from an author. It is why we read them, we know what they write about. Toni Morrison, Clive Cussler, and many other well know writers write in a style that we know about before we pick up the book. When an author strays from the well known path that people expect they sometimes get upset because the image that they receive back from the mirror doesn't match what they expected. I bought this book because it was bombed by several people who stated right off the bat that they were fans or had read much if not everything Cook had written. I give Dr Cook a big atta-boy for this book. He's in a brave new world with his writting. Sure its weak in spots and predictable in others, but I enjoyed it for I wasn't hung up on past books by him. If you can read a book without presupposed ideas it can be enjoyed. I liked the ending and thought it was an original twist. To the fans of Robin Cook I say, &quot;don't worry, he'll be back.&quot; And to people who haven't read him I say, &quot;sit back and enjoy the story, it's lite and fun to read.&quot; Life is too long and hard to spend most of the trip looking for the ruts!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This was a pleasant surprise from Robin Cook not so much because the story is intriguing as the fact that I'd never discovered anything so sci-fi-ish by Cook before. It's a little more fantasy than sci-fi, but the science it utilizes, while often a bit vague, is not so terribly far-fetched in many instances. Mainly, Abduction is a story about a mixed group of professionals who inadvertantly become a part of a fantastic utopia and how they deal with it. What if heaven existed on Earth, and you could visit it anytime...just not ever return to the life you knew before? It seems worth adapting to for a single oceanographer, worth exploiting for a pair of good-ole-boy divers, worth exposing to the president of a large ocean drilling company, but only worth escaping for a former Marine who believes he has the best interests at heart for the mismatched crew he tries to make himself unofficial leader of.The tale is mostly build-up, the ending difficult to guess ahead of time, and the whole thing a light, easy read. It left me wishing Cook had spent more time developing relationships between the characters and describing more of the wonders of the futuristic world called Interterra, but was genuinely entertaining nonetheless. I hope to discover a more in-depth sci-fi story by this talented author sometime in the near future. This one wasn't a bad one to begin with."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Let's start from the beginning, first, if you read this book and you expect a medical thriller like: Coma, Outbreak, Fever, Chromosome 6 or Toxin among others, you will be disappointed and you won't like this book, if you see this book as a Sci Fi book as the books of Jules Verne is an incredible book.The story of Atlantis, the lost city, is good, and the end is just as Dr. Cook know how to end his books, there is no other end to this book, but also at the end Dr. Cook gives us a very good message: \\"No matter who are the good or the bad guys, the people who has the power, technology, etc, are the winners, in one way or another.\\" You just can't say I don't like you and just go, that is the very truth."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I was glad to see Dr. Cook going beyond the medical thriller, but &quot;Abduction&quot; was a disappointing Michael Critian(?) clone. The premise was good, but the writing was not up to Dr. Cook's usual talent."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have read many of Robin Cook's medical thrillers, and find most to be interesting, though a bit formulatic. I find it hard to believe this book is by the same author. I had to keep pushing myself to keep reading in the hope that the book had to get better. No luck, it just kept spiraling downward. The ending was enough to cause me to literally doze off.The characters were not developed, the writing style was elementary school level, and the plot did nothing to draw me in. It's as if Mr. Cook had a contract to fulfill, waited untill there were 18 hours left, and gave birth to this weak effort. Laid an egg is more like it."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"In reading some of the other reviews, I was surprised to see how many people either completely loved this book, or felt it was totally unenjoyable. I am one of the definite fans. Sure, the book is not based on reality, but that is what makes it so fun. The notion of a whole other world beneath the ocean is, at best, preposterous. BUT, you must read this book solely on the notion of fantasy. I found it very engrossing, and read it in two sittings. The book is both charming and suspenseful. If you like The Twilight Zone, you will appreciate the ending. It has a nice twist.If you are looking for a medical thriller, which is the normal genre for Cook, this may not be the book for you, but if you enjoy Cook's style and ability to keep you in suspense, then I recommend you read it. To sum it up, it's a science fiction fantasy thriller, that will keep you pleasantly entertained for hours."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I found the book definitely up to the quality of excitement that one always finds in Robin Cook's books. I am always intrigued by the titles and can't wait to find out their meanings in his books. Although the title/book was self-explained early, I felt it still met the suspense of his previous books. What is wrong with a medical doctor reaching beyond his profession. I found that comment a little surprising from one of the top reviewers."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"First of all, I LOVE Cook's books. I love the science and facts he usually uses. Even when he does take literary/artistic license, he backs up his imaginative scenarios with some facts. I was totally unprepared for the science fiction utopian storyline of Abduction- there isn't even a hint on the back cover to tell you what's coming. I figured \\"Oh, maybe the oceanographers bring some oddball bacteria back with them,\\" but noooo, the oceanographers are sucked into a bizarre utopia of lazy, beautiful humans. As another review said, there are no likable characters, so I found myself not caring about what happened. The twist at the end was a bit silly and felt very forced, as did many of the scenes. I'd recommend it to someone else as a for-fun, kicks-and-giggles read, but I would make sure they know Abduction is not a medical thriller."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Robin Cook's books are normally a good read and I enjoy them. Have read about everything that he has written.This book is as good as it gets. It is a good read for those who like novels with a medical background and mystery and suspense involved.Cook is able to capture our attention very quickly and does not let us go until we have finished.Enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'\\""},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I enjoyed this book. Great imagination. The characters were well developed, and I could feel their pleasure and their discomfort. I've read many of Cook's books, and this is one of his best. I was, however, disappointed with the ending. And then I realized, Dr. Cook has set the stage nicely for the sequel. I'll be one of of the first to buy it!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This was a fairly exciting book, although I'm sure many of the plot elements have been used a bunch already in sci-fi books from the past. I couldn't stand the two diver characters; I wish they would have been left out. Cook clearly uses this book to bash modern society, which is OK to some degree, but it seems the lead female character starts to sympathize with some of the nightmarish ideals the Interterrans hold. I didn't buy the evolution garbage, either. It's funny how most authors today assume that everybody accepts evolution without question, as if it were composed of established facts, like a historical account. In truth it's incredibly filled with holes and absurd on it's face. The odds of an automobile spontaneously evolving are greater than those of a human being, due to the incredible complexity of humans."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"What happened to DOCTOR Cook? Science fiction?? I was expecting another great medical thriller as usual. Although I found the book interesting, it's not the real Robin Cook."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I coulldnt set it down it was a nice change from Robin's usual books I can't belive it's got such bad reviews I WOULD DEFINATLY read this book! He discribes this other world so well that I really felt as if I was right there with the charecters. READ THIS BOOK ignore the other bad reviews"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Having read and loved many of Robin Cook's previous novels, I expected to be pleased with this long awaited book. The fact that it came out in paperback instead of hardback was a surprise at the time. Having read the book, I'm wondering why they wasted the paper? I was very disappointed in the storyline. It dragged on and on, and all I could think was that Robin was into his second childhood. Having reached the end of the book (I was given permission to stop reading it by more than one person), I feel like I've just completed a marathon. Robin needs to get back to what he knows best, and stay away from the &quot;abduction/ alien/X-files&quot; type novels. Hopefully, Shock will be better than this one, otherwise I'm giving up on his books. (Amazon requires a star rating. I'd rather not put even one star on this book.)"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have read most of Robin Cook's previous novels and was prepared to enjoy this one. The beginning grabed my interest but when he got his characters in to the center of the Earth it all goes to pieces. Lots of loose ends. If all they wanted a professional oceanographer why did they abduct the two divers? It they were as advanced as infered, they should have been able to solve the problem on their own. The two divers were totally over the top. Their actions were not consistent with their situation. If I were a Navy Diver I would be offended by these two characters. Then there is the end? The book doesn't end. I kept looking for another chapter or at least a few more pages. So many unanswered questions. Robin Cook has done better."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I was disappointed with this novel. It began like it was going to be a good story. The first 80 pages or so were very interesting, and although I felt the characters seemed somewhat one-dimensional, thought I had found a winner. But then the story turned into a combination of scenes from an old Outer Limits episode, &quot;The Probe,&quot; where survivors of an airplane crash in the ocean end up being decontaminated from viruses inside an alien spacecraft, then turned into a remake of a few low budget movies I remember from the 60's or 70's where the forerunners of Atlantis still exist in an undersea world, enslaving second class citizens and unfortunate top dwellers, and an idea from the Dune novels. Aside from the good start, there was nothing new about this story that hasn't been told before.The dialog was weak, as well as the plastic, one-dimensional characters. Sailors just don't speak or act the way the three former naval characters (two of them hard drinking ex-cons) spoke in the story. It seemed like the author was in a rush to get the manuscript to print, and the only editing it received was a quick run through a spell check. The story could have been told in half the number of pages, which would have left more room for story and character development. That's very unfortunate, as it had the potential of being a great story. I also felt the author spent too much time narrating.The writer could have made two good novels out of this. One, a scientifically factual story about a mini-sub trapped in an undersea volcano, and the struggle to find a way out. The second could have elaborated into a fantasy about the &quot;Interterreans&quot; world and how the second-generation humans muck it up. But neither the story nor the characters ever fully developed. After 350 pages the story started to develop, then it abruptly ended. The ending, as well as most of the book, was predictable.On the plus side, it was very readable and fast paced; not boring.This was my first Robin Cook novel. I was inspired to read it by his reputation of turning out good stories. I might try a few of his others, but I'll get them at used bookstores. I won't plop down any money for another new novel by him."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"A poorly excecuted foray into the science-fiction genre for an accomplished thriller author. The premise of a highly-advanced undderworld civilization is something that exists only on the lunatic fringe of UFO believers, and the adolescent writing style only serves to discredit the author. Dr. Cook's editor should find a new career after allowing this in print."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"My absolute awe at how poorly this book was written kept me with it through the bitter end. Having read all of Robin Cook's other books I expected some kind of plot to evolve as the book continued. Cook has always had an easy flow to his dialogue, but in this book it is stilted and thick with ridiculous stereotypes. While I don't discourage a foray into different genre', perhaps he could at least write with the same level of conviction he has in the past. I can't believe a good editor and/or publisher who supports the author would let this book go to press."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have read all Robin Cooks novels, and I was very dissappointed in his latest ABDUCTION. It was wise for it to come out in paperback. I am upset because I wasted the money on it, but glad I did not have to buy it in hardback (as I usually do). I love Dr. Cooks medical knowledge and the novels he derives from this knowledge. Being in the medical profession I can readily relate to his books. Not so with this one. Just very dissappointed."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is a book that might even have had trouble being published in the 40's, the heyday of space opera. The script would probably not have been accepted for a very bad episode of \\"Star Trek.\\" That is has been published at all, in any decade, is a mind-boggling tribute only to the venality of publishers who will count on a well-known name to sell any old drek. That any respectable writer would allow this donkey to go to print is inexplicable, save that he suspects he will never write another book so doesn't care. The 'human' characters are trite, shallow and stupid, the 'alien' characters are idiotic, the plot - such as it is - is mind-numbingly predictable, the suspense and tension are zero. I give it one star for grammar and spelling. It deserves far less."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I began reading Robin Cook books when I was in junior high, and have since been addicted to them. I was looking for something I hadn't read to take with me on vacation, and picked up Abduction. Because I'm a Robin Cook fan, I was hesitant to read something other than a medical murder mystery, but I was definitely taken in by Abduction.The opening of the book takes you out to the sea, where scientists are drilling through the earth's core. All of a sudden there is a halt in the drilling due to a bit breaking, and the scientists and divers are forced to go deep below the ocean to examine the problem.As the plot evolves, the divers and scientists are &quot;abducted&quot; by a mysterious force; they find themselves in a cave (below or above the earth? you'll find out!), only to come a huge metalic door. They open it, and are put through a series of purification processes that appear outer-wordly and completely advanced.They soon learn that they have been taken by a society living underneath the earth's core, a utopian world not unlike Eden where everything seems possible. Everything, however, seems too perfect. The sci-fi thriller ends with a surprising, though somewhat predictable, conclusion.Although I agree that the characters are pretty stereotypical (and even a bit prejudice if you ask me), this book has a good moral to it. If you're looking for a quick beach-side read, this is for you. If you're a huge Robin Cook fan, this is for you. If you're looking to read a good Robin Cook novel, don't start with Abduction (try Coma)."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"But I hate sience fiction! If you are looking for and expecting a typical Robin Cook medical mystery, you will be disapointed as I was."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"InterTerrans Just wanna have fun! (Cindy Lauper Song Playing...)Please Abduct ME!.Interesting Sci-Fi story about a super advanced, primarily peaceful civilization that lives underneath the surface of the earth were they migrated to billions of years ago to protect themselves from extinction....Suzanne, Perry, Donald, Richard and Michael are the main characters in this novel, together with fellow InterTerrans Arak and Sufa who serve as their guide to this mysterious yet inviting world they have been abducted into.The story move along at a very enjoyable pace, at time slow specially towards the second half were it tends to become repetitive. Perhaps the only weak side to the story and the book as a whole is the personality given to Richard and Michael, two deep-sea divers who seem to have the brains of 12 year olds yet have manage to somehow go through the navy and keep stressful and demanding jobs... these two characters behave in ways I have never seen or heard of anyone behave and it is such it becomes annoying and completely unbelievable as real characters. I can bite on the Sci-Fi bullet given the premise of the story but you have to pass the \\"real\\" human characters as real enough to be credible.The story has a very interesting side to it, and it is that it makes you appreciate the world and the society we live in even more, even when compared to a \\"perfect world\\" almost \\"heavenly\\" and rid of all decease, war and even death... it also brings to our attention a few environmental issues that when put against the light of this incredible but true comparison of worlds and societies, become ever more apparent and important.A good, healthy, clean and entertaining read with a great plot, no loose ends and fantastic ending.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I am a big Robyn Cook fan and didn't even know it. I read Robyn Cooks's \\"Primal Fear\\" years ago, and loved it. I picked up this book years later because the cover intrigued me and was surprised at how much I was drawn in. I didn't even know it was by Robyn Cook. Now this is the kind of fantasy I like and would love to see now-a-day's. This is a very creative novel with a new idea. Even though scientific theory may not be incredible accurate, he paints it perfectly plausible. Robyn is a very calculated writer and has never disappointed me with his work. I was so drawn into this story, the concept was wonderfully magical and the ending/climax had me stressing. i love when books can pull you in and make you sweat. This book had me totally palpitating.

Also onboard are the lovely Dr. Suzanne Newell; ex-navy commander and present submersible skipper Donald Fuller; and navy-cum-Neanderthal divers Richard Adams and Michael Donaghue. It is this cast of characters who, with the reluctant Perry, dive to the stilled drill site in order to make repairs. En route, they are sucked (or suckered) into a defunct undersea volcano and deposited into an otherworldly wonderland. That takes about 75 pages of fairly cogent spadework. The next 375 pages sprout some of the looniest, most derivative, made-for-TV-movie science fiction imaginable. Our heroes, you see, have been abducted to Interterra, an undersea world of staggering beauty and unheard of technologies--intergalactic travel and eternal life, for starters--populated by stunningly beautiful, toga-wearing, first-generation humans.First-generation? They were here first, see, and had been doing very nicely until their scientists realized that the earth was about to be \\"showered with planetesimal collisions, just as had happened in its primordial state,\\" and that they had better start digging. While the Interterrans prospered and thrived undersea, we, the second generation, began hauling our single-celled bodies up by our ooze-straps and started all over again.And that's about it. People with names like Arak and Sufa speak strangely, giggle at the primitive second-generationists, recoil at the very thought of violence, press their palms together to have sex, and direct \\"worker clones\\" to do the dishes while the second generation does its stereotypical best to, in turns, exemplify, define, and defile humankind."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"As a fan of Robin Cook's medical thrillers, I wasn't sure I would be able to get into his first sci-fi effort. I was hooked from the very beginning! All the gripping terror and chilling suspense he brings to his hospital horrors are present in this whirlwind encounter with a lost civilization.The characters are believable, the descriptions fascinating, and the premise Cook has concocted is absolutely extraordinary. I especially enjoyed the explanations of \\"birth\\" and \\"death\\" in the lost world, finding similarities to Walden Two and at least a few R.A. Heinlein novels.While entirely unlike anything else Robin Cook has written, The Abduction is definitely worth your time, and I happily recommend it. It's a bit disappointing that other reviews trash this book, but then again, it is a *total* departure from Cook's usual genre and writing style. I still thought it was quite good."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I LOVED this book! I have tired of the multitude of medical scenerios written by Robin Cook and delighted at a sci-fi storyline.

I expected another medical or science fiction thriller from the usually reliable Mr. Cook, and the initial chapters seemed to bear this out. But the deterioration into a silly and boring lost society/world is almost instantaneous. The other reviewers are right on the money, and I will not repeat their brief plot (if it can be dignified by that word) descriptions. If this is any reader's introduction to Robin Cook, don't be put off. Any of his other works are infinitely better. As for his old fans (and I am one), don't allow yourself to be deceived by the author's name and reputation into purchasing this turkey. What can he have been thinking?"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I thought that this book is the most disappointing of Cook's collection. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. The plot basically has a couple of people get captured by people who live in the Earth. They have the choice to go back to above ground or stay there. The values of these people are so messed up I couldn't stand it. I promptly returned the book to the library after reading only about two hundred pages. Cook could have done better!For people who have only read this book by Robin Cook,don't give up. His other books are much better."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I've read all of Robin Cook's books and this is the only bad one in the lot. I didn't like his choice of characters, whom I thought all were taken straight out of a list of OBVIOUS STEREOTYPES. I hope Mr. Cook realizes his error and comes home with a medical thriller which we all know is his forte.His foray into Sci-Fi was not a success, maybe if this is what Mr. Cook wants to write, he should get some help from accomplished Sci-Fi writers."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I find it really hard to believe that this book was even considered for printing. The premise is amateurish and the story so under developed that is borders on inept. The characters spend so much time being told by the Interterrans &quot;to be patient&quot; that I soon realize it is the author telling me &quot;to be patient...please do not put down my book, I have a point&quot;. And yet, Cook doesn't. He creates a Utopian world that we are supposed to embrace while despising our own...but in the end, I only despise myself for wasting several hours that I will never get back. He leaves so much unexplored that it is maddening...his heroes never ask the question that a sane person would ask nor do they do what a normal person would do given the same circumstances. Moreover, how is it possible that these Interterrans are so advanced and yet know so little about surface humans...I mean these beautiful Morlocks live forever and yet all they can do is giggle like coy school girls at our &quot;primative behaviour&quot;. He then rushes through the climax to a totally unsatisfying conclusion as if he too, realizes his story is going no where so might as well but us out of our misery. Oh, and tell me how likely it is that the human species would evolve TWICE to be the same, let alone live in the Moho Discontinuity. Cook is a doctor for Pete's sake, he should at least be fundamentally aware of the processes of natural selection. I tell you if this is what is to be considered publishable scifi...I am giving up my day job and going back through all the stories I wrote as a kid...I have one I would like to submit to Cook's publishers on these monsters which have six heads and seven arms and live under my bed and...well, you get the picture? Is that a scathing enough review? Save your money and sanity, read a better story called &quot;the Time Machine&quot; *grins*"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"\\"Abducted\\" is airport material. If you're just killing time waiting for your flight, this book isn't too bad, but it's not all that good, either.The science is mostly poor, with a lot of naive mistakes. Physics, geology, and evolutionary biology all take a bit of a beating. For instance, early on, the characters' mini-submarine dives uncontrollably because the water warms up to about 100 degrees, and (supposedly) warm water is much less dense than cold water. If you took physics 101, though, you may remember that heating water (and most other materials) reduces its density by only a tiny amount. If you expect your science fiction to get the science right, you will find this sort of thing jarring.That would matter less if the characters and story were well-crafted, but they aren't. The characters are cliches: macho jerk #1, macho jerk #2, uptight military man, wimpy corporate guy, brainy but hot scientist babe. That's pretty much all you need to know (and about all you ever find out) about any of them. Meanwhile, the storyline is straight from cheesy 50s SciFi flicks: a few ordinary humans encounter an ancient and extremely advanced civilization of people who look human and are all incredibly hot, who don't work, have a slave race, live in a \\"perfect\\" society, have no wars, don't use money, are fascinated by primitive humans but are perplexed by our emotions, etc.Still, stock 50s SciFi movies were popular for a reason: they're goofy mindless fun. This probably won't hold your attention for long, and it's unlikely to make your top ten (or top hundred) list of favorite books, but if time is heavy on your hands and you really need to pass a few hours, you could do worse. Then again, you could also do a whole lot better."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have picked up and read quite a few very bad books over the years. This one by Cook definitly cracks the top 40 worst books that I have worked my way through. The plot here surrounds the idea that their is this underworld civilization unknown to us. The story is kind of like Jules Verne redux. Only where it is interesting to read Verne and see how someone saw the future a hundred and twenty years ago, this is just bad thinking when it comes from someone today.I could go on. But why bother? this book sucks so bad that its not worth the effort of thinking about it for another second."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Let me summarize the story for you so you don't waste time on this book. Five divers/scientists go deep into the Atlantic Ocean, and become abducted by another species of humans who live in a large air-filled cavity under the seas. The \\"aliens\\" are a happy people who abhor violence, and who transfer their souls from body to body to live forever. The \\"aliens\\" also have advanced technology which is difficult to explain (for example, why do they use lights to set up artificial days and nights?). Our ordinary human heroes want to escape. The ending is particularly ridiculous, and comes across as Dr Cook ran out of time to think of how to wrap up this crazy story."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Readers who have enjoyed Robin Cook's medical thrillers will be disappointed by this book. The setting updates a tired science fiction idea -- an inhabited world miles under the surface of the Earth -- without adding much of interest. The characters are not very sympathetic, and the ending is essentially a joke. One hopes that Cook will go back to biomedical themes, and that publishers will not print everything a famous writer puts out."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This novel is a pleasant change from the medical psychological thrillers that we are all used to from Mr. Cook. It involves a group of people being \\"abducted\\" by a race of ancient beings that pre-date all known living creatures on Earth. As the plot unfolds we the humans are in a virtual paradise where everyone lives for pleasure and death and violence are virtually unknown.The humans must decide if living forever in Paradise is more important than their personal freedom and being with their families in a world of death and violence.This is the second science fiction type novel I have read by Mr. Cooke and I must say he does the genre well. This book does a good job of explaining many of the mysteries about our planet that have plagued scientists and historians for more that a century."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Abduction, by Robin Cook, was very fun, in my opinion. I have not read any of his other books (yet)but reading these other reviews, if people think this was a poor example, I can't wait! Going on an undersea adventure and meeting another &quot;humankind&quot; was very exciting. He shows us that it may not be &quot;perfect&quot; to live in a &quot;perfect&quot; world. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Having read all of Robin Cook's books, I expected another wonderful read filled with suspense and explicit character development. This book failed those tests. The storyline was original, but halfway through the book, I found myself wondering why Cook failed to expond more on the questionable behaivor of his characters. The story could have gone a long way, but I found myself anxious to finish and get it over with. I recently read both suspense books by James Rollins and found those to be fantastic"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"When a crew of oceanographers receive a mysterious transmission, they are led to a discovery beyond all imagination...a world far beneath the ocean's surface.Amazed with their finding, the crew is quick to make friends with the undersea people, and adapt to the customs of this civilization (including making love; which consists of hand cream and hand touching, and never having to work since each person has a work clone).The crew believes what they learn will change what we know on earth...but at what price?What is this, you ask? The latest thriller from bestselling MEDICAL THRILLER author, Robin Cook.&quot;Abduction&quot; is a straight to paperback original novel, and easily one of the silliest book's of the year.I am still shocked that this book is written by Robin Cook! I have been a fan of Mr. Cook's previous novels, and this book is a serious disappointment. It seems MANY authors are trying to broaden the scope of their writing, unfortunately, they are NOT succeeding. PLEASE go back to writing medical thrillers.The book earned one star because the first couple of chapters were interesting, other than that it is totally un-readable. Avoid this book, and wait for his next hardcover!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is the first Robin Cook book I've ever read (listened to, really). I know he's better known for his medical stories and based on this &quot;science fiction&quot; story, he should get back to his forte. This book is poor on every count. All the characters are idiots. If they weren't, the story couldn't have been written at all. Somehow the 5 main characters have made it through their lives with reading a single science fiction book, watching a single science fiction movie or TV show, or even knowing anyone who has. Otherwise they would have seen every trite plot point coming 50 pages away. There isn't a single original thought in the entire book. Really, I mean it. And then, in the middle of this amazingly juvenile book, he drops random polysyllabic words as though to say, &quot;see, I haven't lost my perspicacity!&quot;Based on his reputation, I'm sure some of his books are great. Too bad this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are annoying and so very stupid. This seems as if it was written for 4th graders.Do not, under any circumstance, buy, read or listen to this garbage. What a waste of time!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I am an avid reader of Robin Cook's novels. They are the type that you do not want to &quot;let go&quot;. Abduction, however, is a departure from his medical thrillers and a very poor one at that. If you have never read a book by Robin Cook, do not start with this one! Any of his other books is much better. If you have read some of his books, be prepared for a disappointment."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Having never read a Robin Cook novel before, I got sucked in by all the blurbs touting him as a \\"master of medical fictions\\". Wow, talk about false advertising! This is 3rd rate science fiction, as written by the Boy in the Bubble. The characters, and I use the term loosely, act and speak like no human beings I've ever met. To use the description \\"cartoonish\\" would be an insult to cartoon dialogue writers everywhere. If this were a movie, it would be perfect MST3K grist. But, sadly, it's just a bad book that killed two evenings (and a few brain cells) for me. Thank God I borrowed this from someone, and didn't actually pay for it..."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I've read science fiction before so I know about needing to suspend disbelief while reading a story, but this one is absurd. The crew of a submersible and the 2 divers enter the secret world of Interra which exists between the upper &amp; lower oceans of the earth. The Interreans seem advanced, but display some disturbing traits. There is a separate race of creatures which are half human-half machine who do all their work, while the Interreans mostly play. The crew &amp; divers want to return to the surface, but the Interreans don't want people on the surface learning about Interra.This story is clearly a rewriting of The Hollow Earth by Raymond Bernard from 1976, which was also unbelievable."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"As a long time science fiction fan, I found the book poorly written and dreadfully predictable. Cook uses a condescending, didactic style that is clearly oblivious to several generations of development of the genre. (It openly acknowledges the influence of Jules Verne, and is reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Lin Carter in places...which would be fine if it were 1936.) Further, I was completely appalled with the occasional gaffes in basic physics. (&quot;Supersonic&quot; trains in a vacuum tunnel?!? OK, that's probably not how he meant it, but it's what he WROTE.)Run, don't walk away from this one. Back to the medical thrillers, doc."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"As a sci-fi short story, this might have worked -- it even has a twilight-zonish ending. But as a full-length novel, it was a big disappointment. I have read every other book by Robin Cook and this was the first one I did not like. Hopefully it will be the last such bomb.There isn't any real horror in this novel -- unless you consider boredom to be a form of torture. The plot is a hackneyed new-age mish-mash of Brave New World, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and the Time Machine (only this time, the good guys went underground, er, undersea.) The characters are shallow and the \\"science\\" is utterly ridiculous -- how many times can you say, in essence, \\"This is so far advanced it's way beyond me...\\"?Then there's the lack of good descriptive prose. In Cook's previous books, we can get inside the characters' heads and really FEEL what they are going through. In this book, the plot is carried forward through preachy dialogue and \\"orientations\\" that drove me up the wall. Every good science fiction writer knows that the Absolute WORST way to explain things in an alternate world is to have some scientist or tour guide give a lecture.PLEASE, please, Dr. Cook -- go back to writing medical horror!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I wouldn't ordinarily bother writing a review that echoes what all the other readers have said about this ghastly effort, but I used to be a big Robin Cook fan. He's never been a great writer and my husband and I used to laugh at the pouty-lipped, short-statured, big breasted heroine of every novel, always the youngest to graduate from her medical school, with all honors. Also, it's irritating that every reference he makes to a black person is always \\"African-American\\" no matter how often the reference has to be stated, and those people are always painfully articulate and noble (and cardboard).Anyway, this crummy book -- I got saddled with the audio version read by Dick Hill (probably an alias) when I joined Jiggerbug.com and couldn't find anything else remotely interesting - is SO BAD it's almost great. I mean, Ed Wood's \\"Plan Nine From Outer Space\\" bad. Since the publication date is 2000, I have to guess that Cook wrote this when he was 13 years old and dragged it out to meet a deadline. Jeez! He couldn't have at least punched it up a little? The sci-fi is *so*tired* and hackneyed, I kept waiting for one of the females beauty queens of the underworld to pant \\"What is....kiss?\\" (a la \\"Forbidden Planet\\", kids) to one of the moronic diver strongmen. The hot babe in the lead is taller than most of Cook's earlier books, but the leading man is such a shlub that no one could believe he's an engineer who built a scientific empire. At least, *I* can't."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I listened to this book as unabridged audio, and I'm a little embarrassed to say, it grabbed me. Even as the critical part of my brain was noticing that it was pretty badly crafted, I couldn't put it down. And now that I'm done, I keep thinking about it, wanting to have discussions about the world the book creates. BUT, I would not recommend it to any of my friends. Scenes seemed to exist because they would make blockbuster movie footage, not because they were what the story needed. I suspect the author of trying to create a book that Steven Spielberg would option, without any other considerations (like a story that makes sense). The \\"utopian\\" world that is supposed to be like paradise is unconvincing -- I'm not talking about could it really happen, but who would *really* be happy living there? It's dull as dust. And there is no character to side with, no one who is really sympathetic. Of the 5 primary viewpoint characters, 3 1/2 are totally unlikable and 1 1/2 are semi-sympathetic, mostly because they are too bland and underdeveloped to dislike, not because they give you anything much to care about."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"After forcing myself to finish this torturously ridiculous book(being the last of my beach reading supplies), I wanted to call up Dr Cook and demand a refund of the hours of my life. Which I'd seriously consider donating to Jerry Springer, with my sincerest apologies...."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Let me try to bullet point the other reviews.* This is science fiction -- not Cook's typical Medical thrillers* It would actually make a much better short story. (Atlantis Lives) It could be told very well in about 75 pages or a hour long TV show* The characters are fairly flat and one dimensional.* The plot, while not bad, is reminiscent of a 1950s twightlight zone, or 60s Star Trek episode. Its very straightforward and you can see where its going.* The ending twist was one I didn't find that amusing -- again, a decent short story conclusion, but not enough for a full novel.Saying that, the book isn't *that* bad. I think some reviewers might have been expecting something more in the lines of Cook's other works. I would give it a little more than 2 stars, but given the lenght it's closer to 2 than 3."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Occasionally young authors find that even though their first few novels are rejected by publishers, after they become famous the publishers are willing to publish almost anything. However, sometimes the early efforts are not publishable regardless of the author's name. This book was published after Robin Cook was quite famous, but went straight to paperback.This is definitely not a \\"Robin Cook\\" medical thriller, but rather a poorly written science fiction story with an utopian society with open marriages reminiscent of sci fi from the 1950s and explanations of the Alantis Myth, the Gulf Stream, and myriad others topics \\"unknown to scientists.\\"If you love Robin Cook, and I do, pick a different book."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"If it weren't for the one-dimensional characters and wooden dialogue, I wouldn't believe that this was a Robin Cook novel. It comes as a bigger surprise, because the description on the back cover doesn't even hint at the true direction this book is going to take.Having said that, I did enjoy the book, just because I happen to like the whole \\"alternate civilization\\" concept, although it has been done better.One thing that I couldn't understand, is that for a radically advanced civilization, they never thought of the concept of burning a backup copy of critical data. I'd have my essence stored on DVD in a safe deposit box, just in case I got in an air taxi crash after too much crystal.Overall I liked it, but if you're expecting a medical thriller, move to the next book on the shelf."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"for the past 15 (at least years) i have listened to any number of audio cds and tapes (from Nancy Drew quality to higher) while i have been engaged in renovating an old house--- this is the first CD that i have put back in it's packaging to send off to the goodwill, unlistening to in it's entirity----- it is poorly written, as if it has been composed by a half-drunk in the 1950s who is stuck in some sexist/unimmaginative time-warp-=----"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Perry Bergman, founder, president and largest shareholder of Benthic Marine is on its way on board the Benthic Explorer near the volcanically and seismically active Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Using the submarine Oceanus, the crew is working on their current project: drilling into a magma chamber within a seamount west of the Azores.One day, in the Oceanus, the crew come across a strange and deep hole that looks like an opening into an extinct volcano when suddenly the submarine looses its buoyancy and is inexorably sucked into the abyss. And so the members of the crew are about to enter the futuristic world of Inteterra.Jules Verne wrote an infinitely more refined book, \\"Voyage to the Center of the Earth\\", in 1864! Maybe Dr Cook should concentrate on what is his speciality: medicine."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Perhaps I'm not the ideal person to be reviewing this book as I've never read sci-fi stuff but, as I picked this up, thinking it was another of Dr.Cook's medical murder mysteries and found myself in another world..one underwater and the precursor to Atlantis, peopled by incredibly beautiful, ageless people, I couldn't help but be taken back to Saturday afternoon matinees at the Progress theatre.It read almost exactly like a Buck Rogers adventure and all it needed was an appearance by Ming the Merciless!! A beautiful marine biologist(and when aren't they beautiful?)is with an undersea exploration party when they are drawn into a deep fissure in an undersea mountain and their mini submarine is taken to a different world by means of water tight caverns. Ye gods..enough said !!!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"If you like Robin Cook, don't read Abduction. Personally, I wish I could get the money back I spent on the book. It's Saturday-morning cartoon-ish. Mr. Cook's other books are believable. This one is childish. Mr. Cook -- please bring back more books like Chromosome 6. That one had everything -- plot, a touch of believability, good characters, and suspense. It was pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This book is a work of science fiction, about people who find a world under the sea inhabited by an advanced species of humans.This is certainly not the best work by this author. I have read many of his works and they are mostly related to the medical-investigative field and much more realistic. This book deals too much in the fiction world and it is hard to accept the story. However, I did find the ending to be orginal and totally unprepared!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I usually pick up subsequent books by familiar authors, because I'm in the mood for a particular type of story. When I started this book, I thought this must be some other \\"Robin Cook.\\" That's why I came to amazon.com to read a review. After 100 pages, I think I'll abandon it (which I rarely do to a book) & give it away. I have plenty more \\"real\\" Robin Cook books on my shelf to read. If I want GOOD sci-fi I have those, too."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This was the first and probably last Robin Cook novel for me. I was disappointed after hearing so many positive comments on his medical thrillers. The &quot;fantasy world under the sea&quot; science fiction in this book lacked several components, including plausibility and interesting dialogue. Many comic book heros have more dimensions than the stock, predictable characters in this novel. A plot twist in the last pages is the only original idea in the otherwise stale material."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Ok...I'm still shocked that Robin Cook wrote this. Are they SURE that this wasn't written by some wannabe Micheal Crichton? The only elements of a traditional Robin Cook novel (Sphinx and The Year of the Intern nonwithstanding) are the brief references to microbes (although I think that Robin Cook made the mistaken assumption that decontaminating someone externally decontaminates them completely). The rest of the book reads like a poorly written Micheal Crichton novel(including an ending almost identical to Timeline), and nothing like I expected. So why did I give it 2 stars instead of 1? If nothing else, its a good read if you have nothing else handy. As far as Robin Cook novels go, this one goes squarely at the bottom (w/Vector at the top) and I do not recommend it, but you could do worse."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Having read almost all of Robin Cook's books to date, I sat down Saturday afternoon ready to be involved in a medical thriller. What I found instead was a novel with poorly developed characters and a totally predictable story line. I even went back and checked the title page to be sure this wasn't a reprint of a very early book by this author. Unfortunately that is not the case. The main actors in the story are superficial and one dimensional. Unlike older Robin Cook novels, none of these characters seems to have existed before the story began and the reader is really not sorry to see them go. The premise of a civilization existing under the earth could surely be presented in a more believeable way given today's technology. This book is a disappointment from start to finish."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Well, I really wish I could say something pleasant about this novel but I'm as lost for words as Cook apparently was when he wrote the book. I can't recall the last time I've read an entire novel where I did not encounter a single new word -- new to my vocabulary, that is. Not that I buy novels to increase my vocabulary, but as I read this novel, that &quot;peculiarity&quot; stuck in my mind. The character development was atrocious, and the plot was so old and tired that even Cook seemed to give up toward the end and just shut his effort down with one of the most truncated endings I recall ever reading. I read the whole thing but would encourage other readers to avoid my mistake. Ouch!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read quite a few books this summer, and I believe I enjoyed this the most. Some of the concepts seemed to come out of nowhere. It is interesting to read a division in some of the reviews I have read about &quot;Abduction&quot; - you either love it or hate it.There are some concepts similar to Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot;, regarding the transfer of a person's &quot;essence&quot; when he/she dies, which I found interesting. And the history of these people below the earth goes way, way, way back - what a concept! Not your usual sci-fi, I thought it was totaly fresh and original."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I'd stopped reading Robin Cook's books because, frankly, one was the same as the next. My sister convinced me to give this a try and I found it very refreshing. I'm sure it dissappoints many loyal fans, but it will probably attract a whole new audience. I found the characters believable and the story alternately gripping and entertaining. I feel the need to address many of the negative comments I saw in readers' reviews regarding the plausibility of the story: This is FICTION. If you want real-life, try a documentary on PBS. Geez."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"THIS BOOK IS REALLY TERRIBLE. ROBIN COOK USED TO WRITE A GREAT MEDICAL THRILLER...WHAT HAPPENED? AUTHORS SHOULD NOT GET NEW BOOKS PUBLISHED BASED ON THEIR PAST BOOKS. THIS IS ONE FOR THE DUMPSTER!! THIS BOOK WAS BORING, START TO FINISH. I CAN'T BELIEVE I STUCK IT OUT."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I did expect to be reading a medical thriller from Robin Cook but I was wonderfully surprised at how great I thought this book was. It was enthralling, well written, and exciting. I often couldn't put it down. What an amazing piece of fiction and wouldn't it be cool if it were true??"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"...but that doesn't mean he always has to put them in the starring role. Over the past 10 years or so, Cook has been writing about doctors on crusades against all sorts of evils, drug companies who brainwash doctors into using their stuff, corrupt hospital administrations who turn organ donations into a racket, HMOs--you name it. It's made his writing sound more manifesto than story at times. Now comes a breath of fresh air--a bona-fide S-F adventure that may be a bit derivative of &quot;Sphere&quot; or an undersea &quot;Planet Of the Apes&quot;, but is not too bad for all that. You gotta give the guy credit for taking the broken record off the turntable. A group of marine scientists right out of early Cussler by way of Verne discovers a human civilization below the ocean floor that is more evolved than the one we live in. Now they're stuck: &quot;We wanna go home&quot;--&quot;But you can't. We can't afford to let our secret get out.&quot; In my opinion, though, the only really big flaw in this book is the way Cook depicts the two divers who are former Navy enlisted men--vulgar, immature, mean-spirited. Both men are cut from the same mold. It smacks of the standard bourgeois prejudice against &quot;the Great Unwashed&quot;. As a blue collar type who gets dirt under my fingernails myself, I have to wonder if Cook is really that much of an elitist. I've been entertained by his work for a whole heap o' years--now I'm thinking that I'm lucky not to know him personally."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Maybe it's not great literature, but it was fast paced, a real page turner. An interesting romp in and other world in our world."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The subject is something totally different. I have read all of Robin Cook's books, but off late all of them have become quite boring and predictable. This book is much better - mind you I am comparing with his Vector and other recent novels. This book is definitely not predictable. Though the first 75-80 pages of this book were like sleeping pills, the later part improved. I feel the ending could have been changed. It just left too many things unanswered. It is as though you are suddenly in the middle of another story. When will we get back books like Harmful Intent, Mutation, etc. Even his next book \`Shock' (to be released next year)does not sound promising in the editorial reviews."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Like all of the other reviews I had a hard time beliving it was Robin Cook. I have read all of his and I kept waiting for something Cook-ish to come. It never came. Not one doctor (at least not any medical doctors) not one nurse not one hospital. It was his worst yet."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"First off, let me say, the abduction in the title is not by aliens from outer space. In fact, just the opposite, but that's all I'll say so as not to spoil the imaginative and suspenseful plot of this sci-fi thriller. Robin Cook is one of the few writers whose books I will read automatically, without even glancing at the cover synopsis, he's that good. He's never failed to entertain, and this latest book is no exception. Once again, he varies from his usual medical thriller format (see Invasion) and pulls it off nicely. The story moves right along, always prompting you to read further to see what happens next or to explore the fascinating details of the advanced alternate culture within. The characters are varied and interesting, and his writing style is, as usual, excellent. I'm not sure what those who gave it a low rating were looking for, but if you're looking for an enjoyable, fascinating book to read, especially if you're a sci-fi fan, don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This was my first Cook book and I was thoroughly impressed by his unique and imaginative storyline. This book had surprises at every corner and has made me an instant fan. It was more a sci-fi story than medical thriller which made it even better than I expected. I'm almost finished with the book and sad that it's almost over. Now I'm looking for another Cook book that measures up to this one."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"After reading almost all Robin Cook's work, I stumbled across this book. Totally through me for a loop because this is far from his 'medical' writings. I was totally entranced with this book that I had to go and buy it to add to my Cook Collection. This is a strange tale with a very good story for those with the ability to use their imagination. Very visual!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"i read this book a few years ago and at the time i thought it was very good! i am suprized to have seen it get a poor rating. i thought it was pretty neat the whole submerine dropping down to the bottom of an abyss and there being intelligent life there. i thought the author did a good job drawing you in to the details of the intellects of these higher life forms."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I enjoyed this book, No it is not typical Robin Cook but that is why it is interesting. He was trying to push the envelope to make his readers see other writing genre's. The characters act that way for the plot to continue in the direction he wanted it to follow. A good book that I recommend if you want to try something different."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The abduction of the submarine Benthic Explorer by human beings living undersea, drive the explorers to a sophisticated civilization called Interterra where the abducted are surprised to find out their way of life, their incredible history, philosophy, etc. For those people seeking for another of Mr. Cook medical thrillers let me tell you that this is more a science fiction novel that you can enjoy it."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I thought that this book is the most disappointing of Cook's collection. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. The plot basically has a couple of people get captured by people who live in the Earth. They have the choice to go back to above ground or stay there. The values of these people are so messed up I couldn't stand it. I promptly returned the book to the library after reading only about two hundred pages. Cook could have done better!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I thought it was a well written thought out book. If you are not expecting a medical thriller you should enjoy it. The story has been done before, True. However Mr. Cook gave it a nice update.He made it seem Possible..."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I thought this book was wonderful, it made me stop and think. Sure it wasn't as thrilling as his other books, but I loved the idea of a whole different race of humans living below us in secret. The idea that maybe Atlantis could be real, inspired some deep thoughts."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I liked Abduction. I've read all the Robin Cook novels, and while this one is certainly a departure into sci-fi for him, Cook's usual character development was as strong as ever, making you care about each character. I think he did a fine job of creating an alternate world and he had some fun with it. Anyone familiar with his other books should give this one a try."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have read every single book Robin Cook has written, so I was eagerly anticipating this new novel. Unfortunately, as soon as I read the first chapter I realized that this book was not like the others. It involved no medical knowledge whatsoever and was entirely science-fiction. I have to say that I am very dissapointed with this book, but his new book, Shock, coming out in March 2001 looks a lot more promising."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I am genuinely surprised by all the negative reviews this book has gotten! It had been quite a while since I had read anything by R. Cook before I picked this one up. To be honest, I had gotten a little tired of the rather repetitive story lines in Cook's work, and when that happens, I give an author a rest. In this case, it was a looong rest. The text on the back of the book, which seemed to promise something a little different this time, is what actually made me purchase it.I found the book to be loads of fun to read! It was light and entertaining and sparked my imagination like nothing has in a long while.I had to stop a little short of giving it a full five stars in my review because of the stereotypical characterization of the two divers. I found them to be particularly crude and .. for lack of a better word.. disgusting. Apart from that, I found this book to be one of the most entertaining I had read in a long while. I think it is great when an author tries something different and I for one think this attempt, while not perfect, was a refreshing and entertaining change of pace.If you want to read the same types of stories all the time from your favorite authors, just drag out the old novels you have and read them again. If you are willing to read something a little different, then you will enjoy this one!Keep an open mind!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"As an avid Robin Cook fan, I was sorely disappointed in this book. I loved his others, so, naturally, when I saw that he'd written a new one, I was thrilled. It started out well, but then it just went downhill. I was surprised he went so far into the fiction ring. I mean, the others were at least plausible, but this one was just too out there. I think Mr. Cook should stick to what he knows and that is medicine."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The book started off on the right foot. However, after about 80 pages, the book changes tone completely. I expected much more from Cook, but got the book Abduction. The Sci-Fi-ness of the book definitely belongs on one of those TV channels, but this is definitely not something you'd expect from Robin Cook. Don't let this ruin your impression of him."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Good Lord this was a stinker. Poorly conceived, clumsily executed, this book is stocked with the most generic group of explorers and aliens ever assembled. There's the Earnest Blonde, the Deep-Voiced Samuel Jackson Rip-Off, the Thuggish Navy Seals... And as for the Atlanteans, not since 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians' has there been such an inept portrayal of an alien race. And on top of that, the dialogue is stilted, and the narration reads like it's been translated from a foreign language. But the saddest thing of all is that for all the fantastic setting and exotic background, the 'wonders' that await us in this undersea world are stunningly banal. It's all been done before with so much more ingenuity and class, that one is tempted to suspect that this Brand New Robin Cook Novel is actually a Very Very Old Robin Cook Novel; something he penned when 'The Man From Atlantis' was all the rage, and dusted off after watching Michael Crichton's 'Sphere.'"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"What a stinker. Having read many of Robin Cook's previous medical mystery novels, I felt suckered after I bought and read this one. It is a sci-fi attempt by an author way out of his genre. This stuff has all been done before by real sci-fi writers, and Dr. Cook's attempt comes out at the level a 6th grader might enjoy. When I buy Tom Clancy, I don't expect poetry. When I buy Robin Cook, I don't expect a preachy Greenpeace advertisement. Dr. Cook, return to the operating room, STAT!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"this book begins slowly, but i gave it a chance, since mr cook has written some very good books in the past. it did start to pick up after a bit, but then bogged down again. i gave up after about 250 pages."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I thought the book was written well. Robin Cook bridges some of our history with this undersea world. He incorporated some mysteries of science in this book as it relates to the undersea world that I found interesting. He also deals with some human characteristics that show some insight to the way a human may react to be found on so-called paradise. The ending was a bit of a shocker. I enjoyed it and I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Le me begin by saying that if you're new to Robin Cook, do not start with this novel. It is nothing like any of his other novels since it is not a medical thriller.This book begins fairly slow and send the reader in the wrong direction. I don't want to say more because I'll be giving it away.You will NEVER guess how it ends!!!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This was the disappointment of my lifetime! Ok, that's a little harsh, but this was, without a doubt, the worst novel written by the master of medical thrillers. It's not a medical thriller, by the way. Issac Asimov comes to mind. I couldn't even develop a liking to any of the characters of this book. I am convinced that someone made a mistake when crediting the author of this novel. My 15-year old daughter could have done a better job. Mr. Cook, forget this silliness. I am afraid I will never purchase another one of your novels. Many say the ending was shallow, but I say the entire movel was. Please return to your proper genre. I wasted too much time and money. I almost threw it away, but was sure there'd be a twist that would get this novel on the right track. It never happened"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"If you like Robin Cook, don't read Abduction. Personally, I wish I could get the money back I spent on the book. It's Saturday-morning cartoon-ish. Mr. Cook's other books are believable. This one is childish. Mr. Cook -- please bring back more books like Chromosome 6. That one had everything -- plot, a touch of believability, good characters, and suspense. It was pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"While most of the negative reviews of this book focus on the fact that it is not the &quot;normal&quot; Robin Cook, I think it was great to see a change in focus from the medical thriller to sci-fi. I agree with the review that stated Robin Cook's novels were starting to all sound alike. The problem I had with Abduction was with the overall writing and character development, or should I say lack thereof. If the Interrans were so &quot;advanced&quot; why did they giggle so much? Why were Richard and Michael so immature? Why was it so easy for the Americans to escape? For those that are looking to find the typical Robin Cook novel, don't buy this one. For those that are looking for a well developed sci-fi novel, don't buy this one."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have not read anything so juvenile for many years. Some of the childrens literature that I read while working for the School Library was far superior to this drivel. It reminded me of an attempt at Science Fiction by a 7th grader. As he points out, himself, in the book, it has already been done and much better by Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I, too, have read all of Robin Cook's books and always look forward to each new book with great anticipation. I was so very disappointed in this book. Reviewers like Chuck Hickey might put me in the &quot;It's not Mr. Cooks typical medical thriller so I don't like it&quot; box, but that is not true. One of his early works, &quot;Sphinx&quot; was not a medical thriller, and I loved that book. The problem with this book was that it was very boring, not suspenseful, and definintely NOT a thriller like his previous books. The only reason I kept reading was I was sure it would get better, but it never did. The ending was a horrible dispappointment! I wasted my money and time on this book!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Should be called &quot;How To Use the Terms Vis-a-Vis and Apropos as Much as Possible&quot;. This is the worst book I've ever read. There are inconsistencies on every page. Character dialog is horrid and unrealistic. Gets one star because of a mildly funny scene involving a game of fetch. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"After being given a stack of used books to read, the first one I pulled out of the box was Abduction. I'd never read a robin cook before, though being familiar with him, was expecting a medical mystery. Not this book.This one has nothing to do with medical genre, but is more related to the function of the earth's various crusts, mantles and plates, and the spaces between them...and the created world of interterra where some very bizarre \\"people\\" live.The story is about an undersea drilling team which gets swept into the land of interterra, which exists in pockets between various gaps in the crust of the earth. The society is a very sanitary, starchy, almost hospital like place to live, with incredible technology. Maybe this is where the medical part comes in because of the massively sterile type of environment.There is so much homophobia and blatant macho man attitude displayed by two of the main characters that it almost becomes distracting to the plot of the book. Speaking of plot, I'm not really sure what the point of the book was other than to introduce a possible civilization living beneath us, and how they have supposedly evolved technologically but repressed anything competitive or physically harmful from their lifestyle.Procreation is genetic engineering in a laboratory...nothing really new there compared to other sci-fi novels, other than in this case, memories and personalities of those who choose to die, move on to the next body they inhabit. Interesting commentary I suppose on being able to decide when your physical body dies, because you know you're going to just move on to another body.The ending left me sadly disappointed as a reader. There was little to no resolution of major plot lines in the book, it was almost as if we had so much to resolve or explain, let's just end it before anyone notices.One of the major open holes was the role of the \\"servant\\" race in the book, and the world they lived in. There were so many references to the under-under society, but then nothing about them.I have a stack of more Robin Cook, and I'm hoping that if I get back to the medical genre, I'll find them more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Sure, a society under the earth's crust is an old theme, but this book is exciting and well written, a real page-turner. I couldn't put it down.Yet, it is more than just an action thriller. It also provides food for thought. Dr. Cook makes us take a closer look at our morals and motivations.Dr. Cook is a master storyteller.One reviewer didn't like the ending. I thought it was terrific. As I neared the end of the book, I was wondering how the many problems would be resolved.Why do we sometimes try to limit authors to our favorite subjects? (Medical thrillers, in this case.)Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This book is an example of a failed experiment that probably would not have sold except for its having been written by an already commercially successful writer. Once a writer is a success, the publishers stop requiring good editing, which is what this book needs.The story interested me enough that I finished the book, but only to find out if anything interesting would happen to the characters, and if they would ever grow from their experiences. Plenty of things happened to the characters; few of those things were interesting, mainly because the characters are one dimensional paper dolls dressed up like fictional cliches.The characters include a couple of low-life, crude, violent bubbas, a pretty female scientist, a hard-edged military man, and a corporate president. No matter what happens to them, they stay in their designated roles with little emotional response and no character growth despite their traumatic experiences. The corporate president is a oddly out of place, with the literary voice of an insecure adolescent. He judges people by whether their teeth are as white as his own, for gosh sakes! I found him completely devoid of credibility, not in the sense of a shrewd but distrustful executive, but in the sense that I was unable to buy the premise that a man of his limited intellect, beset with so many inner misgivings, could have succeeded as head of the school lunch committee, not to mention a global drilling operation.When this group is sucked under the bed of the ocean into what appears to be a peace and love Utopia, they run around wreaking their normal havoc and staying true to their flat character traits until the ending, during which I thought, for a moment, that I would be reading a remake of the appearance of the buried Statue of Liberty at the end of Planet of the Apes.Suspending practicality and belief long enough to enjoy a fantasy is a fine and honorable pleasure, but only if the characters have enough passion to connect the writer to the experience. Sorry, that never happens here. When I reached the end, I felt I had wasted my time reading this book. I find it sad that the commercial aspect of publishing requires good writers to pump out lame work in the interest of sales.If you want to read a good book about people venturing into the center of the earth, read H. G. Wells' The Time Machine, which is actually given a nod within Cook's Abduction."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This book is terrible. A plot line driven mainly by homophobia, underground humans cleverly named \\"interrans,\\" unflinching use of exclamation points, and absolutely no character development at all makes for one of the worst reads EVER. The only reason I finished was that I kept thinking: \\"This has to get interesting at some point, right?.\\" Alas, no."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Like most of the reviewers, I bought this one largely because of Robin Cook's name (I really enjoyed \\"Chromosome 6\\", for example). Apparently, this is the first time this book has been in print; after reading it, I can see why.The book starts off with a great premise, and has some good action scenes. But almost immediately it begins falling apart at the seams: the Interterra culture is wildly implausible; many of the events seem contrived and dictated by the plot (e.g., a rather abrupt change in motives in one of the 'lost' characters); there is no character development whatsoever; and, to quote another reviewer, there is rampant--and seemingly unnecessary--homophobia. Worst of all, the final \\"surprise\\" event of the novel--to say that this novel has an actual ending is giving it far too much credit--is telegraphed long before it comes (&agrave; la Michael Crichton's ~Timeline~).If you want to read it, save your money and borrow it. Better still, save your time too, and don't bother. [Find one of Cook's more recent, and significantly better, efforts.]"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"You probably already know the Atlantis style plot line. Many reviewers have said &quot;Is this really Cook?&quot; and virtually all reviewers slammed the book. Why? Because it's awful, that's why.This book is a perfect example that proves the Clancy's, the Cook's, the King's and the Grisham's can put pen to paper and sell *anything*. There is NO WAY this book gets published with any name other than a &quot;super author&quot;. The dialog is elementary schoolish, the plot telegraphed miles ahead, character development is weak to non-existant.If this is the first Robin Cook book you'd ever read, you'd probably never read another (a mistake, in my opinion).An interesting experiment? I don't know about that. A &quot;statement&quot; about today's society? Nope, it's not even close to being that &quot;deep&quot;. It's just plain bad writing. A worthy experiment in proving that an author with a name like Robin Cook could sell blank pages, and that's about it. To tell you the truth, I think I'd rather read a blank book than endure &quot;Abduction&quot; again. Buy it, read it, you won't believe just how bad it is, nor how many copies it sells."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The first third of the book is the best portion of the book, although it's a copy of the numerous meaningless thrillers that throng the market. The rest is an exercise for the reader's patience and perseverance. I completed it because I was travelling on train and had nothing to do for twenty two hours. The plot idea is good (two stars are given for that, eventhough the idea of immortal life is a take from Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosomes), but the execution is very juvenile and for the last third of the book the author simply lost interest, how do you expect the reader to sustain it?"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The first few chapters of this book piqued my interest, until the crew of the submersible end up in Interterra. The inhabitants of this world are not believable at all. The last few chapters grew very tiresome, a chore to finish. Stick to medical thrillers, Mr. Cook!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I am a Robin Cook fan, so when I bought his latest I was expecting a medical thriller. What I got was a science fiction book that was confusing and hard to follow. The only reason I finished it was to find out if the &quot;second generation humans&quot; were able to escape or used for some other purpose.I hope this was only an experiement for Mr Cook and he will go back to his usual forte for his next novel."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"It is very good the only downside is the ending, i thought it would come out better. For kids it is a lot easier to understand than some of his other books."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I cannot remember reading a book as bad as this in a long, long time. I have read all of Robin Cook's books and this one does not fit the typical novel of his. As the &quot;master of the medical thriller&quot; I would have expected more from him. This book was an attempt at branching off into science fiction. He should stay with science fact. Every page was loaded with &quot;he said&quot;, &quot;she said&quot; and it quickly became redundant. I hope in the future Robin Cook sticks with the medical thrillers and leaves the science fiction to the real science fiction writers."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This book is nothing but a bundle of the writer's most outrageous &quot;What ifs&quot; with barely a sprinkling of a plot. We care nothing for the characters, and find ourselves wondering whatever happens to things the writer hints at at the start of the book, like a romance between Perry and Suzanne, or a deeper understanding of the worker-clones. Altogether bizarre and childish, with an extremely poor ending. Stick to the medical thrillers, Mr. Cook."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I am a Cook fan and have loved his medical thrillers, so I eagerly bought Abduction while waiting for a long flight. It was a big let-down. I thought the topic of an Atlantis type world might be interesting, but the story turned out to be weak and the writing definitely not up to Robin Cook's normal standard. In fact, it was as if someone else had written this book under his name. The accounts of continual orgies were in my opinion in bad taste, the characters not believable, and the whole effect rather disappointing.Don't let this put you off his other books though. They are usually well worth the read."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This book was such a disappointment and not at all like Robbin's previous books. The story starts out fairly interesting and keeps you guessing what they are going to find by drilling into the earths core. A team of people get into a submarine to explore the findings and find themselves suck into a hole. Not bad up to this point but then you discover they were captured by aliens and the whole story goes down hill. I almost put the book down right there an then. But I thought it might get better. Trust me it doesn't. I still wonder who really wrote this book because it was not even close to the quality of writing Robbin normally creates. So will the real Robbin Cook please stand up."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is a poor attempt by Robin Cook to stray away from his typical medical thriller and try his luck at a Michael Crichton wannabe book but falls short.The subject has already been used before but nevertheless it is an easy read. But I think I might have read this book before I think it was called \\"The Abyss\\""},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I thought that this book was very thrilling and without boring lectures. I also liked how Robin Cook used his knowledge and experience in the medical field, and brought it into his book. Even though this book is fiction, you get a sense that it maybe could happen. I usually am not into the scientific type of book, but this book pulled it off. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The most important thing to realize about this book is it is NOT Robin Cook's typical book. There are no doctors, no hospital, no cutting edge medical technology.It is, however, a very good book in it's genre. This book really belongs in Science Fiction rather than mystery. The story is set in the ocean rather than in space, but many of the elements are the same as first encounter stories. It's a familiar story of the clash of cultures and the resulting problems.I found it very refreshing to read this type of story from Robin Cook. Hopefully this is the first of more stories away from the typical medical setting."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I cannot believe that as a Robin Cook fan I did not read this spectacular book sooner! I actually had it on my bookshelf for awhile and didn't read it right away because the begining was rather slow for me compared to his other books, but I thought, this is Robin Cook, so it has to be good. Was it ever! As soon as the characters were stranded in a dark, muddy cave somewhere under the sea that they determine is not geologically possible, I was hooked. They walk for awhile in knee deep mud and and a big steel door out of nowhere opens up with a light inside. They cautiously go in and from then on I went along with them experiencing the adventure of a lifetime! I won't spoil the fun by telling you anymore right now about the plot. I thought this was a very imaginative work by Robin Cook that possibly became my new favorite of his. (I am still real fond of the Jack Stapleton books, esp. Chromosome 6 and Vector). I really recommend this book, it is way cool!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"well..i have been a Robin Cook's fan for a long time and have enjoyed most of his medical-based-thriller-books..and although this one is not in his usual style...i enjoyed it tremendously and it is really a page-turner...u just cant put it down..it stimualtes the mind with all the concepts and ideas in it..the only word for this book is ...WOW!:)"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read. The storyline is about a group of varied people being sucked into an ancient subterainian civilization under the sea which has evolved into a utopia. While slow moving as far as action is concerned, it is stimulating for those with intelligence and imagination, even suspenseful up to its abrupt hastily wound up ending. It begs for a sequel, though making one would require a different theme. This novel is written in the tone of the contemporary humanistic relgious attutude of modern America, but what makes it different is the fictional challenges to the Evolutionary Darwinian faith, which while intriguing, is even more unbelievable than Macro-evolutionary scientific theory itself, which is presently crumbling in the more open-minded circles of the scientific community. In addition to the mixture of simpleton characters with the more \\"elite\\" politically correct, educated characters (paradoxically promoting acceptance of certain sexual behaviors and personal liberty in our imperfect world where it leads to suffering and destruction of the family, the basis of our civilization, yet is promoted in an advanced society concerned with the whole of their civilization, though it is based on selfish impulses and the labor of a created sub-class. Such conflicts make one think!) are social issues, environmental issues, and the spiritual condition of the human race. It is interesting that the story recognizes a difference between the human body and the \\"essence\\", though it tends to explain the spiritual in physical terms, a mistake that many intellectuals will only realize when they pass on, only to realize the spiritual is real and the physical is an illusion. But coming from that physical standpoint, no explanaition for the origin of life or the design of the universe is explained, and perfection is achieved only buy large amounts of time and human evolution and effort. Typical of those who refuse to entertain the concept of God, or wish to be their own god, usually to justify his own sexual desires. Man can be so blind as to not see the fingerprints God in our world and universe...we are without excuse as it is so obvious. Anyway, despite the attempt to circumvent the spiritual, I found it an enjoyable novel, save the abrupt ending. In reality, man is born with a sin nature, and will never evolve into a better being, or create a utopian world, and those who are trying to conform us into their social engineering will bring us all of the negatives of the undersea civilization of this story, but none of the benefits. But this book gives one something to dream about, and though we cannot re-enter eden, I have had a glimpse of paradise to come...to bad, like the 4 in this story, most will reject paradise in favor of their own will and destruction. Like Satan himself, we wish to be as God...and the world groans as a result...."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The book gets good ratings for plot, (very Michael Chricton like). But character development is poor. Michael and Richard are more like Beavis and Butthead than regular divers. It's funny at first but it gets old. Perry (the President of Benthic Marine) seems very boring (however, most company presidents are).Suzanne was the only character I liked. She seemed like the most intelligent and least predictable character.On the plus side, the book is very easy to read, and difficult to put down once reading starts. If character development was as good as the plot, I would have given this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Robin Cook is by far the best Medical Thriller author!This is Definitely a Great Book. True to his nature, this book is full of suspense and the &quot;what if&quot; of reality. Again, after reading one of his novels, I found myself thinking about it for days."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I've read nearly everything Robin Cook has written, and I've got very used to hospital based thrillers. How different this book is! So plausible!,he manages to relate histoical fact to this work of fiction in such a way that you can almost believe it could be true. And what a great and unexpected ending. If you're wanting Doctors, forget this book, if you want a really great story, then this is the book for you. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Robin Cook is an acclaimed author whose mysteries and thrillers have attracted legions of fans. Abduction combines human drama with high-tech thrills as a mysterious transmission from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean leads a crew of oceanographers and divers to a phenomenon beyond scientific understanding, one that will alter everything we think we know about life on earth! This unabridged, 7 cassette, 10 hour, superbly produced, library edition audiobook is marvelously narrated by Dick Hill. Abduction is also available in an unabridged CD format (209-4...); as well as an abridged trade edition (6 hours, 4 cassettes, 053-9...)."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I must say that I've never read a Robin Cook novel before this one, and I wasn't about to before I found that this was the only book at work one day when there was nothing to do.Robin Cook's credentials on the back cover were impressive, and I looked forward to a Michael Chrichton-esque novel thoroughly grounded in science fact. What I got was a poor imitation of a Jules Verne story with many loose ends and flismy characters (caricatures, really) that was agonizing to read. Once I start something, I must finish it, and Abduction was one of those times when I wished I didn't have that conviction.I know that I shouldn't expect much from pulp fiction, but this book was very poor. Cook makes a mild pass at research, familiarizing himself with a handful of oceanographic and nautical terms, and his vaunted medical knowledge makes two cameo appearences. Blink and you'll miss them, they have nothing to do with the overall story. The characters are so blandly one-dimensional that they become irritating. By page 150, I was cheering for the protagonists to meet a gruesome end. The dialogue is dreadfully repetitive, and there are so many loose ends that it would take another fifty pages to resolve them all. Thank god that there aren't any pages though.Cook's (or his editor's) mastery of english is also called into question, as there are several instances where Cook prints one word where he clearly needed to use a homonym (I can't recall a specific one now, but read the book and they'll slap you in the face).Big, big thumbs down from me."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This book is appallingly bad. The plot, such as it is, is risible. The characters are cardboard. The dialogue is excruciating. The scientific accuracy is lacking. The writing is terrible.Even worse, editing and proofing are absent. Proofing would have picked up on the use of 'base' for musical bass, or 'foolhearty' for foolhardy in my US mass paperback edition of November 2000. Or the incomplete sentences with missing words. (Despite waving the title 'Dr' around a lot, the author doesn't appear to be particularly literate.) Any editor would have rejected this from a slushpile.Worst of all, the lazy throwaway ending to the book is a lame reference to the author having been to Harvard. It's presumably a joke - andthe joke is on the reader who has gotten that far. It is tempting to make comparisons with Michael Crichton's 'Sphere' - the worst of Crichton's books that I've yet read, also set undersea - but Sphere was, for all its faults, far better written.Jeffrey Archer writes better than this. Heck, L. Ron Hubbard has written better stuff than this. And he was probably dead at the time.I will never read another Robin Cook novel. I urge you to do the same."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Having read all of Robin Cooks books, I'm used to medical thrillers with good story lines and well develeped characters that make sense. None of that is here. It's an interesting idea very poorly executed. It's as if the author really didn't care.This book was painfull to read, avoid it at all costs."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Anyone who gives this book a good review is lying and simply wants you to suffer as they did for having to read this horrible book. I have always been a huge Robin Cook fan, I love his medical thrillers. They are good, entertaining reads that leave you thinking. I am also a huge fan of Sci-fi and this book is some of the worst sci-fi ever written. The characters are so bad that to call them one dimensional would be to big a compliment. The actually story had some potential but it became so trite and superficial you simply didn't care what happened to any of these people. A noble idea that fell flat on it face is the best way to sum up this book. A much better story is Orson Scott Cards book \\"The Abyss\\" Now that is a fantastic book, far better then the movie with really interesting characters. Bottom line, don't waste your time with this book. If you are interested in a non-medical book by Mr. Cook, check out Sphinx. That was a great story!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Maybe it's pointless, but I read some of Dr. Cook's later works for a laugh. This time I was sick and bed and it amused me, but that's about it. The fact is that Robin Cook does not develop characters well at all, so he needs a good strong plot in his area of expertise, which is medicine, and this book is not about medicine. It's full of weak, stereotyped characters having very unreal conversations, and a bunch of high scientific jargon that will make your head spin unless you happen to be a scientist. But you know what? I liked it. :-) I was highly amused by the names of the Interterrans... he must have had fun making those up. And I LOVED the ending. It made the book worth while to see those suckers get their justice. :-) Still, I think I'll wait till I am sick again to read another one. Stick with his earlier medical thrillers... \\"Mutation\\" is a particular favorite."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I am an avid Robin Cook fan and found this book to be a great disappointment. Getting past the fact it was not a medical thriller, it just wasn't well written. The plot was thin, the characters never developed to the point the reader wanted to be involved with them and the ending fell flat.I agree with other reviewers, Mr. Cook please return to the medical suspense thrillers you are so skilled at!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"While most of the negative reviews of this book focus on the fact that it is not the &quot;normal&quot; Robin Cook, I think it was great to see a change in focus from the medical thriller to sci-fi. I agree with the review that stated Robin Cook's novels were starting to all sound alike. The problem I had with Abduction was with the overall writing and character development, or should I say lack thereof. If the Interrans were so &quot;advanced&quot; why did they giggle so much? Why were Richard and Michael so immature? Why was it so easy for the Americans to escape? For those that are looking to find the typical Robin Cook novel, don't buy this one. For those that are looking for a well developed sci-fi novel, don't buy this one."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I have not read anything so juvenile for many years. Some of the childrens literature that I read while working for the School Library was far superior to this drivel. It reminded me of an attempt at Science Fiction by a 7th grader. As he points out, himself, in the book, it has already been done and much better by Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I, too, have read all of Robin Cook's books and always look forward to each new book with great anticipation. I was so very disappointed in this book. Reviewers like Chuck Hickey might put me in the &quot;It's not Mr. Cooks typical medical thriller so I don't like it&quot; box, but that is not true. One of his early works, &quot;Sphinx&quot; was not a medical thriller, and I loved that book. The problem with this book was that it was very boring, not suspenseful, and definintely NOT a thriller like his previous books. The only reason I kept reading was I was sure it would get better, but it never did. The ending was a horrible dispappointment! I wasted my money and time on this book!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Should be called &quot;How To Use the Terms Vis-a-Vis and Apropos as Much as Possible&quot;. This is the worst book I've ever read. There are inconsistencies on every page. Character dialog is horrid and unrealistic. Gets one star because of a mildly funny scene involving a game of fetch. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I am an avid reader of Dr. Cook. I have read evert book he has written and was extreemly disappointed with this book. The plot was lame and the ending unsatisying. While I did finish the book, when I did I felt that I had wasted my time.I suggest that Dr. Cook stay with what he does best, medical plots and stories and leave the deep sea to better authors such as Jules Verne."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Everything my fellow reviewers have said about this book is true. It is the first (since Coma) Robin Cook I've read. I read it because I thought he has been at the business of writing for so long, he has to have gotten good at it. And the premise sounded interesting (not shockingly new, mind you...but interesting).I nearly got out my red pen and went after several passages. There are several howlers...all unintentional.The characters ARE irritating and their actions make NO sense. BUT I give this two stars (instead of one or a half) because the plot DID keep me reading until the end. Now that must be worth something!So style is absent. So the characters are ludicrous. So we saw this society in Brave New World and ninety-leven 70's SF movies and 50's SF novels...there is still a spark of something new--albeit a small one. So IF you find yourself on an island, you COULD be stranded with worse. If you have nothing to read at present...believe me you could do worse."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This book was a disappointment. It's great that Robin Cook is trying out a new genre, but the book reads like a corny old Star Trek episode or a bad made-for-tv movie. Please, Dr. Cook, go back to your medical thrillers!!!"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Cool story. Good story. Whenever I'm reading a book, my wife asks if it's any good. I usually reply, &quot;I don't know yet&quot;, even when I'm almost finished. With this book, I replied &quot;Yes, it's good.&quot; I finished it in almost record time which tells me it was quite engrossing. If you're looking for the typical medical mystery with arrogant, bigshot doctor perps--this isn't it. This book was quite a change from previous Cook books but it was a great story. The literati won't like it since they're so busy looking for &quot;Composition 101&quot; violations that they miss the great creativity that went into this story. This book introduces the reader to the wonder and fantasy of another world and holding the author to the old licenses is not only unfair but a good way to miss a great book. If you focus on the characters you will miss the greater questions explored by the book. Perhaps the first line should be, &quot;Work with me here...&quot;. Think &quot;B.F. Skinner meets Jules Verne&quot;."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I'm only writing because I simply can't believe that anyone considers Robin Cook's latest attempt at mass hallucination to be &quot;enjoyable.&quot; Maybe those people define &quot;enjoyable&quot; the way the Marquis de Sade did...I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that if you've read at least ten books before you got suckered into reading Abduction, you couldn't possibly have enjoyed it. I only finished it because I couldn't believe it could stay that bad. Cook surprised me by managing to make it stink right to the end. As Opus the Penguin once said of a movie: &quot;Okay, maybe it wasn't as bad as all that, but lordy, it sure wasn't good!&quot;I'm still going to be muttering to myself about the future of America when there are people living here who think Abduction was worth reading."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Being a science fiction fan (versus medical fiction fan), I found the first part of the book interesting and exciting, albeit some of the character development was weak. The second part of the book turned into a bad episode of Star Trek or a reminder of &quot;Amazon Women on Mars&quot; with an ending that was put together at the 57th minute of the 1 hour show."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"We need more of a Medical Thriller than inter-gallactic sci-fi ..."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The only reason I gave this book two stars is cos' atleast Mr. Cook tried his hand at a different subject. Other than that, there is hardly anything in the book that would deserve even one star. The chracters are not only predictable, they are downright irritating! After a promise of some fancy stuff, we get a load of the funny first generation humans who hardly seem human atall. The book reminds you off those Hollywood sci-fi movies which were mada in the seventies, that two the worst ones of the period. Even the dresses they wear are similar. The initial plot is very much similar to a book by Michael Chriton. The story is about these five humans who land up in a surreal world located inside the Earth. As the rest of the story unfolds, you realize that you can guess almost every next thing thats about to happen on the next page. In short, this book is not even for the hardcore Robin Cook fan simply because the plot line is alien to any of the other works by the same author.Please Mr. Cook, if you have to do different stuff, please give more meat and depth to your characters. Don't make them Robots."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Perry Bergman, president of Benthic Marine, is holding station in his ship Benthic Explorer above an anomaly discovered on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. He joins Dr. Suzanne Newell and Commander Donald Fuller in a submersible dive to the site and to those on the surface the submersible disappears without a trace, but the trio are not dead. They wake in a futuristic chamber and meet their hosts, the Interterrans, who live beneath the ocean floor in a place called Interterra.These Interterrans are the non-violent first generation humans and this is a story that is pretty hard to take in, though I must admit that I read it in one sitting. I suppose that's because even if Robin Cook is writing about something as far fetched as this, it's still a Robin Cook book and they are so well written that you willingly believe the unbelievable."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I picked this book up, expecting another medical thriller by one of my favorite authors. Instead, I found myself gripping the arms of my chair, transported down through the ocean floor and through a volacanic vent. I literally could not put the book down. I started it late one afternoon, read until 10 PM, got up very early, and finished it before breakfast. I have loved every one of Robin Cooks's books, but this one was by far the MOST exciting I've read. I loved science fiction as a kid, but have been generally disappointed with many science fiction novels as an adult. Now that I've finished it, I literally can't stop thinking about it. This is a marvelous first novel breaking out of the medical thriller genre. It seems to me that most of the people who were disappointed with this book prefer the \\"realism\\" of a medical thriller--the enjoyment of this novel, while written very realistically, depends upon a \\"suspension of disbelief\\" as to the characters' circumstances. Lastly--the ending does not disappoint. It is reasonable, believable, and satisfying."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"The story is beyond my imagination. The technology mentioned in the story may not be accomplished in my life time. Although there are many technical terms, but the glossary does help a lot. I'm sure that Cook must did a lot of studies before he get started especially on the field of ocenography. To sum up, the book is well written with an unexpected ending. This is another book by Robin Cook that I recommend."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is not a normal Robin Cook medical thriller. It's a fast read and not too deep. The premise is similar to Abyss, but without Abyss' excitement."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is my first book of Robin Cook. I knew him mostly from his medical books. Abduction starts very good but the second half of the book is a bit boring far away from being thriller. In anyway, it is a good book. It also has some criticism to violence of humanbeing. A journey to the Fantasy Land. Deep down ocean.. Have a good trip..."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Cook takes a departure from medical thrillers and tells the story of a group of undersea explorers who get sucked into the world of Interterra. Stories of undersea civilizations are nothing new, but I thought Cook did an OK job handling this one. Really liked how he presented Interterra, its culture, its technology, its beliefs when it comes to reproduction (which are pretty wild). Bascially, this civilization, which is millions upon millions of years old, has created a virtual utopia. But the more time the explorers spend in Interterra, they wonder if utopia is really worth living in, especially when it's not clear whether they will be allowed to return to the surface world. No real clear distinction is made on who is absolutely right or wrong about the fate of the explorers. Still, I thought Cook handled the story well."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"I was really into the story when the Americans landed into this secret city under the sea. After awhile the story about life on Interterra became boring, the two divers very boorish and I couldn't wait to finish the book so that I could move on to another book. I did like the ending however; I thought it was a good conclusion to the story. Not your typical Robin Cook novel which are far more preferable"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Every once in a while a successful writer comes out with a book that encompasses his life's work and philisophy. I hope this isn't Robin's. I certainly hope he didn't spend years writing it. I kept looking for meaning. Once in a while I would think that I had found some and instantly I would realize I was so wrong and I would laugh. OK, so I did laugh. It was worth [the money] for the laughs. But then perhaps the laugh was on me. I bought the book and I read it--every page--even though it was really awful. Robin, if only for me, go back to the books I love to read. Judy Parsons"},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This is my FIRST Robin Cook book I have read and I pretty much summed up my reaction with my title for this review.The beginning of the book immediately drew me in and before I knew i had read almost half of it in just one night. But towards the later half, the book definately slowed down and was lagging. I felt I was just being drawn out until the ending.I would also like to note if you have read Robin cook's previous books which i believe MAINLY deal with MEDICAL-related storylines, you might not enjoy this book at all."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"Cook should stick to his area of expertise - Medicine in his books. This science fiction adventure lacks the deep analysis &amp; understanding of a theme that makes his medical thrillers so interesting."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"At first I was expecting an update of Brave New World, with a twist (all those references to &quot;the entertaining primitives&quot;). Unfortunately, while the plot was intriguing, the characters were a little too cookie-cutter. Mr. Cook also doesn't delve into the moral or ethical concerns which permeate the Interterran's world - I so desperately wanted someone, anyone, to head down to where the worker-clones lived and seek out their humanity. I feel he missed a real opportunity to move this novel from beach-reading to something more."},{"Title":"Abduction","review":"This novel begins and ends like a first-rate marine adventure, but the 90 percent in between isn't much worth the time it takes to read. The principals are abducted into a Utopian undersea society, at which point the story becomes a plagiarism of Aldous Huxley's classic 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;. I'd advise reading the Huxley and skipping this one!!"},{"Title":"The Decorated Kitchen: Creative Projects from Leslie Beck","review":"Don't let the title fool you. Yes--this book is full of compelling kitchen decoration projects, but it is so much more than that. There are quilts, tablecloths, curtains, chair covers, totes, pillows, pot holders and matching directions for folk painting objects to go with the theme kitchens. There are four main kitchen themes. Vintage Kitchen is in red and white patchwork with redwork inserts. I'm crazy for redwork, country kitchens and antique oak. I have an antique wooden office chair that I have failed to paint and I'm going to make the chair cover in this book. The Koffee Klatch Kitchen is a log cabin theme in bright red, blue, yellow and white. I've got to make the table runner! Antique Fruit Kitchen has an apple quilt to die for. Folk Art Rooster Kitchen is warm browns, tans, and deep red. There are folk art pillows,a table runner,and a rooster on a stick that make me laugh and will no doubt make me sew! There's a chapter on kitchen completers too--more nonfabric projects! The color plates in this book are awesome and I want my kitchen to look like everyone of these themes! The directions are clear and have color pictures and diagrams! This book took an honorable mention in the Accidental Quilter's Quilting Book Award 2000. :)the accidental quilter"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is an excellent book!It's an adventurous fantasy of another world, Narnia. It had some old english vocabulary that I couldn't understand though. I loved it!

Lewis, lures you into a whole new world behind a wardrobe in this imaginative heartwarming adventure. The main characters are four children who befriend a faun in the woods of Narnia ,the country behind the wardrobe. They are determined to save him and the rest of Narnia from the White Witch who cast a spell on Narnia to make it always winter, but never Christmas. Both children and adults have enjoyed this classic for years and it is now a wonderful motion picture. &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; is the second of a seven book series describing the enchanting woods of Narnia. I guarantee, once you begin to read you won't be able to stop."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I've read this book two or three times and it is always great. C.S. Lewis's writing is very original and friendly. The pictures are very nice and the story itself is exciting and entertaining. There are obvious allusions to the story of Jesus, but I like to think of it just as a lovely little story that really everyone can have their own interpretation to. P.S. If you think that this book is just for children, you probably aren't the type of person who would like it anyway."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I'd rate this six stars if I could! Because this is awesome! I likes 1-10 rating scale better,because it gives choice. But this is the bomb!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book written by C.S. Lewis has been one of the best fantasy books I've read before. This book opened my imagination and showed me what fantasy really looked like. This story begins when four schoolchildren are sent from London because of World War II and the air raids. There Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find their way through the back of a wardrobe into the magic land of Narnia. Lucy is the first one that discovers the fantasyland of Narnia and met there Mr. Tumnus, a faun who explained how Narnia was controled by the White Witch who has cursed the land with eternal winter. These kids knew that the Witch had to be fought so that Narnia could return into its normal state.When the four of them went into the magic land of Narnia, Edmund was being controled by the witch. He made a deal with the White Witch, since he didn't know the witch wanted to turn him and the others into stone so that they could from part of her stone statues collection. the deal was that if he bring the others to her castle by the next day, he was going to become and turned into King of Narnia, which wasn't true at all.then they assist Aslan the great golden lion to triumph over the witch and in a blink of an eye all their lives changed."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I feel that any parent who would not encourage their child to read C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; should be charged with neglect. Even though these stories are a kiddie version of the &quot;Bible&quot;, where Jesus of Nazareth is replaced by a lion, they are fun to read and bring out the goodness in everyone. These books also show, not just children but anyone who reads them, that people can be swayed by evil, but that everyone can be true at heart. These action adventures have had a lasting impression on me. Yes, I understood that C.S. Lewis was just covering up Christianity with a lion's mane, but I have not let that affect my relegious views in any way. I did take the lessons of kindness and forgiveness to heart however. Even though my nephew was only a year old this past Christmas, I bought him the whole set of the &quot;Narnia Chronicles&quot;, hoping that someday he will find joy in them like I did."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I would never give any book a 10, unless it captured my heart time and time again, this book deserves it. I've read it fourteen times now and my mind dreams on and on for fortnights and my heart is singing and wailing to see the blessed Naria of which Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy talk about seeing. It makes my day bright and gay to read about such happy adventures that the four children have together. At least it's much better than reading about the misfortune in Jonsboro, Arkansas or about some gangs shooting at one another, etc. The Chronicles of Narnia are a wonderful collection to pass down from generation to generation. The best, though, is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I have read this book over and over again, it's one of those. I am now in 8th grade and in fourth grade the teacher read all six books from the Chronicles of Narnia to us. I now read them to my sister and enjoy them so much myself as well. Presently, I am looking for information as I am composing a project on Clive Staple Lewis and the Narnia books. I have encouraged all of my friends to get wrapped up in them and they indeed have; and have all thanked me. There are so many great sites with amazing things. I never look at any of the pictures of the characters, since I do not want the way I have created them with my imagination to be replaced by an artist's point of view (no offense). In conclusion, I would like to say that I think everyone should be swept into Narnia, no matter what age they might be, they will all find the books (especially 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe') fascinating and delightful.

Enraptured was I in the prose and the way the it flowed. From the beginning when the children are sent to the country-side mansion to escape the air raids in London is a bit of a history lesson that children, as well as, adults are treated to. There are little lessons in morality, religion, history, and undeniable fantasy wrapped in a story sure to please. I read this book again and again and from the moment Lucy steps through the wardrobe door and pushes her way back through what seems and impossibly large wardrobe, through fur coat after coat, and finally into the forest, hearing the snow crunch beneath her feet, I was hooked.

I think there is a lot more feeling of things being explained at the right times if the books are read in the order C S Lewis intended them to be read in, but whatever order they're in, they all still give an incredible feeling of magic waiting just round the corner. Even though I'm old enough now to see the the religious allegory in the book, I'd really rather not.It's a clever way of explaining Christianity to children, but for me seeing it as a religious allegory takes a little of the wonder away from it.

This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia. I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than 1 week and that was the fastest i read a book because it was so interesting and captivating. This is now 1 of my favorite books. I recommend that others read this book and like it as i did to. I enjoyed reading this because it was so captivating. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is very courageous, and caring to others. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named something very special. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She was my least favrite because she is evil. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were given a special position in Narnia My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he lied and said he had never been there. I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination. I liked it because it had vivid details and it was imaginative. It was also full of great characters kids can relate to. Since the characters were kids our age and the setting was an imaginary place it made it more fun to read.

The four children embark on an exciting quest to stop the witch and save Narnia.I enjoyed this book for many reasons, but also there were some parts that were a little annoying. Some of the good things about this book are that the fantasy world Narniaseems very realistic. The characters are also very believable, they have human-like characteristics. The characters are animals, that talk and act just like humans. Some of the annoying things that are in this book are: the way C. S. switches between characters it some times confuses me.

Upon reading it, you would initially say that it is a beautifully worded work of prose. Dare I say I had thought it to be a children's book, but upon finishing it, I had to change my view.

The main characters were Edmund, Lucy, Peter, Susan, White Witch, and Aslan the lion. I thought it was cool how Lucy just went into the wardrobe and found a magical place called Naria. It was awfully cruel of the faun Mr. Tumnus to be working for the White Witch although it was cool how he told the truth about it. I did not like it when the other children didn't believe Lucy, but then Edmund found it and the White Witch and he thought she was the Queen of Naria. It was weird though when she made a hot drink and turkish delight out of snow and something in a bottle. I love though the way the beavers let the four children come in to their house that was so kind of them. It was cool how they let the children even eat dinner with them. It was sad though about how Mr. Tumnus the guy faun that Lucy met got taken away by the police. The when the spell started to break I cheered up. But then something happened to the children which I must not say. And there is also much more which I must not say."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a book about a group of kids, a mysterious new world, a kind hearted lion and a evil witch. The children find a wardrobe of which they can enter into a whole other world. This world is Narnia. In Narnia, the evil witch made it winter all year \`round with no Christmas. The children soon find out that they are the only humans and the animals can talk. Also they find out that they can stay in Narnia as long as they want and they wont lose any time on earth. The children and Aslan, the lion save Narnia become kings and queens and rule Narnia for many years with out ever losing a second of earth time.My favorite part of the book is the great big war between good and evil when the children find out that Aslan (even though he sacrificed himself to save them) came back to life and they fight side by side animal and human fighting for a common ground. The witch has great big ugly beasts on her side but Aslans army is far more cunning then these barbarians. Together, they defeat evil and rule the land of Narnia.I have read many fantasy books in my life and this one is not my favorite to say the least. If you want a quick read this is the book for you but if you want a book that will keep you reading for months I suggest the Shannara series by Terry Brooks. This was a good book but it could have been better. Overall this book has me satisfied and I will probably read the rest of the chronicles of Narnia series.

Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Four siblings--Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are staying clear of the war in England by staying in a huge old house in the country with an old professor. As they are left alone most of the time, the children are free to wander and explore the huge house. One day while exploring, Lucy steps into a wardrobe, and walks into another world, the world of Narnia. There she finds that she is not in the wardrobe anymore but is instead in a forest of trees, covered in snow. She meets a faun and spends the afternoon having tea with him. The faun confides that a wicked queen rules the land, making it always wintertime and never Christmas, and that he has sworn to bring any humans he finds directly to her. There is a prophesy that someday four humans will come to sit in the thrones of the castle and that the queen will be defeated. Lucy convinces the faun to let her go, though.When Lucy returns to her sister and brothers, none of them believes that she has really been anywhere, and she is very upset. Soon afterward, Edmund follows her into the wardrobe and is shocked to discover that his sister was telling the truth. Unable to find her in Narnia, though, he meets the wicked queen who charms him and makes him promise to bring her his brother and sisters.Soon afterward, all four children find themselves caught in Narnia. Peter and Susan and Lucy are eager to meet Aslan, the great lion who is said to be coming near to end the eternal winter. But Edmund sneaks off to announce the presence of his siblings to the queen. Peter, Susan and Lucy are now in trouble. Will they be able to avoid being taken by the queen? Will they help their brother come over to the side of good?I liked the descriptions of Narnia and the way things worked there. It's a great mythology. I also liked Aslan's character and the ways he handled problems that came up. I thought that Edmund's turnaround seemed too easy, though. He semed to slip from one side to the other with no effort. I also didn't like that the story of the children growing up happened too quickly, without incident. The end of the book went by much too quickly."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of the top ten best books I have ever read. To me it seemed as if the story was alive.C.S.Lewis is a gifted writer; some books are just plain boring, but not C.S.Lewis's books. He starts the book a little dead but soon the story comes alive. His books are so exciting. I stood up late reading it sometimes. I felt as if I was apart of the story. With all the action and excitement the story grabbed me like a mother does to her child. If mom had not sent me to bed I would have most likely read the whole book in one night.There were so many exciting scenes that barley any of them were boring. The scenes were so realistic that you could almost see a movie when you read. One of my favorite scenes was when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy spoke medieval, it was funny.Reading this book made me think. It made me think that even fake characters could seem real.

Four orphans, Edmund, Susan, Lucy, Peter are adopted by an old scientist. Little did they know they were moving to a mansion, and didn't know what they were getting themselves into. The four children then started playing games inside the house and stumbled across a massive wardrobe. Inside was a magical place called Narnia.C.S. Lewis put this fantasy together spectacularly. In Narnia there is evil, such as the White Witch, who creates many conflicts throughout the book. There is also something to stop the evil, and that would be Aslan the Lion and the four orphans Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan. A conflict that really frightened me is when Aslan the Lion was close to death. He was captured by the White Witch, and was murdered on a stone alter. I was surprised what happened to Aslan the Lion after he was murdered.C.S. Lewis did an awesome job writing this novel. In my opinion this is the best fantasy I have ever read.

Living in a professor's house, they are given many strictly enforced rules by an employee of the professor.

But, Edmund goes missing and they have to fight a battle to not only get Edmund back, but to save Narnia.Whenever C.S. Lewis is describing settings, I can easily picture the icy castles, the beaver's dam and the frozen lake. One particular quote that sticks out in my mind as a good example is:\\"There, a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs, that meant that they whole country below them lay in the evening light--- forests and hills and valleys, and winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river.\\"The 189-page book is a fantastic read for fantasy-lovers.

Lewis wrote in his Chronicles of Narnia series. Even though \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" occurs first chronologically (and is now listed as #1 in most sets), this book is a much better introduction to the land of talking animals and, more importantly, to Aslan. Though children from our world are the main characters in this (and other) Narnia stories, the true hero is Aslan, The Great Lion and Son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea.Though this is written as a fairytale for children it follows C. S. Lewis's philosophy that, \\"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.\\" Aslan is clearly a Christ character and each book, besides being a fun fantasy story, explores a different aspect of His character. This book reveals Aslan as Redeemer."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a wonderful audio edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, perfect for car trips. However, if you are planning to read along with in the book, this is not the audio cd to purchase."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"You know, I can't help but question whether a book like this would be published today. There's a lot of telling, not so much showing, a lot of action is skimmed over and it's very obviously a religious allegory (not that that would make it ineligible for publication). I couldn't help but think that as I read it but at the same time I couldn't help but think just how magical the story actually is.Compare the circumstances to other works now and you don't have all that much that is original but then, back in 1950, this was the epitome of original. There was nothing else like this story except for facetious fairy tales that carried very little depth. This was the basis for portals and other worlds and magical creatures that authors today either consciously or subconsciously pull from for their own stories. So no, it's not original today but it is the very reason it's not original today, because it was so original and magical then that it was bound to spurn derivatives.This is a classic fairy tale despite the obvious Jesus references (if I could find that YouTube video, I'll post it, with Aslan as Jesus). It's light and airy and the kind that, obviously without me saying it, will stand the test of time for many more years to come. The children are eternally relatable , their wishes are forever there in the reader, to escape to a magic land and become king or queen. There's nothing in there that couldn't appeal to anyone, at any time, reading it.When comparing this book to something like Stardust by Neil Gaiman, I think the voice of Narnia just stands out. This was Lewis's voice. He was born to write these types of fantastical stories in the style of an age-old fairy tale. While Gaiman's idea for Stardust was on the level of awesome, the voice just wasn't right. There was a sort of force there, a trying too hard. I use Gaiman as an example because (aside from the fact that I can't think of any other authors that have tried to write like this) he's a magnificent writer and writes amazing stories. Stardust was an experiment for him, not his usual voice so it's not chalked up to him not being able to write. That old timey style voice of fairy story telling is bestowed only on a select few. Lewis was one of those few.These stories are capable of transcending time with ease and are written in such a way that they'll never go out of style. Sure, you'd have to be either really damn good or someone of Gaiman's status in the publishing industry to get something like this published now, and even then there's no guarantee of equivalence, but it doesn't erase the fact that Narnia was published, does exist and will continue to exist for generations. There is a classicism about these stories that just can't be erased and just can't be mimicked unless you've been bestowed with the voice to do it.Yes, there is so much that could be expanded on in Narnia but what's already there on the pages is amazing. Perhaps it is because it's the epitome of a fairy tale and someone who's much more critical than I can might be able to see how empty of a plate it might be but to me, there's just enough there to trust the reader. It's not bogged down in worldbuilding infodumping or unimportant backstory or research masturbation on the part of the author. All that's there is what's important to the story at hand, and nothing else. It goes from point to point seamlessly and with little to no fat and, for me anyway, makes the experience of the read that much more enjoyable.The world misses fairy tales like this, in all their simplicity but I don't think there can be much more than what there is now without an inundation which would only devalue what's already available. Let's hope the world never has to know what it's like to live without Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Okay, I finally got around to reading one of the most famous children's fantasies series ever done. Depending on who you talk to, this is actually the second book in the series if you read it by topic, but Lewis wrote this one first, dedicating it to his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. While perusing the Large Print editions of fiction in my local library, I was very pleased to discover this entire series by Lewis, and it is the illustrated version to boot! (Illustrations are b&w; line sketches by Pauline Baynes, much like the illustrated edition of the classic Wind in the Willows). The text of the book runs about 44,000 words so it is not a lengthy or deep read. It is intended for young children, possibly to be read to them. But this entire series is also an allegorical tale of Christianity, not just a simple fairy tale.In the first book of the series (thematically speaking), Lewis tells of creation, when he relates how The Magician's Nephew plays a part in the creation of the world of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is therefore a children's tale about triumph over evil, about the Christ and his redemption and the kingdom of God restored back to faithful believers, and the defeat of Satan. The gospel in a juvenile nutshell, to be exact. In the subsequent books of the series, Lewis deals with fulfilling our destiny with God's plan for our life (The Horse and His Boy); joy in the midst of tempest, with Christ as our conqueror (Prince Caspian); how we can be influenced by a future eternity if our hearts are set toward heaven (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader); a victorious hope against death with our resurrection (The Silver Chair); and the coming Armageddon and return of Jesus Christ and the new heaven and earth (The Last Battle). This all makes compelling reading, when you consider the hopelessness and misdirected avenues taken in sagas such as the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, which are sword and sorcery without any redeeming values.The story is very simple. Four children, Peter, Lucy, Susan and Edmund, all brothers and sisters, are sent away to a safe house in the English countryside to avoid the WW2 blitz in London. A friendly Professor takes them in. they explore the huge and strange house they are in and accidentally discover a magical passageway into a frozen world full of odd creatures. Lucy first falls through the doors of a wardrobe in one of the rooms, and discovers the world of Narnia. The others follow soon thereafter, and are soon involved in the mystery of this place. They get to meet Aslan, the lion king of Narnia, who has returned to reclaim his kingdom from the wicked White Witch. A sacrifice is made and a battle or two is fought, and Narnia is saved. This is plainly the good vs evil of the gospel accounts of the Christian Bible.Aslan (surely the original \`lion king') is a type of Christ, right up to his sacrificial death at the hands of the witch (Satan). Lewis wastes no time about fine details but carries his young characters right along briskly from scene to scene. I was a bit put off by the appearance of the character of Father Christmas and his reindeer and sleigh and gifts (a type of Santa) but at least Lewis had the courtesy to have this jolly guy praise the king (Aslan) as the real power of giving and love and joy. The entire story is chock-block full of Christian typology, in spite of many critics thinking otherwise. Lewis was perhaps the last century's best and most loved Christian apologist, and he has given the world of youth something very moralistic and divine to sink their teeth into here.I have no doubt that I will read the others sometime. I was prompted to read this one now because there is a very recent movie release based on this particular book, and I want to see it as well. The movie versions of the world of Narnia which were done before were effective in their day, including an animated TV series. The British are experts at this sort of thing. There are even Bible study courses using the characters in this enduring book series. The website ChristianityToday.com offers a lot of help in that direction. Walden Media, a division of Walt Disney Pictures, has produced the latest version of this story in full feature mode, and it is directed by Andrew Adamson, who also directed the previously successful and popular movies Shrek and Shrek II. While the movie audiences of the world seem to be on a quest for mythological escapism at the theaters, there isn't a great deal there of intelligent design or of upright moral teachings. This is a refreshing difference, and the old saying that \\"the book is usually better\\" is still very true in this age of computer-generated images and highly paid actors.I have never been a fan of science fantasy or any of the plethora of sword & sorcery literature out there - I've rarely seen the sense of it all. But if good themes and morals can be portrayed in an entertaining and different way, I will pay attention. While Tolkein's Lord of the Ring series bored me to no end (movies included) and while Harry Potter or the Wizard of Oz or the uncounted TV series which barf out those constant and stilted tales of witches and ghosts and phantom warriors and occultic happenstances, a series like this, composed by someone I personally consider to be the most capable writer in the English languange of the past century, is a treat in every way. An older child-centered adventure that is slow but more appealing is The Princess and the Goblin by George Macdonald, who was an important influence on Lewis."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a great book for people of all ages.

Even though this is the second book in a series of seven, it can be read without reading the The Magicians Nephew, which is a magnificent book also.

So do you want to read a great adventurous book? If you do then The Chronicles of Narnia is the right book for you. There are four kids [peter (oldest), Susan, Edmond, and Lucy (youngest)] who have to leave their home in London because there are air raids. So they have to get on a train and go to a place far away from their home. They go to a house in the country where a professor lives and the professor has a house keeper. When the kid's get there the house keeper makes many rules for them and the most important rule that the house keeper made sure they heard was \\"don't bother the professor!\\" While they were playing one day they find a magical wardrobe that leads to a mystery land called Narnia, while in Narnia siblings have to learn to trust and believe in them selves and in others in order to get through Narnia. Ultimately Edmond is tricked by the white witch and leaves his brother and sisters. They must rescue him, but how can three kids defeat a powerful and mystical witch?The Chronicles of Narnia is a book for everyone. It has a great adventure and once you start reading it you're hooked. The whole book is basically a rising action as each page gets better. It also has some action and a little magic. It has a lot of different creatures. With a very creative story, this book is fiction and fantasy.The Chronicles of Narnia is really similar to the movie version of The Chronicles of Narnia. The book just has a lot more description than the movie. For example: in the book they tell the setting everywhere and when they get to the beavers house they describe everything and in the movie they just show the house while they are walking into it. They both make a good picture in your mind. They both have the same characters.There are no weaknesses and nothing I didn't like about the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book makes you wonder what is going to happen next, example there is never a slow boring part. The book is always moving and it feels like you are moving with it or in it. It is great all the way to the end. In conclusion this book will blow your mind. A never ending adventure that takes you with it. Full of action waiting to happen, when you pick it up and start reading it you won't want to put it down. Even if you don't like to read you will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"For a few years I tossed around the idea of reading this children's fantasy novel and finally took the plunge after hearing a speaker at our fellowship talk about it last month. Fiction is not my cup of tea, but if there is anyone who could give me a taste for it, C.S. Lewis would be the one. Several years ago I read Lewis' classic, Mere Christianity, and I have had a growing interest in reading his fictional piece, The Screwtape Letters. I decided to read roughly a chapter a night to my girls who have seen both the BBC and Disney versions of the movie. It was a little difficult for Grace, my four year old, to always follow the story, but Rose, my seven year old, enjoyed hearing about the secret land beyond the wardrobe. Upon completion of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, both Rose and Grace have expressed on one more than one occasion their disappointment that I am not continuing on with Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia, the second of seven books in The Chronicles of Narnia series. Although I do not plan on reading more fiction anytime soon, I think there is a good possibility we will continue these adventures in the land of Narnia one day."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"My edition of this book is subtitled \\" Book 1 in the chronicles of Narnia\\". Interestingly the author wanted this book read after \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" where he details how the lion Aslan created Narnia and gave the gift of speech to its animals. I mention this fact since many readers have access to the seven Narnia books and may wish to read \\"Nephew\\" first. Of course I am assuming you are reading these comments BEFORE you read the books!In any event \\"Wardrobe\\" introduced us to the Pevensie children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Who travel to the land of Narnia by entering and exiting a \\"magic\\" wardrobe in the attic of an old Professor. It is not my intent in these short comments to summarize the entire story, after all discovering the delights therein are one of the prime pleasures in reading. One of the pleasures for this reader was the illustration at the beginning of each chapter by Pauline Baynes."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"It is a beautiful set. The box is beautiful and I love that the CD's are separated into 4. Micheal York narrates and he tells a beautiful story. It was shipped quickly and came in excellent condition. A wonderful asset to my classroom."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book still had all of the wonder and magic that it had for me when I was a kid. In fact, the book probably means more to me now then it did then. Because now I can understand all the various undertones of the story. When I first read the book I was too young to understand all that was going on under the surface of the main plot. So, to be able to see and digest all the many layers made the book more rewarding and enjoyable. This is a great series and I plan on re-reading the rest of the books at some point.[...]."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I read the Narnia books for the first time when I was about 12/13 yrs old. I loved them! Couldn't put them down. After the first Narnia movie came out, I decided to buy them all hardbound to re-read and keep for the kids. They still read great. Even if you aren't a Christian, I wasn't when I read them the first time, the stories are a wonderful picture of fantasy intermingled with a light morality play. If you are a Christian, you'll also love the symbolism behind Aslan (Jesus) and the White Witch (Satan). If you are 10 or 110, you'll love these books and could read them over and over and over again."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is a true children's classic. I thought it was much better than The Magician's Nephew. One of the things I enjoyed about this book was the very Tolkien like feel it had (although definitely aimed at a much younger audience). I really thought I'd be turned off by all of the Christian symbolism (and this does seem to me to be a biblical allegory), but I wasn't. I felt it was a great, well told story with some wonderful underlying messages."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Narnia is a series of books that reflect on the maturing of children's spirits into adulthood.

The paths taken by each character in these books give the reader a chance to choose which one he or she will take in real life.The Path into Healing"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is an awesome fantasy book that begins with four kids going away to a Professors house. They find a magic wardrobe that has a world called Narnia inside it. The four kids wonder into the wardrobe and find many strange creatures that help them during their various adventures.In the book there are two sides: Good and Evil. Edmund (the second youngest) turns to the bad side with the White Witch. The other three (Peter, Susan, and Lucy) are on the good side with the great Lion, Aslan. There is an ongoing battle between the two sides throughout the book.I loved the book and would give it four and a half stars out of five stars. This is the second book in the Chronicles of Narnia series. Which book you read first, doesn't matter. I would recommend it to any fantasy readers, boys or girls. I think this is a really great book and you should try to read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Here are two meanings I got out of the first book. The first meaning i saw was an awesome and well detailed magical story. I saw this to be fun to read. A great story, and that I had something to look forward to, because it is a series. Then I found a out the movie was coming out. My brother mentioned something to me about the meaning behind the book. This is to share Jesus Christ, and show what he did in many different ways. Aslan is supposed to represent Jesus Christ as some might know. Then other people are supposed to represent different things. It shows Aslan dying for the sins the prince made, then raising from the dead. Sound familiar to someone? There were also tons more metaphors relating to christianity. Like the evil witch representing the devil in some parts. First of all, the which is always taunting the lion(Jesus Christ). Also the queen tempting the prince into things like turkish delite, over the love for eachother. Those are just some of the ways i believe the book relates. There are many other things you can get out of the book. If you didn't know some of this, then don't hold back from reading your child the book, because of some of the relations. It is another great title from C.S. Lewis. I hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I have read this story several times in my life however i never wrote a review. I recently read the book again because the movie was coming out and i wanted to see how well the movie tied into the book.This is simply a wonderful book and a very quick and easy read. Please do not be discouraged from reading this book because of the possible Christian references. Whether you are a believer or not you can fully enjoy this fictional tale.The book is full of fantasy creatures, heros and enemies that will leave you smiling at the pure genius of how it all comes together. I have always enjoyed this book and will probably read this book a few more times over the course of my lifetime.Take some time and read this book before seeing the movie, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"My father read this story to me as a child. I was only lucky enough to get a chapter each night. I remember wanting more. Wanting the story to be read faster. Reading it now, years later, I'm impressed with how it still captivates me. This story is about four children who move into a large house away from their family. While playing hide-and-seek one rainy day they find a wardrobe that takes them to a magical land, Narnia. In Narnia they learn of an evil White Witch that has caused it to be winter all the time. The children, work with the lion king to try and restore some order to Narnia. This is a perfect story for adults and children alike!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I'm 28 and, sadly, this is the first time I have read this book. I am ashamed myself. But with the movie coming out,I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. It was an extremely quick read...a couple hours is all it took and well worth the time. I am not a fan of fantasy but this book was a cute book...CS Lewis has yet to let me down."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Any child or adult would sit up straight to hear the story of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from start to finish. Mr. Lewis had the talent of capturing readers' attention especially children's then grasping their interest throughout a whole story. This tale is drolly told right through the entire book. It is a gripping adventure taken by four siblings who are actually eagerly anticipated by beings in another world. There are entities of rivalry, greed, betray, merriment, kindness, magic, and triumph for each person's enjoyment. Although the end is too fantastic that amnesia or giddiness might have been the cause for the four children's forgetfulness of their origin, the immensely entertaining technique of narration overcomes the poor conclusion."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The story, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, features four children displaced from their home in London due to violence of WWII to a remote country cottage. Upon arriving to their caretaker's cottage they explored the odd rooms and furniture. To eliminate their boredom, they decided to play hide-and-go-seed. This is when the youngest, Lucy, hides in the wardrobe and stumbles across the land called Narnia. The snowy land of Narnia is filled with all types of little creatures like fauns, dwarfs, and beavers, but the land of Narnia also has one White Witch, who calls herself the Queen of Narnia.The four children don't realize that they are the ones who can stop the White Witch and save Narnia from the Winter Wonderland that the witch has cast upon it. With the help of a lion named Aslan they over throw the witch and Narnia has all different seasons all over again. All of the animals live in peace and harmony after the reign of the White Witch is over.This story is written for one who enjoys adventure and likes to have fun. On a scale from 1-5 I would rate it a 4 because it's one of those books that you can't put down once you start to read it. It's a children's book even though some adults enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"If you are familiar with Lewis' non-fiction writings (Mere Christianity, etc.) were all that Lewis had written he would have left a wonderful legacy. However, Lewis has a large library of fictional works as well.'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is my only my second piece of Lewis fiction (the other being 'The Screwtape Letters') and I found it to be a quick, enjoyable read. The characters are likeable but sketchy, but that is understandable considering that he intended it to be a fairy tale. How much character development is there in a fairy tale?Christian themes are very strong throughout the book, but the story can be read without any previous study into Christianity. If you are unsure of the themes or want to make sure that you are not missing any, I would recommend that you pick up any of the half-dozen or more companion study guides that Amazon offers."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Lewis is amazing in many respects, one of the reasons is his ability to adapt to his audience that he is writing to. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an amazing extension of who Lewis was. The book itself is seamless and flows from beginning to end. Lewis creates characters that are real and fun, leaving you able to become involved with the story.Aslan is a great hero, evoking a strong and protective, just and right lion who is the people's champion. Throw in the evil white witch and some naive Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve and you have a tale worth reading. The ending is very clever (especially since Lewis foreshadowed it) as Aslan brings an army to the battlefield.Don't get me wrong. Lewis says it in his opening acknowledgment. This is a fairy tale meant for children, or for an adult willing to sit down and enjoy a fairy tale, for that is what it is. Don't mistake this for a full blown fantasy series and book. The descriptions are short and concise, the characters are black and white, and the outcome is fun. That being said, there is no reason why this book, or series, cannot be enjoyed by an adult. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially to be read before the movie."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis really did a great job in creating a world known as Narnia. A little background on Narnia: Narnia is a place stuck in a winter that is never ending, it is \\"ruled\\" by the White Witch. There is only winter and no Christmas. There are many, many creatures in the land of Narnia.The book starts when 4 kids are shipped to a professors mansion during the times of WWII. They are told not to disturb the professor. They pretty much have the huge house to themselves, so there is much mischief that they can get into. Well Lucy, the youngest of the 4 one day stumbles upon a wardrobe. She enters into it, but there is not a back to the wardrobe and it leads to Narnia. She meets a creature called a Faun. He is actually a creature that is supposed to be telling the White Witch that a human entered Narnia.She gets back and her brothers and sisters don't believe her. Nevertheless later in the book they all end up in Narnia, and are stunned that Lucy had been telling the truth the whole time.The meet many creatures along the way. They meet with a Beaver and his wife and they are told of the White Witch, Aslan (a lion who the White Witch fears), and the prophecy that they would be fulfilling.Well one of the four, Edmund takes off after the White Witches palace, because they had meet before and she gave him something to eat.Aslan ends up putting down his life for Edmund after he supposedly betrays the White Witch. This is a parallel to Jesus Christ. Many other Christian thems take place after this, and I don't want to reveal them for they are amazing.Note that this book is highly recommended by me. It has a ton of Christian themes, and it takes you to a fantasy land that is amazing to me. You should definitely get this book, it's for all ages!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"i think the book was good for all ages because anyone can connect to it and the movie is pretty true to the book!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"With The Chronicles of Narnia C.S.

Soon a lion named Aslan arrives and brings spring with him and the power to bring stoned people back to life. Ultimately, Aslan kills the witch and the four children become kings and queens of Narnia. It is a quick, effortless read that is entertaining. Once you start you will not want to put the book down.

Lewis, teaches biblical messages through a dramatic and intriguing plot. It all begins in WWII when a mother sends her four children off to the country to live with a professor for safety. The children were very curious and often spent hours playing hide and go seek, which lead to them discovering many new rooms and parts of the mansion. One day the youngest girl, Lucy, hid in a coat wardrobe. She walked to the very back of the closet where she revealed a new land. It was snowing and right away she discovered an odd creature. Lucy eventually went back through the wardrobe and tried to explain her discoveries to her brothers and sisters but none of them believed her. Finally Lucy was given the opportunity to prove her tale and her siblings peter, Edmund and Susan followed. Once they all entered the land they were told by a creature named Tumnus that the queen would want to kill them if she ever found them. This is because they were human and threatened her power. The rest of the novel is a biblical parallel to basics tenants of Christianity. The good and evil were always at war and at one point the Lion was slain. He rose from the dead and was able to overthrow evil. This is directly related to what the bible teaches. I believe this a great story. At a young age it has a fascinating plot with magical creatures and a powerful ending. At a more mature age is has vast symbolism that still allows for an easy read, without lacking in complexity. I think the characters in the new land are remotely bizarre but I enjoyed that if left me wondering about their personality because it lacks the usual stereotypes that are often placed on everyday characters. I couldn't tell whether the character was sympathetic or an antagonistic until I kept reading. Overall I highly suggest reading this book. When the final page is read it will leave you thinking. It's a quick read with deep meaning."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"For my book I read the Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I thouhgt it was a very intersting book.

There was something unusual found in the back of the wardrobe. It was another world called Narnia. Lucy made some friends and so did her symbolings. One of there frinds got in trouble.

Lewis, and the theme is never give up on a good cause. The story's about a family of four young Londoners being sent away by their parents to the countryside mansion of a professor to escape the German bombing of London. Soon after arriving at the mansion,Lucy (one of the children) discovers a magical wardrobe that leads to a place called Narnia. She convinces the other three (Edmund, Susan, and Peter) to come with her, and from there their adventures start. The story begins at the Professor's mansion. While exploring the mansion during a Hide-and Seek game, Lucy finds a spare room with a wardrobe in it. She goes into it, finds another world, (Narnia) and meets Mr. Tumnus, a faun who lives in Narnia. After leaving Narnia, she goes back to the real world and after a lot of trouble, convinces the others to come, too. Upon arrival, they learn that there's an evil witch controlling Narnia with eternal winter, and that she's ransacked Mr. Tumnus's house because she let Lucy escape. They make their way to a beaver dam, and learn from Mr. and Mrs. Beaver that the true king of Narnia, a lion named Aslan, has returned to depose the White Witch and restore spring. With the beavers, they set out to reach Aslan. they learn that a prophecy says that they four must fill the four thrones at a castle called Cair Paravel and rule Narnia, but all four must be there and they need Aslan's help to depose the white witch. That's more, Edmund had already seen the \\"Queen\\" and snuck away from the beaver's dam to alert her. He quickly realizes his bad choice, and wants to reunite with his siblings. Will they reunite with each other and Aslan to depose the Witch?

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"We all know this story, and how exciting and stirring it is. But hearing this dramatic and well-produced reading adds a wholly new dimension to the overall experience. The inspired choice of Michael York allows the story to unfold before your very eyes, as he paces his voice comfortably enough to make you follow along and be excited at the same time. The reading may take a long time, but York never sinks into a monotonous tone, and he also gives each character personality and depth. Particularly tellig is his satanic characterisation of the White Witch. He also avoids the tendency to make the children sound too cue or whiney. To sum everything up, this reading will be sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of anyone who listens to it, and will surely be prized highly in any Narnia lover's collection and also by those who have never heard of the Narnia stories."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a story by C.S.

In Narnia the four children are swept into one adventure after another while they try to destroy the evil White Witch so that spring will return to Narnia.Narnia is a wonderful, imaginative story that I highly recommend to children and adults of all ages. I loved all the adventure in this book and the magical creatures that they meet. I thought the children were vivid, believable characters, and I think you will find yourself cheering them on throughout their adventures. I feel that anyone who takes the time to read this book will find the ending extremely satisfying and will probably want to jump right into the third book of the Narnia series.In conclusion I give this book four stars. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars was because it was slowly paced near the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the beginning of theland of Narnia for readers here in our world. The name itself evokessymbols that mean almost as much in our culture as Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow.Reading this book is a lovely gift to make to your children, or to yourself. Lewis draws powerfully on our childhood desire to find ourselves in a fantasy land. The story of Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund being transported into Narnia makes all of think of our own childhoods in a powerful way.And from that power, Lewis can draw on the naivite and newness of children to approach faith and love and the values that accompany them. We see the very basic sin of Edmund as he betrays his siblings for just one more piece of Turkish Delight. And, so movingly, we witness his forgiveness and the love of the Lion for this one boy.Lewis disagreed with the term &quot;allegory&quot; being applied to his Narnia tales. He felt that an allegory provides tangibility to intangible values and he felt his Narnia stories deal with things that are real in our world already. He wanted to show how people might come to God if they didn't have all the baggage and preconception that &quot;our world&quot; loads on top of religious feeling.No matter how much you're reading into this book, it's a piece of magic and not to be missed. Reading it to a child will give it an even stronger place in the life of that person. Not many things mean as much to me as thoughts of the Lantern, Mr. Tumnus, the Stone Table and Lucy. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was read to me as a child and it will always be a dear, dear book to me."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Having a story that is as well rounded and deeply plotted as this, especially when we're talking about a children's story, is a feat indeed. In this respect, and in many others, C.S. Lewis as done a remarkably excellent job. The Christian morals and principles that it teaches are an excellent addition to the story, and reflect greatly off of the man who wove this story into being. Aside from being very good literature, children should also read it for the lessons that it teaches. Perseverance in the face of fear, trust in God, and love for those around you.Sadly, as so many have pointed out, few children get to experience the emotional vividness, and compelling plot line of this fairytale now a days. In addition to &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, there are six other books in the &quot;Tales of Narnia&quot; series. My advice to parents is to read all of these to your children, or, if your kids are old enough, have them read them on their own. Everybody should read the series at least one time, and if you haven't, your missing a great piece of American literature.It's still amazing to me that all of these thoughts and concepts came from one man's head, and that through the God given gift of words, C.S. Lewis changed the lives of millions."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"*The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* begins the enchanting series of Narnia books as, in a game of hide and seek, intrepid Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and into Narnia -- a delightful world of dryads and fauns and dwarves and animals that talk. Lucy finds, however, that as things stand, Narnia is a land of perpetual winter ruled over by an evil witch. Worse, even though it's always winter, it's never Christmas (note allegorical material beginning to rise to the surface). Lucy must return to her house, convince her brothers (especially the aptly named Peter) and sister that Narnia actually exists, and, with the help of Aslan, the great lion, defeat the witch and bring spring back to the land. She has her work cut out for her.As readers, so do many of us. For in this most delicate and charming and gemlike of books, C.S. Lewis has planted as heavy-handed an allegory as anything Edmund Spenser wrote in *The Faerie Queene*. Lucy, as her name denotes, brings &quot;light&quot; to Narnia and England. Aslan is Christ. Narnia is the postlapsarian world. Aslan (Christ) must, according to the rules of the Emperor-over-the-sea (God), die so that Lucy's brother, Edmund, (the sinner) can be saved (Saved). After his death, Aslan comes back to life (is resurrected) and defeats the witch (temptation/the devil). Through the spilling of his blood (Blood) all of Narnia is renewed (finds grace). If your religious beliefs compell you to point this not-so-deep meaning out to your own children, then do so, but please don't spread the word. When teaching this book in a college-level course on Children's Literature, I have too many times seen the years of joy this book has given my students quenched by my Outing Of The Allegory. This quenching is nondenominational.What I write now would not bring joy to C.S. Lewis, but the true miracle of the Narnia series, to this reviewer, lies in its astonishing ability to survive its own allegory. On the literal level, these books are marvelous: they are invigorating, heady, filled with heroism and magic, great deeds and quests. They should not be missed by children of any faith. My two sons love the series, and, frankly, as far as the hidden meaning is concerned, I dread the day that they are finally old enough to ask about it, and I am weak enough to tell."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have been sent to live with a professor in the country during the London air-raids. While exploring the large house, Lucy finds that the wardrobe in the spare room transports her to the magical land of Narnia. The country is under the spell of a terrible witch who has made it always winter but never Christmas. At first, her siblings don't believe her, but soon they, too, find themselves in this new country. With danger around every turn, they must survive treachery to join Aslan the lion in the fight to free Narnia and break the spell.I read this book for the first time in third grade, and it holds up just as well today. The pace of the writing is a bit slow, but the adventure is sure to hook readers. Lewis creates a wonderful fanciful world that is lots of fun to visit. This is the first I read and still my favorite. There's something about this book that captures the wonder of finding a new, magical world that the other books don't have.Lewis also created just the right spell for his land to horrify kids and to a lesser extend adults. The idea of always having winter and all it brings but never getting to celebrate Christmas is too awful to mention.A brief word about book order. When I read this book, it was considered the first in the series. Now, some people have put the books in chronological order, making it the second. While I fell that reading them in the original order is the best approach, it really doesn't matter that much. Nothing about the other books is spoiled here since this was the first one written, but not much about this book is spoiled if you read them in the order events occur.Narnia is one of several classic kids' series about mythical countries and is still my favorite. It's perfect for anyone wanting to leave our world behind for a touch of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I could not find my paper copy of this book and I wanted to read to my children.

But these spiritual truths are conveyed more by Biblical allusions than by rigid allegory.\\"This statement is absolutely correct. While I was reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, it sounded like I was reading the bible. Aslan, symbolizes God, and the White Witch symbolizes Satin. When Aslan gets stabbed at the Stone Table, it is symbolizing Jesus dying on the cross, and when the lion comes back to life, it is symbolizing the Resurrection.C.S Lewis' use of symbolism does not make The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe a better story. Some people may think that symbolism makes it good, I think it makes it worse. If a person wanted to read about that, they could just read the bible. C.S Lewis should have incorporated more of his own ideas into the storyline.There are a lot of good things going for this book. There are interesting characters, good conflicts, and good detail about the scenery. I just think that C.S. got carried away with symbolism."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe is about four children whose names are Peter,Susan, Edmund and Lucy.

The professor had strict rules about the house such as what not to do and where you shouldn't go. While they were at his house they decided to play hide and go seek in the house. When the youngest child Lucy decided to hide in one of the forbidden rooms, which had nothing but a large figure with a sheet over it. Lucy wanted to see what it was so she took off the sheet to find a beautiful wardrobe laying there in front of her. She decided to hide inside of it and when she opened it she found something amazing inside of the wardrobe.Which is what leads to the whole adventure of the four children.The Lion, The Witch, and The wardrobe is a great book for people who love fantasy or Lord of The Rings.

I look forward to reading the other tales of Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children, is written in a style accessible to children, or that has a narrative voice that is speaking as to children a &quot;children's book&quot;, and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults. When they do so, they often miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available. This book, and the others in this series, fall into that category, just as do &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkein, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, by James Barrie, and &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot; by Lewis Carroll, among others.This book is a delightful story, even if as a non-Christian I did find the Christian symbolism a bit heavy-handed. (The blood-sacrifice and ressurrection of the character intended as a Christ-figure was a bit much.) But even so, and in spite of a couple of minor quibbles, this book still was unquestionably a five-star delight. For those who don't have my level of discomfort with Christian symbology, it should be even more enjoyable. Certainly, if you have children, they should enjoy this story, but even if you don't, don't fail to read it for yourself. It's well worth the attention of an adult."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"When C.S.Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia, this was the first tale that he produced and not \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". There is a problem with ordering the books other than in the way that Lewis published them primarily due to the fact that the mystery of Narnia is better revealed when you read the books in this way. The reader is meant to \\"discover\\" Narnia as the children in Lewis' classic tales do.What makes these books so powerful is not necessarily the message of Christian Dogma that Lewis spent his life analyzing and lecturing on, but the incredible gift of story telling that Lewis possessed. Lewis had the ability to make the people, places, and things that he wrote about come alive and leap off the page. While reading about the fine feast served at the last stop before reaching the end of the world (in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader)one can almost taste it. One can almost see the heavy smoke curling down out of Puddleglum's pipe in \\"The Silver Chair\\", or feel as if you are actually taking tea with Tumnus in \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".I view the Chronicles of Narnia as classics of Children's Literature and something that should be apart of the reading list of any child as they reach the fourth or fifth grade. Even adults will find them to be facinating reading. Of all the works that Lewis produced fiction or non-fiction, I feel that these are the works that he will be best remembered for."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardobe is a very good book.

This book is second in a series called &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, which happens to be one of the only children's stories written by C.S. Lewis. Lewis was famous for his Christian writings, which holds evident is this book for he relates to the story of Jesus Christ throughout it's entire theme. This is done through the symbolism of many of the characters (Alsan to Jesus; the White Witch to Satan) and themes (good vs. evil). These observations may not be evident to children, but it makes an excellent reading for them and adults alike. Aside from the symbolism, the story is timeless and magical as it lets a child's imagination wander and sparks the child within us."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this book when I was about six and I have loved it so much that I have read it about eight times. This book has been a great wonderful escape to a whole new world full of fantasy each time I read it. I am a sixteen year old girl that has loved this book for as long as I can remember. I always wanted to have the same great adventures that the four children had in Narnia. This book is highly recommended for children and adults alike. I intend to read the book many more times to come. It is a book that never seizes to capture my imagination."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a book I read a number of years ago and I still pick it up every now and then. Lewis' story is a classic tale that transports the reader into its pages. I can clearly remember the days when I would climb into my own wardrobe hoping to hear the crunching of snow under my feet, or see the faint glow of a lamp-post in the distance. [admittedly this was only ten years ago!] I recommend the 'Narnia' series to anyone of any age group. 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was one of my very favourites, as was 'The Voyage of the Dawntreader'. I hope others who buy this book will get as much enjoyment from it and the rest of the series as I did."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I have read this book a few times before, but this time, I have come to notice new things that I had never seen before, which truly showed the brilliance of Lewis in weaving the reality of life in a fantasy story. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe continues from The Magician's Nephew where the wardrobe that Digory (who became the Professor) made a wardrobe out of the tree he had planted from the core of the Apple (which was used to heal Digory's mother) from Narnia. Aslan, the Lion, is the parallel of Jesus Christ, and the With parallels Satan. In this, shows the epic struggle to save the life of Edmund who had become a traitor.One area that jumped out was the parallels between sin and the Turkish Delight that Edmund ate. When the witch asked what Edmund wanted, he told her that he wanted Turkish Delight, and that desire for Turkish Delight was already in Edmund, just like the sinful nature of human beings. The Witch just fed the sinful nature, and it was written of the enchanted Turkish Delight that \\"anyone who had tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go one eating it till they killed themselves.\\" When we feed our sinful nature, we would keep craving for more, even though we feel the ill effects of it (like Edmund did), and soon become enslaved to it that we could even consume it till it kills us. This is one of the profound truths that Lewis was communicating through the story.Also, the way Edmund reacted is so much like that of one who did not know the Savior, like how he had reasoned that the Witch was not so bad and the others may actually be the enemy, but all the time being enslaved to the need to have more Turkish Delight. The bondage was so strong that the taste of a good and decent meal was not satisfactory, as his mind kept thinking of the Turkish Delight. Also, when the 4 children were told of Aslan, Peter, Susan and Lucy felt positive things, but Edmund felt \\"a sensation of mysterious horror.\\" In light of the sin that Edmund had committed, being in the presence of Aslan would send a fear because of the reality of judgment for one's sin.Another area that was brilliant reveals our mind set towards the spiritual (for this case the world of Narnia) where Peter and Susan did not belive Lucy even though she was the honest one. The discourse with the Professor was a similar logic that can be applied to Jesus Christ, that if Jesus is telling the truth, then He is God, and if not, He is either a lunatic or a liar. Historically, He was not called a lunatic or a liar, so Jesus has to be God!This is a story brilliantly written, and I would likely pick it up some years from now to have a read again and see what gems Lewis had hidden in his writings."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Hi. ...I am here to talk about The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is the beginning of the book to start you off. It is about Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edmund. They all have to move because of World War II to their grandpa&#65533;s house. He is a professor. When they get there, they decide to look around and they come across a wardrobe. Lucy decides to go in, and when she reaches her arm through, she feels a pine tree. She goes through and enters Narnia. She meets Mr. Tumnus, a fawn. He brings her back to his house and cozies her up and she falls asleep. When she wakes up, Mr. Tumnus is crying because he was working for the bad white witch. That&#65533;s all I will tell you about the beginning of the book.You meet lots of other characters like Aslam, the lion. He is practically the main character and he almost dies. At the end there is a big war, but I can&#65533;t tell you who wins. You&#65533;ll have to read it for yourself.

Lewis popular children's fantasy series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". It is not the first of the series chronologically, but the second, and although there is much debate over whether one should read the books in the order that they were written or the order in which they take place, I cast my vote for order of writing or publication, with \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" first. The books refer to one another, which makes reading them in order of publication seem more natural -and more desirable, as it also prevents too much from being revealed too soon. The mysteries of the back-story help sustain readers' interests, which might otherwise wane, for the duration of 7 books.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is a fairy tale about brave and honorable children in a magical land. Four siblings -Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy- are sent to the country home of a kindly old Professor to escape the London air raids during World War II. One day Lucy, the youngest, steps into a big old wardrobe, lured by the cuddly fur coats hanging inside. Stepping farther and farther into the wardrobe, past where the back of it should be, Lucy finds herself in a snow-covered forest in a strange land called Narnia, where human children are a rarity. She returns to the house full of excitement, but her brothers and sister don't believer her incredible story. But when all 4 youngsters pile into the wardrobe, trying to evade the housekeeper Mrs. Macready, they are transported to Narnia and find themselves key figures in a fight to free Narnia from the oppressive reign of the White Witch.When I read \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as a child, I found it too simplistic. Reading the book again as an adult, I realize that the problem was that I was too old. I discovered \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" when I was about 10 years old and already captivated by the more sophisticated Tolkien fantasy books. \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are written in a rudimentary style with two-dimensional characters. \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" seems hastily constructed with awkward dialogue and long passages dedicated to insignificant scenes while major events are made incidental. (Lewis' writing style improved in subsequent books.) These books are fairy tales intended for young children. The difficulty is that they are probably too young to read them. But if your kids like to be read to, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are an good choice. I've never met a child who didn't like to hear stories of children who are important, independent, and take control of their own lives. Biblical allegory and morality plays notwithstanding, I think that is why Narnia appeals to children."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This Item was described as hard back It was not. I sent it back. I got a full refund. The book is good reading. I would recommend it. If you don't mind paperback buy it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This had more charm than I remember from 4th grade, but I still take issue with a few plot points. \\"Ha ha, I win because of deep magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" \\"Oh, yeah, well, ha ha, I win because of even deeper magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" It's almost like Aslan and the White Witch are playing Calvinball. I realize Lewis needed these kinds of plot devices to make the allegory work, but would it have killed Lewis to throw in a little foreshadowing? He foreshadowed other things. It was within his power.The saddest thing about this for me is that there's a nice little adventure story buried under the deus ex machina plot mechanisms. At least there could have been. Perhaps a different author would have sent the characters to find their accoutrement (Peter's sword, Lucy's cordial, Susan's bow--which she never used, I'd like to point out). But Lewis decided to play the Santa Clause card, because... well... I have no idea. I had to keep reminding myself that this was only a children's book, and perhaps it would have been more dramatic if it had been written with an older audience in mind. The moments of narrative tension evaporate quickly. Most of the crucial battle takes place off-screen. The only characters with any development at all are Lucy and Edmund. Peter's supposed to be the hero, but he barely has any screen time. And I realize it was written in the 50's, but is it necessary to constantly break the 4th wall?Oh, and can I take a moment to complain about the professor? I can only assume that he's a Mary Sue for Lewis, and yet he's this jolly, one-dimensional deified beacon of anti-intellectualism. GRR!!!Okay, I've griped. LWW is at least fun and imaginative. And while the main machinations of the plot are transparent allegories for Christianity, they're at least not oppressive. The story is allowed to breathe a little underneath them and develop its own personality. I rather liked that the book has a sense of awe and wonder about itself, and while I can criticize it for being far too brief for its scope, I can just as easily criticize J.R.R. Tolkien for the pointless ramble that is the first six chapters or so of The Fellowship of the Ring. It was a different time and new genre, nobody knew what they were doing. LWW is mercifully short, colorful, engaging, and very accessible, for all its foibles. I guess that makes Lewis the anti-Tolkien, now that I think about it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I'm 21 years old and I picked this book up because I had never read it as a child and wanted to read it before I saw the movie. It is a very short book and I am pretty sure I read the book in less time then it took me to watch the movie. Most younger readers will not have a problem with this one and it is entertaining enough to keep them reading until the end.The story seemed kind choppy to me and there was very little character development. However, this is only the first of the chronicles of narnia and I've heard the the other books are better and since they involve the same characters there is bound to be more development. I think I might have just been to old when I read this book.If you're looking to get your young reader into novels then this might be a good introduction. Then they can continue with the rest of the series. If you're looking for something entertaining for your 14+ year old, this isn't it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeBy C.S. LewisHarperTrophyIn a room of the Professor's house stands a wardrobe of coats and something more, something that was destined to be discovered by teh youngest of four children, Lucy Pevensie, while exploring the house. Lucy and her siblings, Peter, Susan, and Edmund, explore the land inside the wardrobe; the land of Narnia, frozen in eternal winter by the White Witch, a land that is waiting to be set free as the prophecy says. However, after over 100 years of winter, the creatures have lost almost all hope, but the return of the Great Lion, Aslan, and the appearence of the four children causes a great change, a betrayal, a great sacrifice, and a great war thast will decide the future of Narnia and all of its creatures.The four Pevensies are very curious children. Little did they know, they had a huge part in the freedom of Narnia. Their arrival signaled the return of Aslan, the end of winter, and the beginning of spring. Peter is the oldest of the four, then Susan, Edmund, and at last Lucy. Peter tries to act like their father (who was probably sent out to war) while Susan tries to act like their mother (who is back at their home in London). Edmund is greedy and even betrayed his siblings to the witch for power that wasn't real. Lucy is very curious and truthful. She has never told a lie. Although the first impression of Aslan is terrifying, this lion is quite gentle, kind, caring, and brave. He is greater that any other lion in Narnia. He has a lovely golden mane and great, royal, solemn, overwhlming eyes. Aslan was there before the dawn of time (this is a fact that will save his life). The Great Lion is the enemy of Jadis, the White Witch. The White Witch is the last Queen of Charn. Jadis has had Narnia under her control for over 100 years. She is as white as snow and has a very red mouth. The White Witch wears a golden crown on the top of her head and carries a long straight, golden wand in her right hand. This witch has a heart as cold as ice and turns creatures to stone with her golden wand. She is truly the evil creature of the story.This story is very magical and curious. I think this because in the story, Lucy discovers the wardrobe out of plain curiosity and the story gets more curious as you read on. I would also describe this story as magical because it is about a fictional world of fantasy. This book has a fantasy genre. I like this genre because is this book, there is a lot of mystical events which helps good triumph over evil. I recommend this book to children in grades three through five. It is truly a wonderful book, but I think that it is too easy for sixth and seventh graders. Third grade is mostly whne children start reading short chapter books a lot and fifth grade is when children usually stop reading short chapter books and start reading longer books. However, if you are a kid at heart and love a good story, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Because it is so spectacular, I'm choosing The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe to be the first book I review here at Amazon. I first fell in love with this story (and the subsequent volumes in the series) when my fifth-grade teacher read it to our class. Though it has been more than a decade since, this book has remained one of my all-time favorite works of literature, and I try to reread it once a year. It has an enchanting effect on the heart, mind and soul that never diminishes.The novel features four British children: Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy (Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) who discover a magical world hidden behind fur coats in a wardrobe. In &quot;Narnia&quot;, they encounter an endless parade of fantastic characters and events that aid them in their quest to free the land of Narnia from the spell of the White Witch. She makes winter a permanent season and turns those who oppose her into stone. The most prominent Narnians are the talking animals, but especially the lion Aslan who, with the children's help, must return spring and benevolent rule to the land.On a more analytical note, I find it fascinating how C.S. Lewis uses allegory to loosely bridge his fictional world with well-known themes and stories from the Bible. You can most easily recognize this in the ever-present battle between good and evil and the symbolic representation of Christ's Resurrection in the guise of Aslan's death and revival on the Stone Table. Which fulfills an &quot;even deeper magic from before the dawn of time.&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a modern classic that should be included in EVERYONE'S library. It will leave you completely satisfied, but at the same time craving more (which can be found in the other six volumes of the Chronicles of Narnia series). Oh, to sit and rule at Cair Paravel while munching on Turkish Delight!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The first of C.S. Lewis' beloved Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is an exciting, emotionally-charged, truly magical story. Filled with beautiful imagery, exciting battles, and heroic sacrifice, the story is a truly mesmerizing work of fiction. Most people have read it when they were very young. However, I didn't read it until recently, at the age of 21. But for me, and possibly others, it took me back to my childhood, when you believed in the magical, and the unseen. That's where the book's power lies. For the young, it is fantastical and new, while for the adults, it takes us back to our younger days.This is a fantastic story that is rightfully called one of the greatest fantasty stories of all time.Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I usually greatly dislike fantasy but I really thought that this novel, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" was interesting. The introduction of this novel was also one of the parts I thought it was interesting because of how the main character enters another part of the world and found that she had a gift. This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has. Instead of using magic like the White Witch does in Narnia, the teenager in, \\"Hatchet\\" gets his resources manually, not magically. Like all fantasy books and adventure books, the protagonists usually find that the have a specialty or a gift. I recommend this book, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" to people who likes magical places, and magical powers. People who read this novel should also like the genre, fantasy with characters that do not exist in real life. I do not recommend this book to people who are not into magical powers, or magical places."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Throughout my teenage years, I was thoroughly entranced by J.R.R. Tolkein's masterful LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and Terry Brooks' exciting SHANNARA series and the brilliant works of Stephen R. Lawhead. But, for some reason, I missed out on C.S. Lewis. I had been told this was a children's book.And then, when I was 17 and going on Summer vacation, I picked up THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE on a lark and began to read it. I couldn't put it down. I literally read it in one sitting, one night. The next day, I rushed out and bought as many of the rest of the NARNIA series as I could find. Sadly, the bookstore in the resort town where I was staying did not have the last two titles. I was desperate! I ordered those titles and put a rush on it. Over the next four days, I read the next four books in the series and kept calling the bookstore to see if my order had come in. At the last second, as I finished book 5 in the series, the final two books arrived, and I devoured them.Since then, I've read THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE many times. Recently, I re-discovered this handsome new edition and enjoyed the story all over again. Is it a children's book? Yes. But it is so much more than that. Many adults and scholars with great learning have had their lives profoundly affected by reading this book. Why?Of course, it is beautifully written by one of the true masters of English literature. The story is captivating--the magical land of Narnia and its mysterious inhabitants are portrayed vividly for us by Lewis. The characters, both the main children and the Narnian creatures, are colorful and entertaining. The \\"good guys\\" are sympathetic and brave, if flawed. There is tremendous humor. And pathos.Aslan the Lion is majestic and awe-inspiring. And the villians here are really villians...the icy witch and her evil minions are truly hateful.Beyond all of that is a powerful and subtle allegory about some of the deeper truths of life that are amazingly compelling and moving. Perhaps more than one reader has had to dab a few tears from their eyes at certain points.It may sound like hype, but I truly believe that everyone should read this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This superb adaptation by Amanda Benjamin of the C. S. Lewis children's classic is available as stand alone book (hardback and paperback) and book and cassette recording read by Nickolas Grace. Birmingham's true-to-life illustrations complement the narrative magnificently and, dare I say it, will stand the test of time equally as well as have the beloved original illustrations by Pauline Baynes. Amanda Benjamin's adaptation of the original story is faithful to the narrative of C. S. Lewis' story. It neither avoids nor sugar-coats the treachery of Edmund, nor the grim event of Aslan's sacrifice. Though not an abrigement, the narrative maintains the joy and thrills and mysterious wonder of the cherished Lewis story.I've 'road tested' this lovely book with my own young niece and nephew (aged 8 and 10) and have had as much enjoyment seeing their excitement and happiness as I got when I first read the story at 11.A first class Christmas or birthday present for any child who enjoys reading, listening to a good story or appreciates beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is the second volume (chronologically) in The Chronicles of Narnia (after The Magician's Nephew, before The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Last Battle).This book takes place during World War II, many years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, and tells the story of four young siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They are exploring the big house of an old Professor (which I'm guessig is Digory from the first book) where they've been sent during the air-raids, when Lucy enters the old wardrobe in en empty room upstairs to hide in it.Only this wardrobe is actually a direct passage to the world of Narnia, and Lucy finds herself in a forest on a snowy night, the only light that of a lamppost. There she meets a Faun named Tumnus, who is indeed very amazed to meet a legendary Human, an invites her to tea. In the cozy warmth of his home, he tells her of the evil White Witch, who is turning everyone who opposes her to stone, and whose spell on Narnia makes it always winter and never Christmas.When Lucy finally gets out of the wood and then out of the wardrobe again, no time has actually passed, and of course, when she tells her story to her brothers and sister, none of them believes her. Edmund in particular likes to make fun of her.On another, rainy day, when they're all playing hide-and-seek in the huge mansion, Edmund decides to hide in the wardrobe and he too finds himself in Narnia. But instead of the Faun, he meets the White Witch, who lures him with Turkish Delight (his favourite sweets) and by making him believe that he can become King if he brings her his brother and sisters.The book then tells the adventures of the four kids in Narnia, meeting a friendly couple of talking badgers and all kinds of other fantastic animals and creatures, among then the powerful Lion King Aslan, and helping them save the world from the evil usurper Queen.Reading the series in the chronological order rather than in the publication order, I found that The Magician's Nephew was actually a kind of spoiler for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I think that I would have been more enchanted, amazed and curious about the world of Narnia if I hadn't read all about its creation in the first book. I would have wondered about the lamppost, for example (and it would have been nice to read about the Lion's song later). Knowing about it in advance, I'm sure I found it a tad duller, because I wasn't discovering it at the same time as the kids. This is a nice story, and I know it's a Classic, but I must say it's not as captivating as I thought it would be.I advise you read it in the publication order: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magicians Nephew; The Last Battle."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The dearly loved chronicles of Narnia has always held a wonderful place in my heart, from the time it was read to me by my first grade teacher. Each time I pass a wardrobe, I often wonder what mysteries are on the other side. Will a faun lead me to a new and great adventure? And when I see I lion I think of the magnificence of Aslan with his piercing eyes and mighty roar.For those who have not read this book, you must be ready for something that is more than just a beautiful story about children, the magical land of Narnia, a wicked witch, and an &quot;untamed Lion&quot; named Aslan, whose very name brings joy to the heart of all who hear it. It is also an allegory of Christ and His Love for all, the Great Lion of Judah who is kind, loving, but, indeed, never a tame God!I have spoken to people who have read this book as a child and did not know that this level was present in the books; that's ok, because you can read it again as an adult and see how Lewis, in his inimitable way, can beautifully weave a story of suffering and grace, loss and celebration.For children, it is a book that will give them a love of reading, of imagination and joy.

I knew that a movie version of this book was coming out and I wanted to see it. My brother, a big, big fan of Chronicles of Narnia, made me read the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before seeing the movie. I read it grudgingly because I was in the middle of reading another book but I figured it was a short book so it wouldn't take long. By the second chapter, I fell in love with the book! It's so good and very well written. The Pevensie children are very likeable and you really do care for them. You feel bad for Edmund when he's being mistreated by the White Witch. Speaking of the White Witch, this book has one of the best villains of all time. It's a refreshing break from the very cliche persona of a villain; having black clothes, black hair, dark face, being mean right off the bat, and those kinds of things. This villain had white clothes (hence the name WHITE Witch), had a light face, and starting off being \\"nice\\". Aslan is also a great character. This book really started me on a Narnia craze. I now have all seven books, the movie, and I can't wait for the next movie to come out.

For example, Aslan, the lion, is Jesus, and the Witch is Satan. The story is perfect for children because through the course of the novel, the character Edmund discovers that being on the side of good is better than turning to evil. He learns, through selfish reasons, that being on the side of good is more benifical. This young children to turn to God without seeming &quot;preachy&quot;.

Don't miss this book."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This wonderful little book was, at one time, the first in the Chronicles of Narnia series, written by the late C.S. Lewis, a Christian philosopher and literatus. It was the first one I read, and is a delightful story. Both children and adults who enjoy the fantasy genre should enjoy this book. It is centered around four children who, while staying as guests at an old mansion, walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a completely different world. There, they have many adventures and get involved in a great conflict between an evil witch, who is oppressing the land with an eternal winter, and the good king Aslan, who comes back to his country after a long absence to fight the witch's evil works. Anyone with a church or Sunday-school background should quickly recognize the Christian elements in this story, and I think it is safe for young children to read. It is a charming tale and worth reading again and again. Buy the whole Narnia set, read all the books, and pass them on to your children."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This magical story has amazing mythical creatures.

Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fantastic book that combines great story telling and charming style while engrossing readers in an intriguing mythical world. Though it is numbered as book two in The Chronicles of Narnia series, C.S. Lewis wrote it first and therefore meant it to be read before book one, for it introduces the world of Narnia and launches readers on the beginning of an exciting journey leaving you wanting more. Though the style of writing and almost non-existent use of difficult vocabulary ostensibly targets the book toward a younger audience, fans of all ages can enjoy this timeless classic, and perhaps older audiences will grasp the deeper underlying message.The book begins with the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, being sent to live in a mansion with a fabulously rich, mysterious, and old professor because of the German air raids in London during World War II. While the four kids explore the house, Lucy, the youngest, first stumbles upon the doorway to the world of Narnia-an ancient and gigantic wardrobe. Eventually, all the children go through the wardrobe together, and they begin their adventures in Narnia. It is there we see two distinct sides of good and evil: the White Witch and her minions and those for Aslan the lion. The White Witch has spread an ethereal winter that has lasted for over one hundred years, and it is only the coming of Aslan that this winter spell can be broken and the White Witch defeated.C.S. Lewis brings a wealth of intriguing and interesting characters into his book. Upon meeting the characters of Narnia-mostly various animals-you become automatically attached to them. There are by no means \\"fuzzy little cute things\\" you would expect a children's book to have, but noble, smart, wise, and humanlike. Animal lovers of all sorts will enjoy this book that much more, as will mythical creature buffs. C.S. Lewis also brings in centaurs, unicorns, dryads, and naiads among others into the story, along with numerous evil creatures such as wraiths, ogres, and many other things that I will not mention here.The plot of the book is engaging and relentless. I found it almost impossible to put down the novel at the end of each chapter, a cruel but effective ploy to grasp the reader's attention throughout the book. The first initial peeks into Narnia leaves you wanting more, and upon permanently entering there, you are just as eager as the four children to explore and find out more about the strange, mysterious, but beautiful new world.I highly recommend this book to any fan of fiction. Readers will never forget the magic of entering into the world of Narnia for the first time and the wonder that it instills. This book incorporates everything that an epic novel should have. It successfully pulls you into a magical world that is totally believable, provides engaging characters and events, and captivates big and small audiences from start to finish. There is no doubt that children and adults alike will enjoy this book, and just like the Pevensie children, will leave Narnia hoping only to come back again."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion the Witch and the wardrobe is a book about four kids in the 1940's. The youngest sibling, Lucy, finds a wardrobe that houses a magical land that was cast under a spell by the Evil White Witch. With the help of Aslan the lion and Lucy's 3 brothers and sisters, Peter, Mary, and Edmund they must return the magical land of Narnia to the way it originally was.The most exciting part of the book was during the climax. During the climax there are fights and celebrations. During the fighting Aslan leads his magical army into battle with the four children by his side. Mary and Peter are able to fight with their gifts from St. Nick, Peter had recieved a sword and sheild while Mary had a bow and quiver. Lucy acted as a nurse for all the wounded soldiers. Towards the end of the book Aslan prevails and the four children are crowned Kings and Queens. Finally, after many years later they find the wardrobe and return to their house they were at in the 1940's a few seconds from which the originally left that house to go to Narnia.The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is an amasing book, that is why I recommend it. The action through the climax is enough to get any action lover to read it. Even people who like fairy tales will love the ending. The book will also help younger children know that not everyone is as good as they think they are. It can also help other people think that their might be other livible worlds out there"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"A PR man recently lamented that the movie of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was not being sold with the pitch, \\"See the Bible come alive!\\" But while Christian elements appear in various guises throughout C. S. Lewis's \\"Chronicles\\" you may search both Testaments, the Apocrypha, and the wealth of extracanonical writings BC and AD and find nothing about Narnia.This first installment was published in 1950 with the subtitle \\"A Story for Children,\\" and in his dedication Lewis calls it a \\"fairy tale\\": it is set during World War II, when many London children were sent away in hopes of finding safe in the countryside. In addition to the usual fairy tale contingent of a wicked witch of great powers, trolls and ogres and werewolves, Lewis has added the naiads and dryads, fauns and centaurs from Greek and Latin myth, as befits a classics professor, plus Father Christmas. When Aslan, the great Lion, is first mentioned one-third of the way through, his status as a Christ figure will be unmistakable---to any adult. But how many children of eight or ten---the premium age to enter Narnia---will recognize allusions to the Agony in the Garden, or interpret the sacrifice of Aslan at the Stone Table by the White Witch as the Crucifixion, or his return as the Resurrection? (The \\"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\\" plus \\"Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time\\" are tough doctrinal nuts to crack at a young age; I never understood them at the time, and now their arbitrary nature---to provide a rationale for the plot---rather sticks out.) Aslan's trials and triumphs are much sweeter than the Passion Story, which is shot through with a larger sadder view of human nature and destiny.The vivid pacing and emotional charge of Lewis's narrative bears all before it: one is swept along. What one recalls in after-years are images from high fantasy: the lamppost visible from the depths of the wardrobe, which shows one is leaving this world for Narnia; the Dwarf handing Edward the Witch's steaming tempting brew; her castleful of stone creatures being turned back to flesh by Aslan's breath. This is due in no small part to Pauline Baynes's witty, elegant, endearing illustrations, which are as much a part of Narnia as Tenniel's are of Wonderland and the Looking-Glass World, or Louise Fitzhugh's of Harriet the Spy's beat.\\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" bear the imprint of the time when they were written, and the author who wrote them, as every book does; but where Harry Potter finds most of his adherents in readers near his own age, and Tolkien's Middle Earth calls out to young and middle-aged and old alike, for what they can bring to it, Lewis was right---these are stories for children. As I reread them today, I see the boy I was when I first read them; for as an adult one can revisit, reappraise, and criticize, but one cannot recapture Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is probably my favorite book in the Narnia series, because I did read it first in the series as a child and it stuck with me. What always gets me, for some reason, is when the character Edmund indulges in some enchanted Turkish Delight. One of my favorite parts in the book, maybe because of my sweet tooth.This novel features Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they go through a magic wardrobe and enter Narnia, caught in an eternal frost. The children in turn encounter fauns, a witch as icy as the environment she has created, and a golden lion, not to mention talking beavers, giants, and Father Christmas. Edmund learns important lessons in the ethics of betrayal, or lack thereof, so to speak. Peter, Susan, and Lucy all find courage within themselves through battle and the wise words of Aslan, the golden lion.The Christian allegory in this book is somewhat stronger than in the others, due to the death and resurrection of Aslan, but as a semi-Kabbalist/former Christian/former semi-Wiccan, I have to say I do know about religion and this scence is more magic at work than the power of a god or gods. So, whatever religion you are, just be open-minded while reading this novel, and I think you will be able to see it for the extraordinarily crafted fantasy it truly is.See you after I read the next novel, for those following my review trail !"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Four kids find a magical world called Narnia. They make friends and enemies along the way.

My favorite character is Lucy because she is the most caring and honest one in my opinion.The scene that meant something to me was the scene with the witch, the lion and the witch's friends at the Stone table, I can't tell you why or it will spoil the book.This book is adventurous and a great book to read at anytime."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are siblings who have been sent to the country to escape the air raids of World War II.

They discover a spare room that is completely empty with a large wardrobe. Peter, Susan, and Edmund leave the room, but Lucy stays behind to look inside the wardrobe. Lucy steps inside the enormous closet to find a snowy wood at the back of it. Eventually she meets a faun, a creature that is half goat and half man. The faun, Tamnus lives in a strange land, Narnia where the White Witch has cast a spell so that it is always winter. He asks Lucy if she is a Daughter of Eve, if she is a human girl. Lucy is confused. Tumnus invites her for tea and plays his flute. Lucy feels like she is in a dream. The faun tells her that she cannot go home, but she begs him. Tumnus walks Lucy back to the lamppost at the border between Narnia and the wardrobe door, and they say farewell.On the next rainy day, the children play a game of hide and seek. Lucy wants to check and see if the wardrobe really is empty. Edmund sees Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He follows her into the wardrobe, but once inside he finds himself in Narnia. The kids don't believe Lucy about Narnia, but Lucy takes them, anyways. I think this book is very good.

I remember having it read to me when I was six. Of course, I was oblivious to the Christian theology running through it at the time, and in later books some of the references to other races is questionable.

After being there for what Lucy thinks is 2 hours, the faun says that he shouldn't let her go because of the White Witch's orders. When Lucy goes back, she thinks that her brothers and sister will be worried because she thinks that she has been gone for 2 hours. When she asks if they are worried, they say \\"no you were only gone for 5 minutes.\\" Then Lucy explains what happened to her and they don't believe her and so they make fun of her. Then, a couple of days later, Edmund goes into the wardrobe and he runs into the White Witch. She bribes him to come with her back to her palace.

They end up living there until they are adults. When they go back to the wardrobe they realize that they are nothing but kids.My recommendations would be toward the younger audiences because they might love all the characters. I think that anybody who likes reading interesting books will like this particular one. I also recently saw the movie and I was totally blown away! I thought that it was going to be boring. It ended up being really interesting. I think that it's better than the book. Other people say it vice versa. But I guess other people have different opinions. Anybody can love/like it!!! I do know, at first I didn't like to read and I thought it was so boring but this book opened all the posibilities!!!!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is amazing! I just loved its plot and storyline. The characters were well developed and you could relate to them, as I am very close to the main character's age. And it is also so addicting written, that after reading the first sentence you won't want to stop!This book is about 4 brothers and sisters who find a magical wardrobe that bring them to a magical world of Narnia. But Narnia is under the evil rule of the White witch. So now the children must go along with a army of talking animals, spirits, and trees, along with the leader of Narnia, Aslan the lion, to defeat the White Witch.I just love C.S Lewis's style of writing. It lays everything you need to know on the paper, straightforwardly enough so any child can understand it, but beautifully enough so any critic will praise it. This book is truly a masterpiece.I recommend this book to any fantasy book lovers, and any Lloyd Alexander fan will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia are unique from any other book I've read, considering every time I reread them I get a different opinion.The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is technically the one that started them all, if you read them in the correct order, against the publishers' intentions. It's not the best, but really is the most memorable. Here you are introduced to the four Pevensie children- Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Lucy, the youngest, ventures into a wardrobe at her eccentric relative's house and finds herself in a different world- Narnia, home of the evil White Witch and the mythical Lion Aslan.Nowadays you could dismiss this book as one-dimensional and predictable- yes, good triumphs over evil, there's a bit of forgiven betrayal, and a child's dream comes true. But Narnia is completely unique, because it was CS Lewis that came up with this other world idea, and it was from his Narnia books that all the others were spun off of.Narnia reads like a fairytale. Lucy is sweet, Susan is mature, Peter is a warrior, Edmund is an oddball that goes through random personalities changes. Aslan is faultless, the Witch is cruel. But all that is where the magic comes from. Somehow these characters all work and are believable and readable. You are surprised and hooked till the end.Despite Lewis's awkward dialogue, his obvious love for the word \\"presently\\" and dragging descriptions, these books are classics, to be read over and over. As I've said, every time you read them you understand a bit more."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Ages 12 and up.

This book deals with courage in many different ways as Peter (the eldest of the four)overcomes many obstacles throughout the course of this magical novel."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of NarniaThe Lion, The Witch, and The WardrobeZach ThomassonThe book that I read for the fourth quarter project is called The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. It was written by C.S. Lewis, who has written many great books.The book is mainly about four kids who live in England at the time of World War II. Their mother sends them off to an estate to live with someone while the war is going on. Since the day they got there was raining, they went to go and play hide-and-go seek. Lucy, who was the youngest, went to this secret room with a magical wardrobe in it. She went inside it and kept going back until she found she was in a forest. This magical place was called Narnia. Then she saw a light post and met a faun, which was a mixture of two animals. The faun took her back to his place to have tea and to kidnap her. But this faun was good so instead of kidnapping her, he took her back to the light post so she could get home. Then Edmund, who was her brother, followed her into the forest. But he went the wrong way and met up with the evil White Witch. He told them about his family and went back home. One time they were playing and they heard footsteps so they went to the wardrobe room. they went in and found themselves in a snowy forest. When they saw talking beavers, they went to the beaver's house for dinner. When they were talking, Edmund snuck out and went to the White Witches house. She took him prisoner because he didn't bring his family with him. So the rest of the book is about them finding Edmund and getting into a big war against the White Witch. And of course they win the war.The four main characters are Peter who is the oldest, Susan who is the second oldest, Edmund who is the third oldest, and Lucy who is the youngest. Peter is a smart guy and despises his brother because of his attitude toward all of them. Susan is very smart knows how to solve problems between her family. Edmund you can almost say is very bad. He acts like that because he is afraid that his dad will die in the war. Lucy is a person with many freckles and a nice personality.I think the theme of this book is good vs. evil. In the war it is the axis powers who are evil vs. the allied powers who were the good. The when they reach Narnia, it is the White Witch who is evil and Aslan the mighty lion and his side that is good.I really liked this book for many reasons. One it is filled with adventure and is just a great book. Two it has many different characters that seem very cool. Three the good guys win and the four children become the kings and queens of Narnia. I think you should read this book too."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"A world of fantasy that leads the reader to the victory of good over evil, C.S. Lewis has written an enjoyable children's story that allures to the Christian religion. Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with a professor in a huge old house. Inside a wardrobe in one of the many rooms is a passageway to the world of Narnia where mythical creatures live alongside the mundane animals. However, in Narnia the White Witch has placed a spell on the land so that it is \\"always winter and never Christmas.\\" The four children travel with friendly beavers to meet Aslan, the great lion who can defeat the White Witch. He leads them to fight the Witch's allies to restore the beauty and goodness of Narnia.The events and characters in the novel take everyone back to childhood dreams of unicorns, talking animals, and glorious victories. The reader becomes captivated by the plight of the four children and their quest to save Narnia. The children are alluring because of their innocence. The clear line between good and evil aids the flow and understanding of the story. The imagery describing Aslan captivates the reader, creating a mysterious character who is kind yet fearsome and who cares for all the people. This imagery draws the reader to love Aslan just as much as the children love him. The clear distinction between the awesome goodness of Aslan and the evil treachery of the Witch fuels the reader's desire to learn of Narnia's fate. The fate of the creatures the White Witch has turned to stone also keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat. The reader wishes to keep reading because of the foreshadowing of a great battle and the prophecy that the children will ascend to the throne of the Castle Paravel and defeat the Witch.The sentences seem awkward at time, but this is due to Lewis' writing style. He writes as if he is talking, relaying the story to a group of children. The wording is simplistic and there are quite a few moments where he recaps the story or explains mundane actions. This style is ideal for children because the explanatory comments help children to better understand the story, and it helps adults to remember what occurred earlier in the novel. C.S. Lewis switches between a narrative of the Witch's actions and Aslan's actions throughout the middle section of the novel. Lewis will break one story at a climax point and return to the other which causes the reader to continue in order to discover the answers to the questions in the last chapter.C.S. Lewis continuously alludes to the Bible, making the story a great study for Christian groups. The name Peter connects the apostle, the head of the Church, to the boy whom Aslan trusts to head the battle against the evil White Witch. Edmund, the youngest boy is related to Judas. Edmund meets the White Witch and is taken in by her magic. Just as Judas was enchanted by the allure of money, Edmund betrays the whereabouts of his siblings and Aslan while under the spell of the White Witch. However, Aslan frees Edmund. Edmund repents and is forgiven, just as Judas would have been had he not killed himself. Also, the many prophesies throughout the novel allure to the prophesies in the Old Testament about Jesus' life and death. The connections continue, but would give away the rest of the story.Lewis' novel is a great read for all people because of its adventure and mystery. The courageous children's fight to save Narnia is a childhood dream come true. All will fall in love with this novel. It is not just a book for Christians, but it is a book for all longing for adventure in mystical lands."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"My book talk is on a book called Narnia the lion,the witch,and the wardrobe.It was written by c.s lewis and it was eventually made into a movie it is about these 4 kids Lucy,Susan,Edmund,and Peter,Anyway they all go through this wardrobe and land in a magical world called Narnia.They meet an evil witch and a very good hearted lion called aslan.It is one of the best adventure books I have ever read,it also has alot of fantasy with alot of magical animals that can,like talk!.If you like alot of adventure and fantasy this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S.

I decided that the only place where wonderful, magical things happened was in England. Only in England could characters like the White Witch, Aslan and Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund have exciting, magical adventures. Even now at 27, I still have this child-like fantasy that England is a magical place filled with the possibility of adventure and excitement. This wonderful book is enjoyable for all ages.

I'm not a Christian, but I can appreciate the skill and the depth of feeling Lewis has for his subject. Aslan the lion is a wonderful character. He is gentle and kind, but can also be fierce and fatal when the situation calls for it. The children are believable--they are basically good at heart, but are certainly not perfect, and Edmund is extremely trying. I'm so glad I re-read this! The first time I heard the story was in fourth grade. Every child in my class was rapt with attention when our teacher read this to us.

Thus, I went into this series wondering whether this series, purportedly written for children, would appeal to my supposedly &quot;adult&quot; sensibilities. I needn't have worried. As most of the rest of the world seems to know already, the books are absolutely charming for readers of any age group...at least, for readers who still have a sense of wonder about them. I am writing this mini-review in &quot;The Lion&quot; section of Amazon rather than the &quot;Magician's Nephew&quot; section because I absolutely agree with the other readers who maintain that the original order of the books is the right and proper order in which to read them.

I found this book was a great fantasy and a book I could read with ease. I felt that C.S. Lewis came up with a very interesting plot that most readers can enjoy. I loved the setting descriptions, the characters, and overall plot. However, I feel this book suits a younger audience. The simple diction and context made the book seem of lower level reading, certainly not of my age group.There is a definite religious theme throughout the book that C.S. Lewis is trying to get across to his readers. He uses the Christian faith and Jesus Christ constantly throughout the book. He uses the main characters to represent religious figures in the bible. Aslan represents Jesus Christ in which Aslan dies and rises from the dead. The White Witch symbolizes Satan with her evil ways and treatment of the animals and people. The children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy represent Jesus' disciples as the follow and love Aslan who represents Jesus Christ. Some might find this use of religion as an annoyance, but being a Christ follower, I actually liked these references and loved the connection that was portrayed between the characters in the book and the biblical figures of the bible.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book, despite it being a little too young for my liking.

I know people are always weary to pick up a book that has a religious theme to it but C.S. Lewis is enjoyable no matter what you choose to believe.During WWII, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy Pevensie have to leave London and their mother as they seek refuge in the English countryside with Digory Kirke. The children amuse themselves by exploring and playing games; one day, Lucy steps into a wardrobe and into Narnia, a magical land where she meets Tumnus, a friendly faun, who invites her to him home and tells her about the evil White Witch.When she returns to the real world, Peter, Edmund, and Susan believe she's lying; Edmund, however, goes into the wardrobe and enters Narnia. He has the misfortune of meeting the White Witch who bribes him with Turkish Delight and encourages him to bring Peter and his sisters back with him.While trying to hide from a group of visitors, the four Pevensie children pile into the wardrobe and step back into Narnia; Lucy leads them to Tumnus' house but finds that he has been taken by the White Witch. From then on, the children meet friends, battle the power of evil temptation, and search for the true King of Narnia: Aslan.This story is unlike anything I've ever read before. I couldn't help but admire the brilliant way Lewis wove together so many stories yet made it uniquely his own. Making a trip into Narnia is something everyone should do and your first step is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Like JACK AND THE BEANSTALK, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, HARRY POTTER, THE WIZARD OF OZ and so many other children's stories that have entered the realm of literature classics, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE begins with the discovery of an obscure gateway into another land. Peter, Susan, and Edmund Pevensie, children living with their uncle in a sprawling country house in the English countryside believe their youngest sister's stories of her visit to an enchanted winterbound land ruled by an evil white witch to be the product of an overheated imagination. For no other reason than to humour her and to prove her story wrong, they skeptically follow her into a dark, musty wardrobe. To their great surprise, they find they have all walked through a magical portal into the country known as Narnia.On the surface, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is a simple children's allegory with characters drawn from a deep well of literary predecessors including English folk tales and Norse and Greek mythology - talking animals, Mr and Mrs Beaver, Father Christmas, dwarves and giants, fauns, unicorns and centaurs, dryads, sentient trees, a snarling, frightful wolf who is the henchman of the evil white queen, black magic, and a great lion called Aslan who mysteriously returns from an extended absence to help Narnia's beleaguered subjects release the magical grip of a never-ending bleak, icy winter and allow the return of the much longed for beauty and warmth of spring and summer.But, at a deeper level, CS Lewis is well known for his Christian references and this story is no exception. Virtually any adult reader will recognize Aslan's heroic self-sacrifice to save Edmund's life and his return from death atop the witch's Stone Table as a clear symbolic allusion to Christ's crucifixion for the redemption of earth's sinners and his resurrection from the dead. While some readers may disagree, I found the allusions considerably less than subtle. While they were entirely obvious, almost painfully so, they were also, perhaps paradoxically, unobtusive and neither pedantic nor sermonizing. As a result, readers of any faith (or lack thereof) will be able to accept and enjoy the symbolism or simply ignore it and focus on the charm of the story as it might be seen from a child's point of view.The obvious overriding theme is good versus evil and, as is the case with most children's stories, good will out. The ending, not unexpectedly, is a suitably happy one that will satisfy a child reader or perhaps a youngster who is happily listening to a parent reading the story over several nights before bedtime. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I love how C.S. Lewis posits the trilemma of Mere Christianity, perhaps C.S. Lewis's most famous apologetic work, to also support the idea that Narnia exists.Lucy must either be a liar, mad, or telling the truth that Narnia is real in the same way that in Mere Christianity Lewis posits that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic. Clearly, there are more possibilities than these with regard to Jesus, lest we believe every fantasy our children tell us.This writing is very much secretly evangelistic, but probably not in a way most people would expect. I feel when an evangelist presents me with the Jesus story, and declares something like that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic, it is not Jesus whom I am passing judgment upon, but the witness of a fairytale presented to me. It is thus not Jesus that must be Lord, liar or lunatic, but the person or author that presents Jesus to me that is probably liar, lunatic or telling the truth. But, as I believe happens in the case of the Jesus story, most people that believe in fairy tales are just honestly mistaken about their tale. That is, they are neither telling the truth, lying, or insane, but that they are just plain honestly mistaken. When someone tells me that if I don't believe in a fairytale, such that my soul depends on it in order to escape eternal punishment, I won't sell my soul to believe in Jesus anymore than I would subscribe to the idea that Narnia is a real place. Strangely, C.S. Lewis seems to support that idea as upright, such that entering the fantastic world of Jesus and Christianity, even if it be lies, is still ideal to the alternative of denying Christian religious fantasies.Of course, Jesus was a real person, but anything beyond that is anyone's guess, and as mysterious as Narnia itself. Three major religions have three stories about Jesus that are very much in conflict. Christianity says that Jesus is Lord. Judaism says that Jesus was the antichrist. And, Islam says that Jesus was the humblest prophet, but not as great as Mohammed. Therefore, what is to be made of this man's story is anybody's guess. Absurdly, most Christians say that this decision is central going to either heaven or hell in the afterlife. That much I am unable to accept."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Just re-read this last week to my boys (4 and 6), and what a relief it is to read something that's been written with real care and a sense of style.

This book is even read by many adults, because of the magic that C.S Lewis's pencil wrote. They might not be thick books. But that doesnt make a book good at any means. What makes a book good is detail, and that is exactly what C.S. Lewis did. All hail Aslan!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", to be quite honest, is my least favorite of the Narnia books. While it is the most well known book in the Narnia series and seems to receive the most adaptations, for this reader it is also the weakest. While my personal prejudice against the book may seem unjustified, I will go into detail on why it is this book does the least of all the books for me. However, do not think that I despise the book. Some of the individual scenes are my favorite in the series, including the meeting of Tumnas and Lucy and much of the actual world of Narnia. The scene with the professor stands out as well, as do others, including Edmond and the scene with the White Witch and her devilish Turkish Delight.The chief fault I have with this is the overly explicit Christianity in this book. The Chronicles represent very fundamental Christian faerie tales, and generally Lewis embodies Christianity with a very good story. For me, however, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" ceases to be good story and just mere allegory. I think of the Chronicles as something of magic themselves, and the spell of the series are the excellent stories that also have great Christian truths. The death of Aslan for the sake of Edmond totally ruins this spell for me. Again, this is personal taste.To best describe what I'm talking about, I will give you my personal view on why the series itself is good. Lewis, while always writing from the Christian standpoint, keeps first and foremost the story in mind. Christianity underlies it all, but the most important element is the story itself. Readers do not like to be preached at. If you tell a good story that has exhibits various elements of Christianity as its theme but keep the story original, that is a good faerie tale. Here, Lewis starts that and then stops that at the end and has Aslan die for Edmond. It would have been fine had the parallel not been so blatantly obvious. For me, it makes me lose focus of the story and concentrate on the Christianity solely. Still, it's like Lewis decides to make it very explicit what he is talking about instead of sticking to the less obvious.Another element that alienates this book from me is the inclusion of Father Christmas. I cannot specifically put my finger on it, but for some reason he does not sit well with me. We have this beautiful new world of Narnia, and here it's always winter and never Christmas. Why would they have Christmas in the first place? Again, I understand Father Christmas can represent the Holy Spirit, etc, and put it on the level that children will definitely relate too, but even when I was little I had an immediate dislike to this inclusion in the story.While the slain god myth is an essential archetype, it just does not work for me in this story. I would have rather Lewis come up with a more ingenuity and have a different way for Aslan to redeem him. How is the ultimate question. But he did do this with Eustace in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\". While that may seem to be a rather harsh reaction to the opening book of the Narnia series, it was my initial reaction, and when rereading it, I am still of this opinion. Again, I recognize this is personal taste, and \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is certainly deserving of its acclaim.For myself, the explicit Christianity ruins the otherwise flawless faerie tale atmosphere Lewis creates in this tale. Lewis does not violate my own personal aesthetics of endowing a story with Christianity without making the story seem bogged down with Christian elements in the series again with the exception of \\"Dawn Treader:. Every other story in the series the Christian themes but does not, in the end, breaking the spell of the faerie tale. It just feels like in LWW he starts preaching at us. But what do I know. It is probably the most popular of the seven books.\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", a book I very dearly love, only breaks the spell at the very end and only as part of a comment from Aslan to the children. While certainly Christianity (i.e., a relationship with God) is the most important thing, for myself it brings down the story when Lewis has Aslan say that he brought the children to Narnia so that they may know him better in their own world. I guess it is meant to give hope to the children reading it that they will one day know Aslan, and it is certainly a worthy inclusion for the book, but I still feel, when I read it, that that is a little to explicit for me. The story ceases to be story and becomes just regular Christian doctrine, and while certainly we need Christian doctrine a story should be, first and foremost, a story. However, Lewis's intent besides the story was to win souls to Christ, and if Narnia help does that, then ultimately that is more important than trivial literary concerns.You can tell this is the first one he wrote and that originally there was no thought of a series. There are several contradictions in between this and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", which include the ancestry of the White Witch and the belief that there have been no human beings in this world. Originally Lewis tried to stay true to this premise but Roger Lancelyn Green told him cut this long scene between a ploughman and his wife in another world and Lewis took his advice and instead went with this concepts. Another case of this not being originally intended as a series is when asked about the story from Coriakin's book, Lucy is spoken of in the present tense, indicating she is still alive. Even Prince Caspian adheres to the original concept of the idea that there were no humans in Narnia at the beginning. Another element that, although working in the self-contained book that Lewis originally meant LWW to be, seems rather awkward to this reader is the professor. He is never named in LWW, but is so in MN. Father Christmas doesn't seem to fit either.This passage from \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" where White Witch is demanding the life of Edmund because he has betrayed the children and Aslan to the White Witch is one of Lewis's most overt allusions to Christianity in the series. Aslan makes the sacrifice. This also illustrates the fact that evil was not there in the beginning. The White Witch did not know the great magic from before the world's foundation. There were rules and ordinances that were not made known to the angels. Pride also blinds, because when Satan fell, he thought the crucifixition would truly solve the problem with Christ and his ministries. Jadis also thought this as well, that she would triumph in the end. Both were proud and glorified in their evil. Their belief is placed in the wrong deity.Lewis uses the colour white in the cold, wintery sense rather than white symbolising purity. The White Witch has put Narnia in a spell, freezing Aslan's land into a continuos winter than cannot be broken until two kings and two queens from the human race come to seat at Cair Paravel. The white is sickening and represents the cruelty. Ironically, Lewis reckons her colour as that of salt, which precisely what she is not. Salt is a natural preservative and adds flavour to the food, but the White Witch only ruins and destroys and perverts. Jadis, who also appears in \\"The Silver Chair\\", uses the natural colour perverts it into the evil. Green often has been associated with the spring time. In \\"The Silver Chair\\", we find her as the Green Lady. She directs the children and Puddleglum to the giants of Harfang. Here, she appears to be a rather mysterious woman, but she shows her true colours in the Underworld. Jadis, just as she used the white as a perverted colour, here she uses green in her underground kingdom, because here that colour will never come. Spring cannot come to the Underworld, and if her plans would go through, she, like she did in Charn, would destory the world. Green, that vibrant colour of life, is chosen by her to mock spring.Although the winter is an unnatural one, the attitude the characters show for it is part of the pathetic fallacy. From Wikipedia: \\"The pathetic fallacy is the treatment of inanimate objects as if they had human feelings, thought, or sensations. The word 'pathetic' in this use is related to 'pathos' or 'empathy' (capability of feeling), and is not pejorative. In the discussion of literature, the pathetic fallacy is similar to personification.\\" When spring comes to Narnia, they all rejoice for the characters feel so much happier now that the winter is lifting. This also occurs in The Silver Chair with Scrubb and Pole. Jill thinks of the edge as being horrible simply because it is high, which is quite an odd attitude to take. If, by your very nature, you are skilled in mathematics and another person is not and they say. You are black or white or yellow or whatever, this colour has nothing to do with what you are like as a person. If the water is cold and someone says they love water when it is cold because it is so good, but it is bad when it is hot, that is pathetic fallacy. Cliffs are not bad or good - they're just cliffs and that is all.Although a worthwhile book, as I've explained I like the other Narnia novels much better than this one. Tolkien likewise did not like this book for many of the same reasons. He once wrote to a correspondent George Sayer, saying \\"It is sad that 'Narnia' and all that part of C.S.L.'s work should remain outside the range of my sympathy, as much of my work was outside his.\\" Tolkien thought the mixture of various fairy tale motifs quite absurd. Obviously the reading public has adored these books, and they are established literary classics, so if you haven't read LWW, give it a chance. You may have a completely different view than myself and just love the work. For myself, the other Narnia novels are so much better...------------------------------[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The five works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complications if you do not do it his way.Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomaly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\"."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This classic is an enjoyable read.

The tree that Jadis was afraid of, wasn't in the book. However, the lamp post was.

The stange things helped them get away from the evil witch. then a lion comes named Aslan who is the only one who can defeet the evil witch. Aslan was my favorite charecter because he was good,nice,and,when he fights he uses his mind not his strenght. With the help of Aslan the kids defeet the witch and become the kings and queens of Narnia. IU like this book because the author made it feel like the charercters come alive and I could see it in my head, for example my favorite scene was when Aslan turned all the statues back in to animals. It describes the process like a paper catching on fire,and I could see the process in my head.While the book starts out slow,it is worth the effert to keep on reading. I think I will read morew of this book series ,and I can't wait to msee if the movie will match my imaganation."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Although this was the first Narnia book published, it is the second in the series. It is about four siblings who get sent to a big house in the country during the war. Their names are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This house was owned by an old professer. One day they were playing hide-and-seek and Lucy decides to hide in a wardrobe. She finds that the wardrobe has no back. She walks through and finds herself in the land of Narnia where it is always Winter and never Christmas. She befriends a fawn an he tells her that Narnia was taken over by the White Witch Jadis, and that it is she who turned Narnia into winter. It is she who turns those who do not follow her into stone. The White Witch is completely evil. Lucy finds her way back and tells her siblings. They don't believe her but soon all four find themselves in Narnia, waging a war against the White Witch with Aslan the Lion by their side.As is true for all the Narnia books, this book is straight-forward with excellent characters and plot. It is a quick read, but you will want to read it over and over again. With all the hype of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings nowadays, Narnia should become more popular spawning live-action movies and plastic lunch boxes.

You'll love it too!!!!!=)"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story, and a great film!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis has conjured a world that millions have adored with incredible creatures(far more than the Lord of the Rings has). The one thing that I'm fed up with is people comparing this to Christian beliefs. It's not that I'm unchristian but I think that this makes people believe that only christians can read the book. Anyone can read the books because though it can be viewed as a tale that instills christian faith its really just a fantasy story at heart. Even C.S. Lewis himself said that Narnia was not supposed to be a direct comparison with christianity. So please enjoy the book or go see the new movie and please don't get religion involved with it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I can't even begin to say how many times I've read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" or the other books in the Narnia series. I grew up reading these books time and again, and each journey into this imaginary land is as fresh and exciting as the first journey there.\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a very simple fairy story at first glance: four children who have been squired to the English countryside to escape the London bombings during WWII find an entrance into a magical world through a wardrobe door. Yet underneath the surface, much is at work, as Lewis weaves myths and faith into a spellbinding adventure. When Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy enter Narnia, it is under the spell of the evil White Witch who can only be defeated when Aslan returns and the prophecy (which involves them) is fulfilled.For those only familiar with the writings that C.S. Lewis has done on religion and Christian apologetics, the notion of him writing a children's book must seem strange. Yet Lewis' first love was the myths and fairy stories that he devoured as a child, and Narnia is full of those creatures that sprang to life in his dreams. Lewis and his friend J.R.R. Tolkien were once under the impression that if they wanted to read the sort of stories that they liked, they would have to be the ones to write them. How many adventures they have taken readers on, and will continue to do so for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Having been a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings for a long time, I picked up a book by J.R.R. Tolkien's friend, C.S. Lewis. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read LWW first, as it was the first published, or to begin with The Magician's Nephew, as Lewis himself had said he preferred as the opening novel in the Chronicles. Although this is the only Chronicle I've read so far, I'm glad I started with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.From the moment Lucy explores the back of her makeshift hiding place and begins to find trees and snow on the ground and the famous lamppost, being completely free of the knowledge of how Narnia originated lets the reader experience the same wonder and amazement that the characters feel. I was entranced by the mystery of the land and its inhabitants. I don't think I would've felt the same way if I had prior knowledge of Aslan, Jadis, or the history of Narnia.The story itself reads very quickly and is sparse with details in areas, such as the battle at the end, but it allows the reader to fill in with their own imaginations whatever is not outright told to them by the author. Anyone who loves visiting fantastic worlds, such as Middle-Earth or Hogwarts, I heartily recommmend this book."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"... of Michael York. It's deep and smooth and soothing; just like the book. You can find out what the book is like by looking at the other reviews; but I definitely recommend this recording!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The reason for the \\"sudden reordering\\" of the Narnia series dates back to a letter sent to C S Lewis by a child after the completion of the series. The young reader noticed that the books were published out of order as far as the Narnian time line goes with the creation of Narnia occuring in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (the sixth book published). In the letter, the child asked which order the books should be read in. Lewis replied that it was really up to the reader, but he prefered them chronologically within the Narnian world which places \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" first. SO it is up to the reader whether you want to read them in the new order (approved by the author) or their publication order. Either way you do it, \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" occurs at the same time \\"The Lion and the Witch and the wardrobe\\" occurs. I read them both ways, and LW&W is a better \\"first book\\" because it's more action oriented than MN. It was more interesting for me as a young reader to go back in time and read about the creation of one of my favorite fantasy worlds...every reader might not agree (obviously the publishers and the Lewis family don't). Enjoy them either way!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, of course, loved by millions as a classic, and it truly deserves its distinction. Rarely will any reader of any genre find a story so moving and entertaining and so enlightening. I can't recommend anything more highly than this little volume.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter who wander through an old wardrobe into the magical world of Narnia. What follows is their adventure as they team with a nation of talking animals and other magical creatures versus the evil powers in the kingdom. The novel climaxes with one extraordinary act of love which tears through the kingdom and changes everything and everyone after.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is such a successful novel. It does serve as a wonderfully powerful read. The book also enlightens the reader with its commentary Christian symbolism on the nature of love. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a classic, and I really think that it is just now coming into what may be its most popular period. The world is pleading for some type of meaning, and here, Lewis is willing to offer it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Unlike most of the rest of the world, I never read this series as a kid. With the movie coming out, I thought I would take a look as an adult. While the story is nice and there are some fantasy elements that would be appealing to kids, it seems odd to me to compare this book to epics like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, principally because there is just not much there. The story is short and simple, the battles barely rate a couple of sentences of description, there is a bit of repetition, and the characters are fairly simply drawn. Don't get me wrong: I have no problem with the allegorical message or the story for what it is, but is is more akin to A Wrinkle in Time in terms of depth and detail than it is to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. Thus, it is more likely to be appealing to younger kids than to those able to tackle more extensive and more complex reading material. YA readers who like Narnia might also like Jean Rabe's The Finest Creation."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"When four English siblings (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) are sent to the country to avoid the air raids in London, they find a secret passageway in a wardrobe that leads them to an imaginary land called Narnia. Here the four young children meet a few interesting characters: Tumnus the Faun, a half-goat/half-man that befriends Lucy when she's lost; the Beaver family who help the children elude the White Witch and her dangerous allies; and, lastly, the White Witch herself, who has laid claim over Narnia with her year-round winter spell and her self-proclaimed title: \\"Queen of Narnia\\". She is also the one who lures Edmund to her side with endless supplies of Turkish Delight and subtle hints of him becoming King.During their adventures, the four children ultimately meet Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia who has returned, at last, to reclaim his land from the evil queen. Together they--along with the help of several other mystical beings--aim to defeat the White Witch and return Narnia to its original state and ownership.After reading \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", you'll definitely want to read the following books in this series: \\"Prince Caspian\\" (#2), \\"The Voyage of the 'Dawn Treader'\\" (#3), \\"The Silver Chair\\" (#4), \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" (#5), \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (#6), and \\"The Last Battle\\" (#7). Although \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is geared for children age 8 to 12, I consider it appropriate for all ages and encourage everyone to read it.I received the entire Narnia collection from one of my aunts when I was a kid, either for my birthday or some other holiday--I don't remember. Anyway, this book/series has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. It's a wonderful fantasy meant for children, but will inspire adults as well. Highly recommended. It also makes a wonderful gift. ;)There are some Christian undertones in this book, such as the terms \\"Daughter of Eve\\" and \\"Son of Adam\\" for humans in Narnia, as well as Aslan's sacrifice for Edmund; however, I don't really regard The Chronicles of Narnia as a religious series. You can expect a wholesome story, but not to worry--it isn't preachy or overly self-righteous.Several years after it was published, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was made into a TV series in the late 60s, which I never saw because I wasn't born yet. Plus it only aired in the UK. About ten years later, in 1979 (the year I was born), a cartoon movie was made, but I didn't see that one either. The only movie I vaguely recall watching was the 1988 movie starring Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Jonathan R. Scott, and Sophie Wilcox. I remember that even then I wasn't too impressed with it, not as much as I was with the book.So, for those who love children's fantasies, or are just C. S. Lewis fans, then I highly recommend this book and series. It's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"While this is not my favorite book in the Chronicles of Narnia, it still merits five stars and is an excellent book. Few authors can capture the imagination like C. S. Lewis was able to do, and I doubt that many will ever be able to again. This book is unbelievable, yet believable. Extraordinary and impossible things happen, yet Lewis describes things like the meal set before them at the Beaver's Dam so eloquently and vividly, it makes you seem as if you were there, and when you realize you are not, you are suddenly very hungry and wishing you had some fresh fish just caught from the icy river.In addition to being a fantastic story, it contains a point, something which many modern fictional stories fail to do. In this book, C. S. Lewis lays out the crucifixion and Ressurection of Christ, except in Narnia Christ is not a man, but a lion, and not named Jesus, but Aslan. The power and majesty of the Great Lion impresses one while reading, yet his kindness and love shine through no weaker. Lewis does an amazing job of presenting to us the Christ of another world, and I cannot imagine anyone doing a much better job of it.If you have seen the recent movie which models itself after this book, you have seen but a shadow of the real thing. The book is thousands of times better than either the PBS version or the new release. The new release managed to take the focus off of Aslan and put it instead on the children by talking about how the hope that the children have brought has ended the winter, whereas in the book, it was Aslan's power which did it (among numerous other changes to this effect). The movie both lowers Aslan and the importance of the death and ressurection of Aslan, and I think that it fails to capture the real essense of this work. The real thing is so much better, it is well worth the time required to read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Although I have only read two NARNIA books, (LION &amp; MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW), I am sure LION is (one of?) Narnia's best.(It), even though (it was) written before MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, fills in the holes from the prequel, as well as creating a new vivid and enchantingly entertaining story of it's own.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MAGICAL STORY, HERE'S YOUR SERIES!The order the plubisher put them in after Lewis wrote them is as follows, although I'm not sure I spelled everything correctly:#1 THE MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW #2 THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE #3 THE HORSE AND HIS BOY #4 PRINCE CASPAN #5 THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER #6 THE SILVER CHAIR #7 THE LAST BATTLEThe star charecter of the books, I can tell, is easily Aslan, and his bravery in LION was stunning! LION is a true favorite, a treasure, and a classic.I believe the easiest way to read them all is by buying THE COMPLETE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (a 500+ page book including the full text of ALL SEVEN Narnia novels), or by buying the boxed set (either in hardcover of paperback.) Either way, enjoy LION and the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this in three days. The fastest I've ever read a book I think. Of course, I didn't have much else to do though, so that might be a factor.Still, the book was very enjoyable, especially since I'm not into all of this mythological stuff. I especially like the lamp-post at the end of the world concept.This book is very descriptive, which I guess is an essential element to the success of a book. It gives you a sense that the author is actually there and just reporting what happens. He mentions everything, even how one of the kids during a long journey watches a beaver's feet plod along through the snow, as if in a trance. Minor details like that seem to confirm the author was really there. Great for fiction. I think the Harry Potter books are like that too.I hope this isn't a spoiler, but this book has Santa Claus in it, which I personally thought was kind of lame, but oh well.This isn't my favorite book ever, but it's fun to read. I don't think I'll get the other Narnia books, but I've got nothing against them. They're good stuff. I only got this book because I recognized the book cover. I believe I saw it when I was a little kid. These books must have been popular for the past 50 years. I think Mel Gibson is due to make this particular book into a movie this Christmas, but I'm not sure.I used to think books were always better than movies, because seeing a movie every week cost a lot more than reading books for a hobby. Now I'm not so sure. This one cost me seven bucks, and I finished it in less than a week. Now I think good books are good, and good movies are good, but neither books or movies are better overall.I've noticed that my reviews have been getting poor ratings as of late, so I don't think I'll write as many now. I'll have to find something more productive. Like reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland again. That's a great book to read by the way.

I only spent $.01 on the book! I think it is ironic that the shipping cost more than the book, but it was a lot cheaper than driving across the country to get it. I love books. For me, books are a life source. I was going to rate this a 5 star purchase, but I wasn't fully satisfied. When I bought the book, the discription said it was in excellent condition. Well, I was not pleased to find that there was writing in the cover and on the page sides. Plus, and I don't understand why, the company put a sticker on the cover that tore as I was trying to remove it. You see, I collect books. The set that this book belongs to is now complete, however, this book is slightly damaged and now defaced. I am happy about having it, but I would have liked it to be free of writing and stickers. Overall, the company who sent me the book is very professional and quick to reply. They were friendly, and I didn't have to wait too long for the book. I believe I got it in like 4 or 5 days.

Now that I think about it, it was decades ago, and those were the days of punch cards. I hated computers because of that; what a lousy interface that was; but I didn't hate the punch card operators ... I presumed they were all attractive young women working their way through college and I wanted to meet all of them. Bemoan the hormones. One of the things I hated most then was that there was no debug code. Every time I made a mistake, all I got back from the computer was a whole-page goofy-faced image of Alfred E. Newman with the phrase printed below saying \\"What Me Wonder\\". I'm supposed to fix my code and that's the only clue I get? But I digress.Why do I mention all of this? Because some stupid Alfred E. Newman computer programmer type at Amazon.com decided I should review an audio book CD that I obviously didn't buy for myself (because they took my credit card number and I'm pretty sure that young kids who are interested in these stories don't have credit cards) -- I bought it for a grandchild for Pete's sake. I think it's up to her to do the review, but I'm pretty sure she didn't listen to it yet and for all I know she may never listen to it. Besides, if she does, and by the time she does, Amazon.com's hour glass will have run out and I wont be allowed to review the CD. So ... I think the CD is probably great, and I sort of presented it as a birthday gift while winking at the mother because she should make sure that her husband (my son) should spend some of his personal time with her every night listening to part of it (dispensed gradually over a period of days). He doesn't spend reading time with her now because all she has is printed matter to read and that's a little fatiguing for my son. To give him a break, that's not because it's difficult for him to read; rather, it's because he reads at a level far exceeding the level most people are accustomed to, and especially what children are accustomed to. So this CD is a win-win for everybody: my son isn't fatigued; my granddaughter gets exposed to great literature; and the two of them spend some quality time with each other.Now if you want more than 4 stars, you're going go have to ask my granddaughter. I gave it four because I imagined it's great. Only her imagination will know for sure, and I wont know until I speak with her at Christmas time. If it gets my son to spend more time with his daughter then the CD is great no matter whatever other measure is applied.

The house in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe had a secret , which only Peter, Susan,Edmund, and Lucy knows. Once they went through the wardrobe in the house,their adventures would begin in the land called Narnia, and their lives will change.I love this book, because it tells about Lucy trying to save her friend Tumnus. It tells about the wonderful adventures she had with her friends, Peter, Susan, and Edmund and the great dangers they faced in Narnia. I also liked the little rhymes that describes Aslan, the great lion.I wish that this book would be longer and the adventures of Narnia would countinue in this book.I recommend this book for people who like adventure stories, because this book is filled with adventures.My favorite part is when the dwarf made Edmond a prisoner and used a whip to threaten him to go faster. If the White Witch ( a terrible witch) that calls herself queen of Narnia wants Edmond to go faster, the dwarf whips him until he goes faster.My other favorite part is when Edmond got tricked into bringing Peter, Susan and Lucy to her because she wants to turn Edmond and his friends into stone. They are smart and she doesn't want them to break the White Witch's spell. The spell is a spell that will keep Narnia always in a winter season.On the map, I think it is a little confusing because it doesn't show the place where Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy came through the Wardrobe to Narnia, but the story is exciting."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"World War II rages but in the country, the Pevensies (Peter,Susan, Edmund, Lucy), four children find their way into the greatestplace they have ever seen-Narnia.

The evil, foul-minded people who are publishing these works (The Chronicles of Narnia) have profaned the fantastic writing of C.S. Lewis by rearranging the order of the seven books so as to confuse the reader and steal away some of the magic and wonder by imposing it in a chronological order rather than the artistic one in which it was rendered. Is the horrible time witch at play again or it could be that rascal Screwtape at work? I shake my head sadly at the poor folk who will read these books in the wrong order, actually thinking that perhaps the author meant for them to read Volume Six first. Yes, of course these books come highly recommended but I think it is most important to stress that they should be read in the proper order, which is as follows: 1. The Lion, The Witch &amp; The Wardrobe 2. Prince Caspian 3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 4. The Silver Chair 5. The Horse and His Boy 6. The Magician's Nephew 7. The Last Battle Please, do yourself a favor, if you are reading these books for the first time, read them in the right order."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I somehow managed to make it through my childhood without ever coming across C.S. Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia. I had heard of the series but never read it, and it's only now as an adult that I have picked up \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". I knew a little going in; there was a magical land known as Narnia, it featured a lion, and somehow a wardrobe was invovled.The book centers around four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They have been sent away from London to escape the air raids of World War II and are staying at a professor's house in the country. While exploring the mansion one day, the youngest, Lucy, comes across an old cupboard that houses coats. Opening it up to hide in, she discovers that, rather than being an ordinary wardrobe, it is a gateway to a magical land called Narnia. There are many interesting creatures, from unicorns to giants, centaurs and dwarves. Sadly, Narnia has been put under a spell by an evil witch who has made it winter all the time - but never Christmas. The land is waiting to be freed, and freedom can only happen with a war against the witch and those on her side.Lucy eventually makes it back to the professor's house and quickly tells her siblings what she has seen. They don't believe her, even when Edmund accompanies her into the wardrobe on another adventure in the land. There, he is met and falls under the witch's spell. Eventually, all four siblings enter the magical land, where they participate in a battle to rid Narnia of the witch and restore Aslan as ruler of all.I've read commentary that the Chronicles of Narnia is a very religious series, and coming from a Christian perspective, I can agree. Aslan is definitely representative of Jesus Christ, and aspects of the story mimic biblical events. But this is something I was looking for as I was reading; if I hadn't been aware of it, I may not have made the connection. And, while this book isn't as vivid as, say, Harry Potter, it is still a great tale.Overall, while I was less than thrilled with \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", I can see the appeal to children. I am going to delve into the rest of the series to see what it's about; after all, it's a fast read and an interesting one at that."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The chronicles of Narnia is a book written by C.S. Lewis. The genre of this book is an adventure book. The name of the book comes from four young children's lives in a somewhat parallel universe as ours. I would say that the theme of the book is loyalty to your family. I enjoyed this story very much. It was a constant page turner for me. Every new page was sort of a new adventure for me and the characters alike. The story is written in a 3rd person point of view where the author not only tells of the story but talks to the reader as well. I enjoy this much more than a regular third person point of view. The authors voice to me sounds like an older man sitting by a fireplace telling you of this story that he came up with the previous night and was energetic to tell us. \\" There shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane ( for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\\" This is a quote from the book in which the author adds his own little thoughts, as if he were really telling us what was happening.The setting of the story takes place in a fictional world called Narnia. It is world filled with magic and mystical beings and talking animals. It is very much like the world we live in today with exception technology and regular humans. The writer makes you feel like your in the story. He does not use a lot of the seeing sense but much more of the others such as cold, harsh. hard, and pale. Narnia is mostly covered in snow and ice due to the Witch's rule. However there are parts of the land that are not affected. The parts that have not been affected by the cold is where her evil power has not yet reached.The main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy; going from oldest to youngest. Then there is of course the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch; the Queen of Narnia. You also have Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and a faun named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Lewis put a good deal of detail into each of his characters, even the non important ones. As I said in the first paragraph the theme is about loyalty to your family, Edmund, the second youngest of the four, dishonored his siblings and almost got them killed by a the Witch's police wolves.The story is essentially about the four children going into a magical wardrobe and ending up in a world called Narnia ruled by the Evil Witch. The kids are in danger and a very powerful lion comes and saves all of Narnia with the children from the Queen and restores balance among the Narnian world."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" illustrates the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ in assuming our penalty for our sins. Even though fanciful, it becomes a very moving account of giving of one's self for the benefit of others. C.S Lewis is a master author in the Christian faith."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia children's series is an excellent read not only for children and young adults, but for anyone who is fascinated with adventure, magic, mystery, friendship, and action. The first book in the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a wonderful tale of four siblings who live during WWII. The four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves living with their Uncle whom they have never met. While playing an innocent game of hide and seek, Lucy, the youngest of the four stumbles into a magical wardrobe. The wardrobe enters into a place called Narnia where it is never Christmas and always winter, animals talk, and an evil witch rules over the land. Lucy, her older sister and her two older brothers will enter Narnia and be known to the animals and magical people as the \\"sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve. The four learn that they have entered a world where evil has thrived and good has been forgotten. Until, they hear of a savior, a king, a lion named Aslan. The four must save the kingdom, fight evil and restore good.This first book is only the beginning of many adventures the four children will have in the land of Narnia. My promise is that if you read the first book, you will be hooked! C.S. Lewis again, has done a fantastic job in capturing magic, spiritual undertones and morals into a classic children's book series. You will NOT be disappointed! Enjoy:)"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I remember reading stories by C.S. Lewis when I was a kid and loving them.

As the teacher passed the books out to us I thought it was just going to be another one of those boring books that we have to read for school.

It is very good and it will keep your interest. A young girl finds a magical wardrobe that takes that little girl to a place called Narnia. Later, her brothers and sister finds out about that mysterious place and then the story goes on to an adventure that just never stops."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is probably one of the most popular fantasy books out there, especially for the younger set. When the movie came out (which I also loved) it just furthered the popularity of this series. While it can be read as a stand alone, I recommend reading the complete series for the full richness and history that is contained for the world of Narnia.When Lucky, Edmund, Peter, and Susan have to go to the countryside to escape the air raids and war, they stay with a kindly professor at his rather large house. There is plenty to explore, and it is on a rainy day that Lucy finds a magical doorway to another world, inside the wardrobe in a spare room. She quickly makes a friend in a faun and learns of the evil White Witch who fancies herself Queen of Narnia. The other children don't believe her about her adventures though, and this is even worse for her when Edmund comes through too but lies about it to the other children. Finally and quite by accident they all make it to Narnia and learn that they have been expected. Aslan, the great lion, wants to see them and they set out to meet him and help him with his fight against the White Witch. However, they experience a setback when Edmund defects to the witch's side and they feel sure that he is lost to them.The characters, despite this being a short book, are very well done. I love Lucy and think she is charming and sweet. Peter is rather noble and distant, and Edmund of course is a complete brat in the beginning of the book without hardly any redeeming qualities. The other characters are quite nice as well and it is easy to see that Aslan has a regal bearing.The writing is great and definitely the most appropriate for kids (adults might find the story a little rushed) and while there are battles there is not extreme violence in this book. In fact, the only thing I found offensive was Father Christmas saying women shouldn't fight in wars, but that could just be the small bit of feminist in me. There are Christian tones, but they aren't strong in voice and are rather just a background to the story itself. It is read more as a fantasy novel, and highly appropriate that way.I love the series and especially this book and read it over and over. I don't think I could ever tire of it. With all the fantasy novels out there, this is definitely one that should be read.The Lion The Witch and The WardrobeCopyright 1950206 pages (and my edition had black and white pictures as well)Review by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I grew up attending a private, Christian school and I was convinced that I had heard this story, and read it, enough times. I finally picked the book back up and was surprised how much I had forgotten and how many things I never picked up on before.This is a great book for all ages. For children, the story of Christ is presented in such a way that is easy to relate with and understand. For adults, C.S. Lewis has insights about who God is and how He relates to the world that will open your mind and heart. Using metaphor as a means to describe who God really is has fallen out of use, but it is a tool that can sneak around the most guarded defenses and penetrate souls better than any other.As I started the series again this time, I realized that the death and resurrection story would start the series. Many fantasy series contain this element, but normally as the climax to the series. Lewis includes it at the beginning. I don't know why he wrote the series this way, but I suspect it is because it reflects our own lives. The first thing we must learn about is Christ and his death and resurrection and saving power. Then we learn how God moved in the world before Christ, after Christ, and how He is moving now in our own lives. For that reason, even though I'm not done with the series yet, I like how Lewis starts with this story.One of my favorite quotes is from this book, and it was great to read it in the full context again.\\"He'll be coming and going. One day you'll see him and another you won't. He doesn't like being tied down-and of course he has other countries to attend to. It's quite all right. He'll often drop in. Only you mustn't press him. He's wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\\"This is well worth reading again if you have not read it recently, no matter your age.

Woven throughout the book are Christian themes, however, I believe you can still thoroughly enjoy this book even if you are not a Christian.

I look forward to reading the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series.The story is about four siblings that are sent away from London during the Nazi Germany bombing campaigns during WWII. They go to live with a professor at his large and strange house in the country. During a rainy day it is discovered that a wardrobe in an empty room leads to the new and strange land of Narnia. The four siblings then go on the adventure of their lives.I'm a 35 years old male and I don't know why, but I had never read any of The Chronicles of Narnia books by Mr. C.S. Lewis. After reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe what a shame it has been to not have read them before. My wife and I saw a trailer for the upcoming \`Chronicles' movie by Disney, Prince Caspian. We both thought it looked interesting and decided we should watch the first movie being The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe before seeing Prince Caspian. After reading some of the reviews of the book I decided it would be worth the time to actually read each of the books before seeing the corresponding movie which brings me to the place of reading The Lion... this weekend. Books are almost always better than their corresponding movies and I think it's important, if possible, to read the books first so your imagination can take over and you are not placing the faces and voices of the movie characters into the reading realm.

In this book, that is not so bad."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Allegory, fantasy, fairy tale--THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE works on the audience of children as a story, and extends its reach into the adult crowd with its unmistakable parallels to the story of Jesus Christ. C.S. Lewis wrote this--second chronologically in the series but the first written--for kids, but embedded within the tale is an allegory rich enough for the hardened academic, or theologian.The story of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and (especially) Lucy begins as the youngest of these children finds a gateway to Narnia, a magical world imperiled and imprisoned by a terrible witch. Only by fulfilling a prophecy and through the sacrifice of the great lion Aslan can the world be saved. Along the way, the reader will meet magical creatures, fight epic battles, endure unbearable betrayal, and witness the rebirth of a world. Returning through the other side of the wardrobe is like waking up from a dream (or, in the words of Tolkien's Frodo, \\"like falling asleep again\\").Along the way, Lewis also throws in a cameo appearance by Father Christmas--a real mistake, as this seems to allow trappings, or mythology, from the real world to shatter the whole invention of his own. It's a quibble, but it's also the reason why I can't give the book five stars.(This review posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"If you've never read a 'Chronicles of Narnia' book, you'll be surprised at what a quick read this is! Despite all the talk about 'Christian allegory' and other 'symbolism' that adults have tried to inject into Lewis' writing, the Narnia series, particularly this volume, is intended for kids above all else. The influences on 'Harry Potter' and other modern fantasy series are apparent. While Lewis' writing may lack a certain amount of polish in his descriptions, he manages to convey a lot of information in a relatively brief space, while leaving a lot to the reader's imagination. The four children are instantly likable(well, most of them are), and the various fantasy characters actually add something to the story than just comic relief.I'd never read this book til now, and wish I'd picked it up years earlier!Having read a bit about the other books in the series, I'm not sure if I'll continue. I found that 'Lion...' reached a logical ending point, and Lewis took the characters about as far as they could go. But 'Lion...' is best enjoyed as it was originally written; a nice fantasy story that will capture the attention of kids and grown-ups!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Overall, The Chronicles of Narnia is a very interesting book and I would recommend it to young readers who like fantasy stories. It has wonderful imagery and figurative language that makes a beautiful picture in your head. Also, the plot keeps you entertained, so you never put the book down. It's a quick read that you can finish in your spare time and you don't have to read all the books in the series to understand it. It can be a stand-alone book. The Chronicles of Narnia is a classic that I think everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"As Lucy stepps into the wardrobe, she steps into another world...Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves in a different world.

Loved it !"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Just imagine a wondrous land, which no other person has ever seen, with creatures beyond comparison. A vast war, a hideous queen, talking animals, a never-ending winter, and a mysterious prophecy. That is what C.S Lewis brings to life in his masterpiece, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe. He winds all of these supernatural events into one captivating tale, which is absolutely unbelievable.The magic all begins when four young children, Peter, Susan, Lucy, and their mischievous brother Edmund, discover a thrilling new land inside of a wardrobe called Narnia! Yet, the only problem is the White Witch is attempting to take over Narnia, by casting a spell over the entire land, and she plans to kill Aslan (the real king) in the process. It may sound like a short, typical story, but there are many, many more details. For instance, how Lucy meets a friendly faun (half goat, half man) and quickly befriends him. As soon as the other siblings enter the world of Narnia, they learn that the faun was taken captive (along with Edmund, but that appears later on). Oh, and when the children discover some talking beavers, they also discover a mystifying prophecy. And then how the White Witch's wolves (lead by the wolf Maugrim) soon find the beavers and the children, but luckily they do overcome the wolves. And did I mention a harsh, epic battle comes up between the Queen's Minotaurs and trolls, and Aslan's fauns and centaurs? Well, that happens too! Join the four children on their glorious adventure in the world on the other side of the wardrobe.However, sometimes a book's moral is more important than its events, and the moral in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that if you stay positive, cheerful, and if you forgive those who disobeyed you, you will always succeed. For example, Edmund ran away to the White Witches abode, and she took him captive, yet when he returned his brother and sisters forgave him.All in all, this book was a numinous fairy tale, which has every thing to do with family, loyalty, and absolute excellence. C.S. Lewis did it again, with his work of art, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. But, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was not his only masterpiece. He also wrote more books, all part of the series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" including The Magician's Nephew, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, and many more!!Read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and discover the magical land of Narnia!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The lion, the witch, and the wardrobeI'd like to introduce this book to you! I recommend this book because it's easy to read and understand. It's also the best book ever because it's about a magical place called Narnia. Well one day peters, Susan's, Lucy's, and Edmond's dad goes off to war and they are sent to a professor's house. Once they got there they get all settled then they play hide and seek. But Lucy found a wardrobe and went in it. Lucy has just found the magical land called Narnia.Well since you know about the book lets talk about the theme. In this book the theme is pretty much the same. It's magical. It's magical because Lucy finds Narnia in a wardrobe. The witch can make hot coco and Turkish delight with a flick. She can also freeze people. But the lion can unfreeze people with a blow of his breath. Now don't you think that's magical? Well I do.Now let's talk about the characters. First of all you would do the same thing as them. Well Lucy explores Narnia and talks to strange animals. Edmond talks to the witch and takes hot coco and Turkish delight from her. Peter not believing in Narnia but later becomes a king of the magical world. Then you have Susan who becomes a Queen of Narnia, but also helps the lion live. Now wouldn't you have done the same thing as them? Well I would have.Well now let's talk about what Narnia looks like. Well Narnia is a very wintry place. It has a lot of snow and it's very cold. It's also very icy. Well that's because there is a big river between Narnia and Aslam. Aslam is where the lion lives. That place is a very springy place. It's grassy and very warm. And it's very beautiful there just like Narnia.Well that's about it, one more thing though. Over all I hope you enjoy and like this book as much as I did. You feel like your there and it puts a great picture in your mind. This is the best book ever and you will find out why after reading it. Well that's it. So I'm out of here!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Lucy is the first child to go through the wardrobe to Narnia, but the other children(Peter, Edmund, and Susan) are soon to follow. The Narnia they find is locked in winter,under the spell of the White Witch. Edmund is captured, so the children, along withAslan, must save him, and the whole of Narnia. I would recommend this book to anyone.This book, along with the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series teaches verygood morals (the book was written by a Sunday school teacher). One of the morals itteaches is forgiveness. Peter and the others could have given up on Edmund forbetraying them, but they forgive him. And, the book teaches bravery, as was displayedthroughout the entire book, especially by Aslan.The religion implied in this book is very obvious. In the book, Lewis has madeAslan their god. In the book, Aslan came back to save Narnia, as the Christian \\"god\\" issaid will do. And, Aslan is very powerful, as we might expect a god to be.The Aslan character in this book is very interesting. As stated above, it is obviousthat Lewis has made him the god of Narnia. But, though he rises back, he dies forEdmund, who had betrayed the others.This book is good for anyone looking to read a good fiction. It was very exciting,and kept me reading. Also, many Christians would enjoy reading this book, to see all ofthe religion that is in the book. This was a very good book, along with the rest of theChronicles of Narnia series.-Bill L"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a wonderful, symbolizing story by C.S. Lewis. It deserves five stars with its greatly written story that keeps you turning pages one after another. The book can be classified as a wonderful fiction classic. The story is told by a narrator and without him/her telling the story, then we wouldn't get the full effect of the book that draws us into the characters. Lewisshows enthusiasm even through a narrator. He shows how other universes may exist a little bit closer than we may think.An entire story starts with one simple action: the turn of a wardrobe handle. When Lucy Pevensie opens a wardrobe door all she expects to find is a few hangers with coats, little did she know that she was totally wrong. She finds herself entering the world of Narnia: a world of magic and talking animals. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is set in Narnia; a world where a witch rules over the entire world, making it always winter and never Christmas. This is all because of the White Witch who will rule over Narnia until four children sit in the thrones at Cair Paravel. Most of the story happens because Lucy's brother Edmund betrays the family. Without this betrayal, the whole journey throughout Narnia would have been an easy and quick one. You should definitely read this book, no matter how old you are."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"One day Lucy Pevensie, accidentally, discovers a magic wardrobe-like portal into the magical land of Narnia. She meets a faun named Tumnus who kindly lets Lucy go after he tells her he intended on capturing her and giving her to the White Witch. Lucy then takes Edmund into Narnia with her where she loses Edmund who is put in a trance by the White Witch with magic Turkish delight. It makes him do anything to get another Turkish delight from her so he promises he'll bring his siblings: Peter, Lucy, and Susan to see her. Lucy and Edmund then meet up and leave Narnia. Then one day when the siblings are hiding from the housekeeper all four children enter Narnia together and decide to Tumnuse's house but find that the White Witch has arrested him from Mr. Beaver. They then join with Mr. Beaver to meet Aslan at the Stone Table the next day, but notice Edmund is gone. This is because Edmund has left to warn the White Witch about Aslan and Mr. Beaver's plan. Soon the Witch finds where Susan, Aslan, his followers, Peter, and Lucy are hiding, Aslan warns them in time so they see Aslan get tortured to death and stay with his dead body \`til morning where they see it is gone. Also they find the Stone Table broken in half. Then they see him and know he has risen from the dead. They all then fly to the Witch's castle. Peter's army is exhausted, but Aslan makes quick work of the Witch and Peter and his army finish off the followers of the Witch. Then everyone forgives Edmund and they become kings and Queens of Narnia for years. Finally they promise to return and leave through the wardrobe.One thing I liked about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that things are not always going well for the heroes. For instance, until the end Edmund is a follower of the Witch because he ate the Turkish delight. Another example at a point the only two together is Susan and Lucy. Peter took an army with him to go to fight the Witch and again Edmund was with the Witch. Even though he rises from the dead, Susan and Lucy watch Aslan get tortured to death. From this you can tell that the heroes' journey wasn't easy.Another interesting thing about this book was that there were a variety of characters. Like Tumnus the generous villain or the Witch the straight up villain.Edmund plays the good guy gone bad. Peter is the chosen one because he happens to be the oldest and the one Santa Claus gives the mystic sword. Aslan is the god-like character that is immortal never beaten or dead. As you can see there are characters of every kind in this story.I liked the whole setting, Narnia. I thought it was the perfect portrayal of a fantasy like world. You got talking beavers, flying lions, and an ice witch with a wand that turns things into stone and enchanted Turkish delights. Not to mention the way you travel to Narnia is through a magical wardrobe. Sounds as fantasy as it gets to me.Overall I think C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a very good book because I like to read books where the impossible happen. This book is definitely impossible in the world we know and reality. I recommend this book to all fantasy readers because you won't know what could happen on the next page."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book was great and it had a good theme. It made me feel good inside and made me feel like I could relate myself to the story and I could picture myself in the kids positions. I felt like I would once be in the same position, except for being in magical worlds. This book was so good I couldn't show how good it was in words. You should read this book and you will see how awesome it is. This book will make you want to read the other Chronicles of Narnia books"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I must admit that the title \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is not what compelled me to read this book. It seemed a bit too childish for me. I am familiar with some of Lewis's other work, but this is my first trip to Narnia. In preparation for the upcoming movie, I decided to make my first visit to Narnia.Four Children staying in a mostly empty house can give rise to numerous potential adventures. When a passage in a wardrobe closet leads to another world, a strange adventure is available to the children. Narnia, where it is always been winter since the white witch became queen, has been awaiting the fulfillment of a prophecy. When the four children arrive in fulfillment of the prophecy, they meet the mighty lion Aslan. The great strength of this lion can only originate from one source than allows the witch to ultimately be conquered and the four children to reign as kings and queens of Narnia.While this book is short and simplistic, the adventure has more than enough depth to capture the adult reader's attention. While books with fauns and talking animals are normally not on my reading list, I have a great appreciation for this book. There is certainly a reason this book has been treasured for more than fifty years and across generations of families."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"That is all I can say about thiis book. It is a book that you will never forget. C.S. Lewis is one of the most talented and wonderful authors that ever lived. After you read this book you will want to start it all over again.

I especially love reading these books.. doesn't matter which one, snuggled under a warm blanket sitting in my rocking chair in front of the fireplace with of course snacks and hot chocolate. u should try it.. it's fulfilling."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"HarperCollins' renumbering of the Chronicles of Narnia is a disgusting desecration of a great work of literature. As far as I can tell, Lewis never instructed his publisher to reorder the series, he merely mentioned casually in a letter that it would be okay to read them chronologically. That hardly constitutes a statement of \\"the original wishes of the author,\\" as HarperCollins claims.The editors at HarperCollins seem to think that the children for whom these books were intended are so unintelligent that they would get too confused if they were to read them in the order in which Lewis wrote them. Never mind the fact that millions of children have thoroughly enjoyed them in the their original order for half a century.Next thing you know, HarperCollins will be reordering the chapters in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey because modern readers must be too stupid to follow them as they have been read for over two thousand years.If you are new to the Chronicles of Narnia, do yourself a favor: get a permanent marker, blackout the numbers on your books, and re-renumber them back to their original order:1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe2) Prince Caspian3) The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4) The Silver Chair5) The Horse and His Boy6) The Magician's Nephew7) The Last Battle"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the supreme treasures of all English literature--a wonder in childhood, at coming of age, in adulthood, and in old age. It is also a bringer of hope and a force for good in a world where despair and evil are present and need resisting. It is one of the best gifts you can give a child, a friend, or yourself.You should definitely note, however, that the publisher of this and some other recent editions has made a moronic and despicable decision to change the order in which Lewis intended the books in the series to be read. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" is the first book in The Chronicles, and the way Lewis intended his readers to first encounter Narnia. \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" the next-to-last book in the series as Lewis wrote it, is a sort of flashback in Narnia's history, and the events related in it take place earlier than those in \\"LWW\\" in a chronological sense. IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ \\"THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE\\" FIRST, AND TO READ \\"THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW\\" SIXTH, AS LEWIS INTENDED. CHANGING THE ORDER CHANGES THE WHOLE TONE AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE STORY FOR THE WORSE. Don't let the delusion of the publisher's staff that they somehow outrank C.S. Lewis in literary and artistic judgment rob you of the best possible experiencing of this masterpiece--READ LWW FIRST!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This was one of the first in a myriad of novels that I first explored in the infancy of my interests in literature. I enjoyed reading this book at the prepubescent stage of my life because the children in the book were reminiscent of contemporary children but they exhibited aspects of children coping with a terrible situation, such as war and they sough escape through the wardrobe. The novel began in war-torn times and created a wonderful dream world to alleviate the pain of reality.The fascinating part of the novel that takes you away from the terrible reality is that the animals in the book talk and are presented with real human emotions. Somehow animals explain emotion turmoil and loss in life when the people characters were lackluster and stoic. Soon the children gradually grow up through their contact with animals in the dreamscape of their imagination. Narnia is a place where issues that are difficult to grapple with in reality are skillfully explained and dealt with in the imaginative and creative world of a child's mind."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"How much do I love this book. I recently revisited it and had the experience of reading it out loud to my nephew (7) and niece (5). I hadn't read it for quite a few years and, although I still know the story well, there were parts of the book that had faded with the passing of time and were brought back to life with the re-reading of the book, as tends to happen.For instance - I'd completely forgotten the feeling of complete joy and wonder when Aslan bounds over the wall of the Queen's courtyard and begins to breathe life back into the statues there. I'd forgotten good old Rumblebuffin and how much he made me laugh. I'd forgotten that, in spite of what the movies do, the battle scene was fleeting and over so quickly because the focus of this book is not on the grim trials of war but rather on the redemption of the living creatures spoken of.While reading through the story and watching my niece and nephew sink into despair at Aslan's death I felt again the pang of sorrow I felt as a child. After we'd finished the chapter my nephew looked at the title of the next, being \\"The Triumph of the Witch\\" and he gasped in shock. \\"But, she doesn't win.. does she, Aunt?\\" he asked.He learned quickly that in spite of her best efforts.. in this beautiful, wonderful story.. of course evil does not win. If you haven't read this book in a while I invite you to re-visit it.

Being that I began my journey into the world of fantasy with reading the Harry Potter books, I did not grow up with The Chronicles of Narnia like many of us have.After seeing the movie version of this book, I decided to read these books in chronological order (starting with \\"The Magicians Nephew\\"), and my first journey in Narnia was a pleasant one. When I picked up the second issue of The Chronicles of Narnia, the renowned classic \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" I was interested to see if it lived up to the constant praise it received.Again I insist, this book is very enjoyable-- it is not, in my mind, worthy of being called a classic. Narnia is a refreshing world that is beautifully described... when Lewis takes the time TO describe it, that is. This book could have easily spanned 300 or more pages, but instead it is crammed into 189 pages, which do not have enough room for the words needed to thoroughly describe the beautiful world of Narnia. The characters suffer as well, for we hardly get to know any of them or their motivations, and the climatic battle of Aslan's army against the White Witch's lasts for only about one page! This may be the only time this sentence will ever apply, but the MOVIE has a great amount more detail then the book, and allows you to get to know the characters much better.However, I am not saying this is a bad book. While Lewis's use of the word \\"presently\\" becomes so often that it grows to be annoying, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and I plan to keep reading The Chronicles of Narnia in hopes to one day have the whole collection. I definitely do recommend this book, but I also warn the readers not to expect a classic like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.While I don't enjoy Lord of the Rings as much as Harry Potter, I see why it is a classic, from the beautifully descriptive writing to the twisting plot, but \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" falls short of this. One last time, I will restate that while this book doesn't live up to the hype, it is ENJOYABLE and makes the reader smile often.PS: It is a great story to be read aloud!!6/10"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a wonderfull adventure story, but also a sad story .

Though the wrapping paper of the gift that Lewis gave us in \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is itself quite nice (an approach fully and wonderfully informed by early to mid twentieth century British life), it is the gift inside of the wrapping that is the true source of the book's power. Neither unnecessarily subtle nor offensively overbearing, the Christian allegory that Lewis unfolds is strong enough to be apparent to one accustomed to Christian narrative and imagery while not so blunt as to take away from the reading experience of one without such a frame of reference. And, bonus of bonuses, it is all rolled out in an exciting adventure that is able to engage and entertain all manner of reader. 5 stars and more if more could be given."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"About 60 years ago during World War 2 this story begins.

Although the story may be weird because Narnia stands in a cupboard in which Lucy enters it first while playing hide-and-seek. But this book does not go on with everyone believing that Narnia exists but Lucy's elder siblings espcially find it most peculiar but the Professor ,believed, to be more logical believes that Narnia may exists due to certain factors that is the time journey and Lucy's truthfulness.

One day, Lucy, the youngest, stumbles across a magical wardrobe which leads to the mystic land of Narnia. In Narnia, it has always been winter, but never Christmas, since the White Witch's cruel reign. They meet new friends and discover the secrets of Narnia. During their adventures, they meet the true king of Narnia, Aslan. Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy join Aslan and the other Narnians to fight the White Witch and save Narnia from an eternal winter...but will they succeed?The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of the best fiction books I've ever read. It is full of great morals and it's fun to read. It is also a really good book for Christians as it portrays the Bible. This book is so absorbing and C.S. Lewis makes you feel as if you're there watching everything happen. I enjoyed the book so much and there was nothing I didn't like about it.

Lewis is an excellent but easy, read chapter book. I recommend this book to people of all ages because they can either read it by themselves or get it read to them. People who like adventure type books and chapters that leave you thinking, then this book is the book for you. Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter, the main characters, get sent to a far away home because of the London war. Later Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads to a secret place. In this secret place there is a White Witch that makes it always winter. Lucy, Susan, and Peter have to get to the Stone Table to meet Aslan to fight the White Witch, to try and get their brother back.Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan made the Chronicles of Narnia very interesting because the characters were detailed by the author and he told a lot about them. Peter is the oldest and he tries to keep everybody together and try to help them. Susan is the second oldest. She helps Peter take care of Lucy and Edmund too. Lucy is the youngest. She is very cute and funny. Edmund is the next youngest. He tends to boss Lucy around. The characters all turn out to help each other in the end.Next, the theme of the book helped bring the characters together to fight the White Witch. The characters went through a lot of change of the different worlds, seasons, and the people who the characters had to live with. The book was terrific because of the theme of the book.The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a different type of book which made the setting tell a lot about what happened where. The book is in a different world so it makes you think in a different way. The wardrobe is wooden and filled with fur coats. The woods were filled with animals that are mostly in a fantasy book. The time frame is the present and in about one to two days. The author describes the book so much and well that it looks like the time frame is in weeks.Therefore I believe that this book is all about change. The characters go through different changes during the book. The characters are different then other characters in other books because all of the animals in the book talk. The setting describes where they are all of the time very well. Every one of those things helps make this novel very splended."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the WardrobeIn the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. Four brave kids leave London because of the war. They live in a house and find a wardrobe. That leads into a magical land. Which is called Narnia and along the way one meats a lady that has strange powers. The kids have to save Narnia the Lady doesn't want them too so she try's to kill them. I recommend the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe for all ages because it has adventure, action pack, and funny.The four main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. One statement about the characters is. Peter is the oldest and he is trying to be the leader but he finds out it is hard work. Susan is the seconded oldest she is trying to be the smartest and trying to keep the family together. Edmund is trouble but he wants to do good. Lucy is showing faith, Loyalty, trust to her friends and family.The theme of the book was based on power. The main power was between Aslan and the White Witch. Alsan was the true ruler of Narnia. The White Witch was the flase Queen of Narnia. The main struggle was who was going to rule Narnia.The setting started in London and was almost destroyed by war. When thet moved to the country and was untouched by war. When they were in Narnia it was beautiful but was going to be soon toched by war.In conclusion, I feel like I Was there. It made me think about how the kids felt when they were gone from home. Every page you turn has some sort of adventure in it.

Lewis wrote in the Chronicles of Narnia series in the early 1950's. The story is of the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. The children are sent into the country during the bombing raids on London in World War II. The children arrive at the estate of the eccentric Professor Kirke. On a rainy day with nothing to do the children decide to play a game of hide and seek. As the children are hiding Lucy stumbles upon a room whose only contents are a blueglass bottle and and old wardrobe. Lucy chooses the wardrobe for a hiding place however as she manuevers through it she is magically transported to the land of Narnia, where it is always winter but never Christmas. In Narnia she meets the faun, Mr. Tumnus who tells her of the White Witches magical enchantment over Narnia and of the prophecy of Cair Parivel/Aslan's return which will bring the reign of the White Witch to its end. This is as far as I am going to go in giving away the plot of the book. This book is Number 2 in the series the Chronicles of Narnia. I would suggest when reading the books to read them in the order which Lewis wrote them. This story will delight both young and old alike. It is a classic to read over and over again with your family."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy think that they will get away with all sorts of mischief when they are sent away to the country during the London air-raids, where they will stay with an elderly Professor, and his assortment of household help, in a dilapidated old mansion. But not one of the four children could have ever imagined that they would be transported to a strange, faraway land known as Narnia. Lucy is the first to discover the strange place, when she looks into a wardrobe, and is quickly walking through ankle-deep snow, and cavorting with a Faun named Tumnus. When she returns from her journey, she is shocked to find that her older siblings think she is making up lies, and even more shocked to find that Edmund - who discovers Narnia and the White Witch at a later time - lies when his siblings question about his journey there. But when all four children find their way to the strange land, and find that Lucy's friend, Tumnus, has been seized by the White Witch, the four children believe that it is their duty to rescue him, and quickly find themselves immersed in adventure, statues, talking animals, a great lion, and a battle.I have heard about THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA for years, and while I saw the BBC version of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE years ago, I never read the book. That is, until I heard about the new Disney film being created from this book. I found that from page one I was deeply immersed in this story, and interested to find what would happen to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - all very enjoyable characters, by the way. C.S. Lewis weaves an enchanting story that will keep readers enamored for hours, as they accompany the four youngsters on their adventures through the mystical land of Narnia. A fascinating story that will enchant readers of all ages - especially those who accompanied Alice through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll's ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I first encountered C.S.Lewis when 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was read aloud to my class, over the period of a term, by our teacher in 1969 when I was eight years old. Of course I, like millions of other children over the past fifty years, did not recognise the Christian parable. To us it was just a story. But now, as a forty-four year old man and a C.S.Lewis devotee, I am of course aware of it's intended 'other meaning'.However, that aside, I think back to 1969, and can clearly remember as a child, how I and my classmates received it as 'just a story'. We were absolutely enchanted. Whenever the weekly lesson started during which our teacher would read a chapter or two from the book, I remember, as she began, having butterflies in my stomach. Throughout my childhood no other literary work ever came so close to literally giving me a glimpse of magic. Although we were unaware of it's christian meaning I believe, in hindsight, that what so captivated us was indeed it's deep spirituality which reached out, through the storyline and the characters involved, and entered our very souls. I do not think it is inappropriate of me to suggest (even accounting for my partisan leanings of being a huge Lewis fan) that, whilst such literature is available, a childhood that is allowed to pass without being given a similar such glimpse of something so fundamentally enchanting, has been deprived of something very important."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This c.d. was a complete life saver on our summer driving/camping holiday. Our six year old son was completely enraptured by the characters and the plot. There were moral lessons to learn but of course fabulous evil characters, good guys and battle scenes as well. The narrator, Michael York, did a great job of giving each character a unique voice. When we paused in our listening we had plenty of fodder for some unique discussions. Infact this c.d. stood up to two rounds of listening over a two week driving trip."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe is about four children whose names are Peter,Susan, Edmund and Lucy.

The professor had strict rules about the house such as what not to do and where you shouldn't go. While they were at his house they decided to play hide and go seek in the house. When the youngest child Lucy decided to hide in one of the forbidden rooms, which had nothing but a large figure with a sheet over it. Lucy wanted to see what it was so she took off the sheet to find a beautiful wardrobe laying there in front of her. She decided to hide inside of it and when she opened it she found something amazing inside of the wardrobe.Which is what leads to the whole adventure of the four children.The Lion, The Witch, and The wardrobe is a great book for people who love fantasy or Lord of The Rings.

The struggle between good and evil has prompted many discussions after reading the book. I'm a fan, and each year the series prompts many of my students to go find the box set.

The story begins when Lucy discovers the Land of Narnia. Lucy tells everyone about the Wardrobe but no one believes her. Edmund discovers Narnia and meets Lucy there. When Lucy and Edmund came out of Narnia, Lucy told Edmund to tell the others about Narnia, but he said that Lucy was making it up. So, Lucy gets mad at him. One day a lady came to the house to show people the huge house. When the kids hide from the lady they hide in the wardrobe and then walk into the land of Narnia. When they are in Narnia they find two beavers and they invite the children over to have tea. All the sudden they realize that Edmund was missing! They go out looking for him. They all know that he went to find the White Witch because that's where he went the first time he was in the wardrobe. While the kids were looking for him they went to the stone table and meet Aslan (the lion). When Aslan came everything turned into spring. Then Aslan helped the kids find Edmund and get him back from the Witch. But in order to do that Aslan had to sacrifice his life and the Witch kills him. But Aslan came back to life and let out a big ROAR! Lucy and Susan hopped on his back and road all the way back to town. If you want to find out if Aslan and Narnia win the war or the White Witch and her evil crew wins you are going to have to check this book out and read it. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The title of this book is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. The authors name is C.S. Lewis. I give it 4 stars.I gave it this amount of stars because the book is packed with very many details such as: Aslan was a big lion with a large gold main and huge paws. I also enjoyed how Aslan was raised from the dead and the stone table breaks. That is just like the bible. Aslan was sacrificed to save Edmond and Jesus died to save everyone. They were both then raised from the dead. They conquered the bad guy and good prevailed. They then went away. It really had me on the edge of my seat when the White Witch took over Edmond and tried to kill all of the other \\"Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve\\". She also turned all of the people or animals that crossed her into stone. She thought that she was the queen of Narnia but she was really and evil dictator that wanted to take over Narnia.My favorite part of the book is the battle. I thought it was very cool how Susan (one of the four kids, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy) shot an arrow at a pheonix and it lit on fire and made a wall of fire to prevent the Witch from getting to them. It really stunned me that the polar bears swung their heads and it took out the entire wall of fire! Then Aslan showed up with an entire new part of their army. They went to the witches house and \\"destoned\\" them all. In the end....I would also recommend any other books writen by this author because he is an amazing writer. Also, the books by Dan Brown are very good.

Now, the four children found themselves in a mystical world called Narnia. The children were amazed to see tiny snowflakes falling, creating a white blanket of snow covering land farther than they could see. Back at the house they came from, it was a rainy spring day. But what the children didn't know is that there were many adventures ahead of them to be explored in this white winter land.As I read this book, it kept my interest because the writing is fluent and intriguing. The book includes vivid verbs such as, vanishing, stooped, and swish. As well, C. S. Lewis uses great adjectives, like filthy, sulkily, and dreadful. C.S. writes so descriptively that it paints a picture in your mind. The book is also packed with excitement and adventure. There are suspenseful parts where you just can't put down the book. There are battles, there are creatures being turned into stones, and there are kidnappings.Over all, this is a very intriguing book that keeps you involved in exhilarating adventure.

There are of course other scene I would love to tell you all about but that would ruin the story. so I tell you go and read it because this is one of the best books I have ever read.[and I'm really not kidding.] So what are you waiting for GO AND READ!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Four children are sent to live away from home during a war, and stumble upon much more than they had anticipated.While playing a game of hide-and-seek, the youngest girl, Lucy, hides in a wardrobe. What seems like the perfect hiding place eventually turns into a wonderful, mythical land filled with all sorts of strange beasts and talking animals. There are centaurs, giants, and fauns; some animals I can't even really imagine.Upon her return from the fantasy world, nobody believes her story. In fact, nobody noticed she was gone. In the alternate world of Narnia, time is not related to time as we know it.Eventually, her brother Edmund (who I hated from nearly the first mention of his name) follows her through the wardrobe. The plot thickens when Ed meets up with the White Witch. She befriends him because of her fear for a prophecy that four children of Adam and Eve leading to her downfall.From there, the story seamlessly follows the four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they travel through Narnia. They learn that Lucy's friend, a faun named Mr. Tumnus, has been taken captive by the White Witch. While Lucy feels compelled to help, the others are not all that interested; except Edmund, who is interested because of the pact he made with the White Witch to deliver all four children to her castle.Edmund betrays his family and goes the Witch. What follows is an epic tale of the struggle between good and evil, ubiquitous Christian allegory, and the inevitable happy ending.There are shocks, surprises, twists, and laughs. Perhaps the most important aspect of the story is the great leader Aslan, who is pure, and represents all that is wonderful (a not-so-subtle representation of Jesus). It's not overbearing as some would assume, but it's definitely there. Aslan teaches, nurtures, chastises, and leads. He gives selflessly, and fights for all that is pure and just.The story is easy to read, allowing the reader to imagine, to become involved with the story. You'll immediately love certain characters and take sides.I highly recommend this book to fans of fiction, and anyone who wants to read a great story. It's a wonderful book that transcends age and genre."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"When we read this in for our Book Group it was difficult to find a good list of discussion questions. Here is the list I compiled from questions I found on the internet. I hope this helps your book group!1) Many of Narnia's fantastical creatures are personified; name some of them. Which human qualities are most celebrated? Which are not?2) Elements of fantasy and real life are intermingled in the worlds of Narnia and \\"reality\\". What makes these worlds different from each other?3) Although they are children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have very distinct personalities. By portraying them the way he did, what messages might Lewis have been sending to children about human behavior.4) Each of the children undergoes some changes throughout the course of the novel. Discuss how these changes impact their characters.5) Symbolism is quite prevalent in this book. Discuss what Narnia and Aslan symbolize and how their portrayals shape Lewis's message. Who or what else is symbolic? How?6) In agreeing to sacrifice himself in Edmund's place without divulging to the White Witch theat he could return, Aslan might be considered somewhat deceitful. What other variances are there on the traditional definitions of good and evil?10) Aslan sternly reminds Peter to cleand his sword after he kills Maugrim. Why was cleaning his sword so important?7) When Lucy tries to minister to her wounded brother, Aslan hurries her along to tend to others. Does the theme of the greater food vs. the individual arise elsewhere in the story? What other themes arise?8) The Pevensie children leave London during World War II because the city they live in is being bombed. Yet Narnia they fought in a war. Do you find this ironic? -Talk about this.11) In Chapter 10 the children meet Father Christmas. How is he like the traditional image of Santa Clause? How is he different? What does he seem to represent?9) Notice the titles of Mr. Timnus' books. Do any of them strike you as strange or humorous? Why?12) The children are each given a gift by Father Christmas. Whose gift would you most like to have? Which do you think is most useful? Elaborate.13) In Chapter 7 the children hear about Aslan for the first time. Describe how each of them feels when they first hear about him. Why do you suppose they react so differently?14) Some readers think that there are parallels to the liberation of the stone statues in Chapter 16. They point to passages like Matt. 27: 52-54; Eph. 4:7-10. Do you see any similarities?15) In Chapter 17 the children (as adults) go after the White Stag. What do you think it represents in the story?16) Do you think it's an accident that the children return to England when they do? Why, or why not?17) Discuss the relationship of time in Narnia to the time in the children's world. How does it work for the children to grow into adults in Narnia, then returned to children in England?18) In the beginning the children have trouble with Lucy's claims that she has been to Narnia. What does the Professor say about this? How does he apply logic to this situation?19) Throughout the book there is a paradox about Aslan, which the Beavers describe as \\"good and terrible\\". Compare what they say about Aslan with what is said about God in the Bible.20) Aslan tells Mr. Beaver (p.137) \\"All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about noises. Speculate on what he might mean by this.21) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, was written as a children's book.

Actually, all of Lewis's books have an agenda. It is a religious agenda, and the story does kind of get bogged down in it. So this book is actually perfect if you yourself are religious and are looking to share it with your kid, but I was not looking for religion and when I found it I was sort of disappointed. Why couldn't Aslan just be Aslan? Why did Lewis have to go and bring Jesus into the picture?That being said, this story is lovely minus all the religious stuff. It tells the story of four children who walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a fantastical new land, filled with fauns and witches and whispering trees. Aslan, by the way, is the lion who is the mysterious ruler of this place called Narnia. He has not been seen for many years, and subsequently, the evil witch has imposed winter on the Narnians for one hundred years. The story ran through my head nicely, and it was actually a good fantasy book. The metaphor behind it was just slightly disconcerting in its blatantness.If you're an adult and you loved the Chronicles of Narnia, read The Magician by Lev Grossman. It's an adult fantasy, and it is GREAT."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I've read this book two times and it hasn't gotten old at all.

This is a hardcover with dustjacket and includes one color illustration of Aslan playing with Susan and Lucy. The first few pages are different but the story printing on each page coincides with the first edition. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is there are several pages in the story where the ink must have been running short on the printer because some of the words are difficult to make out. Also, the book boards are covered with paper not cloth and the pages are glued not sewn. The Chronicles of Narnia have such a huge following.

York brings each character to life with his vocal inflections, his use of dynamics (loud and soft voicings) and best of all, his mastery of various accents--British, Irish and Scottish--given to the different characters. Here each &quot;person&quot; has a vivid personality, and the listener can easily picture them in his or her mind.We've enjoyed the Focus on the Family dramatization, as well as the BBC version, in the past, but I'd prefer to hear the unabridged text of this C.S. Lewis classic fantasy, with its spiritual and allegorical undertones. We've read this story aloud several times in our family over the years, but I believe that, from now on, we'll let Michael York read it to us.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"A long time ago, four children found a magical world beyond (what they thought was) an ordinary wardrobe. This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia. I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than three hours because it was so interesting and captivating. this is now my favorite book. After I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I bought the other books in the series. I recommend that others do too. I enjoyed reading this book and then the Magician's Nephew. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is a lion that comes to save Narnia from the White Witch. Aslan is very courageous. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She made Narnia always winter but never Christmas. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were crowned Kings and Queens. Peter was crowned King Peter the Magnificent. Susan was crowned Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was crowned King Edmund the Just, and Lucy was crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he lied and said he had never been there. I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination.

S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first of the seven Chronicles of Narnia by unequaled English author C.S. Lewis. These books are able to accomplish something that few other books in all of literature have been able to achieve. They are able to be at once great and entertaining literature as well as insightful and profound theology. They are fun and inspiring. Tolkien, Lewis's model McDonald, and a few others achieve some variation of it, but none quite like Lewis.The story unfolds with the four Pevensie children being sent to live with an eccentric old professor in the country, in order to be out of London during the bombing. The house turns out to be as interesting as the professor, and soon the kids find their way to an alternate world where some of the animals can talk and fairy-tales come to life. Not just the fun characters, either, but witches as well, in fact one has the land of Narnia under a spell where it's \\"always winter but never Christmas\\". The kids become the focal point for a classic good versus evil struggle, but with heavy though never pedantic theological lessons. And the king of Narnia, the lion who is the son of the Emperor-over-the-Sea, is just fantastic. Highly, highly recommended for kids and adults."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"...a book worth reading ONLY in childhood is not worth reading even then.\\" ~C.S. LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming. Giving away the plot of the book is spoiling the pleasure of reading. And this book is definitely worth reading.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\". Available on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I teach this novel to fifth graders and loved having an audio rendition of the novel that included a differentiation of the readers voice to indicate the character speaking. Highly recommend this audio cd."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"In my humble opinion, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is the finest children's story of the past century. The story contains both enormously imaginative touches combined with childlike simplicity, and the solid yet uncomplex prose belies a story of great sophistication. It also is a story intended for children, yet so respectful of their intelligence that adults can read it with equal appreciation.There should be absolutely no controversy about where this novel should come in the seven-novel sequence that comprises The Chronicle of Narnia: it is the first, and it is required to be the first both by the quality of the novel and by the way it fits into the overall structure of the series. Shifting it from the first spot in the series to the second is quite possibly the worst publishing decision of which I am aware. The justification for the change is exceedingly weak. A child wrote Lewis saying that in their opinion the series should be read beginning with THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which tells, among other things, of the creation of Narnia. Therefore, they felt that THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW should be the first and THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE second, with a subsequent reordering of the other books to reflect the chronology of Narnia instead of the kids that discover Narnia. Lewis replied that he agreed, and this agreement is used as the excuse to reorder the books. I have two huge problems with this. First, my guess is that Lewis was, as a wise adult will often do, affirming the child rather than stating his conviction that the books should be reordered. Second, even if Lewis did think the books should be reordered, it is not clear that he actually would have authorized it actually being done, nor that he would have resisted the efforts of any decent publisher to point out to him that reordering was a dreadful idea. Why? Because what is so magical about the original ordering of the series is that it focuses on the extremely subjective experience of the discovery of Narnia by children. The original order maintains a chronology based on its exploration and discovery by children and in reading the books that is going to be the concern of any child or childlike adult in reading the story. Who cares about the narrative from the standpoint of Narnia when the far greater concern is the narrative from the standpoint of children? A lesser but still pertinent criticism of the reordering is that it places one of the weakest novels in the sequence in the first position. When I first read the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEWPHEW was, along with THE SILVER CHAIR and A HORSE AND HIS BOY, the weakest stories in the sequence. Why put your worst foot forward? The Narnia books are about to be made into a series of feature films by the Disney studios, and they have quite correctly decided to film the books in the original and correct order.As noted initially, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a nearly perfect story. The manner in which the children first discover Narnia, by entering it through the back of an ordinary wardrobe, is the most exciting entrance into a magical land at least since THE WIZARD OF OZ and probably ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. What they discover is a land under the worst of all possible curses: it is always winter, but never gets to be Christmas. The land is temporarily ruled by a beautiful but evil witch who entices children with Turkish Delight. As literature it is all so delightfully perfect, and one marvels that an enormously literate Oxford don could have written it, though perhaps not so surprising when remembering that another Oxford professor, the mathematician and logician Rev. Charles L. Dodgson, wrote ALICE IN WONDERLAND under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll.Of course, Narnia isn't really ruled by the witch, but by a magnificent, enormous lion by the name of Aslan, who, as we are often reminded, is not a tame lion. Anyone reading Narnia will instant recognize a host of parallels between Aslan and Jesus, known as the Lion of Judah, but Lewis cautioned that no one should imagine Aslan a mere Christ figure: he is Lewis's conception of what Christ would have been like had he been incarnated into a magical land called Narnia as a great lion. During the course of the book Lewis retells the story of the death and resurrection of Christ through the character of Aslan, yet he ever gets to the point of preaching or dogmatism. A very close friend of mine, raised Jewish, was aware of the Christ overtones of the story, yet still declared that it was her favorite book as a child.This is also one of the books with the largest potential audience of which I know. I first read and loved it in college, but elementary school children can delight in reading it, and even younger children can love having it read to them. And it would take a pretty somber and sober adult to not be seduced by its beautiful simplicity. Absolutely no one should deny themselves the joys of exploring Narnia, but make sure you start your tour with this book and not another."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"There are a very few treasures in this world that never lose their magic. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of them. It has been almost twenty years since I first read this book, and I still get goose bumps. It's not one of the deepest or most poetic pieces of literature, but it is truly one of the most magical. \\"Magical\\" is really the word to describe this enchanting novel. It's very, very simplistic as it works its powers on the child imagination. A wardrobe that is a door into a magic realm that needs to be saved from eternal winter. Even after many readings and many years, I still feel the beauty and the darkness of the book. I still get a little freaked out by the paranoia of the trees listening in. And I still feel the incredible power and joy of the melting snows. C.S. Lewis' masterpiece is deceptively simple. He takes the ordinary and turns it into pure magic. He plays with the child's imagination. He creates darkness in simplicity. The simplicity is enchanting rather than dull. The characters are fantastic and utterly charmingly enchanting, from the brat and betrayer Edmund (my favorite) to the kind goodness of Lucy to the sympathetic and conflicted Mr. Tumnus the faun to the frightening and awe-inspiring Aslan and the White Witch. The simple and allegorical story of saving Narnia through sacrifice and redemption isn't really the point. The point is the magic of it all. One of my all time favorite books. One of the books that formed my imagination and my brain. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"After reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time at age 31, I sat and asked myself what I really thought of it. I think one of the main things that I felt was disappointment. Not in the book itself, but mainly with myself for not reading it when I was much younger. I truly enjoyed the tale that Lewis has woven, but I think that a lot of the magic is lost by reading it for the first time as an adult.The story itself is solid and I enjoy the narrative tone of it and the references back to the reader by the author as he tells his tale. As an adult, I did notice a fair amount of simplicity in the writing (I'm used to reading novels with much more detail) but not in a negative way. Overly wordy and descriptive narrative can sometimes undermine the smooth flow of a simple story line, and that might have been the case here had Lewis gotten too detailed.I am looking forward to continuing my maiden voyage into Narnia and am eagerly waiting to see what adventures lie ahead."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones. This time we started with the first book, which I think is named \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than \\"Wardrobe.\\" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.But returning to \\"Wardrobe\\" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from \\"Nephew,\\" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the \\"Narnia\\" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,\\" and from me that is saying worlds.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This Review is for the HarperCollins hardcover edition of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". This printing uses the original text from the British edition of the book, rather than include the changes that C.S. Lewis made prior to the publication of the American edition.In 1950, C. S. Lewis's first book of The Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was published. This book would later be considered the 2nd in the series' internal chronology. If you are coming to this book after seeing the movie version as I did, you will find that it is aimed at a younger audience. This book serves well as an introduction to the fantasy genre for young readers. At a little under 200 pages, it is a fairly quick read. In 2001, it was nominated for the Retro Hugo for novels published in the year 1950.The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie) who are sent out of London during World War II to the English midlands to keep them safe. There they stay in a Professor's large house. While exploring the house, they find a room with just a single Wardrobe in it, which Lucy soon finds sometimes acts as a doorway to Narnia.The other children don't believe her at first, but later when trying to hide from the housekeeper they are all find themselves in the mystical land of Narnia. They find that Narnia is in a perpetual winter without Christmas, caused by the White Witch who claims to be the Queen of Narnia. They soon learn that they are prophesized to bring an end to the evil of the White Witch, and they learn of Aslan, a great lion and leader who has returned to the land and who is the true King of Narnia.Much has been written of the use of Christian themes which run through the story. Some of them are quite obvious, such as the references to the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, and the winters without Christmas. Others are a bit more subtle such as the betrayal, death, and resurrection stories. Lewis also drew on other mythology though, such as Norse and Greek in some of the creatures which inhabit Narnia. In any event, the Christian themes are not too heavy handed, and the book can easily be enjoyed by readers of any faith for what it is, a fantasy.The overall result is a fun light read for young readers. As the age of the reader goes up, the amount of enjoyment will undoubtedly go down, as this story lacks the detail and texture which can be found in Lewis's contemporary's work \\"The Hobbit\\" by J. R. R. Tolkien. There are also some rather odd passages in the book, such as references to problems with Edmund which had never been discussed earlier and an inconsistency with regards to repeated travels to Narnia. These flaws are minor though, and this work is deservedly considered a classic."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis are great children's books. They are easy to read and interesting. In The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, it starts out with Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter having to go live with their uncle because of the war and air raids from Germany. One day while playing hide and seek in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and finds herself in another world; Narnia. She meets a fawn and becomes friends with him. He warns Lucy of the White Witch warning her of her power. When Lucy returns to her world, her siblings don't believe her but later on all hide in the wardrobe and walk into Narnia. Edmund betrays his siblings and sides with the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. They run around, following Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, trying to hide from the White Witch while trying to meet Aslan, the lion at the Stone Table. Aslan talks to Edmund and settles for him to never betray them again. The queen does not want the children to be in Narnia because of the prophecy that says that four people will take over Narnia and overthrow the queen. There is a battle over Narnia between the children and the Witch. The children win and become the rulers of Narnia.Unlike most books it is interesting from the beginning, and keeps you interested. I usually don't like fantasy fiction books, but this is a good one. There are adventures involved, which can get children into a book. I didn't get the characters mixed up as I usually do in a book. The story is descriptive enough to get a picture in your head but doesn't go on for three pages about the scenery.I read this book when I was in about 6th grade, and honestly I enjoyed it more now as a teenager because I understood more of it. I would not usually pick up a book for fun and read it, but I would recommend this book to readers because it is simple and to the point, and interesting. I have the sequels and may read those to find out what happens next in Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was a great children's book. The adventures of Lucy, Edmond, Susan and Peter started when they had to move to their grandfather's house due to a war going in London. As they were playing a game of hide and seek they stumbled upon the magical world of Narnia. There they joined forces with the great leader Aslan and together overthrew the evil white witch. I have read this book as a younger kid and just now and there was a big difference in the way I read it. As a kid it was a lot more magical and I couldn't put it down I just had to read it. Now it might be the fact that this is the second time I have read this but it wasn't as good this time around. I had more wonder in my eyes I guess as a kid. I would recommend this book to everyone but I do truly believe kids will enjoy this book more than adults."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion,The Witch,and The Wardrobe novel is really great. First, you can feel your heart pounding in your chest when the White Witch screams at Edmund. Second, the adventures are like so real that it feels that your there. Finally, the characters like Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are really good in acting. That is why it is a really great novel!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is about four children Peter,Lucy,Edmund, and Susan. They come from London. But it all changes when they go in the Professor's Wardrobe. They go in the land of Narnia where it is always winter but no Christmas. When the evil witch kidnaps their brother Edmund, they know that they have to save Narnia to save their brother so they do with the help of all the pure creatures of Narnia, and the help of the legendary Lion Aslan.With all that help they retrieved their brother Edmund killed the Evil Witch, and they all became royalty to the land of Narnia.I liked this book cause it was very exciting, and it had a lot of tension. It was exciting cause the war that they were fighting looked in the odds of the evil witch, but in the end they won. It was full of tension because I saw the movie and I knew there was going to be a battle so I was waiting for the battle. I really liked the part when the good guys raided the Evil witches camp. This part was good cause the good guys snatched Edmund back and they started to get feared of the bad guys. I think that this author did a very good job with this book I loved it, and I have no suggestions what so ever."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This story was about four siblings, two brothers, and two sisters, findind their way through Narnia to help save their brother and to find Aslan. They wind up fighting in a huge battle and their chances to survive are slim. They are trying to defeat the White witch! They come head to head in a battle and have many obstacles to go through before they get so far. There are many mythical creatures in this book and it is very magicall.I rated this book a three out of five because this version left out a few things that were in other versions and I didnt feel the same way in this version as others. I am a christian though and I really like the fact that their was a christian scene, it was hard to understand but I knew what it meant. This book always makes me cry and I really enjoy this adventurous story. Overall I really love this story and think this is a great book that you can get caught up in and never put it down. I highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The book, \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,\\" is the second book in the legendary series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia.\\" There are seven books at all, all written by C.S. Lewis. This book was published only five years after the end of World War II. The author dedicates this book to Lucy, a girl, that like the characters in the story, went to live in a country house, escaping from London in the war years.The author begin telling the story of four siblings, the Pevensyes. Peter, the oldest, Susan, the second oldest, Edmund, the second youngest, and Lucy, the youngest were all sent to a country house to live with professor Kirke, during the war.They went to live in a humongous old mansion, where only an old professor and his maid, Mrs. Macready. One day, they were playing hide and seek, when Lucy, the youngest, found a spare room, empty like many other rooms in the house. The only difference was that this was not a completely empty room, but there was a wardrobe in it, and as soon as she entered the room, she was astonished with the wardrobe, there was something different about it. It was an old wardrobe with many drawings on it, and she thought it was a very beautiful wardrobe. They were still playing hide and seek, so, she hid inside the wardrobe, and she kept on going further in, until she thought to herself, \\"this must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\\" She had been walking through coats which didnt let her see what was in front of her, but she felt something cold under her feet, and wet. Soon, there were no more coats, instead, there were branches of trees on her face. She was shocked when she saw that she was in the middle of a wood and it was winter. She had entered the world of Narnia, and there she had incredible adventures and she even met Mr. Tumnus, a faun.When she came back to Earth, what seemed to heve lasted many hours in Narnia, didnt take any time at all, here on Earth. She tried to explain to them what hapened but they didnt believe her.It was many days later that they were playing hide and seek again, and they all went in the wardrobe to hide and they saw that she was telling the truth. And That's how the whole adenture begins.All four of them were in Narnia this time, and they had to try to rescue their brother Edmund from the White Witch, the responsible for the eternal winter in Narnia.Meanwhile, they met Aslan, the creator, the real king of Narnia, who helped them rescue their brother, and made them kings and queens of Narnia after they Fought the White Whitch, killed her and put an end to the long winter, bringing peace to Narnia again.They were Kings and Queens for many years, until one day when they were walking through the woods and, accidentally, went in the wardrobe and came back to Earth. Like I said, it doesnt matter how much time you spend in Narnia, it doesnt take any time here, so after many years there, they came back at the same exactly time that they went in, and they became kids again."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I love this series. Loved it even more when I read it as a fourth-grader, delightfully unconcerned with the Christian symbolism, not that it really mattered. My best friend Mark introduced them to me; he truly believed Narnia existed, and come to think of it, how do we know it doesn't? Even now in my 40s, I just don't think the overt symbolism matters much. For me and many others, these books represent a time in our lives when we could willingly suspend our disbelief easily, readily, wholeheartedly. Isn't it sad that, as we age, we often seem to lose that flexibility, that openness?"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I am a big fan of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", as well as \\"Harry Potter\\", so it seemed only natural that I should also read C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I never read them as a child, but then again I stem from the third world, where these occurrences are not unusual. After watching the movie, I decided to give the book a try. At first I was unsure where to start the series, as there is still a debate as to which order the books should be read in, but I went with the first book in the series that was published, as this made the most sense to me.I am so very glad that I picked up \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\"! The book is actually tiny - less than 200 pages, with illustrations - but packed full of adventure. Most people are familiar with plot, but for those fellow \\"third-world-ers\\" I will rehash some of it. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are four siblings in the WWII England, who get sent to a kindly professor's house in the country to be safe from the German air-raids. They are amazed by the size of the house, and decide to explore it on rainy days. During one of those days Lucy, the youngest sibling, entered a room that contained only a wardrobe. Upon entering the wardrobe, behind the coats, Lucy encountered a different world, with snow and woods and a lamp post.Lucy ended up meeting a Faun called Mr. Tumnus - a half man, half goat, who introduced Lucy to Narnia, the world that she entered, a world ruled by a White Witch, who called herself the Queen of Narnia. Of course, the one true King is Aslan, the giant talking Lion, who is planning on returning to Narnia and bring Christmas and then spring and summer back with him. In order to do this, Aslan needs to fill the four thrones in the castle currently occupied by the White Witch. The four thrones can only be occupied by humans, as foretold by a prophecy.Lucy returned to her world via the same wardrobe. On a different day, while trying to escape the grumpy housekeeper and a group of tourists going around the professor's house, all four siblings hide in the wardrobe. Not believing Lucy's Narnia story before, the siblings are surprised and apologetic when they, too, end up in Narnia. Deferring to Lucy as a way of apology, all the siblings go with Lucy to meet Mr. Tumnus. They are all surprised to see Mr. Tumnus missing and his place raided, as they find out that Mr. Tumnus was arrested by the White Witch for abetting humans.The White Witch found out about Mr. Tumnus' nefarious activities through Edmund, who entered Narnia on his own while one day looking for Lucy. Edmund met the White Witch, who gave him Turkish Delight. The food was enchanted, and Edmund wanted more of it. The White Witch promised Edmund rooms full of Turkish Delight if he brought his siblings with him the next time he was in Narnia.This is just the beginning. The children end up meeting Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them go to Aslan, while Edmund (believing the White Witch was not that bad), escaped to the castle, where he got imprisoned by the White Witch, who then took Edmund on a harrowing journey of looking for Peter, Susan and Lucy. But the snow is already melting, and the spring is coming, so the Witch needs to hurry, as the prophecy is about to be fulfilled, which would mean the death of the Witch.Ah, this book was such a pleasure to read! Lewis wrote this book as a story for his god-daughter Lucy, and at first intended the story to be just that - a story and not a series. The book is written very simply - one can easily imagine the author telling it to a bunch of kids, adding asides for dramatic effect or as a way of explanation. Although the book is written in a very simple language, its plot is actually quite complicated and covers amazingly well developed characters in such a short span.Lewis, who was a good friend of Tolkien, was truly a master of the genre, as this children's book is so well loved by adults, as it has themes that can translate to any age. \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is also the simplest of all the books in the series, as far as language is concerned, as it was obviously originally intended for a very specific and small audience. I am very glad that the book found a larger audience than that. The book is wonderful in that it teaches courage, loyalty, forgiveness, strength, endurance and sacrifice, among other things, while immersing the reader in a plot in which they cheer and sit at the edge of their seat. The illustrations propel the reader into the world of Narnia, and illuminate all that our adult imagination might have forgotten.All in all, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a fantastic children's fantasy book, that would be very hard to match, and that, one can safely say, serves as a basis and a starting point for all fantasy writers of today. And well it should, as Lewis was one of the masters, and \\"The Lion...\\" was just one taste. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis writes an inspiring tale of four young children who stumble upon a wardrobe that leads to a magical land called Narnia. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to find Narnia, and while she is there, she befriends a fawn named Thomas. Thomas tells her of the evil ice queen who cast a horrible spell that made it constantly winter without Christmas in Narnia until two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam arrive to save the land. Complications arise when Edmund is bribed and betrayed by the evil ice queen who promises that he will become prince if he gives the location of his other siblings. The other three young children and eventually Edmund decide to help Narnia, and they begin a dangerous yet exciting fight against the evil ice queen. The story is filled with memorable and inspiring characters especially Aslan, the true and righteous ruler of Narnia. The novel is incredibly moving, and C.S. Lewis delivers a meaningful message to his readers. It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and I recommend that everyone read this beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeBy:C. S. LewisReviewed by:M. LinPeriod:P. 6The eternal winter of Narnia, set by the witch, abruptly stops when Aslan the lion returns to aid it. In order to return the season of spring, two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve must be crowned the kings and queens of Narnia at the Cair Paravel of the 4 thrones. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, the 4 brothers and sisters must leave their home in London to escape the air-raids of war. Brought to a mysteriously large mansion, the children wander throught it finding an enormous wardrobe in which they enter to find a lamp post in the middle of the frozen Narnia. Lucy befriends a faun named Mr. Tumnus who saves Lucy's life, but is captured by the Queen. Edmund betrays the party when the witch offers him sweets and tells all his secrets that could endanger his family. Discovering the truth that the witch is not the true queen of Narnia, the children try to find Aslan and be taken to the throne to become the kings and queens. Aslan later saves Edmund ,but the witch claims that according to the \\"Deep Magic,\\" every traitor belongs to her and everything that belongs to her, she has a right to kill. Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund and is brought back to life according to the \\"Deeper Magic,\\" saying that if someone else is killed in place of a traitor,he is brought back. The witch is defeated by Aslan and the children grow up as Kings and queens of Narnia. When they return to the lamp post, the find their way back through the wardrobe and return to the mansion as children again.What I liked about the book was that it was creative and full of hooks that pull you in. Narnia is locked up in winter, but the story is so intriguing that it pulls you all the way to the key. You journy with Aslan. \\"Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for he remembered as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.\\" The book keeps on repeating this line in the begining and even though it isn't very important, it somehow hooks you in and then you really start enjoying what happens in Narnia and how it makes you want to be in the adventure with them. The land is magical in the human world as it is in Narnia because it had the wardrobe in it and it seem as though something magical was driveing the children into Narnia.Lucy is my favorite character because she is pure and innocent. She plays fair and is always honest and when Mr.Tumnus was captured, she tried her best to try to help him because he saved her life. \\"We can't just go home, not after this. It is on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble...We simply must rescue him.\\" All of this showed Lucy's kind nature and caring heart.My favorite part of the book is when the four children are at the Beaver's house/dam to eat dinner. The description of the food makes my mouth water. I love the food and it always makes me hungry. The author does a long description of the dinner and how it smells, taste, and what they eat. Potatoes, fish, bread, and butter just made me feel weak and the loving detail didn't help. It isn't a very important part but it was my favorite part out of the book."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I grew up reading The Chronicles of Narnia and these books are a part of who I am.

If you haven't read these books then do so in the order that they were released by Lewis. If you only read them as a child then read them again.

Peter is a brave and courageous boy. Susan is also brave. Lucy is the main character. She does cry a lot but is also courageous.The main characters of Narnia are Aslan, the King of Narnia, who is also a lion, the White Witch of Narnia who thinks she is the Queen of Narnia, and Maugrim, the White Witch's secret, chief of police.

The story in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very interesting story. It's interesting because it's a story about this magic land inside of a coat closet, so it get you think about how Narnia got in a closet. The story is age-appropriate, and it would appeal to the kids because it is a Fantasy and Adventure story. That type of age group loves stories that have adventure. The book is very well written and easy to understand; C.S. Lewis is a good author. It is easy to conclude from the title and formation of the book that it has something to do with a lion, a witch and a wardrobe.The theme of the story is that good will triumph over evil and that you have got to have trust in people. Yes the theme is worth conveying to children to let them know that good will overpower evil with the right tools and attitude. The theme is moralistic and it may be a little overly moralistic to some people because of the religious connection. In my opinion the theme is not overly moralistic.The plot of the story is very well constructed. It introduces you to the land of Narnia, and sets each piece of the story in the right spot at the right time. It's not a confusing plot, it's a very easy plot to follow. The plot of the story is original and fresh, but the believable part is a little hard. You have to try and really work to believe kids have the power to save a whole magical land. All the characters, especially Lucy, seem really convincing and credible. They all grow from the experience in different ways, some grow in imagination and some in trust, and all four kids are changed by going to the land of Narnia.This is a very good story for all ages to read; it has the important elements of a great story, the laughter and the tears. You learn from this book really fast who is good and who is not. It has symbolism to reading that is really subtle, but if you pay attention, you will pick up on it. I like the book because of the air of mystery with what is in the wardrobe and at first only one of the kids, Lucy, believes in Narnia. It is a really good book that all kids need to read. You will like it; it is one of my favorites.Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia S.)"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"How can you not love The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe? This book is just tremendous. I listened to it on audiobook recently and fell in love with it all over again. This is one of those books that you could read or listen to once a year and never get sick of it. Love it!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"*The Chronicles of Narnia* is perhaps the best-loved series of all time. It is loved by not just children, but men and women of all ages. I have grown up since I was eleven years old with these beloved stories, and they, along with CS Lewis' other writings that I discovered as an adult, have had an immeasurable impact on my life.Indeed, I feel almost shy about writing a review of any of these books, but I will try to do so. We will start with the first review about the first book, *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*. I am going to be reviewing these in publishing order, not chronological order.Most everyone knows the base story. Probably many know it better than their own country's history. Many children are sent into the English countryside to escape the air raids over London by the German *Luftwaffe* during World War II. Among these are four siblings, the Pevensies. They are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They are extremely fortunate to end up in the house of a wealthy Professor.Once at the house, first Lucy, then Edmund, and eventually all four of the children, wind up in the enchanted land of Narnia. Really, (as shall be revealed in later books) it is a completely other dimension/universe from our own. The country of Narnia in this other world is ruled by a tyrant, the White Witch Jadis, who is determined to kill the children to thwart a prophecy that states that when four humans, two boys and two girls, sit on the thrones in the castle of Cair Paravel, it will mean the end of her tyranny and her life.Along the way, many adventures are had, and many lessons are learned. Edmund betrays them, and is repentant later on. He is redeemed from his stain of betrayal by Aslan the Lion, Who leads the children and the Narnians to triumph over the Witch and her forces.The novel is not just an example of superb storytelling, but also of wit, description, and wonderful use of the English language. The subtle jokes and historical references are enjoyable, and lead to the audience actually *thinking* about what they are reading. The descriptions and elegant use of language is absolutely captivating. The audience is transported directly into the story, and can almost see and smell what the characters do, and eat the foods along with them. What I mean by the masterful use of the English language is how Lewis was not overly \\"high-minded\\" in his words and descriptions. He was elegant without seeming snooty. This is not always easy to do, and Lewis did it quite well.All of these ideas are well-known about the book, but there is even more to glean from the work. To be sure, the most important element in the story is the symbolic truth of Christ, and His atoning death on the Cross for our sins via the story of Aslan giving His life in place of Edmund the traitor. Lewis once stated how culture in the West has become too comfortable and familiar with the Scriptures, and thus they have lost much of their impact on us. When we are moved by the story of Aslan dying for Edmund (and rising in the end), or even of any sacrificial character in other stories (whether they rise like Gandalf, or stay dead), it is really the truth of the Scriptures touching our hearts.There are many other areas that I could examine, but I will focus on one more that I think reviewers do not focus on enough. This area deals with heroism and the modern definition and view (a very *Christian* view), that would have been familiar to Lewis given his studies of literature and various periods of history, including the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\".I do not know for certain what Lewis thought beyond what he has said, and I heartily disdain putting words in an author's mouth. I have always hated that people say what an author thinks, especially if they don't know what the author thinks, or if their statements of the author's intents actually *contradicts* the author's beliefs.The above disclaimer is to serve as a notice that I can not guarantee what I am venturing is correct about CS Lewis' intentions. But I will try to gauge his idea of a hero, because it is important for us to consider how even in this area, the Bible impacted our culture and Lewis' story. In the history of the West and of America in particular, there is a falsehood that many erroneously believe. This is that the culture we all embrace comes from the Greco-Roman heritage of the West. This is pure bunk. To be sure, the love of learning and the importance of the Law were gleaned from the Greco-Roman history, but the moral and philosophical underpinnings that have made the West more vibrant, and more ready to use knowledge to better ourselves and others, than any other civilization in history are the result of the Christian Faith.What this has to do with the idea of heroism is that the gods and heroes in Greek mythology were vile and cruel creatures. They were murderous and petty, and took obscene delight in hurting and torturing people. The idea of the hero as the strongest one who exerts his will on others is the Greco-Roman idea of the hero. The idea was changed and altered as Christianity became the dominant force in the West.Really, the early concept embraced by the Church is identical, except that the obvious change had started in the morality of the hero. The hero was called on to do good in honor of God. This was due to the Church taking the knightly orders under it's control, in order to put an end to indiscriminate killings for \\"glory\\" that many of the supposed \\"heroes\\" pursued.Eventually, a Reformation and Enlightenment came and went, and the \\"hero\\" changed. Now the hero was expected to act as the Lord Jesus Christ acted. Sacrifice for the sake of others is what marks a true hero. This is what is special about Aslan the Lion, and even Edmund as well. Aslan sacrifices his life for Edmund, and via the prophecy, *all of Narnia itself*. Edmund sacrifices himself to save his fellow Narnians and his family when he destroys the Witch's wand, leaving himself open to attack.This sacrificial hero is important to our history, and it is one we are fast losing. Lewis has helped us to revive this great ideal and this great Truth. Indeed, many other concepts and Truths are buried in LWW, as in they are in the rest of the Narnia books. For helping to teach, and ingrain them in the minds of many men and women for nearly sixty years, we owe a massive debt to Lewis.This book inaugurates a series that has many \\"hidden\\" nuggets of wisdom and moral ideals that we would all do well to notice and embrace. It is also a frollicking good story. Please pick up this book and the others, you will *NOT* regret it.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books. When I was a child, I enjoyed it for the action and story, but as I got older, really started to grasp between the lines. CS Lewis is definitely an amazing author and his entire Narnia set is a classic and a must for anyone's collection."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Out of all the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" books, the first published is also one of the strongest of the series; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is a fantasy book, about a land called Narnia, where all sorts of imaginary creatures live; mythological creatures, magical beasts, talking animals and so forth. Four children enter it through a magical door in a wardrobe, and are soon drawn into a sort of power play between the supernatural lion Aslan, and the White Witch Jadis, who's been claiming the right to rule Narnia for many years; turning dissenters to stone. By the numbers, it's clear that Aslan is more powerful, but the Witch is clever, and knows many tricks. It's the type of story we've heard a number of times before, and if you don't care for allegory, you can skip to the last two paragraphs now.In the past, I've said that Narnia is mainly more protestant than Catholic, but I may need to re-evaluate that, because the symbolism in this book is positively sacramental in nature at many points. When mice nibble ropes off of Aslan as he lies on a stone table, there's a eucharistic image to be seen there, of eating the body of Christ on an altar (since Aslan is clearly Jesus in lion form.) On top of this, the sacrament of confession is nearly mentioned. After being rescued, Edmund spends time talking to Aslan in private, and afterwards, everyone is told that there's no need to \\"talk about what is past.\\" A discussion with the savior in a private place, and the forgiveness of sins? What else could it be, but reconciliation?I also think it's interesting that the oldest boy, and the one who's clearly the group's leader, is named Peter. This aspect of the bible; the primacy of Saint Peter among the apostles, is only rarely admitted outside of the Catholic Church, and their king and queenship would seem to be an allegory for both heaven, and the church.Apart from this, the book's storyline seems to be a clear allegory of the passion and death of Our Lord, with Aslan as Jesus, and the White Witch standing in for Satan. Lucy and Susan are the holy women. Still, some of the roles aren't as easy to fit in as all that. Edmund seems to have aspects of both Saint Peter (betraying and being forgiven) and Judas (selling people out for a promised reward.) However, neither role is really precise, which may be for the best. It gives the story a flavor of originality, which it might not have had otherwise.In particular, this book's main premise; of a \\"Deep Magic,\\" which even Aslan must never break is perhaps the clearest allegory of all; representing something that most modern people want to ignore; Natural Law. Too many people want to just wander off and do their own thing, and forget that even if the law allows them to do certain things, the natural law, and the final judge are still there, and they can still run afowl of them. Even God's will for our salvation only has so much leeway when it comes to transgressions of the natural law, and that's one thing that Lewis gets absolutely right.However, there's also one point near the very end, where I sort of winced as well. It's a few pages into the last chapter, when everyone is seated on thrones. Aslan uses the words \\"Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen.\\"Not only does this prove to be false later in the series, but the phrase itself sounds dangerously like \\"once saved, always saved,\\" a belief held by many protestant denominations, but not by the Catholic Church. Still, it would have been worse if it had got beyond just being a simple phrase.As a book of fiction, it's entertaining, but more if you know your myths. It's good for children, and unlike most books in the series, has a strong, frightening villain, with a major role in the plot, which only makes the rest of the story that much more exciting. It has some weak points with respect to pure storytelling style, but not much more so than most children's books.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe may be the best fictional storybook out there for Christian children. It's fun, exciting and packed with the sentiments of the faith. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is very fascinating. It has you see the creativity and imagination of people such as the author, C.S. Lewis and the amazing world that we live in. I think it will keep everyone who reads it interested in it. Animal lovers would definitely like this due to all of the animals in this book. Also people who like mysterious action movies would also like this book because it keeps you on your toes and there are wars and many conflicts. I would definitely recommend this book for other readers."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"My wife and I started reading to my daughter when she was still a baby, and have made that a common practice throughout each of her first five years. This is the first \\"real book\\" -- i.e., a book that couldn't be read easily in one sitting -- that my daughter and I have shared. It was a really great first.I never read The Chronicles of Narnia as a child, nor had them read to me. While the first few chapters held my daughter's attention, I wasn't exactly impressed. I thought the writing was a bit clumsy, a little too heavy on 1940s British vernacular. I also thought the characters -- the children at this point -- were poorly developed. However, once the kids are in Narnia \\"for good,\\" the entire tone of the book changes, as does the writing quality. Particularly, the scenes near the end are very well-written, exciting, and evoke a lot of emotion. My daughter would always want two chapters before bedtime, and as the book drew to a close, I'd want to read her a third or fourth!We are now reading Prince Caspian, which I'm told is really the second book in the series (although the books have been reordered after the fact, so that even The Lion, The Witch and, the Wardrobe is no longer Book 1), and we plan to go through the whole series. Many people consider the Chronicles series to be some of the greatest books ever written -- adults, I'm talking about. I don't think I agree with that at all, as I don't think I'd really care to read them on my own. However, as an experience to share with my daughter, the books are excellent: Good enough, rich enough with symbolism to keep my attention and interest, and magical enough to keep her excited and wanting to read."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I adore these books. Read them as a kids and they were part of all my daydreams; Read them now and they are inspiration for my talents. These books sparked my imagination like no other. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Just read this with my boys as a school project and I cannot tell you how fantastic this was! It's even better than I remember it being when I was a kid. I think this is a must for any kid growing up. It works well as a read out loud storybook too."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Our family read this book together as part of their school curriculum, and loved it. This story is a great adventure for children and adults. It is beautifully illustrated. It tells the story of 4 children who are sent to live with an eccentric relative during the bombings of London during World War 2. They are exploring their new environment when they happen into a new and strange land, Narnia, through the back of a wardrobe, and the adventure begins.What an exciting adventure it is! It describes sweeping landscapes so vivid that you can easily imagine yourself climbing the crest of a mountain to see the beautiful valley before you! There are amazing creatures unlike anything you've ever seen before.This book held the intrest of the children and was very fun to read to them. They identified with these characters, and by the end of the book felt as if they were great friends. C.S. Lewis is an amazing author, and this story is as relevant today as the day he wrote it.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"As C. S. Lewis himself said children's stories that are only for children aren't worth reading--or words to that effect.I got the whole series and I steal all the time I can to read them all the while hoping I will never get to the end.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia)"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, And The WardrobeBy C.S. LewisReview by Cameron J. HumpherysIn this marvelous book by C.S. Lewis, The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, the settings are the Professor's house and Narnia. Narnia is a magical land where animals can talk and an evil Witch who thinks she'sQueen made it forever winter but never Christmas.The main characters in this book are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. These four siblings along with Aslan, a great lion with great powers, work to help free Narnia from the oppressive Witch, who has ruled by fear for a long time.When Aslan gave himself up to die instead of Edmund to appease a deep magic he activated an even deeper magic which kept him alive. Aslan being alive and the Witch not knowing it made it so that he could un-freeze those that the Witch had turned to stone. Leading the people who were once frozen into battle, they gained the upper hand and defeated the Witch.My favorite part of the story is when the four children are crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. The reason I like that part is that the Witch is dead and there isn't a care in the world and the children are happy. People should read this book because it is an action packed adventure and a great read.One person I think changed during the story is Edmund. The reason why I think Edmund changed is that at the beginning of the story he is spiteful. One example of his spitefulness is when he saw Narnia and said, \\"I was just playing with Lucy nothing really happened.\\" But at the end of the story he is kind and good. An example of his goodness is when he breaks the Witch's wand."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The four Pevensie orphans Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are evacuated to the enormous country house of Professor Kirke. When Lucy, during a game of hide and seek, finds a big wardrobe in an empty room, she decides to use it as her hiding place. To her big surprise she notices behind the fur coats at the back of the closet a spot of white snow. The world behind the wardrobe turns out to be the wonderfully strange world of Narnia. At first her friends do not believe what she has discovered, but it won't take long before the others are face to face with the faun, Mr. Tumnus, the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a real treat for anyone who likes simple, but not less exciting fantasy. The power behind this book is that it brings the story without too much need to moralize. There is certainly some moral lesson behind what is happening, certainly when considering the actions of Edmund, but it never reaches the level of the Victorian Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. Of course this book dates from the 50's and is written in an era that differs much from Victorian times, still it strongly reverbs the explorative nature of those times. The colorful characters are brought to life in a dreamlike setting that is bursting of opportunities for the six sequels that will follow this book. The humor is omnipresent, but certainly is at its best when the narrator intervenes with his commentary. Again a wink to Victorian novels. If you want to be engulfed in a wonderful and not too complex world, then The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a good start."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Ok so I'm one of those people that saw the movie first. I've tried to read this book 2 times now. Although short, I just had trouble staying interested in it. I thought the movie was excellent. Normally the books are better than the movie, but in my case I don't think so. I know it's a children's book but it reads very childish to me. This is the main reason I just couldn't stick with it.My reason for 4 stars and not less, it was a great movie and it takes a great book to make a great movie. I'd suggest this to all readers, it's fast and was fairly easy to read. But don't watch the movie first."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I had no idea this was a prequel to a series until my senior year of high school. One of these days I'll have the time to read the rest of them, but I read this one in high school, being familiar with the 1979 cartoon version.This was a fantastic book written in a colorful way. It doesn't have illustrations and doesn't need them. Those with good imaginations can easily picture the world of Narnia and get a real feel for all the wonderful characters inside."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I put the series in my TBR pile when it dawned on me that I'd never read them. My kids have, and I'd read this one aloud to them several times, but it seemed like a cultural thing I was missing out on, so in they went. The Lemony Snicket books are in there, too.I have no idea what to say about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe that hasn't been said. I don't even know how I feel about it, because the story's so very familiar. There's the heavy-handed Christian allegory, I suppose, which doesn't take much to uncover. And there's really not a lot of depth to it, nor are the characters all that well-developed.But it is, after all, a children's story, a fast-moving tale of adventure and imagination, and Good vs. Evil. Hopefully, I'll have more to say on the subsequent books, which are new to me.One aside: reading this always brings to mind my daughter's kindergarten best friend, who maintained that she did have a doorway to Narnia in her bedroom closet. This frustrated my realist daughter no end, because she couldn't convince her friend that it was just a story."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Few reading experiences are richer and more delightful than taking another trip into Narnia, especially when doing so via the mysterious wardrobe. C.S. Lewis's enchanting fairy tale is warm, beautiful, and inspiring with every read. I have personally read it four times in my adult life. (I never read it as a child.) And I could probably read it at least forty more times.In this story Lewis enables the reader to step into the shoes of Peter, Edmund, Susan, or Lucy -- whichever character you find is most like you, or whichever one has the tightest grip on you. Things like childhood fancy and fun, sibling rivalry, betrayal, sacrifice, and redemption all play crucial roles in this tale. And it's presented in such a way that a child and adult alike can both learn and understand.Many readers intrigued by the Gospel allegory the book is so famous for will not be disappointed. But many may be disappointed by the allusion to Adam having a wife before Eve named Lilith. This may be a turn-off to some, and I will not defend Mr. Lewis in this area. But I will say that it is a story and should never take the place of the Word of God. Parents and educators would do well to keep this in mind should the matter come up.In other words, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is not a book about theology or a commentary on the Bible. But it is a fantastic example of what happens when the major themes of the Scriptures are mixed with classic fairy-tale telling and quality children's literature."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of four children that stumble into a wardrobe... the magical door to another world. They learn many things while they travel to see Aslam, the great Lion. One of them is how they were expected, for that is what the prophesy said. After good conquers evil they grow up there and become kings and queens of the land until one day they stumble back into the magic wardrobe to find themselves back on the same day they left many years before.

There were also funny scenes that any audience can appreciate. This was a very good book."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is one of the very few books I can truly say I will read over again. It is very well written, never short of any details, and I couldn't wait to see what happened each time. It kept my interest throughout the enitre book.It is quite easy to imagine Aslan, the four children, the beavers, the white witch, and all the characters. And each character has a distinct personality. You learn to adore Lucy and Susan, and you learn how brave Peter is, and you can't help but to dislike Edmund. And I kind of wish Edmund wouldn't have gone to the witch, but every detail of the book is important. There is a lesson to be learned about sacrifice, understanding, and love. Aslan is the forefront of those lessons in this book.In my opinion, the book was written perfectly. It got all kinds of feelings and emotions from me. I do recommend this book for yourself and your young reader.And if you haven't seen the movie yet, definitely read the book first.Thanks."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I remember back when I was in second grade and I read The Loin The Witch and the Wardrobe.

Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is the best known of the Narnia novels and it is a true classic. Although I personally didn't enjoy The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe as much as I enjoyed the Magician's Nephew,it was still a high quality read. The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe starts with the now grown up Digory Kirke,who has become Professor Kirke,taking 4 siblings into his house in a time of war. One of the siblings first discovers way into Narnia through the wardrobe Professor Kirke made out of Narnian wood at the end of the Magician's Nephew. Eventually,all 4 of the siblings find their way into Narnia and the story really begins. The plot is graver and the tone grimmer than the Magician's Nephew. In this book the 4 siblings find Narnia an unhappy land annd will also find themselves in real danger. The adventure is about how the siblings,with the help of Aslan,put things right in the land of Narnia. There are two things I particulary like about the Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe. 1st,The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe makes the Magician's Nephew an even stronger story than it was to begib with because of connections between the stories. There were many times while reading The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe that I found myself saying \\"Oh,yeah,because in the Magician's Nephew................. Much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows made Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince a stronger story,so too The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe made the Magician's Nephew a stronger story. Now we've got a strong series going. I also loved the fact that the people that got into Narnia from \\"our world\\" in The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe were different humans than the ones in the Magician's Nephew. I love how Lewis expanded his base of characters with this book. One last thing is that I LOVED the \\"gifts\\" part. (Can't say more than gifts,it'd require a big spoiler.) The biggest waekness of The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is that the physical appearance of Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy is never described so you have to guess. (I now think of the characters from the movie when I think about what they would look like.) The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is a masterfully crafted tale about the adventures of the Pevinse children in Narnia and is surely 5 star material."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a good read for adults and children alike.

One day a simple game of hide and go seek found them in an adventure in a world called Narnia where through an evil queen (Satan like) made it always winter.

I'll never forget being caught up by the magical land in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe which was read to us FIRST! I know there's a lot of arguments concerning what order the books should be read in: chronological order or as they were published. Well, I have to say that C.S. Lewis published them in the order he meant for us to read the books so start with LWW. What a wonderful imagination this man had and how fortunate for us readers that he put his creativity to good use and put his thoughts down on paper. It's a wonderful and magical trip that any parent should share with their child, they will never forget it. I know I never will."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"...It's pretty obvious that these books are allegorical. Even if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is, I think it probably doesn't take a genius to figure out the religious representation throughout this book (and the others). I don't follow a Judeo-Christian path, personally, and I have no problem reading this; it's not at all preachy, or so obviously Christian that it reads like a rewritten Bible story or something. So, regardless of your own religious affiliation (or if you aren't religious at all), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent choice if you want to sit down for a couple of hours for a fun, light story of magic and adventure...\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion,The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a very exciting book in which four children step into the land of Narnia through a wardrobe by magic.

LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming.

During the children's stay Lucy, the youngest, finds a large wardrobe in an almost empty room. During a game of Hide-n-go-seek, Lucy decides to enter the wardrobe to hide. In the wardrobe, Lucy finds a magical world which is called Narnia. When Lucy tries to tell her siblings about the magical world but they don't believe her.

Their adventures include mystical characters, a majestic lion, and an evil white witch who turns people into stone. There are battles and also time of peace. There are nerve racking moments and times that make you feel relaxed. This book is an overall outstanding well written book that I can reconmmend for any age! To learn more about this book read it! C.S. Lewis is a phenomenal writer and really digs deep into his writting and an analogy of his faith in Jesus as the Savior."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a fantastic book. It takes you into a magical land that can only be created by one such as C.S. Lewis. There is never a dull moment which is good if you get bored with reading easily. However, there are a few downfalls. The book itself is relativley fast paced and sometimes the narrartion is a bit childish. All in all its a good read and a classic that nobody should ever miss out on."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a real classic that we love sharing as a family over and over again! You can read it aloud or read at bedtime, it never gets old."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"What would you do if you entered a wardrobe and found yourself in a magical world? In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe four kids find themselves in that situation. The main characters Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter find themselves deep inside a wardrobe one day and soon discover a magical land inside and set off to explore.Soon they meet Aslan, a lion, who is willing to do whatever it takes to save Narnia from the powerful White Witch who rules all of Narnia. Aslan needs the four to battle for freedom, but when Edmund is tricked into thinking the White Witch is harmless, the remaining three have to find Edmund and convince him to join them on their side. The battle seems easy, but what they discover is that the whole land of Narnia needs them. They realize that it's up to them to save Narnia against the powerful rule of The White Witch.I thought this book was written well and all who like adventure books will love turning pages to find out what happens next to the evil. One adventure I liked in this book was where Edmund was riding in the White Witch's sleigh. I rate this book a four star book for its unique way of adventure for all."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I had first read the Narnia books as a young man, then together with my wife a few years ago, and now to my children.These books are special and wonderful and few children's books compare to Lewis' classic.I recently re-read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and was moved to tears (again!). This book is worth the read at any age. The story is compelling and dramatic. The characters are rich and possess real human dignity. The subtlety and suspense make the book an easy and fast read, yet impossible to forget.Unlike most children's literature, The Chronicles of Narnia--and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in particular--treat both the children and adults with respect and grace. The children are young and sometimes impatient, but brave and decent. The adults are respectful and thoughtful, not dismissive or clueless.Lewis' Christianity is clear from start to finish, but this book is not preaching; neither is the content forced. Lewis artfully weaves his plot and characters into the larger narrative of the Christian story. This is book is fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, and Gospel.I urge all readers (of any age) to enjoy these books! You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"chose this book called The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe for a school project and this book was a good book. My favorite part of this book was when Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Mrs. & Mr. Beaver entered the Stone Table and met Aslan, a lion that is the King of Narnia. I think the characters are believable because they all had a special part in the story's plot. Father Chrismas's part was to give Peter, Susan, and Lucy their tools. Lucy helped the wounded with her cordial that was made by the fire flowers on the top of the mountain, Peter and Edmund were knights that had a sword and a shield to protect them in battle, and Susan had the ability to use a bow and arrows for protection and a horn. The horn was used for thinking about something good to help her when she blows it and that thing she thinks about comes or appears. The ending was happy: the kids helped Narnia by defeating the Witch and her army that was trying to take over the magical place. I recommend you to read this book that is full of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"At the time of the publication of C.S. Lewis's The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe the world was still in the early stages of recovery from the largest, most devastating, and most costly known war to mankind at the time, 1950. WWII was truly a battle of good verses evil, and good prevails. What exactly C.S. Lewis's experiences were during the war are unknown to me however, I venture to say that he knew about the evils mankind was capable of and also knew of the good man was capable of. He lived in Europe at this time and had first hand experience in the dealings of daily life during war. It appears that in this book Lewis is clearly writing about his experiences, but to the extent that his allegories are based on direct or indirect experiences aren't completely clear to me. What is clear is he wrote of his beliefs, his own faith, and how they came to be questioned and ultimately restored through the writing of this story.These themes of good versus evil, loyalty, prudence and faith become evident as the story unfolds. Truth be told there are numerous themes that apply to this story. The theme of maturation could be applied; you see the children are dependant on adults in the beginning of the story for their well-being. Then they pass though the stage of trust versus mistrust, questioning the very existence of Narnia, and arrive at the stage of innovation versus guilt. During this stage they figure out how to solve problems and over come difficulties on their own. You see them take control over their destiny, as they become the rulers of Narnia. This can be applied to the people of Germany, who so susceptible and dependent on their government after World War I that they crave a solution, that is then brought to them in the form of a new charismatic leader who promises them not only a rebuilt life, but that they, the people of Germany, will be come the rulers of the world. This is similar to Edmond's plight in the story. Themes of unselfishness and selflessness are all throughout the story and example of this is the role of Mr. Tunnis who knows that he will be stoned if the witch finds out that he did not do as she wished, which was to notify her that a daughter of Eve had entered Narnia. He still decided to go against her wishes and sacrificed himself for the safety of the Lucy. This selflessness is also seen in the beginnings of the Third Reich by those who were willing to give up their new found sustained lives, their comfortable economic conditions that their leader had provided, to grow, expand, and protect the safety of their country. These citizens, these soldiers also conformed to the requirements of their government out of fear, much like Mr. Tunnis. They too wanted their lives to change realizing that their world was becoming increasingly irrational. They continued to support their government despite of this, out of fear, out of conformity, and out of a sense of obligation.While undoubtedly there is a strong undertone of the religious beliefs of the author, as a student and of history and sociology I found myself continually drawn to the similarities of Narnia and the German town of Dachau. The people who lived in this town did not support the Third Reich and were proud to not be active participants in the dealings of the government, having heard rumors of the deeds that went against their own beliefs of humanity and dignity. Like the children who heard Lucy's description of Narnia, they did not believe that this was happening in their back yard. They instead chose to believe the reassurances of the government they did not support. Their understanding, their belief system did not support the stories that they were being told, just as the other children could not comprehend the stories that Lucy was telling them. Instead they chose to believe the lie they were told by the very government they did not support, because it was more in line with their understanding of human nature. Lucy was said to have never had lied, and therefore is someone they should believe, leaving the reader to assume that Edmund's character is a little more questionable, yet they more readily accepted his response over hers.As the battle of good versus evil ravaged the world in the 1940s, it also ravaged Narnia. The fight over the existence of Utopia, and whether it could exist in the simultaneous presence of pure evil and pure good, played out as much in the minds of the citizens of Dachau and as it did in the world of the characters in the story, as the conflicting stories of reality blended together so that truth and fiction could not be defined.At the end of World War II the citizens of the town of Dachau were first told, then shown what had been going on in their own backyard, allowing them to see first hand what their acceptance allowed. They had readily accepted the assurances of people they knew and believed to be untrustworthy, and as a result not only allowed, but played an active role in supporting the evil that they had tried to not be part of. They had not actively stopped evil, and instead, through their own complacency, played a crucial role in sustaining it. This realization led many of them to collapse, and unable to return to the place they had been proud to call home. The journey they had been on during the time of the war gave them prosperity, but at the end, the realization of the horror in what they had done, made it clear that they had come full circle, back to the devastation and self-defeat they had prior to the rise of the Third Reich. They had chosen to follow the White Queen. It was as if time had not passed, that any success they had enjoyed during that time period was gone, yet they held the memories and awareness of the years in between. Only now those good memories were all tainted.Similarly, as the children in Narnia began to grow and reach levels of success and accomplishment, they soon returned to the beginning. They recognized the signs that they were getting back to where they started, as they chased the stag, saw the familiar lamppost, but instead of stopping and remembering, they continued forward, ignoring the signs they were given. Soon after they too found themselves back at the beginning, as if time had not moved forward. They were back at the school, back through the wardrobe, back as children. But they returned with the memories of the time they spent in Narnia, where pure good lived side by side with pure evil, and how these powers initially fought for them. Having accepted the protection of Aslan to watch over them, protecting them as they maneuvered the balance of good and evil, they now had a deeper sense of understanding of themselves, a deeper sense of faith and awareness of their purpose in life."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The wardrobe made from the wood of the Narnian apple tree planted in a garden on earth and brought down in its old age by some storm is going to be the door to Narnia in the old and magnificent mansion or maybe castle where four kids, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, have taken refuge away from the bombing of London by the Germans in 1940.Lucy first goes through the door and spends a few hours there having tea with the faun Tumnus.

The real stake is Edmund, the traitor Queen Jadis used to get the information she needed. The Queen demands from Aslan that the old tradition of the execution of the traitor be implemented. Aslan negotiates and takes Edmund's place.He's sacrificed but an older tradition resurrects him and he recovers his power because he himself had done no mischief.

She is then powerless.The four kids are crowned kings and queens of Narnia till one day a White Stagn, like the Celtic messenger from the other world or the Arthurian quest-announcing messenger, leads them back to the lamp post and they come back to this side of the wardrobe door. But though once a king of Narnia always a king of Narnia, they can't go back the same way. That rule seems to have been broken though since three passages took place, Lucy first, Edmund second, and the four children third, and what's more they all ended up in the same world in the same time period.The most interesting aspect of this book is the secularizing of religious - deeply Christian, though not only - elements in the legend. The origin of Queen Jadis is Adam and his \\"other\\" wife Lilith, a Jinn, and then later taking some giant blood in her stock.We have to think of the Beast when dealing with Jadis, but she is a female witch whereas the Beast of the Apocalypse is a male monster devouring pregnant women, and its number is 666. We also have to think of the French meaning of Jadis which is \\"once upon a time\\", the past in fairy tales. The future is in the hands of Aslan and the kids.Aslan has to be sacrificed to be resurrected to save Narnia. A common vision from the Gospels as much as from Saint John's Apocalypse. This motif of the savior being a resurrected sacrificed person is quasi universal in many religious traditions, and C.S. Lewis uses many of them. The sacrificial altar is found in many cultures, among others the Celtic culture, or the Roman or Greek cultures, and even the Jewish tradition, to remain within the Eurasian geographical zone.The resurrected savior is well known in many mythologies and religions, the Christian for one example. The traitor is more Christian and yet there are traitors in Sumerian and Mesopotamian traditions. C.S. Lewis regenerates the motif by making the traitor the hero who will save the day by destroying the magic of the witch.We must also think that the four kids around the Lion are reminiscent of the four animals or living creatures around the altar, a lion, a bull, a human-faced animal and an eagle, hence of the four Evangelists in Saint John's Apocalypse. That number four is crucial in the writing and style as opposed to three that seems to represent disorder. Four is like order re-established beyond disorder when the traitor or stray sheep comes back to the fold.The charm of the book is of course the transmuting of that more or less religious magic into a secular marvelous sorcery that can also be magical, white or black, in a way.Finally the Queen/Witch with her secret police is of course a political discourse to children and it exposes tyrannical means and situations as unacceptable because inhumane.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The wardrobe made from the wood of the Narnian apple tree planted in a garden on earth and brought down in its old age by some storm is going to be the door to Narnia in the old and magnificent mansion or maybe castle where four kids, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, have taken refuge away from the bombing of London by the Germans in 1940.Lucy first goes through the door and spends a few hours there having tea with the faun Tumnus.

I was a little disappointed with it, after hearing about it for so many years. The language isn't great, and the boy/girl roles seemed so conventional--dated anyway. One scene in the book is fantastic, however; it's the one of Aslan's crucifixion and resurrection, metaphorically disguised.Take Me With You When You Go"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a wonderful novel. CS Lewis tells a tale of love and redemption in the land of Narnia. The four Pevensie children wander through a wardrobe into the winterland of Narnia, and discover that the curse of the Witch has made for perpetual winter. And younger brother Edmund is seduced by the power of the witch.But the Pevensie children, along with their faithful friends, turn to Aslan, Lord of the Wood for help. Aslan ends up dying for Edmund's sin of betrayal, but he comes back to life to conquer the evil witch and her army.For the most part, if you've seen the film, you'll see that it did a pretty good job of following the novel, with a few exceptions. It is an allegory of the redemption Christ won for us on the cross and of his victory over Satan, the witch of this world.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"An incredible mystery/fantasy that draws you in from the very beginning.

In the beginning, the four children come to the professor's house to stay until the war is over. They are exploring the house one day, and Lucy goes into a wardrobe, thus into Narnia. In Narnia, she meets Mr. Tumnus, a friendly faun who wants a free Narnia. He explains the White Witch making ever-lasting winter in Narnia. In the middle of the book, the rest of them enter Narnia, war breaks, they meet Aslan, the lion, who saves Edmund, who had gone to the White Witch, who \\"killed\\" Aslan on the Stone Table. Near the end, Aslan kills the White Witch, and the children are Kings and Queens in Narnia, when they accidentally leave back through the wardrobe.People who like fantasies such as talking animals would like this book because it has a lot of them.From this book, I learned that dictators do not always use power wisely, so you can not trust anyone completely, even if they do seem kind and thoughtful."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I read The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S.

At the professers house Lucy finds a wardrobe witch takes you to a place called Naira. When all the kids get there they meet the Beavers. In the middle the Beavers tell the four about Asland, a powerful lion who is on their side, and the horrible witch who is not on their side and who wants to take over Naira. Then Edmund sunk out over to the witch's house. Then the Beavers take the kids over to meet Asland, and he saves Edmund. In the end Asland dies for Edmund and the war begins. Then Asland comes alive again and Naira wins the war. After the four are crowned kings and queens they finally go back through the wardrobe to the professers house they are kids again.The themes for this book is always believe in your family. Two ways that they showed this in the book is that Susan, Peter, and Edmund, at first do not bevible Lucy when she first finds the wardrobe, and when they are hiding from the house keeper they go in the wardrobe they all find Naria.The second theme is that you should bevble even if others do not. In the book they show this because when Lucy first comes out of the wardrobe the others do not beveled her, and Susan, peter, and Edmund do not bevible Lucy about the wardrobe.The recommendion for this book is for people who like fantasy stories, or made up creatures and figure.

Lewis was a genius and wrote many powerful, thoughtful books. I am just thankful that he set out to try his hand at children's books, because in Narnia we have been left with something that is truly special."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is a fantasy about a land called Narnia. Four English school children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of hide and go seek. The four children are in this magical land to help the golden lion, Aslan, to defeat the White Witch. The White Witch has used her magic and cursed the land of Narnia with everlasting winter without Christmas. Throughout the book, the children meet many magical characters and animals. The children are forced to fight a war against the Witch and defeat her, which changes the land back to its original beauty and removes all curses she had on Narnia. The children became the Kings and Queens of Narnia for many years in Narnia time. However when they went on a hunt for a white stag, the children stumble upon the lamppost that they had found the first time they entered Narnia. The children wander in the forest near the lamppost and they fall out of the wardrobe that they had entered many years ago. On the other hand, the children were no longer adults as they were in Narnia, it was the same time, same day, and the children were in their same clothes that they were wearing when they wandered through the wardrobe and found Narnia.This is a high quality book in the fantasy genre. Most of the characters are fictional, yet the heroes of the story are children. There is more than one set of literary elements within this story. Each adventure in this book has its own problem, yet there is always one main problem. The language and style of this book is of English literature and some of the wording is different than the English used today. This book also has a different style. The children embark on an adventure to a magical land and find that they are the children of Adam and Eve. To them that is not important, however to the Narnians it means a great battle is to be had. There are a few illustrations through this book in black and white, however they do not tell a story within themselves. The story is told through the printed words. The illustrations are to give a glimpse of the Narnians or land in which the chapters are focusing on. The strength of this book is the high level of fantasy and adventure. The only concern for this book with lower readers is the names and the old English language used throughout the story. The reading level for this book is middle grades starting in fourth to eighth. In the classroom this book can be used as a beautiful example of fantasy. In the classroom, a way to see what the students are visualizing while reading is have the students complete a ten minute quick draw (Yopp & Yopp, 2006). The students can also predict the ending of the story, or even the ending to a chapter. The students can also journal about which character they would like to be use examples in the book to support why they choose that character. Also, the students could journal on the last quote from the professor, \\"But the professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia\\" in which the students could extend what they think this predicts for readers (Lewis, 1950, p.206). Lastly, the students could create a comparison chart and compare the fantasy in the story and reality (Harvey & Goudvis, 2007). The only concern for this book is the violence during the war and the fighting being discussed in the classroom."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"First book printed, second book chronologically.I began re-reading the Narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels. Mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when I was young, and I was interested to see how they held up as adults. I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.This is, of course, the most recognisable title of the series as well as being the first written/published. Most readers will pick up the book hoping for a written account of the events in the recent film, or perhaps the BBC drama series if your memory goes back that far! For the most part the events are the same, although elements are extracted and expanded upon in the films making the novel a little pale in comparison.It is not however lacking in terms of character or charm, and is an alluring tale that sucks the reader in instantly despite the intrusion of the narrator at times. The protagonists, places and events are described straight-forwardly with insightful touches that enhances the specific element that brings the scenes to life.

Time and again, it is referred to as a \\"Christian allegory,\\" a tag with which C.S. Lewis would not have been happy. As he explains in some of his essays and letters, an allegory is a work in which immaterial realities are represented by imaginary physical objects. For example, the immaterial faculty of Reason may be allegorically represented by someone we call Lady Reason. This Lady - because Reason is clear, undefiled, swift, cold, hard, and sharp like a sword - we could picture as a \\"sun-bright virgin clad in complete steel,\\" riding on a horse \\"with a sword naked in her hand.\\" This, C.S. Lewis has actually done in his only allegorical work, \\"The Pigrim's Regress,\\" from which the example of Lady Reason is taken.Is \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" then, an allegory? After all, C.S. Lewis loved allegorical literature, and it is obvious that elements of his Christianity flowed into the Narnian storyline, such as the concepts of Incarnation and Redemption.Were C.S. Lewis alive, I think he would be very glad if I could transfer to the readers his view that the book is NOT an allegory. C.S. Lewis did not say to himself, \\"Let us represent Jesus as He really is in our world by a Lion in Narnia.\\" His original inspiration was much less theological than that - nothing more than a mental picture. Long before he became a Christian, he had a picture in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. Decades went past, until one day he said to himself, \\"Let's try to make a story about it.\\" At first he had very little idea how the story would go. \\"But then suddenly,\\" he later wrote, \\"Aslan came bounding into it,\\" and \\"once he was there he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\\"I believe I am right that some people will now think, \\"But aren't the Chronicles of Narnia Christian at all? Doesn't Aslan die and rise again like Jesus did? Isn't that a representation of the Christian faith? If that isn't an allegory, what on earth is it?\\"Well, C.S. Lewis called the Chronicles a \\"supposition.\\" He wrote the books by saying, \\"Let us suppose such and such were true and then imagine what would happen.\\" At first this supposition did not even contain a Christian element, but after Aslan had \\"bounded into\\" Narnia, Lewis said, \\"Let us suppose that reality contained different parallel worlds, and that in one of them the Son of God, as He became Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen.\\"Now this supposition has a definite Christian element in it; the Christian element is in fact essential to it. But that does not make it an allegory. As we have seen, an allegory is trying to describe a (mostly immaterial) fact in our world by means of a picture, such as Reason being pictured as a sun-bright virgin clad in steel. Aslan, however, does not represent the immaterial God in the same way in which Lady Reason represents Reason. He is the result of a supposition. Granted the supposition, he and all the characters and events in Narnia would have been a physical reality no less than Jesus' death in first-century Palestine. Narnia is thus an imaginary world existing in its own right, having grown out of a Christian supposition, but not being an allegory of Christianity. To put it differently, Aslan is Jesus in another world; he is not an allegory of Jesus in our world.I would encourage those who still cannot see the difference to read Lewis's \\"Pilgrim's Regress.\\" Putting it side-by-side with the Chronicles of Narnia should make the distinction plain.But no matter whether you agree with Lewis's view on the question of allegory, no book shelf is complete without \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\"--or the other Narnian books, for that matter. One can read them again, and again, and again.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofThe Crack Beneath the Worldsand Other Books"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"We heard this book on tape, and my kids absolutely loved it! We were sorry when it was over, and wanted to hear more. We often sat in the car still listening even when we were done driving. It is a wonderful, magical story, and now we want to hear the other Chronicles stories."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Many \`key' events in my life retain only hazy places in my memory, but I can tell you exactly where I was, when I was first introduced to \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". My first grade teacher Ms. Enderlin read the book aloud to my class. Each day she had a reading time after the noon recess. Ms. Enderlin opened the book, Lucy opened the wardrobe, and I opened my eyes to a whole new type of story. That was over twenty years ago.A young girl named Lucy attempts to hide in an old wardrobe and inadvertently discovers a portal to an entirely different world -- the land of Narnia. After her initial visit to this land of speaking beasts and a tyrannical witch, Lucy decides to return with her three siblings Edmund, Susan, and Peter. In Narnia, Edmund falls to the seductive beauty of evil. Lucy, Susan, and Peter strive to save their corrupted brother and defeat the White Witch who has enslaved the talking beasts.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" offers a fantastic opportunity to expose young readers to fantasy literature. Parents who are looking for something to read with their children will especially enjoy this book and the others in the series. Lewis writes with a distinctly conversational tone that lends itself to being read aloud. Though geared primarily for children (grade school age), the Narnia books will be equally appreciated by adult readers."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"It has been several years since I last read this book. I recall having to read this book as an assignment in Elementary school. C.S. Lewis has an amazing ability to bring back childhood memories. This is an age old struggle of good versus bad. A great buy!"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is interesting yet very confusing. Don't get me wrong it was a VERY good book but it had confusing parts. It had many different settings and they described the settings well. But on the other hand, it had so many characters it was bound to get confusing. You can see how it was confusing, the characters are: Lucy, Susan, Edward, Peter, The Beavers, The Professor, The raun, The witch, Aslan, and many others. I would definetly recommend this book to others it is quite interesting. If I had to rate this book i would give it 4 stars not 5 because like i said, \\"confusing\\"!

Most people would agree that this is a very good story and it most likely takes them back to their childhood. When I first saw this edition, I knew that I had to have it. It reminded me of some of the best books that I had read as a child. From the opening of the cover to the last page, I was awestruck by the illustrations. They are great.

I chose the book because it was based off the first edition and it met my expectations."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Michael York overly emotes so that, for instance, Peter is always shouting and Lucy talks softly. I am constantly adjusting the sound volume. This is a great book, but it is exhausting and annoying trying to follow Michael York. I wish the producers had modulated the volume. I do not have this issue with any of my other audio books. For a contrast, try Christopher Timothy's reading of James Herriott's &#34;All Creatures Great and Small.&#34; Timothy also does a dramatic reading with different voices, but the volume is reasonable and the voices are plausible. I get the impression York was trying to treat reading &#34;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&#34; like a Shakesperean stage production. It is overblown."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Ok, CS Lewis is a name I have always heard but never explored. Decided to one day and ordered CS Lewis A to Z.

There's a wood inside it, and it's snowing, and there's a Faun and a Witch and it's called Narnia; come and see!\\" Lucy and her three older siblings, Edmund, Susan and Peter, are living in a strange old house with a professor when Lucy (the youngest sibling)discovers a magical, wintry forest inside a wardrobe called Narnia, at first her older siblings don't believe her, but it doesn't take long before they all discover it too, and while they're there, they meet characters like the (evil) White Witch and Aslan the Great Lion, and participate in many adventures and battles along the way. Will they follow the mighty and wise Aslan or fall into temptation from the White Witch?The book is a fantasy/adventure, set in England around the 1950's. One thing the author did in this book that I liked was he used forshadowing toward the beginning which really maked the book more interesting along the way. He also used outstanding detail to describe the look and feel of Narnia: so realistic that even though you know it's a fantasy, it feels real, as if you're there with the kids. He also uses a very 'real' tone, like the author is having a conversation with you about the story. This book is the second book of a seven book series.I particularly didn't enjoy the book, simply because it isn't \\"my type of book\\", but if you are someone who loves fantasy, adventure, suspense and some action, you'll be hooked! It makes a lot of Christian parallels also, which is very evident throughout the book.

The four kids have wonderful adventures, and learn about themselves and their siblings.I think that C.S. Lewis did an excellent job with this book. He made this story his own, not elaborating off anybody else's. He used imagery, symbolism, and personification to make the book interesting. The plot and story line is like none other I've read.

It wasn't the first, and it certainly wasn't the last, but it was the best. It just pulls you in, and you can't get out. Once you start, you will probably end up reading half of it in one sitting. From the first page, you are totaly envelloped in Narnia. You forget completely about the outside world. Once you read it, it becomes the book by which all others will be judged for the rest of your days. And trust me, its very hard to beat. I would reccomend it to ANYONE, whether they like fantasy or not, it is truly a study in good writing (the understatement of the 21st century). The religious undertones and the author's subtlty of sugestion leave the upmost room for interpretation. Getting others to read it will undoubtedly lead to endless discussions about the significance of Aslan an a god-like leader, or of the so obvious, yet hidden play between good and evil. Be warned. If you read this book, it will change your life."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion ,the Witch and the Wardrobe is an exiting tale that I would recommend to all ages .

Was it the large print or was it that I am now 60 years old and 'see' things differently? Who knows, who cares - what difference does it make.

I've read this book many times and still enjoy reading it. This is a book for all ages so if you haven't read it now. This is the book I sugest."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Above all books The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis has been the most breath taking book I've ever read. Although this book is at a 5th grade level in my opinion it is enjoyable for all ages! There are many unusual characters. The key characters are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who are brothers and sisters, Aslan, and many more. Peter is the oldest and happens to be bossy to his younger siblings. Susan is ladylike and Edmund is rude and mean. You will find in this book Edmund lies to many people. Lucy, on the other hand, is kind and thoughtful. The king of Narina, whose known as Aslan, is powerful and kind to people who are kind to him. Many, many more characters are included.In the beginning of this book the setting is in England and then it wanders off to Narina. The adventure starts when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy move in with Professor. Lucy soon discovers Narina in a wardrobe during her attempt to hide while playing Hide-and-seek. Lucy tells her siblings about her discovery but no one believes her. Finally they go in the wardrobe and find out that Lucy is telling the truth. Then they meet extraordinary beavers who are husband and wife. These beavers built an amazing house in the kingdom of Narina. What's so different special about them? You'll have to read the book or see the movie to find out the truth. Something tragic happens to Aslan! Also something amazing happens to Lucy and her siblings. In this story the White Witch wants to keep the humans so she can be the Queen of Narina. Do you want to know who the White Witch is? Too bad you'll have to read the book.The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was a fast read. This is so because I got so interested in it that it took me two days to read. I loved it. Not everyone like fantsay but this tale is not like Harry Potter, not at all. Even my teacher likes it. Not everyone likes Harry Potter but maybe everyone will like The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Although this tale was rather long, it would only be an to the story to make it have a longer and add more details, because I want it to take me more than two days to read it. In my opinion The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great book and is easy to get interested in. Read or you will be sorry that you didn't."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Two thumbs way up for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe! I see a lion! I see a witch! I see a fawn! It's cold and snowy, animals are talking. Where am I? Narnia of course! The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a thrilling fairytale. Edmond, Peter, Lucy and Susan travel into a wardrobe, hiding from the professor. While in the wardrobe they suddenly are in a world of wonderful beauty, from crystal white snow and strange creatures to centaurs and talking beavers. This thrilling book takes you away to a new land not yet discovered my mankind. The daughters and sons of Adam and Eve will face trials, hardships, and fight the all time battle against the White Witch.This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is adventurous. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe keeps you reading and makes you say, \\"What will happen next?\\" This book is one book that will leave an impression of dreams in your mind. If you read this book you will want to read the whole series."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I usually greatly dislike fantasy but I really thought that this novel, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" was interesting. The introduction of this novel was also one of the parts I thought it was interesting because of how the main character enters another part of the world and found that she had a gift. This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has. Instead of using magic like the White Witch does in Narnia, the teenager in, \\"Hatchet\\" gets his resources manually, not magically. Like all fantasy books and adventure books, the protagonists usually find that the have a specialty or a gift. I recommend this book, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" to people who likes magical places, and magical powers. People who read this novel should also like the genre, fantasy with characters that do not exist in real life. I do not recommend this book to people who are not into magical powers, or magical places."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis, the author, calls the book I have read The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. This book is about 4 young children whose names are Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy who stumbles into a mysterious world called Narnia. This world is found in an old wardrobe in their house. How they discovered this pace was when Lucy and her other brothers and sisters were playing hide and go seek and Lucy decided to hide in this old wardrobe they had found. She stared to move back into it and she noticed that there was no back to it. She kept on moving farther and farther into the wardrobe and still she could not find the wall. She started to feel weird about this until she saw a light. She ran towards the light and it was actually a lamppost. She had also noticed that there was snow on the ground and that she was in the middle of a forest! She could not believe her own eyes. Then a creature that had a body of a man and a goat came up to her and it started to talk to her. It invited her to his home. His house was a cave but it had a fireplace and candles and stuff like that. The creature told Lucy all about Narnia. Then after the creature was done she had decided to return home. When she got back home threw the wardrobe she told her brothers and sisters. They did not believe her. She got upset because they all thought she was lying. Then Edmund went into the wardrobe to see if she was telling the truth. What did Edmund see? Was Narnia really there? Was Lucy making all this up? Here are just some questions that the book gives you and the only way to find out more about it is that you will just have to read it!I liked The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe a lot. I think this book was exciting to read because of how everything was so unique of what any other stuff I have read. I also liked it because there were fights in it. I could not really feel like I was in the book because some of the descriptions were not very clear as some other books I have read. Also the characters were not really that well detailed. The main conflict did interest me, even if I could not feel like I was not in the book, because I liked the idea of how some one was trying to take back his kingdom and I also liked it because there was a couple of really cool battles in it. I thought the characters did not seem that realistic because the author did not describe the characters as well because he pretty much just gave basic information about each one of them. I thought the books' ending was satisfying but the author seemed to me like he was trying to rush the ending. The ending didn't really make sense but besides that I think the book was good though.I think the author had a voice in a more little childish sort of voice. Like he would not give away the cool parts like heads being chopped off. The author did use a very large vocabulary but he did include monsters that I have never heard of like something called a wraith. I thought the author had absolutely no uniqueness to his writing but I think he made a very unique plot. Some unique characteristics of his writing is that he would say stuff like \\" I can not tell you any more of how these creatures looked like because they would be to hideous for the readers.\\" I thought the dialogue in this book was okay compared to other books I have read. I think this book was more set to younger people, so that's why the dialogue is not very good to me because its it kind of immature to me. I think this author did a really good job with the plot but needs to work on more description, but over all I thought the book was very unique.I think this book is an all right book. I think this book is more for younger people around 12 and younger. This book is a very easy read. Also this book is good for boys and girls. Finally I would rate this book an 8 out of 10.The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is a a pretty good book. I admit that I have read better books but this is a good book if you are looking for a easy and a pretty fast read. I personally think this book is more set for younger kids maybe around the age of 10. I liked this book because of how unique it was. It was unique because of all the different types of monsters it had like trolls, wraiths, goblins, centaurs, and much more. I also liked this book because it was really easy to understand. Finally I liked this book because it did have a few good fighting scenes like the battle with Peter against a wolf captain. This book deserves an 8 out of 10 because of how its really unique but it is also set for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"It thought this book was a very good book.

I was there when it was written\\"The four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - have come into the countryside to live with The Professor, away from the war. While there, Lucy discovers an old wardrobe that leads to a magical world.I Liked:I find myself at a loss figuring out what I want to say about this book. I've never been as fond of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as I've been of \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", but it certainly isn't a bad book.The story is clever and unique. At the time, not many fantasy stories existed for children, and this book definitely transports you to a world much different than ours. I love how it is populated with mythological creatures like fauns, nymphs and centaurs, but also has talking animals (which Disney almost owns exclusive rights to), and not just your \\"typical\\" talking animals, like cats and dogs, but animals like beavers (beavers?! That wouldn't have been my first choice) and lions.Another clever addition was the treachery of Edmund. Children in books tend to come off as almost insanely perfect and unable to err, and even this book doesn't avoid it 100% as Lucy, Peter, and Susan do have near-perfect attributes. But Edmund's deception, greed, and subsequent guilt do make things more realistic and show redemption. Plus, it keeps our bad guys from being painfully bad.I Didn't Like:What's always bugged me about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was the heavy-handed Christian allegory/symbolism/whatever-you-call-it. I consider myself a religious person, and yet the message is still too heavy-handed to me and makes me feel I am being bludgeoned with a brick. There were some things that weren't bad (Edmund's redemption), but the obvious parallels to Christian ideology, again, made me cringe.Similarly, I found a lot of the characters to be very simplistic and easily drawn out. I realize this is a children's novel, but still, it would have been nice had Lucy not been so obviously perfect (it could have made the \\"Who is lying?\\" bit between Lucy and Edmund's stories of Narnia more interesting) and had Peter and Susan had more character beyond \\"caring, older siblings\\".I also wasn't fond at all of the lack of participation of the girls in particular and the children in general. Lucy finds the land of Narnia, so she gets some brownie points, but after that, her purpose is nothing. Peter fights a battle and that is it. Susan is the worst as she does nothing that couldn't have been done by one of her other siblings. Honestly, the only person that does anything in the course of the novel is Edmund, and even that is only mess things up. The children themselves do nothing; only their presence in Narnia dictates any action, and that is because of a painfully written poem/prophecy. I understand that Lewis was going for an allegory of sorts between Narnia and our world in Christian terms and that our characters are children and can't be miniature Rambos and Rocky's, but when none of our characters really do much, it makes the whole story feel a little pointless.Also, I know this book was published in 1952, but I hated how Susan and Lucy were purposefully cut out of the fight (\\"Wars aren't for girls\\" - but they aren't for little boys, either) and the prejudice to non-humans (Mr. Beaver says that the White Witch is bad because she isn't human but is pretending to be human and those kinds of people can't be trusted...WTF?!). Maybe if Susan and Lucy had more of a role, then I wouldn't complain.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Absolutely nothing.While no where near as creepy as Uncle Andrew towards Polly in The Magician's Nephew, the White Witch does act pretty cozy to Edmund.There is an epic battle; a major character dies.Overall:While enjoyable to read, I did find myself growing bored, irritated, or embarrassed while reading this book. I would have preferred a book less overt about its theme and message, and one that spent more time building characters and making them important. However, this book does ignite a spark of imagination and creativity, and I think children would enjoy it worlds more than a jaded adult like me.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Lewis wrote this volume first, in 1950, but he later said that The Magician's Nephew, written in 1955, should be considered the first book in his seven book Narnia series. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe occurs when the main character of The Magician's Nephew is an old man, a very wise professor, who lives in a very large house.Four children, siblings, two brothers and two sisters, are sent out of London to the professor's house in the countryside to escape the bombs dropped by the German air force during World War II. They discover a wardrobe that turns out to be a portal leading to the magical land of Narnia.Narnia is under the control of a wicked witch who is a descendant of Adam and the demon Lilith. She has covered all of Narnia with cold weather and snow, with no Christmas for a hundred years. Aslan the lion, the God figure, the creator of Narnia, has been absent from Narnia ever since the wicked witch took control. The citizens of Narnia look forward to his return to save them from the evil. This reminds readers of the popular idea that a messiah will come and help create an ideal world.There is a prophecy in Narnia that if four humans come to Narnia, two males and two females, Aslan will return. The four siblings are present; however, one of the two boys has been seduced by the witch. Nevertheless, the prophecy begins to be fulfilled, Father Christmas appears. He gives everyone gifts. He gives the three children instruments of war.How they fought? What did the lion do? What happened to the witch? What happened to the fourth child? Did all four children return home? These are questions that the rest of the book answers."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This allegorical book, supposedly aimed at children, provided Mr. Lewis with a wonderful medium to deliver a Christian message to readers of all ages. He casts the perennial contest between good and evil as a secret adventure of four displaced children in a land frozen under the control of a wily wicked witchy ruler. While good prevails, it does not come without struggle and sacrifice. Along the way the Lion of Judah acquires a new name and important lessons of loyalty and courage are learned.I really like books that are inspiring, thought-provoking, and fun. It makes me wonder what is in the back of all my closets! This book makes a great gift for young people that they will treasure throughout life. Another Christian fantasy book I like, aimed at a somewhat older audience, isARROWS THROUGH TIME: A Time Travel Tale of Adventure, Courage, and Faith."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"For those of you who are unfamiliar with C. S. Lewis's works and stances on life and faith, I suggest you check out Mere Christianity, which is perhaps the best book ever written on the fundamentals of Christianity. Narnia is also one of the greatest Fantasy series to tackle faith, as it is filled with Biblical symbolisms. Lewis noted that kids often picked up on the symbolisms more than adults, so we gotta show those youngsters that we can still think creativelyStory overview:---------------Peter (13), Susan (12), Edmund (10) and Lucy (8), are evacuated from London to escape the effects of WW2. They go to the home of Professor Digory Kirke, who owns a huge country house and lives with his housekeeper, Mrs MacReady.Lucy discovers that a mysterious wardrobe is actually a portal to another world called Narnia. She meets a talking faun named Tumnus and learns of the White Witch, who made it always winter but never Christmas. No one believes Lucy on her return, but one day Edmund and her end up in Narnia after hiding in the wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek. Edmund is deceived by the White Witch and betrays his siblings once they all find their way to the world of Narnia.Meeting up with the Beaver family, the children learn about the fate of Tumnus and the goings on in Narnia. They find out about a prophecy and Aslan (The Great Lion), who is said to be on the move. They eventually meet up with him, and when Edmund is rescued, the White Witch demands his return. According to the ancient law (the \\"Deep magic\\") she has the right to do so, but instead of handing over Edmund, Aslan takes his place to die for the boy's guilt. This isn't the end of the Great Lion, as a final battle takes place and the prophecy is fulfilled.My thoughts:-------------When I was little, my mother read me this story and I absolutely loved it. Unlike some of the other books my mother had read, I still like this one as much today as I did back then. Ironically, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is one of the books in this series I liked the least, but it still marks the beginning of a wonderful magical world, and a journey that every kid should experience.

There are many reasons why you should buy the book itself. The plot is rich and full of details (however if you read The Magician's Nephew first, much of the plot will be spoiled). The illustrations are absolutely wonderful. Also (though this is a reason why you should buy the 1950 one), having it in hardcover and textured really holds the book together, so you can expect to get many years out of it, if it has already lasted 59. This is the order in which you should read the books: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and his Boy, The Magician's Newphew, and the Last Battle. By the way, if you're someone who absolutely loves the original order of the books, or even someone who prefers the chronological order, you'll notice there's just no way to change The Last Battle, with the \\"last\\" part of it in the title."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I think kids would enjoy reading \\"Narnia The lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" because there's plenty of adventure and action. The main characters of Narnia are Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund. The author is C.S. Lewis. C.S. Lewis was very descriptive in describing the characters which made them believable. For example, when the author described the kids being scared of the beavers. The beavers seamed real.My favorite part of the book is when Edmund went into the witch's castle. I liked this scene because it was very spooky. It was spooky because there was a lion that appeared to be real but was really made of stone. Then Edmund saw a wolf which he thought was stone but was in fact real. I rate this book 9 out of 10."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C. S.

He really brings the story to life in a very real way."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"*****I was happy to hold a hardcover with Pauline Baynes' illustrations.

Left with nothing to do besides play and get into trouble, Lucy, the youngest, gets into a wardrobe and finds a passageway to the magical world of Narnia. It is there that she meets a certain Mr. Tumnus, a nice enough chap who just happens to be a \\"Faun\\", or what I would call a satyr. At first Tumnus seems to be very friendly and invites Lucy back to his home for tea. It is there that he reveals that he is supposed to capture any humans he finds and report them to the White Witch, the self-appointed ruler of Narnia who has entrapped the land in endless winter. When he goes against the Witch's orders he is taken prisoner and taken to her castle. Lucy, along with Susan, Peter, and Edmund, set out to rescue the Faun, and in the process becomes agents of prophecy who may have the power to overthrow the wicked White Witch. They're not alone. Aslan, the god-like lion that created Narnia, has also returned to lead the fight against the black magic that threatens to extinguish all goodness. But the kids never counted on one of their own blood turning against them.Since they came out around the same time and the two authors were such good friends, one cannot help but compare the Narnia books to the Lord of the Rings sequence. And let me tell you, Lewis's work seems pale in comparison to Tolkien's. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe never quite makes it to epic status. There are too few characters, the world seems landlocked and hyperfocused, and you never get the sense that the book is part of a larger tapestry. Instead of world-building for all eternity, Lewis did just enough to frame his story. Nothing more. Nothing less. I just don't feel that the work has a solid mythology behind it.I also didn't feel very connected to the characters. They all seemed distant, cold, and at times very snobbish, in a way that only the English can be. Instead of warm-blooded real life characters, the four kids were more like anonymous cut-outs from fairy tales. Yes, Edmund was a little backstabber, and Lucy was the curious one, but beyond that, I never got a feel for who these people really were.I will say this. I liked the book ok. It was a nice diversion, but I just never connected fully with it. I definitely do not rate it as a classic. It seemed more like a work produced in the 19th century than the 20th, and perhaps that was Lewis's intention. It just didn't work for me. I will definitely continue to read the series though."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis are great children's books. They are easy to read and interesting. In The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, it starts out with Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter having to go live with their uncle because of the war and air raids from Germany. One day while playing hide and seek in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and finds herself in another world; Narnia. She meets a fawn and becomes friends with him. He warns Lucy of the White Witch warning her of her power. When Lucy returns to her world, her siblings don't believe her but later on all hide in the wardrobe and walk into Narnia. Edmund betrays his siblings and sides with the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. They run around, following Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, trying to hide from the White Witch while trying to meet Aslan, the lion at the Stone Table. Aslan talks to Edmund and settles for him to never betray them again. The queen does not want the children to be in Narnia because of the prophecy that says that four people will take over Narnia and overthrow the queen. There is a battle over Narnia between the children and the Witch. The children win and become the rulers of Narnia.Unlike most books it is interesting from the beginning, and keeps you interested. I usually don't like fantasy fiction books, but this is a good one. There are adventures involved, which can get children into a book. I didn't get the characters mixed up as I usually do in a book. The story is descriptive enough to get a picture in your head but doesn't go on for three pages about the scenery.I read this book when I was in about 6th grade, and honestly I enjoyed it more now as a teenager because I understood more of it. I would not usually pick up a book for fun and read it, but I would recommend this book to readers because it is simple and to the point, and interesting. I have the sequels and may read those to find out what happens next in Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Set early in World War II, four children are evacuated from their home in London, which is being bombed by the German airforce and rockets. They are sent to the country residence of a wise old professor. There Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund find that they have \`fallen on their feet' as the house and its grounds are delightful. Most amazing of all (of all the things they discover, that is), one room contains a wardrobe which may allow entry to a land called Narnia, a land of myth made alive, full of creatures of legend, and ruled by a wicked queen whose magic makes it always winter. The talking beasts have taken sides, fearful or greedy ones like the wolves have turned bad and sided with the witch. But many who seem weaker remain loyal to the memory of before the witch's rule and to the true ruler of Narnia who is Aslan the great lion. And now the coming of the four children sets in motion the fulfilment of an old prophecy which gives hope to the true Narnians, and puts fear into the heart of the witch. If the four children take all four thrones that wait empty in the castle of Cair Paravel, they will become the kings and queens of Narnia, and the witch will be thrown down. So there will be war in Narnia too.How can four children who have escaped from one terror hope to win against a clever and cruel witch of such power? All their courage and all their strength is required, and the help of all are willing to aid them. They will need weapons magical and weapons plain. Even the sheer power of Aslan cannot be used to simply destroy the witch as it becomes clear that the magic by which he made Narnia follows the laws of deep magic, which are part of the nature of Aslan himself. Even he must obey his own nature, which in Narnia governs everything as the laws are a part of the existence of the land itself. Now the witch, for all her cleverness, does not understand magic as well as she imagines, and in her haste to capture and kill Edmund and prevent the prophecy coming true, she makes a bargain of which no-one can see where it will lead except Aslan himself.This was written first of the seven in the Narnia series and overall it is best read first. It is the easiest to read, and a five-year old can understand the story quite well if read out by an adult. It is probably best to read \`Prince Caspian' next in the series as it was written second, and all four children appear in this story. \`The Magician's Nephew' was written sixth in the series, and it explains how Narnia was created, and is a superb story. But none of Peter, Susan, Lucy, or Edmund appear in it as it is before their time. Also, the language in it is somewhat harder than that in \`Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe'.The Narnia books are not allegories, this is the wrong word for them. In an allegory, each character, and often each place, stands for one other thing. The names of these characters almost always give away what they stand for. A good (in fact the best) example of an allegory is \`The Pilgrim's Progress' by John Bunyan, where there are characters called \`Christian' and \`Hope' and \`Mr Worldly Wise', and places names like \`Vanity Fair' and \`The Slough of Despond'. There are many others, the Greek legends, Aesop's Fables, and fairy stories often work like this. Narnia stories are magical, mythical, parallel world stories but not allegory. The characters are living characters in their own right, they do not stand \`one-for-one' as things or symbols. The stories do contain symbols and meanings, but then so do all stories, or they would not be called stories. The other thing you cannot call the characters is metaphors, they live and breath and develop in their own world. All language is metaphorical. The sentence \`I see what you mean', is metaphorical. A blind man can \`see what you mean', it does not take eyes to \`see' meaning. So, what are the Narnia books? They are a \`thought experiment' in a magical world. All stories are thought experiments, or they would not be called stories. The only question is, what type?C.S. Lewis was a Christian, was converted around the age of thirty, and he knew what stories appealed to the non-Christian as well as the Christian. He was exceptionally clever, even for an Oxford don and Cambridge professor. He knew how to appeal to \`hearts and minds'. That is why these stories are so popular, they ring so true. It is easy to be attracted to the goodness of the good characters in them whoever you are and whenever you are in life's journey. The \`good dreams' which the ancient Greeks captured in their myths and legends attracted him, and that is why they reappear here. The things they did not understand well are all overshadowed in the light of a greater myth, the myth of Narnia. What the Greeks saw, in part and broken up, is seen here - brighter and more full of life. More of the good, better woven together. Because we have greater light, it does not mean that they did not do as well as they could with the light they had.It is hard to create really exciting good characters in books, often the bad characters are more exciting--many books of magical tales have dynamic villians and wishy-washy cardboard good guys (it is not so hard to think of some). C. S. Lewis is one of the greats, and the mark of it is that his good characters really are."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"I didn't read this book when I was younger, but I enjoyed it very much!

LewisReviewed by:R.AjocPeriod: 1The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best book that Clive Staples Lewis has created. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is about Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund in their guardians home because of war in thier homeland. One day as their playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a giant wardrobe and stumbles into a mysterious land that her friend, Mr. Tumnus calls Narnia. Lucy is very astonished that she has found this new fantasy world inside of her guardian, Professor Kirke. Lucy tries to tell everyone yet no one believes anything that lucy says. Then Edmund, the bratty one in the family happens to also find Narnia, Edmund being the brat that he is tells everyone, and no one believes him. Then all of them go into the wardrobe for the first time and nothing happenes, then tries later thier in the snowy world of Narnia, and they all see Mr. Tumnus, as sneaky Edmund runs off with the white witch. Now the others Lucy, Susan, and Peter must find the White Witch and defeat her with the mighty lion, Aslan.The whole plot of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is to start of the real beggining of The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book. C.S. Lewis starts off the great fantasy world, Narnia with a great hit. Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe has already been created into a movie. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book because it features many scenes while you read where you can just sink into and get lost in, especially the part during the war.This book is a very good book, although I am not a very big fan of fantasy books but Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best fantasy book I have ever read and probably the one and only best book in the series. This book is special because of the way you feel as you read it, it is as if your actually in the fantasy world of Narnia as your reading, like your running right behind Aslan as you run, or like your on flying on a dragon, such as on Dragon Rider. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is one of the best fantasy books to have hit book shelves.My favorite part of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is during the end when there is a big battle for who will win the land of Narnia The White Witch or Aslan, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This part took alot of imagination, and it really helps you picture the war in your head. As Aslan revivies from the brutal killing ceremony from The White Witch Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund are surprised to see that Aslan is still alive. This part of the story showed that you can never die, your body may die but your soul lives on. Aslan's role in this part of the story is very strong, you can feel that C.S. Lewis is trying to send you messages in a fantasy book, while your using your imagination and thinking of how the story is going on in your head."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chrohicles of Narnia,The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe,is writen by C.S Lewis.It is about four children Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy.They find an intense other world in a wardrobe.There are wonderful creatures there like Mr.Tumnus and Mr. and Mrs.Beaver,however not all are good,The White Witch,cast a spell on Narnia.Now it is up to Aslan a lion and the children to brake it,and you can help them."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeBy: C.S. LewisReviewed By: J. ZhuPeriod: 6The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is about four siblings. Their names from youngest to oldest are Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter. They live with their mother, but their hometown is under siege in a war. The sibling's mom is scared that they might be killed and so they are sent on a train to go to the Professor's house. When they get to the Professor's house, his maid Mrs. Macready shows the kids around the house and sets some ground rules. Lucy, the youngest child wanders off for a while and sees the wardrobe. After a while the kids become bored and they decide to play hide-and-seek. Lucy remembers about the wardrobe and then goes back to hide there. When Lucy gets inside the wardrobe she trips and falls into this white fluffy stuff. It's snow! Lucy wanders around for a while in this \\"wardrobe\\" and she meets a fawn named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Tumnus then invites Lucy over to his house and gives her some tea. After they talk for a while and get to know each other, Mr. Tumnus plays this instrument and it makes Lucy sleepy. Before Lucy is fully asleep, Mr. Tumnus stops playing and cries over what he has just done. Then Mr. Tumnus tells what he was about to do and Lucy finds out all about where she is (land of Narnia) and that the queen (Jadis or White Witch) is making it winter forever and never Christmas. There was a prophecy that states when two of Adam's sons and two of Eves' daughters come to Narnia the Queen will be out of power and Narnia will be a happy place once again. Then Mr. Tumnus thinks that the queen might already know that a daughter of Eve is in Narnia and he shows Lucy the way back to the Professor's house. When Lucy comes out however, she tells her siblings what had happened, but no time has gone by. At first no one believes her, but Edmund decides to go check the wardrobe anyways. When Edmund gets into the land of Narnia he meets the White Witch and she gives him magical Turkish delight that makes him want more and more. The queen promises that if he brings his other siblings then he will get as much Turkish delight he desires. After many times not believing Lucy the siblings decide to try to look in the wardrobe again. This time on the other hand, the land of Narnia is there! They all decide to go to Mr. Tumnus, the fawn's house. When they reach his house they find out that he was captured and thrown in jail for fraternizing with humans (Lucy). After they get out of the house the children see a little beaver and it tells them to follow him. The beaver ends up bringing them to a small dam. The beaver then tells the children the story about The White Witch and Narnia. Before the story of Narnia and The White Witch was over, Edmund had already gone to The White Witch's house and told her the story about Azlan coming back. When the other siblings find out that Edmund is gone, they realized that he must have betrayed them and they left the dam with the Beavers. The Beavers found out that Azlan is already in Narnia and he is waiting for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy at the Stone Table. When they reach the Stone Table they see Azlan, but they went without Edmund. Azlan then told the children that the prophecy could not be fulfilled unless they had Edmund too. So, the children and Azlan's army go to where they were holding Edmund and freed him. After Edmund realized what he has done he is back on the good side. Then the children and Azlan's army prepared for one of the fiercest battles ever. Then Azlan called his army and he started one of the greatest wars ever. In the end, Azlan won and The White Witch was killed. Then Edmund, Peter, Lucy, and Susan all became queens and kings of Narnia.I liked this book because of many things. One reason that made me like this book is that C.S. Lewis has a magical ability to give you a marvelous description of what is happening and where the characters are. There is one sentence that I really thought made me feel as if I was one of the characters and I was actually there and that is, \\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That really made me picture a thought of a beaver dam with a marvelous food fragrance coming out of a small chimney. I also enjoyed the book because C.S. Lewis just knows how to hook you into the book.My favorite part of the book was when the kids were in the Beavers' house. This was my favorite part of the story because C.S. Lewis gives a description about the food that the Beavers' had prepared for dinner. When C.S. Lewis wrote about fish I just wanted to get my hands on some fish. Usually I do not like fish, but C.S. Lewis' description made it sound very tasty and mouth-watering."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"This is the best book ever!This book is about 4 kids named Lucy, Edmund, Suzan,and Peter.

A must read."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"The lion the witch and the wardrobe is an out standing book written by an amazing author. The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) who take a tremendous journey into a mystical country called Narnia.After stumbling into a wardrobe in an old professor's house (where they were sent because of a war) they came upon the snowy country of Narnia. While in Narnia they come across a talking beaver, in fact every animal in Narnia can talk. The beaver invites the children to his house for dinner.During the dinner the beaver talks to them about the White Witch and how she makes it always winter but never Christmas. He also talks to them about how evil she is and how she thinks she's queen but really isn't. One of the other things that he talked about was that she turned everyone that disagreed with her to stone.One of the most interesting things that the beaver talked about was Aslan. Aslan is a powerful lion that is rightfully king and he had just returned from a very long journey. He also talked about the prophecy. The prophecy states that when four humans sit in the four thrones peace will be restored.It turned out that Edmund had been in Narnia before and had met the White Witch. It also turned out that the White Witch had him under a spell. Because he was under a spell he left the beaver's house when nobody was looking and set off for the witch's house.After many days the three other children met Aslan and told him that Edmund was missing. Aslan went to go get Edmund but the only way he could was to sacrifice his life. Aslan knew that the only way to restore peace to Narnia so he was killed. The next day was a huge war, good against evil.If you want o know what happens in the war, to Edmund, and to Aslan, you're going to half to read the book yourself.

The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel. This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up. And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"great book you just imagine yourself in and get lost in with all the discriptions by c.s lewis"},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"Jeffrey ShanghaiA fascinating book...The book I chose to read for this assignment is \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\", and the reason I chose it was because I have already read it's previous book in the series (The Magician's Nephew), therefore I chose to carry on with the series, as I find reading sequels one after another is a lot easier than reading independent books that I have no connection of.

They were sent to an old professor's house because of the air raids in London. On one cold, rainy day, the children decided to explore the house. The came into a rather empty room, only filled with a very large wardrobe. They saw that nothing of interest was there, so they left, except for Lucy. She wanted to open the door to the wardrobe and stepped inside. What she found inside was not just the back of the wardrobe but an entire wood all covered in snow. While walking a little through the forest, she met a faun named Mr. Tumnus. He brought her to a den in which he was about to turn her in to the white which, who was making all of Narnia, the world Lucy had came in, winter with no Christmas. Mr. Tumnus realized he had to let her go and help her escape. When she returned to the wardrobe, it wasn't even a second after she had left. One other day, the children decided to play hide-and-seek. Lucy went almost directly to the wardrobe room. Just as she stepped in, Edmund saw her go in and decided to follow and tease her, when he found himself also in Narnia. There he met the White Witch. He gave him some food and drink and told him to bring his siblings to her house. When the White Witch left, Lucy found Edmund and they both went back to the wardrobe room. When Lucy told Peter and Susan that Edmund had gotten in too, Edmund said that he had been playing and pretending with Lucy. The house in which the professor lives in, is one of those houses in which many sightseers came to look at. One day, a whole group of them were there with Mrs. Macready. So all the children went into the wardrobe room and hid in the wardrobe and backed up until all the children ended up in Narnia. They had decided to go visit Mr. Tumnus when they found his house had been destroyed and Mr. Tumnus pulled off to prison. Outside, they saw Mr. Beaver who led them to his home on a frozen river. There Mrs. Beaver and Mr. Beaver told the four children the entire prophecy, when suddenly they had realized that Edmund had gone. Mr. Beaver said they had to leave right away for Aslan at the stone table because the White Witch had gotten Edmund to betray them. At the Stone Table, Aslan and his entire army had gotten ready for a great war. Aslan sent a party of centaurs to chase after a wolf at their camp. This wolf lead them to the White Witch's camp and they were able to bring back Edmund. A couple of days later, their armies clashed. Aslan had went to the White Witch's Castle to revive all those that she had turned to stone. With those extra reinforcements they were able to win the battle. Peter was crowned high king, and Susan, Edmund, and Lucy became king and queens.I really enjoyed this book because it was almost impossible to put down. The description made it feel like you were actually there and could feel what they were feeling and experience what they were experiencing. For example, this sentence made me feel like a picture was elaborately painted in my mind,\\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry)you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That made me feel probably just as those Pevensie children felt when they saw it.There was nothing in general about this book that I didn't enjoy. Nothing except in one moment when Edmund lied that he hadn't been in Narnia. I felt extremely sorry for Lucy. If I were her I probably would have shouted at Edmund for lying and being beastly. Despite that one moment, the story was really great. The best moment was probably when Aslan revived the lion. The description was just beautiful. \\"Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back-then the color seemed to lick all over him as the flame lick all over a bit of paper-then, while his hindquearters were still obviously stone, the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds ripple into living hair.\\" Reading that description was just impossible to describe with words."},{"Title":"The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe","review":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY ADVENTURES WHEN FOUR KIDS PETER,EDMUND,SUSAN,AND LUCY FIND THE MAGICAL LAND OF NARNIA.ESPESILY WHEN ASLAN {GOD} CAME AND THEN EVERY GOOD PERSON FELT CONFIDENT OF DEFETING THE WHITE WHITCH.LUCY WAS AMAZED TO FIND MR.TUMNUS.THEN EDMUND FOUND THE WHITE WHITCH AND HAD ENCHANTED TURKISH DELIGHT WHICH HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO HAVE SOME MORE.THEN THE WHITE WHITCH TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE SOME MORE AFTER HE BRINGS HER HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO HER.AFTER HUGE BATTLES THEY FINALY KILL HER AND ARE NAMED KING AND QUEEN OF NARNIA."},{"Title":"Luna's Night (Bear in the Big Blue House) (Night Glow Board Books)","review":"My soon-to-be 2 year old dislikes bedtime no matter how appealing we tried to make it, until we got this book.

So we get to turn out the lights and read the pages with a flashlight then turn the flashlight off and see the glow. The glow in the dark parts of the book are actually quite detailed and light up really well."},{"Title":"Luna's Night (Bear in the Big Blue House) (Night Glow Board Books)","review":"This \\"Bear in the Big Blue House\\" book is all about Bear's night-time friend, Luna, and so it's only fitting that this book has a special feature that can only be seen at night (or, at least, in the dark, anyway.)Normally, Luna is only seen at the end of each episode of the show and so it's nice to learn a bit more about her. In this book, Luna tells Bear all about her various night-time friends. From fireflies to campers, Luna has plenty of friends at night.By \\"charging\\" the book with a lamp (and then a flashlight, once it's been charged before), images on each page will glow-in-the-dark.

When you turn off the lights, the real wonder begins, as you read the book a second time through the glow in the dark images on each page which give a whole new appreciation of the original story.

Mr. Roache presents a great deal of prophetic text, which he interprets, but also leaves open to interpretation by the reader. He includes well known scriptures along with more obscure writings such as the book of Enoch and writings by Emily Dickenson. Since reading this book I have been introduced to the Nag Hammadi Library, the Zohar, as well as other texts, and I continue to find ancient writings that seem to corroborate Roache's point that we are at a unique point in the history of man, and that there is much to be learned from the ancestral heritage of writings that have survived to present day."},{"Title":"Treating Families and Children in the Child Protective System: Strategies for Systemic Advocacy and Family Healing (Family Therapy and Counseling)","review":"Poignant yet practical,Dr. Crenshaw and his colleagues effectively illustrate how to uphold the principles of social justice while serving the downtrodden victims trapped within the confines of the often times chaotic and fragmented child welfare system.

The first thirty or so pages describe Mrs. Sheridan's childhood in Britain and Russia (apparently some wealthy Britons summered in pre-revolution Russia) , her chance meetings with her future husband and their marriage just before World War One. She first met the future Queen Elizabeth, as a baby, in the late 20's, 1927(?) or so.Photography is the main focus of the book, the Sheridan's apparently first got into it as a family hobby and from my reading of the book so far- the author must've been the principal photographer as things went along.It isn't until page 37 that the Sheridan's first &#34;professional&#34; work appeared in a newspaper, (an enlargement of a missing man's photo), the real break came when she sent in a nude photo of her 11 year old daughter to some newspaper talent thing, got a lot of notice for that and started getting offers for work, (that photograph appears near it's mention in the book, maybe the only one of several photographs so placed)., the &#34;cabbages&#34; in the book title being one of the first jobs.The first &#34;royal&#34; work offer came along in 1936, about page 57, photographing the Duke & Duchess of York and their two daughters not long before he became the future George VI.I haven't finished reading the book but much of the remainder appears to center on photographing the Royal family, with occasional side trips into other aspects of the family photographic career. I don't think you'll learn much about the Sheridan family but you will get a sense of devotion to the King, and later the Young Queen Elizabeth II.I'd like the book better if the photo sections were more closely aligned with the parts of the book that relate to them, sometimes pictures that aren't even &#34;royal&#34; are in a section of &#34;royals&#34;. You also won't learn much photographic how-to but of the bits given- many will still apply even in this digital age.The book has some value as photographic instruction but is worth far more as a collection of now rarely seen Royal photographs and accompanying trivia. It's a more worthwhile Royal book than many of the more recent Amazon offerings, especially being so inexpensive."},{"Title":"Final Hour","review":"In Indiana, Roy and Hal follow the delivery truck as it travels towards its destination. When a woman appears in the middle of the back road, the driver and his companion stop to offer their assistance. The delivery personnel good samaritan gesture is instantly paid back in full as Roy executes both of them. Roy and Hal continue to drive the truck until they gain entrance to the estate of former senator Paul Lattimore. Hal and Roy abduct Paul's ten-year-old son Charlie.The FBI assigns Sean Alexander, their best agent, to the highly visible case. However, because his last case ended in failure, Jennifer Bennett is also placed on the investigation team. Sean thinks Jennifer is a news hound who could not care whether a little boy is safely rescued as long as she gets positive press. Jennifer feels Sean is a burned-out has-been, who should take a pension and retire. With their initial reactions so averse to one another, it is a wonder they could work on the same planet. Yet, they not only work well together following every lead, they begin to fall in love. Still a ten-year-old is in the hands of Roy, who would not mind another notch on his belt.FINAL HOUR is a strong romantic police procedural that should entice fans of romantic intrigue and FBI tales. The story line is filled with action that never lets up for even one page. The characters are beautifully developed, especially their initial mistrust and the metamorphosis into a strong, loving team. Tracey Tillis has written a great romantic intrigue that if categorized as a police procedural, would require sequels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Final Hour","review":"I consider myself somewhat of an eclectic reader. I have my favorite genres, I also have my favorite authors and to that list I'm going to add the name Tracey Tillis.I have never heard of her before, so I really feel like I've found a diamond.I loved the story, the characters were very believable and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel. Heck, even a series. I'm going to order Tracey's previous titles and this copy is going into my keeper collection."},{"Title":"Final Hour","review":"Anyone who enjoys reading John Sandford's Prey series will enjoy Tracey Tillis's body of work.

I thought all the important characters were well developed and the only love scene good. I do wish there was more concentration on the romance bt. the black woman( Jennifer) and white man(Sean). I really wish this was turned into a series or was longer. I think both interracial and suspense readers will like this book. It's just not as intense as I thought it would be."},{"Title":"Final Hour","review":"This is the 2nd and last book of Tillis' that I've pushed myself through. Nothing here - again - but boring, shallow and unemotional characters, and a very pedestrian and transparent plot."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"This novel takes place in a remote Cathedral city in England; the reader is drawn into various peoples'lives, central among them the Dean of the Cathedral. It is the story of the way that this humble man, who is unaware of the impact of his simple love for God and his fellow man, deeply affects many in his city. It is a beautifully told story of the healing power of love. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"...I became enchanted by the tale Goudge tells. The setting for the story is a cathedral city in the fens. The city is populated with charmingly depicted characters that ooze quaintness from every pore. The main character is the old Dean, known in the town as a fierce and relentless man due to his hunting down of the city's corruption. And yet, the Dean is a misunderstood man. His love and fidelity are often met with indifference in the town, and this is even more true of his own wife who is deterred by his ugliness and who finds his devotion to her repulsive. Yet help is at hand, for the Dean owns a beautiful watch: a watch that becomes the starting point for a new friendship for the Dean, and new hope.Goudge's tale is clearly Christian in content. It is a tale of redemption, grace and love in a world of ugliness and pain. It is never, I think crass, and retains a note of ambiguity to the end, which is appropriate to her theme. Readers will find that something of this story can speak to them if they let it, and indeed, I suspect it speaks to Everyman. Yet it is never moralistic, didactic or triumphalist: often the worst sins of the Christian novel.A lovely tale, with enough depth to grasp sceptical readers like myself."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"This is my favorite Elizabeth Goudge book. I read this every December before the Christmas holidays. This is a very well-written story about people in a small English cathedral village thrown together by a humble clockmaker. Lives are being changed and we are told how and why. It's a gentle story, and told with much insight into human behavior."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"Elizabeth Goudge is a fine writer. Her language is rich as butter. All of her stories are interesting, but this one is beautiful. I believe that, after all the books I have read in my rather long life, books of all manner of styles and genres, this book is the deepest and best. Her characterizations are strong and complex, her consideration of the human state both honest and compassionate. There is great affection for humanity, even in her most honest and grieving portrayal of it. Beautiful writing, strong story, interesting and provoking characters - I enjoy so much the honor of spending a few hours with this woman and the depth of her faith, courage and love."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"My favorite by Goudge, by far. She takes you there on a flying carpet of words so that you can see, smell and hear, visiting the homes and lives of the rich and weak, the poor and strong, the bitter, the loving, the young, the old, and helpless. Central to it all is the Dean of the Cathedral, only now in his last year is he being truly changed under God's hand. And his &quot;watch&quot; is a timepiece, but also his alloted time on duty. Interesting things happen during his watch!There are characters we love, rejoice with, sigh for, and laugh at. We see the joy of a little girl receiving a gift of a parasol (though the Dean's joy in giving it exceeds her joy in receiving). But his wife, who has greater riches, does not rejoice in what she receives.Though non-Anglicans may need a bit of help with certain terms and concepts, grab the book and enjoy. Then share it with a friend, while you run off to get Goudge's Green Dolphin Street."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"Elizabeth Gouge is one of the finest wordsmiths I have ever read. Her stories are gentle, compassionate - showing her abiding compassion for human kind, with our flaws and our nobility equally recognized. A woman of faith, she weaves a magic through her tales--a twisting of earthly realities with spiritual mysteries, and she denies any limits on reality, knowing that there is more to this world, and to our being in it, than the \\"reality\\" many people insist on defining. There is humility in her work, but tremendous greatness. And her writing is as lovely as a Japanese ink drawing - deft, smooth, simple, evocative. She can handle a sentence like nobody else in the world--words sweet and rich as butter, a complete pleasure to run through the mind and the imagination. I wish she were still alive and I could write to her. I wish I could know her better. I'd love to hear what she might have to say about quite a few things, these days. This is my favorite book in all the world. That's the greatest praise I can offer."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"One of Goudge's last novels, The Dean's Watch, also exemplifies her view of life.Set during the 1870s in an unnamed English fen city, whose heart is a medieval cathedral, it tells what happens when an old clock-maker, Isaac Peabody, mistakenly places a printed motto in the antique pocket watch of the grim cathedral Dean, Adam Ayscough, and subsequently meets the Dean.Isaac is a tradesman and an atheist, brutalised by the hell-fire faith of his father who had been a Church of England priest in one of the city's churches. He is terrified of the cathedral itself, and would never dare presume to speak with such an elevated member of the gentry as the Dean.Yet, a man of profound faith, and enormous compassion for the suffering poor, the Dean is himself emotionally crippled by shyness. He is as lonely, and as isolated in his marriage to his unloving wife, as Isaac is in the household he shares with his sister, who is embittered by self-sacrificing spinsterdom and her shame for the Peabodys' descent from the professional ranks of clergy-gentry to working class tradespeople.Many other characters are pulled into the events of a few months; two teenage lovers, a near-decrepit elderly parish priest, a three-year old girl, a brutal fishmonger, and a woman in her eighties who lives amongst her fellow townsfolk as a kind of unrecognised saint.Goudge also does not hesitate (neither does Victor Hugo) to throw in vigorous chapters of cathedral and town history, and many flashbacks and reminiscences of the earlier years of her characters. The book is packed with incident, character, and landscape, despite its immediate action being comparatively slight and covering a short span of present narrative time.Of course, like all of Goudge's books, it is heart-warming. But it pulls no punches.Goudge writes about the hard gritty stuff of real people, complex, flawed and contradictory in a real world of hope, pain, accident, evil and suffering, cherishing the flashes of goodness which can be achieved by human love. The earth closets (one-holers, lavatories) in the slum backyards stink. Young children are forced by brutal masters to climb inside and sweep chimneys. People hate, or love, as their mood leads them, and often do violent things. Senility descends on the extreme elderly. The stormy autumnal tone grows from the book's references to Shakespeare's sonnets and King Lear and A Winter's Tale, to John Donne's sermons and the organ music of Bach, to the callous violence of the Norman Conquests, Henry VIII's brutal dissolution of the monasteries, and Cromwell's puritan destruction of the rich fabric of the ancient church.In such a dark world the creation of mechanically intricate and faithful watches and clocks, decorated lovingly with charming filigree or Dresden figurines or secret illuminated manuscripts, stands as a covert metaphor of the highest to which humans can aspire. At the same time the ticking of a watch and its sheer mechanical longevity stand as implicit reminders of the mortality of its maker, who labours to make the watch despite foreknowledge of his own death. (In our unthinking age of throw-away mass-produced digital watches Goudge's novel offers fundamental, old-fashioned values we do well to remember.)Even the title means different significant things: the actual heirloom watch, which triggers the story; the Dean's \\"ticker\\" or heart, which physically beats uncertainly, yet passionately loves behind the shyness; the Deans' \\"watch\\", as a navy term, in which he faithfully steers the ship of the city and cares for her people.All of Goudge's novels are \\"romances\\" in one important aspect: they hinge on moments of visionary insight for her characters, filled with that romantic longing for a strange beauty and joy which is known in German as \\"Sehnsucht\\". Dreams, glimpses of landscape, moments of weather, the sound of a voice or melody when no one else is present, sudden remembering of lost experience, or a poetry quote which stabs to the heart. These are frequently counterbalanced against moments of evil, terror, despair, emotional collapse, irrational rage or blinding hate. Most of her central characters are well educated and intellectually or emotionally gifted, although many are presented as frail, absent-minded, wounded. Yet not only are they bound up in everyday tasks, they are surrounded by salt-of-the-earth uneducated workers, heroic peasants comparable to the subjects of Hopkins' poems \\"Felix Randall\\", \\"Tom\\" and \\"Harry Ploughman\\", people of utter reliability and ancient Hardyesque virtue. Her characters' ages may vary from eighty to eight, or even younger. For Goudge there is little difference between adult and child except length of experience and acquired knowledge - their interests, emotions and needs are fundamentally the same. In some cases the children show greater maturity than the so called \\"adults\\", and even the animals, dogs particularly, owned by her characters show unspoken wisdom which may ironically exceed that of their masters and mistresses.John Gough -- Deakin University -- jagough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"I love this book. It helps that it's set in Ely, a breathtaking place (though she never actually names it, and changes some details, Goudge did confirm that the unnamed city is Ely). The author clearly loves her characters, even the somewhat difficult to love ones. The setting is beautifully described. And when she wants to insert historical details, she just puts them in using her authorial voice, rather than trying to force them into a character's voice.There's a nice balance of sad and joyous, serious and amusing. The sadness is what might be called \\"beautiful sad\\", as opposed to \\"ugly sad\\".A delightful book to sink into, like a warm and inviting armchair by the fire."},{"Title":"Dean's Watch","review":"The setting for the story is a cathedral city in the fens.

For example, a lock of Muhammed's hair is kept in Jerusalem but what of other key items from Muslem tradition and Buddha's finger is also kept in India but what other items from Buddhist tradition.Far from the veneration of things, the retention of important relics provides a sense of continuity with the past and this book serves as sort a catalogue to the ultimate Judeao Christian museum."},{"Title":"A Brief Guide to Brief Therapy","review":"This is one of my favourite brief therapy books - comprehensive, covering the range of different ideas.

None of the writers Peyser deals with is particularly optimistic. The possible exception is Howells but there is a dark undertow even to his work which Peyser makes sure we see. So a book about utopia is also a strangely, depressing read. 40 years or so after Brooke Farm, who would have thought things would have gotten so sad? Of course it was the turn the century and the best of the Western thinkers were thinking sad and pessimistic thoughts. And now here we are at the turn of another century and we have this powerful, bleak book. Have we come all that far after this century of bloodthirsty carnage?

Peyser writes of a time in America when the whole idea of &quot;fraydom&quot; (allow me my peculiar spelling of this word) was up for grabs. The difference between the &quot;fray&quot; and &quot;unfray&quot; was growing mighty blurry -- the frontier was closed, and the gold standard was causing no end of confusion.

I don't know if I go along with the MLA types who say he's the next Foucault, but on the other hand it's possible. This book about &quot;the shift by which the nation is replaced with the globe as the fundamental unit of human association&quot; has so many implications relating to so many issues that it's impossible to ignore.

The two books are &quot;Utopia and Cosmopolis&quot; and &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie.&quot; Of the two, I'd say &quot;Utopia and Cosmopolis&quot; is the better book. Not that they deal in the same things exactly but there are definite subtle similarities which the quickwitted reader will be sure to catch. For example, both books deal with what is called a utopia -- a perfect society, or a perfect way of life, and how we (we human beings) go about living a good life, or fail at this noble attempt. Both books are therefore &quot;important reads&quot; and offer &quot;food for thought.&quot; Both books also made me wonder, &quot;What the heck am I doing with my life? How can I be a better human being?&quot; And so on and so forth. &quot;Utopia and Cosmopolis&quot; was not nearly as heartwarming as &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; but I think maybe that's the point. I don't thnk Peyser was going for the same effect as the author of &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; whose name escapes me at the moment. Anyway, if you're going to read only two books this year, I'd read these two.

There is some very funny stuff about the vastly overrated Charlotte Perkins Gilman--Peyser cuts the old trog down to size--but mostly this is very smart and very down-to-earth cultural criticism. We have to be grateful for this book, but I for one cannot help but feel a little sad, too, since it would seem that with its publication P. has shed his youthful guise of hilarity, and that he has now stepped into full manhood, revealing what most of us have always suspected underlay the shimmering surface of his speech: knowledge of what Matt Arnold named &quot;the eternal note of sadness.&quot;"},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"Please say this review is helpful to you. They told me that if I post another unhelpful review they're going to kill my ferret."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"Mr. Peyser's books have given my husband and I many hours of what we call &quot;sunshowers,&quot; a pleasing concoction made of equal parts heart-tugging sentiment and good-hearted mirth. I am pleased to say that his latest work, UTOPIA AND COSMOPOLIS: GLOBALIZATION IN THE ERA OF AMERICAN LITERARY REALISM (New Americanists), does not disappoint in its delivery of this sweet confection. We recommend it to one and all. And if we may make a suggestion, we add that it is particularly affecting if read aloud."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"I have yet to read Mr. Peyser's latest work, but it is at the very top of my summer reading list. When I see the name &quot;Peyser&quot; on the spine, I know the book will be a delight."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"You know, this is not the sort of book I would normally read. But there it was, suddenly, on the coffee table one night. How it got there I have no idea. Just curious, I began to leaf through the pages, and the words began to resonate with me. Unable to sleep, I read it through in one sitting by candlelight. The next morning, I began to look at things around me differently. First, I removed several unessential appliances from the house in an effort to simplify my existence. Then it became time to de-clutter and I threw out several items I realized I had no more use for. Then, and this all seemed so logical in light of the things I'd read, I divorced the wife and sent her on her why. Sure, she cried a bit, but I knew I was doing the right thing. And I've never regretted it. This is, indeed, one of the best books I've read all year."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"At least once in his life, every man is summoned to greatness. It's going to be more than once for Peyser."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"It is an interesting book with a title that I really like. It is erotic without ever being &quot;explicit.&quot; It starts off as being about American literature, ends up as so much more. It is one of two best books I read so far this year. The other book was A. Scott Berg's bio of Charles Lindbergh the famous pilot. Both books gave me goosebumps."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and although I usually don't go in for non-fiction, I'm really glad I made the effort with Peyser's book. It's a hell of a good read and on the basis of it I'd say that Peyser has more on the ball than your average professor-type, more on the ball than a lot of other folks too, if you ask me. I won't give away why this book is quite so special, only to say that it honestly changed my life and I recommend it to virtually anyone with a few hours to spare."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"This winter, I took my family (grandma too!) on a pilgrimage to &quot;Peyser Cottage,&quot; that grass-thatched hut (with all the amenities!) where Mr. Peyser labors over his books, lectures and essays until they meet his notoriously high standards. Although we only got within shouting distance of &quot;That American Man,&quot; my wife was able to observe that he is indeed even more handsome in the flesh than on his dustjacket. And my kids (particularly the youngest) were delighted by the various humorous and &quot;off-the-wall&quot; knick-knacks with which Mr. Peyser decorates the exterior of his little home (the interior is, of course, &quot;off-limits&quot; to we observers). Well, that's all I have to say except that his new book is everyone's favorite around here but I wish there could be an audio-version for some of the oldsters with bad eyesight. Why is it that the books that would most benefit others if they were put on tape are the ones that don't ever get taped at all? Well, 'nuff said. And I hope my anecdote about our pilgrimage brought a smile to some of Mr. Peyser's many fans who no doubt visit this site frequently."},{"Title":"Utopia and Cosmopolis: Globalization in the Era of American Literary Realism (New Americanists)","review":"Peyser's title marks him as a (gratefully belated)ephebe of Raymond Williams but the book soon reveals this as a revisionist strategy designed to mask Peyser's true critical father, none other than Henry James himself. As such, the book is an interesting agonistic struggle and if James is (necessarily) the winner, the willingness to take up the fight in itself marks Peyser as a noteworthy critic with great ambition and great work ahead of him."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY OF MIDDLE EARTH","review":"This book is a good start for those interested in the basics of Tolkien's mythological influences. It is simply written and easy to understand for the average reader. However, for those who are looking for a more in-depth analysis of Tolkien's use of myth and relation to the more obscure texts the Professor worked with, this very well might be a rehashing of already known material. Some attention is, appropriately, given to the universality if certain mythic themes, characters, and occurences."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY OF MIDDLE EARTH","review":"I found this shallow and brief in its analysis and written in an annoyingly choppy style. It didn't appear to have been produced by a serious scholar of folklore/mythology.There have got to be better studies out there."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I love this book, I actually already had this book in paperback, but I simply had to have it electronically so that I could have it with me at all time. Read it and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"As a divorce attorney, I have reviewed numerous books and programs on marriage repair. (I generally encourage clients who I believe can work things out not to divorce.) This book I believe is one of the best, if not the best. It is different from the other programs in that it doesn't dig up a lot of hurt and blame and instead it focuses on the future. It boils the relationship down very simply, which is so important at a time when everything seems so confusing and overwhelming. It really helps the couple get back to basics and helps them understand each other and understand themselves. If you feel loved, the stress and tension lifts, the trust returns, and you can begin to put it all back together again. Other programs and books I believe shake things up too much. They force you to dig up years of pain which leads to blame and more fighting. I think that sometimes they cause more harm than good. Sometimes you just need to get back to basics and get to a place where you can once again feel like your partner loves you. This book in a very easy, simple way, helps you do that. If one or both of you can say you still love the other person (you just can't stand them and can't figure out how to get along!), this book will be a huge help to you. Even if you remember a time when you were once in love, and you would like to get back to that place, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a great book!

Truly a life changing book. Changed my outlook on my relationship and helped us get through the toughest times."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I have only been married for 3 years, no serious problems in the relationship at all. I found this book helpful and will be passing it on to many family members (who also don't seem to have any love/marriage issues). It is just a good read to learn more about yourself and your partner and to help guarntee that you will continue to have a marriage full of Love."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I wish I had read this book early in my marriage. I gave this book to my own children once they ventured into serious relationships. Even after 25 years of marriage this book opened my eyes to the reasons why love is so often misunderstood and difficult to keep alive. Read this book and you will find the reasons why your partner is not accepting or feeling the love you are communicating to them. In addition, you will learn how to explain to them your love language and what they do that speaks love to you."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I have often wondered what it is that punches my wife's buttons but so far that has remained elusive. I thought there was no harm in reading this book to derive some insights that I could potentially harness. I think the philosophy articulated in this book is certainly rational and logical and it struck a chord with me. I only wish that I had read it a number of years ago. Perhaps I would have been a far better husband?The five languages is a simple and easy book to read and one that has armed me with a strategy that I can try to help resolve differences between my partner and I. While it is not a guarantee to keeping any relationship going, it at least provides a tool to help others help themselves. The questionnaire in the back of the book will enable you to determine what your primary and secondary love language is. In addition the book provides a number of FAQ, which help reinforce the books key messages. I would recommend this book to others even if their marriage was not in trouble. In this case I would classify this as a risk mitigation strategy."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The author knows his subject and I would agree that if couples could learn each other's preferences in the way of emotional needs you could only be better together.

I recommend it to any couple before they get married. Even if you are already married, I recommend you read it. It really helps each of you understand how you accept love.

After reading this book, I am confident that my marriage will be stronger than ever."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book was recommended while watching Christian Carter's \\"From Casual to Committed\\".

This is an eye-opener to open communication and creates understanding in all kinds of relationships. The \\"real world\\" examples of how understanding your partner's love language will strengthen your relationship and communication in your other relationships as well are beneficial and insightful. I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for ways to improve their communication with those they love and care about, not only \\"significant others\\", but neighbors, friends, family, and co-workers. Understanding each other COULD prevent years of needless and unintended hurt feelings and emotional and physical separation, if the people you are dealing with are at all reasonable and sane. We all experience love differently and view the method in which we show it differently. We THINK we are doing it right, BUT, if the other person is clueless and totally non-receptive, it's as good as NO EXPRESSION AT ALL."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Length:: 1:19 MinsIt's one thing to review a book.

I enjoyed it so much I just purchased 5 more for family and friends. My boyfriend also volunteered to start reading it. Score! This book is full of \\"common sense\\", but it is organized and detailed so anyone can understand it, follow it, and apply it. After 2 years of dating my boyfriend, the in-love feeling was slipping away and I was starting to feel my \\"love tank\\" not quite as full even though my man is wonderful... telling me how much he loves me and how beautiful I am through out the day, helping out with dishes and laundry, buying me flowers... every woman's dream! This book explained why I wasn't feeling 100% loved, even though my boyfriend was giving 110% effort in showing his love. Its a sigh of relief to have an explanation and an action plan!

Very true all what Dr. Chapman explains, and the experiments he gave out to his patients. I really enjoyed it so much this book!! It was awsome!!! I really loved it!!!!!!!! It is 10 thousand times worth it!!!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I heard this book discussed on the Christian radio station K-Love. They talked about how each person has a love language and that their particular love langugage is often not the same love language their partner communicates with. I found the book in our church library. I recommend it for anyone involved in a loving relationship. It is geared toward adult partner relationships, but also discusses parent-child relationships with both adults and children. I definitely learned from that section.Chapter 3 has the best description of falling in love I have ever read. It follows with a great explanation of the normal cooling off that happens in a relationship after the initial infatuation is over.One partner can be doing everything possible to make his partner happy. But if he is doing the things that would make him happy, and not what makes his partner happy because he doesn't know what her love language is, she feels that he doesn't love her. He feels unappreciated because he has been trying so hard to show his love, but getting no response. She doesn't feel loved because he's not doing the things that really matter to her. It would be a really simple fix if they knew the love langugage of the other.The book is a very easy enjoyable read. It includes quizzes to help you determine your love language and also has exercises you can do after every chapter."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My husband and I read these books while I was deployed. They were amazing and it opened up communication lines for us quite a bit. It seemed like there were so many parts in the book that applied to us and our relationship. This is a MUST read for any relationship!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"A few years back, I attended a men's conference. One of the sessions discussed improving your love life. I was curious and decided to attend. During the session, we took a profile to help us determine our love language. According to the presenter and this book, there are five love languages. Each of us feel love, affirmation and self-worth in different ways. For some, it is through touch. For others, it's words of affirmation. Or acts of service. And so on. The simple 30 question assessment pinpointed my love language. Something I already knew but couldn't put into words. More importantly, it was difficult to explain to my wife.Funny thing was, her love language was completely different than mine. While I tried to love her using my language, she didn't get it. And vice versa. She was loving me the way she needed it, but I wasn't translating. Even with the communication gap, we experienced a good marriage.One morning, I took her to breakfast and had her take the same profile. Immediately, we discovered a key to taking our relationship to the next level. It has been really amazing.I am excited to read this book. I know human languages have different dialects. Same words, different meanings. Similar phrases with various connotations. I am expecting this book to help me understand the dialect of love I speak, but more importantly, my wife's dialect.An ancillary goal is to recognize other people's love language. As a project manager, I can use this knowledge to help me manage and influence my team members.Epilogue: I've finished reading the book. I found the simple 30 question assessment to be accurate, even with additional explanation. In the book, the author gave several additional ideas to pin-point your particular language if you feel two might apply. So, it was a very good read.What I find to be a little more difficult is applying it to business situations. The principles would work, but you would need to apply them differently. For example, let's say one of your co-worker's love language is touch. It is not appropriate to be going around touching people, especially in inappropriate manners. That'll get you fired and possibly sued. Bringing in gifts for the person who feels loved by receiving gifts may get you in trouble as well.But, I can say, now that I am more aware of these 5 love languages, I can begin to empathize with my fellow team members and understand their actions a bit better."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"If you are struggling in a relationship this book is for you.

We re-read it recently with our small group though, having been married almost 4 years, and we both agreed that while it was good to have those foundations early on, a lot of it is much more applicable now. (Mainly because, let's face it, when you're in the honeymoon phase, you can't imagine that you would ever really *fight* over anything haha). Suffice it to say, we have recommended it to all our friends, both the married and the dating, and many of them have gotten a lot out of it as well. While there are other versions out there that may be more relative to certain people (including a version specifically written for singles, though I have not read it), this is an excellent book for anyone who is considering marrying the person they are with or equally excellent for the couple who have been married for decades, who feel that the \\"love is gone\\" and they are just 2 ships passing in the night. Or if you've ever been convinced that your spouse has no understanding of \\"what love is\\". And there's the rub of this whole book. Read it!

The most helpful part of the book is the short quiz that you can take at the end of the book. There is also a test that your spouse (or lover) can take. Then, you can compare scores and realize (or discover) what words/acts of love are important to you (and to her!) I suggest that both of you take the quiz before reading descriptions of the different love languages. Unfortunately, most of us have learned to look for the \\"best answer\\" in a test. Instead, you each have an opportunity to be brutally honest as to how you really behave. Then, you can learn how one or more of the five love languages will enable you to become a better lover."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Normally, these types of books are ignored by me.

Gary Chapman takes a concept as complicated as communication (you wouldn't think it was complicated, but when you're married, or even just in a relationship, everything is more complicated :-) and boils it down to five communication styles. Learn to speak in the language that your partner is most receptive to, and bingo, you're on your way to a happy life. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"As others have said, the message of this book could have been delivered in about two pages max. Granted, the premise is interesting, and I got some insights from examining how the 5 Love Languages play out in my own life. However, I did that BEFORE I read the book, based on a short review of it.The book itself is awful. It is superficial, anecdotal, opinionated, self-promoting drivel. It wasn't even worth the trip to the library, much less buying."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Easy to read.

It is ok but not the life changing book i had heard it to be."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book contains a ton of great information to help keep your marriage on track or for starting a great relationship. There are certainly many different dialects to each of the five languages, and some of them spill into each other (affirmation into quality conversation, for example), but the information is solid.The one thing I would caution is that it assumes you loved this person in the beginning. That may not be true for all marriages. Second is that it doesn't say you are going to feel love at the end of the day. You'll be expressing love to your mate through acts and words, but that is not going to guarantee that your mate will find you attractive or relate to you. Indeed, I think the chapter on physical contact is really straining it because if you are not physically attracted to a mate, you will force yourself to kiss or have sex devoid of the emotional attachment.Certainly every pastor ought to make this required reading for pre-marriage counseling. This book is fairly religion neutral, so you don't need to be concerned about being forced to love someone from a sense of obligation to God. But it does treat love as a verb that demands action."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"When I first attempted to read this book I was \\"put off\\" by Mr. Chapman's language. In the realms of religion, marriage, society, and culture, we are nearly polar opposites. Yet I found his premise, that people in relationships who understand how love manifests itself and can communicate that to their partner, will be better equipped to have a healthy relationship. Unfortunately it wasn't until the end of the book that one of couples Chapman speaks about ended up going their separate ways. The reality is, knowing the 5 love languages doesn't guarantee togetherness. Chapman's 5 keys to how love is communicated is easy to remember and therefore easy to put into action in one's daily life (with a significant other, family member, friend, or coworker). The other concept that is stunningly easy and yet thought provoking is, \\"love is a choice\\", especially once the infatuation is gone. This book is worth reading even if you have to tolerate Chapman's style (Protestant, white, male)."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My husband and I had come to the point in our marriage where we'd grown apart, had no friendship basis and were planning our divorce when we both realized we DO love each other, we just didn't know how to fix what was wrong. Each thought we were right. We were very tit for tat in our marriage. \\"You didn't meet MY needs so I won't meet yours!\\"I went and got me this book and him the men's edition which are almost the same. Neither of us are into counseling or self help books but I was desperate and soooooo many of my friends had recommended this (MALE friends) so I figured it might be worth a shot. I gave him his copy and we started reading, agreeing to meet for 10 minutes each night to talk.Both of us realized we'd been very tit for tat and that was didn't speak each other's love language. For instance, my husband does a lot of cleaning because that's something HE would appreciate. But I don't do that for him - I hug him a lot and he's not like that. I don't care if the laundry is done - I'd rather have a 5 second embrace. So my love language is physical and verbal and his is more action.All this time we realize we've been speaking our OWN language to each other and the other just didn't know what to do with that and got resentful that the other person didn't TRY to learn our language. This book helps you implement things. It's changed us so far. Hasn't been long but we're both happy so I don't see it going backward.ie: I asked him to go on a walk with me because I knew he'd appreciate seeing me make an effort to look good for him and spend time with him. He stopped a phone conversation to walk to the door and give me a kiss goodbye when I left one day.This book is all about doing things out of LOVE, not demand, which is what we were doing.I'm so relieved this exists."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The 5 Love Languages is not only helpful for understanding yours and your partner's love language, but also your children's."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Dr. Gary Chapman provides an insightful explanation of how people express their love and need for love.

It is an Amazon number 1 kindle in three categories, relationships, Marriage, and psychology and has been since it came out. It is only about 200 pages long, and honestly he could have said it all in less than fifty pages (although I enjoyed the extra 150 or so). It is so obvious when you read it, kind of like saying, \\"the sky is blue,\\" when somehow that fact escaped you.So the 10,000 dollar question is: Do you know how your partner most experiences LOVE? Because everyone experiences what they consider to be LOVE in different waysWords of Affirmation: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner TELLS them how much they care for them, appreciate them and such.Acts of Service: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner DOES something for them.Affection: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner TOUCHES them. Such as hugs, kisses, holding hands and sex.Quality Time: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner SPENDS TIME with them, no matter how trifling the activity, this person does not feel loved unless their partner is spending some time with them.Gifts: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner gives them MATERIAL THINGS.I recommend this to anyone who wants to love and be loved."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book has really helped me be more understanding in my relationship.

Some of the paragraphs were not changed, so it doesn't make much sense compared to the previous paragraphs because he changed from a man's point of view to a woman's. Even some of the stories were the same, which if you had not read the first book is fine, but the first book was much better for both genders. Personally I could have done without the religious justification but perhaps others will like that. The ideas are very good by themselves without religion. I would recommend the original book, but this book...not so much."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Fast shipping good deal. Great content.

I love the way the author laid out the different love languages with case studies and everything. I easily identified my own love language, and it was really an eye opening experience. I think that the love languages system is a good way to open up communication with your mate as to what you both need from the relationship. It's straight forward and not too out there so that anyone can relate. I would definitely recommend this book if you want to better understand yourself and your mate better."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend it as required reading for all adults of all ages who have not previously read any of Gary Chapman's books about the 5 love languages. It gives useful information about relating to all people that we care about, whether they be spouse, child, parent, sibling, friend, or in-law."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"\\"The Five Love Languages\\" by Gary Chapman is an excellent starting point for discussion. Readers will respond with, \\"That's me,\\" followed by, \\"Well, not exactly.\\" It is a great book to read quickly, and discuss with a spouse or fiance over coffee. You will know yourself and the one you love more intelligently and more intimately.Fundamentally, there are two key questions, and not necessarily in this order:1) How do I best receive love?2) How does the person I love best receive love?Chapman lays out five major categories and uses anecdotes to explain the finer touches.Like many self-help books, it is long-winded and self-indulgent. This could have been whittled down to an efficient 5,000 words instead of an entire book. Chapman takes a good idea and milks an industry out of it, repackaging and remarketing these same ideas into an entire business.That said, his ideas are solid. In fact, despite the short comings, I still believe it is an important rethinking of love. As we know, love is more than a feeling, but an applied action that thinks about the well-being of the other person. People like myself are lunk-headed and need to see that love is beyond roses and chocolates. Chapman breaks it down. Although he comes at this from a Christian perspective, all readers will appreciate his principles.I fully recommend \\"The Love Languages\\" by Gary Chapman.Anthony Trendlanthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"While much has been written about interpersonal communication, many of the existing writings stereotype females communicating with an emphasis on feelings and relationship and males communicating with an emphasis on status and tasks.Are you feeling \\"under-loved\\" by someone important to you? Is someone important feeling under-loved by you? Perhaps you're communicating through different \\"languages\\".Finally, someone (Gary Chapman) is recognizing that we all want to feel loved and suggesting that each of us might interpret \\"being loved\\" through different forms of communication--the five languages.The Five Languages of Love is an intersting and thought-provoking read...comparably applicable to your significant-other, your family, friends and colleagues."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I had read many of the reviews posted on Amazon regarding this book, so I was quite anxious to peruse it myself. Upon acquiring the book, I was surprised and yes, even a bit disappointed. While the author succinctly narrowed down the \\"love languages\\" to that of only five, his narratives describing each of them are a bit tedious. Not only does Mr. Chapman fail to hold the reader's attention while describing each love language, he has a tendency to be redundant as well. I found the quizzes to be a great deal more salient in helping to identify one's own love language, and of course, that of your partner's love language. In short, this book should have been pared down to approximately three pages. I certainly hope that Mr. Chapman's other books (which I have not read) provide a more interesting read."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book was exactly what my husband and I needed before we tied the knot!

This is really a great read and gift for anyone."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is a sugar pill. Takes a few valid premises and draws fanciful conclusions; takes its metaphors so seriously that you start to wonder if the author believes in the literal existence of a \\"love tank\\" that causes teenagers to misbehave if their parents fail to fill it up. It's absolutely true that people have different ways of communicating love and receiving love. Doing the laundry can be a supremely romantic overture and characterizing particular behaviors/activities as ones love language is a great way for partners to increase the level of satisfaction in their relationship if their \\"languages\\" are adequately compatible to start with. Clearly written for a specific audience (i.e. Christian and heterosexual)--and Lord knows this type of marriage needs plenty of help, what with the institution being under attack and all--but there are much better, comprehensive, science-based approaches to couples therapy and what creates healthy and strong marriage and family relationships out there; one therapist's perceived 'success' rate even over a period of 30 years, especially if his clientele are mostly from the same demographic, is not something I would trust to protect my greatest treasure. That said, the placebo effect can be extremely powerful and if it makes you feel better, who cares if it's a sugar pill?"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Great book. Love is hard work.Great love is comminication and speaking the other persons language and dialect. Why did I spend thirty years with my ex and not know how to relate well? The book gave me insight into the fact that communication and intimacy can be learned."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I am not married, but have been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We already had a great relationship and this book was still valuable. As you are reading, the information seems completely logical and not at all ground breaking... however, it's often the things right under our noses that we don't pay attention to.After reading the book, my boyfriend and I both took the quiz at the back which helps you determine your love language. I learned that the language most valuable to him (physical touch) is the hardest one for me. I wasn't terribly surprised, but had never really thought about it. I absolutely notice a difference when I am stepping out of my comfort zone and paying attention to his language.The principles in this book are fun because the changes in behavior are immediate... and I know how much people love instant gratification!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My friend Laura recommended this book and I am so glad she did. Laura and her husband Rob are NLP Master Practioners. They are life coaches who help people find the root causes of their disease or anxiety. [...]After the death of my husband, I was lost and lonely. I was afraid to love again mainly because I didn't feel loved. In the words of Gary Chapman. \\"I had an empty love tank.\\" With an empty love tank, I couldn't see how others were trying to tell me that they loved me. Gary Chapman's book, allowed me to see how people speak love. Some people show love by doing little things for them. Others by buying gifts; others by words of encouragement and affirmation; others by spending time with them; and still others by touching/hugging etc. This sounds so simple. It is. But not everyone speaks the same language. Learning to speak the language your loved ones speak and knowing what love language you speak is the challenge and the secret to being in love with all those you love. Thank you, Laura for this recommendation. And thank you Gary for writing this book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I purchased this book along with several more marriage, love, respect, and communication books when my husband and I got engaged. I was determined to make sure our marriage got off to a good start with communication being the key (love and respect too, of course). I started reading this book to myself at first but less than half way through it I called my husband (fianc&eacute; at the time) into the room and I stared the book over and read it out loud to him all in one sitting. We both talked about the book along they way. At the end of the book there is a quiz to determine your personal love language(s). I do recommend taking the quiz \\"First\\". We both agree it would've helped us understand or tie things together more during the reading.Before this book, my husband would buy me presents all the time to show me he love me, however, that wasn't what did it for me, him spending quality time with me showed me his love for me. Until we read this book we didn't realize what our own love languages were and that day we were able to identify them, talk about them, and start nurturing them. From that day on, my husband and I started really trying to \\"fill each others love tanks\\".4.5 years later, we are very happy and very much in love. We attribute a lot of the success in our marriage to our wonderful ability to communicate with each other and \\"The Five Love Languages\\" helped us with this.We purchased 12 copies of this book and gave it to all the couples we know in our immediate circle for Christmas.

And that's an important part of the story, because if someone is trying to tell you they love you and it's not being \\"spoken\\" in your \\"love language,\\" then you may miss the point entirely and feel unloved!I highly recommend this book for couples.

Even though I am not married and this book speaks a lot about marriage, it is still very helpful to anyone in any serious relationship. This will be a book that I will recommend to anyone who is looking for a way to improve their relationship. This is a book that I will be coming back to a lot to remind me exactly what it is that I need to do to keep the love alive in my relationship."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is absolutely a must read for anyone who is married.

Very interesting and it changed the way I talked to my spouse. It does work you just have to practice it."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Somebody handed me the &#34;original&#34; book a few years ago while I was still married and it made a lot of sense. Unfortunately the damage was done. Being single again I purchased my own &#34;Men's Edition&#34; as an ebook to understand and correct my behavior before moving forward, and not repeat it. It isn't a dating book, nor will it help you with a new relationship. However if you have an existing relationship, are still communicating, and willing to adapt, I think it can help.Much of what is discussed is simple, sometimes too simple. There is elegance to the simplicity of &#34;5&#34; languages, and sometimes the scenarios are a bit eye-rolling simple, but the stories are told in a non-threatening and straight forward manner. An important point is that you can change you, not the other person. Hopefully there are enough stories that you can see yourself, because you just may be half of the problem. Through your change, maybe it will be reflected back in a positive way. This book helps paint a picture of what that might look like without requiring reading between the lines.This is an edited version of the original. I guess the idea is that guys need a smack on the head or something. It differs little from the original - other than to provide examples focused on and from a guy's point of view. It is a good read and I found it interesting.Whether you are trying to renew an already good relationship, or revive a cooling one, this book is worth a read."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I am planning to get married in October.

It is great information to have, but it doesn't mean it is magically easy to apply to your life- but a great start! I think everyone- married or not- should read this! Why don't they teach THIS stuff in school?!?"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is about more than relationships and marriage, but even if that were it's only application it would be one worth reading.It goes over 5 different Love Languages, or 5 basic needs and how each of us prioritizes which we are most receptive to.If you are interesting in understanding, developing or repairing any relationships with another human being, I would urge you to give this book a read.I am an ecclesiastical leader and as I have counseled with spouses or parents who do not understand why their efforts are unrewarded or why their relationships are strained, I have found myself referring to this very volume.It's short, easy to read and very down to earth. It is one of a handful of books that I read and re-read to glean new insights and to further entrench it's teachings.Give it a shot. It could very well change the course of your marriage - and your life."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The information in this book/ the concept is awesome the only two negative things I have to say are 1) the book could have been summed up in fewer pages ( quite a bit of unnecessary dialogue) and 2) it seems the book was written more for men at some parts the author could have been more general (especially since he already has another book designed specifically for men). but again i reiterate i love the concept of 5 different languages and partners speaking a different one.I think this is a perfect gift for newlyweds."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Im not much for inspirational books but this one is a must read.

Had it been around earlier, it may have saved my first marriage.I am happy to see that the majority of reviews concur with me. I am frankly shocked by those who gave it a 1 star, what were they reading? It is a must read for couples entering a new relationship!I gave a copy to my son and daughter-in-law and insisted they read it before they got married. Nothing guarantees success in a relationship, but better understanding your own needs as well as your partners, sure improves your odds! I am not a book lover! I'm a doer! But this book was a real eye opener as well as an easy weekend read for those of you who are like me!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My husband and I have been married 43 years. The book was too elementary for us. It seems to be targeted to agroup married about 1 to 5 years. My husband and I read the book together. We'd look at one another as to say\\"Duh!\\" Many times we would just jump a chapter or two. The questions near the end of the book were fun. It wasfunny; we discovered we were almost exactly alike in our answers. I guess that was worth it!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Ok, I read this book at the prompting from my girlfriend. I have to say, I'm not a big fan of the self-help genre of books to begin with, but I'm not sure how someone could fill 13 chapters with this \\"concept\\". Frankly, the real genius behind the author's simple-minded book is stretching what should have fit onto 10 pages into 13 chapters. Well, that and convincing the public at large that this is a new and revolutionary idea.Are we all really so dense that we can't figure out that people show/receive love and appreciation in different ways? And would we really have such a hard time putting together our own narrow list of ways to show/receive love?Here are the 5 obscure ways the author has come up with to show/receive love:1 - Words of affirmation - saying nice things to the person we love and avoiding criticism2 - Quality Time - don't think this one needs more clarification3 - Receiving gifts - ditto4 - Acts of service - doing things for the one we love5 - Physical touch - yes, some people like to be touched - who knew???Yup, as you can plainly see, it's a list that wouldn't be too obvious to most of us ;-).From the author's own pompous proclamation, he believes this book is so revolutionary that it's the answer to societies ills as it will strengthen the family unit and hence our national unity.What scares me is that we may have a nation of people so incapable of critical thought, rationality, and skepticism that they actually benefit from this type of drivel. If that's the case, I think our societal ills run far too deep for a book like this to fix.Maybe if we spent more time communicating with each other instead of reading these types of stupid, simple-minded books, we'd get along better."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I will be happy to rate this item once I receive it.

Not happy about that."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I only read this book at the insistance of my best friends. I can't believe I read the same book they did, because I wanted to bleach my brain from the drivel this guy was selling. How it took that many pages to describe the '5 Languages' I'll never know. Of course this guy has to keep selling how excellent he is with stories of couples that gushed on and on about him, and without that, this book would have only been 5 chapters too long instead of 10.If need your partner to make you feel loved/wanted, then tell them how. That's what this book ultimately says. I'm not sure why anyone needs a book to tell them that."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is very poorly written. The author makes the so called 5 love languages as if they are the only ones and as if they do not change over time. These love languages are (words of affirmation, quality time, physical touch, acts of service, and gifts). These things change over time, and people tend to search for what is missing in their lives, not a primary love language BS. We put different values for things according to our needs at the moment.He gives poor examples to make his points. One example in particular, a husband comes to him for a session and he tells him how stupid he was to lose his wife. His wife kept on complaining about her job over and over again, so the husband (like any good husband would do), kept on telling her his best advice to deal with the matters at hand. According to Chapman, she was not looking for advice, she was looking for a quality time!!! Well sorry if someone is stupid to keep on complaining about one issue over and over and wants to take no actions, then he/she should accept status quo. Who wants to listen to a chronic complainer!! And besides; how does that make it a quality time for the husband hearing her complain all the time??Also, he puts emphasis on jesus and religion. Well not everybody is religious, and the ones that are religious I am sure can go to their local church or find religious books if that is what they are looking for.The book is full of I. It is such a self promoting book beyond imagination. I did this, and I did that. And the message he want to tell everybody: I am big, I know what I am doing. Go to my seminars, listen to my CDs and buy more of my books.I wish there was a better scoring system, I would not have given it a zero, I would score it minus 5 stars.Bottom line, don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Me and my fiance sat down and read this book just for the heck of it. After about 30 minutes of reading we were both bored of it. For me I was turned off even by the first chapter.\\"Books abound on the subject. Television and radio talk shows deal with it. The internet is full of advice. So are our parents and friends. Keeping love alive in our marriages is serious business. With all the help available from media experts, why is it that so few couples seem to have found the secret to keeping love alive after the wedding?\\"Chapman basically goes on to say that his book has the answer, the \\"truth we're missing.\\" Great. Just what we've all been waiting for...And then it doesn't get interesting.If I had skipped the first chapter maybe I would have gotten through the book and thought \\"oh that was nice I guess.\\" but that would be the best I could say about it."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is a trite oversimplification of communication theory .

But I was very unhappy with the three weeks to get here, when amazon promised it to arrive within a week (5 business days) of ordering it! The five love languages book is really a good inspiration to a couples life together and journey through understanding each other. If we men are needing a better understanding or maybe just some clarification then this is a good book to help our love lives with more than just our wife or girlfriend. It can also be our kids parents and friends too! Its a good book so far, I have only just read 1/4 of it but worth getting!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Someone told me about this book and I thought it would be interesting. Unfortunately while it has a 2009 publication date, the information provided has a 1980s timeline. While the concept is good, the dating of the information and analysis makes it rather worthless. A quick read as it is very repetitive."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Looking forward to reading the rest of this book. Great points in this book and everyone should read it. Great price."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Takes a book like this to point out what we have stop doing in our marriage. We are better now than we've been in years..."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Overall, I think this was a very good book and I would recommend it. As other reviewers have said, a lot of the information is common sense, but sometimes packaging things in a different way brings a different perspective to them. That is what this book does. However, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it is much longer than it should have been - it could have been about half the length and still got the point across. I also think that the marketing is a little thick and seems overdone, particularly with alternate editions that are basically identical.I also agree that some of the contents are quite obvious once they are pointed out to you. As silly as it sounds, it is kind of like a magic trick. You see the magic trick and have no idea how it is done. Once you get to see the steps to perform it, it is painfully obvious. You don't quite understand how you couldn't see it before. With the ideas presented in this book, they are a little obvious too. Of course my wife likes quality time. Of course she likes being affirmed. Of course she likes gifts. But, why do we consistently struggle? Why, no matter how hard I try, does she still complain that she is lonely or doesn't feel loved? Why can't I figure out how to fix that?Well, if you listen to Chapman, it is because I am not focusing on the right thing. I may be focusing on physical touch and not giving enough affirmation. Or, maybe I tell her all the time how pretty she is or how I appreciate this or that, but she really wants me to spend more time sitting down and talking with her.The point of this book is not to explain complex psychological principles. It is not to give deep insight into human behavior or scriptural concepts. It is to make us stop and think about a relatively obvious concept that most of us miss or do not give enough attention to. What would it do for your relationships if the people you care about focus on communicating with you in ways that make you feel loved? What if you were able to do that with them?"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is an excellent, short, readable book that is beneficial to any couple no matter the current status of the relationship."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I think this book is beneficial to everyone.

Dr. Chapman's idea of the five love languages is so simple, you'll wonder why you never saw it before. It explains so much. One note of caution: I made the follow-up purchase of the book for men, but it is really the exact same book. The differences are not worth the additional purchase. So, get this one or get the one for men (if that's what will make you more comfortable), but get one of them. Great ideas well presented."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Hmmm! And I thought we were a mismatch.

It also made me think of my parents, I am planning on buying the book for them go put a spark in their marriage."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for quite some time, as I'm one of those people whose love language isn't obvious. The chapters on the five languages themselves were very satisfying and helpful (except for physical touch, which mentioned the obvious point that it isn't all sexual yet failed to really expand on that) and I walked away feeling much more certain. Some of the chapters afterward were helpful, but I didn't feel compelled to read them as in-depth. His approach isn't the end-all-be-all to a happy relationship, but I believe it's a huge part of it.Though Chapman writes the book from a Christian point of view and religion does play an appropriately heavy role, I would step out on a limb and recommend this book to non-Christians as well. The basic premise remains the same regardless of your faith or non-faith and it would be a shame to miss out on such an eye-opening concept just because of that."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I was surprised at how much I got out of this book.

Love itself is a universal language invented, established, and demonstrated by Jehovah God himself.

If I wanted to know how to build a motor, I'd ask Henry Ford. It just makes since. God is the answer.Oh and by the way it does not take two years for true love to take form as mentioned in chapter 3.

There is no such thing as a woman who wants to touch a man.There are only two kinds of people in the world: hotheads and easygoers, and they marry each other because no hothead will marry another hothead. They all want a calm, pleasant, easygoing person who doesn't give them any trouble. If you are an easygoing person, you did not pick your mate, your mate picked you, for reasons you were never supposed to know. Check your friends, too. I knew Dr. Chapman many years ago as a sunday school teacher, and trusted him implicitly. I know more now than I knew then, and believe me, Mrs. Chapman is an extremely pleasant and easygoing person. If you are an easygoer, remember, you have a lifetime of experience, too. Learn the difference between hotheads and easygoers, and recognise them as easily as they recognise you. You'll discover that many of the angels in your life are hotheads in disguise.If you're unhappy, the people you love are not who they seem to be. In fact, they are not like you at all, and they know it."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is excellent, and has the ability to save marriageswhen your heart is put into it.

I fear those who left negative reviews have overcomplicated matters. There is no need to over-analyze 5LL.The 5 languages, as repeated throughout the text, are: Quality Time-Receiving Gifts-Words of Affirmation--Acts of Service and Physical Touch. The author believes they are gender-neutral and tend to remain with us for life. Helpful and realistic hints are offered when one is unable to discover either his own or his spouses' language. All advice is in plain vanilla talk.For the record this reviewer discovered, after 22 years of marriage that his languages squared nicely with those of his wife! Who knew? That nugget is certainly worth the modest purchase price.This is a fine, helpful, pleasant easy to read handbook. How anyone cannot benefit at least in a small fashion from reading 5LL is beyond this reviewer."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for. It's amazing how after years and years of marriage, this book could still shed some insight into how to make it even better. Easy read; in fact read the whole thing as soon as I picked it up. This book would be good for struggling relationships (even with friends and children) and just to improve an already great relationship. I have recommended it many friends already."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"When going through some terribly rough times in my marriage last year, a good friend recommended this book.Communication breakdown is usually at the core of many relationship woes and I figured mine weren't any different.I found this book to be wonderfully comforting to read and offered me a great deal of personal insight into what the disconnect between me and my partner might have been.I found myself routinely suggesting the book to others, but kept hearing in return 'how religious' it was...I didn't see that.Sure there are some God references, particularly toward the end (though I only remember them vaguely), but I didn't feel like I was sitting in church.I don't think the messages of this book are limited or relegated to 'believers'. Humans are humans and whether one believes in God or not, there are bigger forces and trends at play in this world than what we think are unique to us.If nothing else, it's a comfort to read scenarios that ring familiar when one is in a time of confusion and pain.I highly recommend this book even if you want to learn how to talk to friends and family better."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I bought this book for a friend, but they had nothing but good things to say about what they had already read.

Fast shipping and reasonably priced."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is the most amazing book, what insight Dr. Chapman has to the depth of the soul. I have read this book and my husband is almost finished. And I can say with 110% certainly that this book has changed our lives forever. I have always felt guilty because I wanted to receive gifts (read book for definition) from my husband and craved more physical contact from him than he already gave (again see book for definition). Little did I know that physical contact was my love language with my dialect split between gifts and words of affirmation. I feel as though for the first time in my LIFE that my feeling are validated and NOT SELFISH. My husband now understands that when he doesn't speak my \\"language\\" and my love tank is empty, how it affects me and us. I recommend that EVERY ONE (well adults) read this book, single or attached it will open your eyes not only to your language but to languages of others. I wish we would have read this book years ago, how much happier and easier my life and relationships would have been!!! A must read, I give it 10 stars!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I chose to read this book because my husband and I were not connecting like we were when we first met.

Also, I told my husband about the book, giving him the chance to read it and he LOVES it! He likes that it's easy to understand and it gives the perceptive of other couples that the writer has talked to.My husband and I were having some problems. I wasn't feeling quite right about the relationship and I didn't realize what the problem was. Once I read this book, I could point out to my husband what my \\"love language\\" AND dialect was.

Why not invest a few bucks into a happier marrage??"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"After hearing rave personal reviews about this book, my fiancee and I decided to read this in efforts to better prepare ourselves for marriage. After reading this book, I admit that this book is based on a good premise (people respond to different kinds of expressions of love in different ways) but that is about where things stopped.For one, the author seems to \\"toot his own horn\\" from the very start, with the audacious claim that there are exactly five love languages (with different dialects, he admits) and that he has discovered them. I, not turned off by the hubris of the author, felt nothing short of the full honor and privilege that this modern day Prometheus was going to bring down the fire of marriage happiness to me in book form.Reading on through the book however, I found the same (anecdotal) information being presented to me over and over again. I noticed that throughout the book, there seemed to be no footnotes or references to actual research of human behavior and/or other counselors, but then again this is probably because our author made this pivotal discovery all by himself.Being a Christian, I did appreciate the references to the Bible. What I did not appreciate, however, are how some of his use of scripture seems to be used, like in the last chapter, where we learn that Jesus told us (in his sermon on the mount) that he wants women to reform their verbally abusive husbands using sex as a tool. (I guess I was sick that day of Sunday school).I would recommend that anyone who wants the author's best treatment of the subject to read the The Five Love Languages for Singles [5 LOVE LANGUAGES FOR SINGLES]."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Knowing we were going to be spending a lot of time in the car on our vacation, I purchased Gary Chapman's classic work on marriage, The Five Love Languages, in audio book format, before we left. It was the first time I've purchased an audio book and, to be honest, I was not too sure what to expect. Though I've heard from several friends that audio books are a great substitute for the written word - I had my doubts. Among them were thoughts that listening to an author read a book would be boring. I also feared the format would make it difficult to follow the author's line of thought and reasoning.Fortunately, these fears proved to be unfounded. Listening to Chapman read the book was easy and the many stories he offers as examples from his years of counseling kept both my wife and I interested and engaged in the material.The premise of Chapman's book is quite simple. Chapman asserts there are five different ways of expressing love, or love languages: 1) words of affirmation; 2) quality time; 3) receiving gifts; 4) acts of service; and 5) physical touch. Chapman devotes a chapter to each of these love languages, offering numerous examples and practical tips on how to properly express these languages of love to your mate. At the end of each chapter on one of the love languages, Chapman offers ten tips for expressing that language to one's husband or wife. This is in keeping with the practical nature of the book; throughout Chapman keeps his audience of married couples living real lives in mind as true stories and practical advice make up the meat of the book.Chapman also believes that each individual person will have these love languages ranked differently in order of importance. In other words, a husband might best feel loved by his wife's acts of service but the wife might feel most loved when her husband spends quality time with her. This can lead to confusion, Chapman says, within the marriage. Because the husband feels most loved when his wife does things for him (e.g. iron his shirts, clean the house, cook dinner, etc.) he naturally believes that she will also feel most loved when he does acts of service for her (e.g. mow the lawn, wash the car, etc.) when, in reality, she would much rather have him spend that time with her. Of course, she feels she can best express her love to him by spending time with him when he would rather have her help him with chores around the house. After a few years of this cycle, both the husband and wife begin to feel unloved and frustrated that their partner does not appreciate the ways they are trying to express their love to each other - all because they didn't understand that their spouse's primary love language is different than their own.Chapman explains that this is why it is so important to understand which of the love languages are most important to you and your spouse. He also states it is important to realize that these love languages are not better or worse than each other; that they are more a matter of personal preference and that different individuals will respond differently to each of them. Because Chapman believes this to be so crucial, he devotes a chapter to helping couples discover their primary love language. As a bonus feature, the audio book Karen and I purchased included a questionnaire designed to help Chapman's readers (listeners?) recognize their own primary love language and that of their spouse.One of the few problems I have with the book is Chapman's attempt to blame the vast majority of marital problems on simple errors in expressing the wrong love language to their marital partner, stating that most men and women have good intentions when it came to their interactions with their spouse. While it is undoubtedly true that many problems are caused by communication breakdowns, and I wholeheartedly believe an attitude of grace and forgiveness should permeate a marriage, it seems Chapman downplays the effect of mankind's sinful nature.Perhaps Chapman just wants to emphasize that every benefit of the doubt should be extended to our spouses (something I wholeheartedly agree with!) but listening to The Five Love Languages it was easy to get the impression that every marital spat, fight, argument and discord could be attributed to a simple misunderstanding; that a \\"good\\" and \\"well-meaning\\" husband or wife would never intentionally hurt the feelings or demean their significant other. This is simply not true and ignores the fundamental problem in any marriage - that it consists of two imperfect sinners!My wife and I enjoyed listening to the book on our travels. The format and setting gave us the unique opportunity to discuss each chapter immediately after we were done listening to it. Chapman used humorous stories effectively, keeping us interested throughout."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This has got to be one of the best Relationship books that I have ever read.I'm engaged to a Wonderful man. He treats me like a Princess and I do my best to treat him like a Prince but sometimes my temper can get the better of me.Lately I noticed that when I get upset I don't like myself and how I treat my Fiance.I knew I needed to do something about this so when I found this book \\"THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES HOW TO EXPRESS HEARTFELT COMMITMENT TO YOUR MATE\\" I knew my search was over.This book was what I needed!!! It explains the Five Love Languages and why a person behaves a certain way when they don't receive their love language.The FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES:1) WORDS OF AFFIRMATIONS2) QUALITY TIME3) RECEIVING GIFTS4) ACTS OF SERVICE5) PHYSICAL TOUCHI noticed that my number one Love Language is ACTS OF SERVICE & my number two is QUALITY TIME.When I receive those two from my Fiance, my love tank is FULL. My heart is happy and I'm filled with so much love for him!!! Don't get me wrong I love him, but when my tank is full I LOVE HIM EVEN MORE!!!!!!If my love tank is empty, I'm not happy, but unlike before....I now know what I need to do to fill it.Had I not found this book, I probably would not have figured out what it took to make me happy.I would definitley recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their relationship or have a better relationship with their partner.It will improve it dramatically!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"It's a quick read with concepts that are easy to grasp. Most of the book is common sense, but sometimes the right words to describe something elude us and I think he does a great job of providing those easily communicated words. I do, however, find the book a bit redundant and some of the examples are just a little too pat...they end too neatly with everyone riding off into the sunset with happy marriages after a few words...and I'm sure that's hardly the case. Overall, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I previously purchased The 5 Love Languages and thought it was very good. Wanting to learn more, I read about the Men's Edition, expecting it to be different based on what the summary said. But the content is 99% the same as the original, not just the themes of the book but the actual words. I, and probably many others, was totally mislead by the write-up about it and wasted my money. Very disappointing. If you already purchased any of the similar books, do not waste your money on any of the others as they are all the same, as I found out the hard way."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I bought this book with very high hopes after reading all the reviews from others. My boyfriend and I decided to read the book together and hoped to learn something useful. Unfortunately, we were both disappointed beyond belief.Chapman's book tells us that there are 5 main ways that we can show love and affection for our partners. They are:1. Words of affirmation2. Quality Time3. Receiving gifts4. Acts of service5. Physical touchHe goes on to explain each one of these in detail and suggests that an individual is most influenced by his/her primary love language (according to Chapman, you are most influenced by only one language and this does not change throughout your lifetime regardless of changes in life situations or any other factors). In case you have some difficulty deciding your primary love language, Chapman gives some advice. For example, he wrote about a woman that was always getting put down by her husband. He was always complaining how she could not do anything right and told her she was stupid. Through a session with Chapman, the woman explained how upset this made her. He came to the conclusion that \\"Words of affirmation\\" is her primary love language! Are you kidding me? Would anybody in their right mind be OK with constant put downs from their partner? I don't think so. This has nothing to do with deciding which is your primary love language. This is a matter of respect from one's partner.He also uses a situation where after careful consideration, he decided a woman's primary love language was Physical Touch after she complained about getting beaten up by her husband! Really Chapman?The rest of the book is filled with embellished and fabricated examples in which Chapman is always the hero. He seems to be able to solve anybody's and everybody's problems. On top of this, he ensures the reader is well-aware of his books, CDs, and seminars. This type of self promoting should be banned from self-help books.This is a topic that could have been adequately explained in 2 pages of a magazine article rather than in 13 drawn out chapters. The book is very repetitive. Chapman seems to have made a fortune off this ONE theory of his five languages (which is not backed up by any psychological or scientific studies). But don't worry. If you buy one book and learn the 5 languages, you can apply these SAME languages to ANY other life situation. Please see below for some of Chapman's other books.The 5 Love LanguagesThe 5 Languages of Appreciation in the WorkplaceThe 5 Languages: Men's EditionThe 5 Languages: Gift EditionThe 5 Languages of ChildrenThe 5 Languages of Apology (both in paperback and hardcover)The 5 Languages, Singles EditionThe 5 Languages of TeenagersThe Heart of the Five Love LanguagesGod Speaks your love LanguageThis book was terrible and a waste of time to read. Don't waste your money buying this book, you can have mine."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I purchased this for our Christian book club summer reading. It was enjoyable. If we first notice communication problems with our spouses, probably this is an excellent book to read. But if a couple who already is going through heavy and serious problems such as domestic violence, addiction, or infidelity, nothing in this book would apply. I would recommend this book to a younger couple who has just got married."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I suppose it isn't in the realm of rocket science to understand that people show and give tokens of love to other people via a diverse set of methods. Of course, many of the simple aspects of how to behave well in a relationship aren't rocket science, which is why we need books like \\"the Five Love Languages\\" to be written. We need them to be written because we couldn't figure out the simplicity of our relationship's health or brokenness without a guide. Dr. Chapman's book is such a guide.The Five Love Languages isn't going to bowl anyone over with deep descriptive analysis of the human psyche. It isn't even going to seem to the average reader to be a very artfully crafted book. But that isn't to say that the simple message of the book \\"mind how you show and receive tokens of love\\", isn't important. It is, almost biologically so.In order to eat, you do not need to know the specifics of calories and nutritional value. Those things are helpful, but most people can get by with simple rules like \\"one protein, one starch, one vegetable,\\" or the food pyramid. Dr. Chapman's book is the simple approach to a subject that can get complex in a hurry - how we love one another.I would recommend this quick read to any new or old couple to get a better grasp on how they might make each other more happy, and by doing so, live out the true beauty of having a relationship - making your \\"love languages\\" talk to each other."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I purchased multiple books for our Deacon who is going through the five love languages every week for a group of about 20 couples as a way to renew marriages in our parish. The bulk of the group are retirees who are excited about this class and they have found love again in their marriages some after 40+ years. It is never too late."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a worthwhile read. Recommended to me by a female friend who said she has read this book with her husband prior to her marriage (and presumably helped), I who is never the one to skimp on a good non-fiction read, decided to purchase this very affordable and short book.The book focuses on marriages, but the concepts covered can be applicable to all relationships.The author cogently argues that much of marriage problem is differing styles of communication that doesn't meet the needs of the other.The author provides 5 different ways to communicate to each other and how each one is important and fulfills the psychological needs of each individual.Beautiful and well done.But how about when the communication problem is not the cause but a symptom of a more deeper underlying problem? It seems author doesn't necessary believe in such scenario. In essence, the book assumes most marriage problems are communications problems. Perhaps.The author details a story of how a wife with a husband who never accedes to her repeated request to paint the walls in the bedroom despite he having ample time to do it. She constantly makes the request (read: nags him to death) and he never does it. The author sees the problem as a communication issue and provides a recommendation. He says his recommendation has had tremendous results on that marriage (and I believe him), but I wonder if he has only fixed the symptom and not the cause (the husband doesn't care about her anymore or painting the walls in the bedroom?)."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I have really enjoy this book! The way it is presented is very eye opening, not only for my husband and I but we can see what different love languages our children have!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I find myself wishing I would have bought this book a long time ago. It would have saved me the pain and agony of a divorce. I highly recommend it. It's an easy read, and just a marvelous book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"LOVE this book. I highly recommend it - whether or not you're in a relationship. EVERYONE can find something useful/helpful with this book. I've purchased it as gifts for couples and friends and they all love. Excellent book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I purchased this latest edition of \\"The 5 Love Languages\\" to support some discussions with my spouse. The thing I like about this edition of the book is it includes a test to help you determine which love languages are your strongest. The previous editions I have read did not include this. We found the results a bit different than we had expected, but more accurate than our own guesses. Each love language chapter includes practical steps to help you learn to speak your spouses love language which I found very helpful."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Understanding the concepts in this book will help in any relationship, marriage, family, or friendship. It was written in an easy to understand and entertaining manner too! I read through it very quickly, it was hard to put down, and I usually don't care for self-help or improvement type books. I recommend everyone who is married or in a relationship read this."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"If you don't have this book, then you need to get it right now!

But I will say this: This ought to be required reading for everyone in the world. I honestly think there'd be fewer arguments and the world would be a happier place. This book doesn't just apply to couples -- this would be great for anyone with close friends or relatives, children, basically anyone to whom you show love. The scenarios in this book are truly universal and surprisingly hit home. I honestly believe that everyone who reads this book will come away with at least a little something learned -- for the better. Also, I read this on my Kindle, and the text, layout, etc. are wonderfully clear and well formatted."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I highly recommend this book to anybody out there who is either single or already in relationship.

Five stars for amazon for making this well written book available."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I recommend this book to everyone.

I look forward to applying its practical suggestions."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book has gotten some scathing reviews as being something that could be summarized in a brief article. While that may be true to some degree, it is still a book that holds important reminders to things that of course seem obvious but are so often and easily forgotten and overlooked. People sometimes need reminding about the simplest concepts when it comes to looking at another person with perspective on how they feel and how they interpret our actions. I also thought hearing about the individual situations was touching and inspiring."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I know several people reading this book and it's great for anyone whether in a relationship or not it's great for practicing and perceiving"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"It's interesting to read these truths, and wonderful that my family has been doing this all their lives and taught me how to love. I loved to learn the truth behind why and how we love as we all can forget ,or get lost on how to love and appreciate those who mean the most to us."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I believe every big concept regardless of difficulty can be made easy to understand by making it simplier. Find the truth of the matter and drive it home. Books that inspire by long winded chapters that at the time seem very inspirational are often forgotten because it is to hard to hold onto the concept that is so thought provoking. The 5 love languages gives you something that covers the whole truth of how people want to be loved, but it is also something that I don't think you will ever forget because it's made so simple. It is easy to remember, understand and not hard to practice improving in one of the 5. It's also not hard to figure out which one of the love languages your signifigant other is. I think this would have really helped my second marriage. I was always a good husband in the since that I always treated my wife with kind words. But I think she needed another love language. Now I have a great insight to my 3rd! What a lucky lady she will be! lol."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"One thing human-kind has a challenge in is understanding each other.

After reading the first three chapters I bought another copy to give to my wife to read. We both enjoyed it.We started counseling a couple of weeks ago and when I told the counselor we've read the 5 Love Languages, she was excited for us. She institutes a little bit of the book into our counseling sessions and used it as a baseline for our first session.The book showed me ways to communicate/love in a language my wife understands. It's teaching her that it's not helpful to us for her to keep bringing up past events and harping on the negative if we're to make our relationship work. The best part is the books gives real situational examples and teaches you how to judge your spouse without being judgmental."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is an easy to read book that all couples must have.

I guess I purchased the wrong book. I am sure that this book is pretty much the same as the one at work except for the test. I haven't read it but hope to soon. My husband liked it.

Worth the money!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is a great tool for understanding relationships. I've read several other books such as the Men are from Mars, Woman are from Venus books, and this book takes a different approach to understanding love and how we express love to our partners.This book put into words what we see happening in our relationships but weren't able to decode the meanings behind it. I've learned a lot about myself from reading this book. For example, knowing what my languages are for love, helps me to explain to my significant other why I do things for her (service). And how my service to her is the way I say I love you, without saying the actual words. I think service is one of the main languages the male population expresses love. But at the same time, the book help me to understand that I too need to understand my s.o.'s language so that she knows that I know how to say I love you in her language too.It's a great read and I think I'm a little better at love than I was before this book. So kudos on a great read on love."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Very good read. Read it to my significant other and we both found it fascinating.

Great buy, great book!!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I am a MFT and one of the couples I saw mentioned this book. The idea - that how we express, and experience, love - is very personal and not the same for all of us, is an important idea for everyone to understand. Not particularly well written, and since the ideas were not new to me Its not a favorite. But I know that for my client couple that first discovered these ideas it was an important book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"It's obvious now but not before you read it. I'm a guy and I've been married and divorced, and had a couple of other meaningful relationships. He writes kind of cheesy but I'd say this is a must read, plus it's short for all you men out there. Either way, it's jhalf the price of a dinner and it's a much greater investment."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I read this book on advice from a friend and I was very enlightened by all the incite this book provided me into how everyone feels love and shares it.

And I continue to recommend it to anyone who cares to want to know."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I read this book alone. When I started to speak my husband's love language, he automatically started to speak mine without even knowing it. I never informed him of my little experiment but he noticed a change. A week in he asked me if something has changed and said that he's just felt so great lately \\"for some reason\\" ;) I love this book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is perfect for new couples as well as long time married couples.

Highly suggest you read."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Absolutely LOVE this book! It was such a revelation for me and my husband. We both read the book and found out that we do have very different love languages. This is why that we were starting to struggle as a couple, because he was showing me love in a way that made him felt loved -but not me. I was also doing the same thing. So we were both wrong. This showed us that we needed to express what made us feel loved and that way we could change our focus. He now knows how to show me love, and I know how to show him love. It has been a HUGE help.

Good price for this very popular book. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughter."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book was suggested to us when we were attending mandatory pre-martial counselling, and it is worth the read. Knowing and understanding your own love language, and the language of those around you (not just your spouse, but your parents and kids) can really make a difference in your relationships. For example, my mom-in-law definitely speaks the language of gifts, while my parents, myself, and my husband, don't. So while it's not normal for me to send flowers to my own mother on mother's day (a phone call is all that is desired), I make sure that my MIL is recognized with a gift for all her occasions. Knowing these things really does make your relationships with all the people around you better."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"As soon as I picked up this book the &#34;Duh!&#34; light went on. As you read it (and it is such an easy read) you think- wow, this is so clear and so simple, and so true. Why didn't I know this before?! It's great, because you can digest the information quickly and implementing the tools it teaches you is simple. You feel like you can begin making positive changes in your relationship immediately, because, the only person we can change is ourselves- but by changing ourselves, we can make huge changes in how our partners relate to us. This book really spoke to me, I love it, and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. As I finished reading it, I had the urge to buy and send one to every couple I know :-) It should come with your marriage certificate!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Read this book a long time ago and it was great to read through again.

It works well for a romantic relationship but I really think it could apply to all kinds of relationships, sisters, girlfriends, etc. It offers sound and practical advice. It offers tips on things you can do right away, I already tried the requesting-instead-of-demanding tip right after I read it and guess what, it worked! Its crazy how we overlook some things or think of them as trivial but if you implement Dr Chapman's advice, you get instant results, if not long lasting. This book is a must have for everyone.

Not only do the concepts \\"focus on that kind of love that is essential to our emotional health\\",it may radically affect behavior and radically alter the emotional climate of marriages. These five along with their dialects can meet the needs of intimacy and love.A unique & interesting metaphor used in the book measures these concepts. \\"People do behave differently when their love tanks are full\\". This is a reality when choosing long-lasting love; which is not like \\"in love\\" illusion in the least!Conflict resolution is an added bonus.

The book is very helpful in recognizing what is important to each spouse and how to give each spouse what they need to feel loved. There is a quiz at the end that prioritizes the five love languages for each spouse. It is helpful to recognize which expressions of love will be most valuable to each spouse. One may prefer actual gifts, expressions of affection, or a simple act like making up the bed. It is really simple, but an eye opener to understand which forms of affection are most valued. My husband and I get along in general, and when we took the quiz we realized we are aligned on most of the 5 languages. Probably the \\"secret\\" to our success. I think it would be even more valuable for those struggling with love, because the book also contains exercises to try for a week, and then re-evaluate your relationship.

Anybody in any kind of relationship will find Chapman's insights revolutionary. It will help you better understand yourself and your partner and the ways you express affection. It's written in an accessible, engaging manner. There is one part about a very abusive husband that I found questionable, but it can be overlooked for the most part. For further research, I highly recommend that you take the online \\"Love Language\\" quiz at the author's website. As an aside, the Kindle edition is formatted very nicely."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Often, when I buy a self help book, I end up starting and never really finishing it or getting in to it. This book, however, has been quite different. It flows and is a very easy read without a lot of difficult jargon and has really opened my eyes. Yes, once you read this book it will seem like pure common sense, but it has diffused my anger at others (such as in-laws) and other people close to me. For example, it drives me nuts that certain individuals are CONSTANTLY showering my children with gifts but now I understand WHY. For me, it doesn't not speak love while for others, it is their way of showing their love. It is also helped me to understand myself in ways I SHOULD have already known; I understand, now, why I have felt so lonely at times in my marriage. If you are having a disconnect with a loved one, someone who you know loves you but you always wonder why they don't \\"show\\" it...this is the book for you. In addition, I thought that I would skip the repeat books, such as the one for understanding your children, because I thought they would probably be redundant. However, I now think I will be buying that particular book as I can already see how one of my children is more of a physical touch type person and would love to explore these ideas further for showing my children love in their own languages."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I love \\"The Five Love Languages\\" and have probably re-read this book about every six months or so. I first became acquainted with the Five Love Languages by my sister, Amanda. Amanda and her husband had enjoyed the original \\"The Five Love Languages\\" which is orientated towards couples and learned that Gary Chapman had another version geared more towards single people. Its probably one of my favorite and most used gifts I've ever received.I was excited about how insightful it was and think it definitely helped me improve and/or develop my relationship with my family members, friends, and, later on, my husband.At my husband's and mine Engagement Encounter, I was excited when they touched on the five love languages because I was already very aware of the concept (having re-read the singles version three times at that point). Engagement Encounter lead to me purchasing the \\"couples version\\". I'm now finishing that one for the second time. (My husband hasn't read it yet but between the activities they had us do at Engagement Encounter and how I have a tendency to not shut up about things I get excited about it, he probably knows as much as if he had.....)The basic concept of the book is that different things will make different people feel loved. What makes Person A feel loved may not be the same thing that makes Person B feel loved. There are five different main things that make a person feel loved (their Love Language): Words of Affirmation (me!!), Touch, Quality Time, Tasks (doing things for that person), and Gift Giving. (Ha!! I've re-read the book so many times, I didn't even need to look to list those!!) Every person has a primary \\"love language\\" they speak and usually to a lesser degree one or two secondary languages.Most people will gravitate towards people that speak their primary love language because receiving that \\"love\\" will fill their love tank; however, if a person is not receiving their primary love language it will cause their love tank to feel empty or unloved.The trick is then learning what your partner, friend, co-worker, etc. speaks in order to communicate with them better.Here's a website if you want to find out YOUR love language. There is also an \\"Apology Language\\" quiz and a \\"Love Language for Kids\\" quiz that I found really interesting. [...]I was amazed at how this basic concept can be applied to dealing with all types of people and situations. Which is probably why I'll re-read the book again in about another 6 to 8 months."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a great book. I learned a lot of myself and my spouse. There's an underlying religious tone to the book, but the author doesn't throw God or the Bible in your face so if you aren't very religious, you could still learn a lot from this book.

I would also recommend this vendor. My order showed up on time and in excellent condition."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This would have been an excellent 115 page book, but unfortunately it was puffed up to 205 pages. Gary Chapman kept going over the same points 3 times when we got it the first time.The basic premise of the book is that what shows love to you (your love language), and which you use to express your love, may not be something that makes your spouse feel loved (is not your spouse's love language). The books objective is to explain the 5 love languages (Quality time together, touching, acts of service, gifts, words of affirmation) and to give you guidelines to help you determine what is your love language, such that you can tell your spouse what would make you feel loved; and to determine your spouse's love language so you can be loving to your spouse in a way that will be meaningful to him/her.This makes a lot of sense in theory, but in practical application, those of us that tried it felt that while better than nothing, in real life, it isn't that simple. Most of us have more than one love language, and our love language can change based on something so trivial as how our day is going. Also we found there were other love languages such as sharing secrets.If the lessons of the book are applied, while not a total cure, you most probably will improve your relationship."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book opened a whole new chapter for me and my husband.

Have we stopped arguing all together in 30 days? No...but we are communicating that we love each other better and we do argue alot less.This book is not only for the married couples.

Honestly......I have always known what is important for me in a relationship......well, there was one surprise.......however meerly knowing it and asking for it is not enough. On this CD, Gary Chapman gives tools to implement happiness and fulfulling love in relationship........I have no doubt it works..........I am pondering his CD for children now......for my grand kids......so that they may feel loved from the start and not go looking for it in another as adults...... One last word.....it was well after I listened to the CD that I noticed the downloadable 'test' (in PDF form) so you can verify what your Love Language(s) are........that was the happiest of all surprises!

Love isn't just about feelings and emotions, its about making choices and doing things for the other person, and this book really drives that home. Written from a purely psychological perspective, so for those of you who are \\"afraid\\" of Christianity or get angry about theology, this is the book for you! Personally, I would have liked to see the author tie faith into the mix some, but I understand his reason for not doing so.

I thought for the longest time something was wrong with me. My husband is words of acclamation. I always complimented him and said positive things about him, and he would do the same for me but for some reason I never remembered what he had said! It just wasn't as important to me as quality time was. We still struggle with the quality time as my love language because he's deployed on a boat and is so busy. He doesn't have time or the capability really to adhere to my specific love language. I know when he's home we'll go back to working on things, but after we read these books he made an effort and I was soooo happy and all \\"puffed up\\" from all this attention, which in turn made me a much happier person to be around.

It seems like a simple idea yet so many of us don't know how to do it. I think all couples should try and incorporate these ideals into their relationships. It would certainly make for much happier relationships. It shouldn't be a secret."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"A friend recommended this book in order to study relationships and why it seems some of us understand each other easily than others.

I don't think I EVER finished a self-help book until this book. It's easy to read, full of examples, and really changes perspectives on relationships. It opened my eyes to a new way to looking at relationships and how they succeed and fail. It has really helped me reflect on how and why my own relationships didn't work, and I strongly believe it will benefit my future relationships. My mom and my sister read it too and we all give it 5 stars and rave about it to our friends."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is an easy to read book about a positive approach to viewing and working on relationships - marital and otherwise. I'm now interested in reading the version for children."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book was recommended to me, and both my husband and I have read it.

I since bought several copies to give to family and friends."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"If you ask me, \\"Is this book cliched?\\" I would say, YES. It is, it has really corny things in it. However, that does not change the fact that there are some really important things in this book. My fiance and I read this before we were married. It helped us understand what makes us happy, and what the other one can do to make sure our emotional needs are met. I am really happy I read this book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The Five Love Languages is a quick, easy read filled with valuable information for anyone in a relationship. I enjoyed reading about each of the five love languages and the stories Chapman tells about working with clients who fit into each categories.For me it became more and more clear in Chapter 9, Discovering Your Primary Love Language, what my personal love language is, but the 30 question profile at the end verified it for me (and surprised me a little, too).While I was reading it, I enjoyed talking with my husband about what I was reading and when I finished I suggested that he read key parts of the book. I was surprised that he read it right away. I look forward to practicing speaking each others' love languages and working toward a stronger, more loving relationship together.I recommend this book for anyone in a relationship, particularly married/committed couples. Even if your relationship is solid, learning to speak your partner's love language will help you ensure it stays that way. As a mother of 3, I can't wait to read The Five Love Languages of Children next!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My wife and I ordered this book at the recommendation of our counselor.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the different types of affirmation that people look for and I feel that this book does a fantastic job of opening peoples eyes to that ideal. However, I did not agree with the idea that people simply need to fill their \\"love tank\\" with one type of \\"fuel.\\" I feel that people need lots of different types of affirmation, and not just one. Besides that, I feel this book is beneficial to anyone that wants to understand their partner better."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I feel my relationship could have been so much stronger and better had I read this book a long time ago.

I really feel that God will bless the relationships of anyone who reads this book and focuses on putting God at the center of their life. Enjoy- I back it 100%."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My wife and I received this book as a wedding gift from a friend, who said this changed her life with her husband. I take that with a grain of salt though, as their situation was different than ours in almost every way.I'll keep this relatively short. We read the book together and took the test at the end, and I can flat-out tell you this book is pointless. Once you know what the 5 Languages are, there's absolutely no reason to get the book or read he pointless stories and drivel that litter it's pages. Chapman recounts what seem to be very loose 'stories' about how people were on the brink of divorce, but he saved their marriage by telling them what their love language was. Yay! Then he goes on to remind you that he tours the country, or that he has other books for sale. Then, in the next chapter, he basically repeats what he told you in the previous chapter, but offers up a new story. What he fails to tell you is he's barely qualified to offer any information about the subject. He's a pastor, has a masters in anthropology, and a doctorate...in adult education...from a seminary. His wall of diplomas would impress no one, let alone anyone in the psychiatric or counseling field. He might as well write a book on how to raise children...oh, wait, HE DID!His 5 Languages are so trite and trivial that any person with half a brain could figure them out. He comes off as pretentious, being a savior of sorts to so many marriages. His 5 languages are loose generalizations that all married couples should be healthily touching upon on a regular basis. Not to mention that he constantly insists that as long as the main language is taken care of, all will be well (so you if your SO is a physical touch person, you can just hold hands or hug, and never buy her anything and your marriage will be great). He does say the other languages shouldn't be ignored, but the focus should be placed on the top language. This is ridiculous advice, as the marriage will be hollow and unfulfilled if all your energy is exerted on, basically, one task. He dismisses the fact that some people may have 2 or 3 love languages in about the same score-range, saying to still focus on the top one. This takes everything out of a marriage. Your filling the love tank of one with the fuel in the love tank from the other, as you'll get more systematic in your 'language' attention and less about your actual spouse. Won't be about them so much as the process to make them happy.To further that, he constantly reminds us that dedication and conviction is necessary for the methods to work. He also doesn't take into consideration speed bumps that may come up on the journey. So, in short, he gives this advice and assumes that your in the ideal situation to focus on your SO's love language. He tells the 'patients' in his stories to go home for a month and focus on one task for the month. The patient usually comes back and is delighted with success! If not, he deciphers that it was the wrong love language, and is successful on the 2nd go-around.The issue with his method is that NO ONE can keep up that kind of dedication. He simplifies the languages to the lowest point (physical touch = holding hands, acts of service = doing the dishes), ignoring the bigger picture of what it would really take to appease a language. Plus, if people were dedicated and in love, shouldn't they be open enough to KNOW what their SO's language is? Or at least have an idea? On the quiz, my wife's language was Quality Time, but I still get nagged if the other languages aren't paid attention to, even if our QT is quite high and fulfilling to us both. If Chapman's method really worked, I'd think my wife wouldn't care about the other 'languages' since I'm focusing on her top language. But, that is not the case here, and I highly doubt its the case in most marriages.My wife still keeps this book, and references it like its the gospel when we hit rough patches, but I just can't take any of it more than it being ink on a page. Truth-be-told, most 'self help' from unlicensed individuals is typically nothing more than snake oil on paper. Chapman did nothing to change my opinion of that."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"We haven't finished reading it yet, we read one chapter a day for ... but so far it's very good, we are both enjoying it!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"You learn a lot ,I like this book..Your marriage can be heal and you can choose the right person before marriage"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"After reading this book i realize that The 5 love languages apply to all relationships.

My husband and I read it togeather and found out , not only why we were having our problems, but actually fell more in love !! I have bought a total of 9 books so far and have been giving them to friends that are having problems but also those that are engaged to be married !! It really does have the secret to love that lasts!!!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Book came super fast! It was in great condition. Awesome book couldn't put it down. I told everyone I know that they have to read it"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The book takes a a little while to explore the 5r Love Languages, which we all have at least one primary one; 1) Acts of Service, 2) Words of Affirmation, 3) Quality Time, 4) Gift Giving, 5) Physical Touch and Closeness, but is an entertaining read. The message though, is amazing.As an example; I thought my wife's love language was Acts of Service so I would constantly be up and doing stuff around the house for her. Sure she appreciated that, but what she wanted first was quality time over coffee, etc. Just learning what speaks to each other the most is extremely effective in improving the marriage relationship.There is no weird \\"psycho babble\\" here. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"A friend recommended this book.

Very valuable information!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Chapman explains how we can live and love together yet not understand that we don't connect on the same wavelength. By observing that some people touch, others use words, gifts, time, or actions to express devotion the recipient may only receive a different language. It has helped me understand how my girlfriend enjoys having time together but does not value gifts."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Very insightful and well written book. I recommend this for anyone looking to improve their relationship with their significant other. You don't have to be on the verge of divorce to find some good take-aways for this relatively short read. My wife mentions on several occasions that I am incredibly hard to shop for and buy presents for. Turns out that of the 5 love languages, \\"Receiving Gifts\\" is the language I speak the least-as long as I can remember I've never really cared if some got me a present or not.Some aspects of the book seem like common sense...after the fact, that is. I feel a little bad that I had to read a book to figure some of these things out, after which I was like \\"well duh, stupid\\". This book is a good guide in that it points out things to look for in your relationship that you may not notice on your own, or have learned to ignore/tolerate, and using you partner's love language to improve on things. I will definately come back to this from time to time for a refresher."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I study communication, that's my gig. And I thought I was pretty darn good at talking to people, particularly my fiance. Matter of fact, I knew this theory existed and I knew the basics. When I read this book, though, all the way through? Turns out all I knew was the equivalent of how to count to ten in Spanish while living in Barcelona. Oh, what an eye opener? Sure, there are moments where it's a little cheesy, and a tiny bit dated, but the meat of the book is so well worth getting through those parts! I give it my highest recommendation to anyone looking to carry on a Godly relationship--with anyone! You can even extrapolate some of the theories and methods described in this book to other non-romantic relationships such as with parents, children, and friends. I know there are books specifically for those categories but if you're a quick study and looking for one book to get the basics down? Start here....and then go get the others anyway, because I have been humbled and educated about my knowledge of interpersonal communication once before, so it can and most definitely will happen again."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is very helpful whether you're married, engaged, dating, single and thinking about being in a relationship with someone."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I have never been married but this book has definitely prepared me in ways I cannot describe.

I really think this book could save a lot of marriages."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I am a relationship coach and recommend Dr. Gary Chapman's books to my clients, as well as to the people on my website. So many folks go 'Wow, I'd wish I'd known that before!' Knowing about peoples love languages makes it so easy to understand more of what they need. In my own relationship I can tell him when my 'love tank' is getting low and I also ask him how his is doing too. It's become a very useful method of communicating how well we are each communicating our love for the other.My sweetheart is an 'Acts of service' love language person, while I'm a multiple love language personality. Being able to say 'Honey, my love tank is a little dry in this area right now', is a far better way to get my emotional needs met, than to be hurt and angry because he's not giving me what I need. Plus, when our love tanks are full, we are both far more inclined to give more love to the other.This book really says the same thing as 'The 5 Love Languages', but it is put into a male perspective. I highly recommend reading this book. It will assist you in understanding how to give different people in your life what they need to feel appreciated and cared for. Even coworkers, parents, siblings, children and friends! It has the power to improve all of your relationships if you choose to use it :)"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book has so much great information in it.

It's a short and easy read that will definitely bring some light into your relationship."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is wonderful. I cannot speak highly enough about it. It really opens your eyes to the reason why people get divorced. I truly believe if your partner does not fulfill your love languages it is a primary reason you will or did get a divorce. I bought the book to help with my relationship and it takes two people to understand what you are doing and how to fix things. Ive tried counseling with dismal results and found this book to be a much better DIY counseling service. I have recommended to several people, and i don't recommend things unless i really believe in them. It saved our relationship. If your relationship is already long over, this is still a great book for you to read, you may realize what it takes to make a long lasting relationship in your future relationships and set you up for success!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"A friend told me about this book when I was complaining about my son and his decision to end an engagement with the girl of our dreams. I have been so wrong. After reading this book, of which I ordered and received five copies, I knew I was wrong. I immediately called him to apologize. I did not go into detail, but did send him and her each a copy of this book. I also sent a copy to my daughter and her husband of two years. They are in that rough patch when the honeymoon is over. I pray they will read it and work it out before making a decision to end the relationship. It is so easy these days to just walk away. They did take the test online and found out their Love Language. That is a start. Thank you for writing such a clear presentation of how we can all live and love together. Even after many years of marriage, my husband and I read it. It has put into us a new kind of thinking. We are a lot closer. Thanks again, Keep writing. Ty"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I hate self help books. I never read them. I decided to read this because my husband and I are going through so much hectic stuff that I don't want to lose the spark. Our real estate agent recommended it to me. I absolutely positively loved this book. It only took me a couple of days to read and I have a 4 month old son, a full time job and no time in between. I read it while pumping breastmilk on my little pump breaks.I am so excited to go home and try the activities that I could just burst.I should add I have a bachelor of science in psychology; not because it was an easy degree, but because I am avid fan of conditioning and reinforcement - this is right up my alley."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I've been married over 30 years and during that time I didn't know my wife's love language and she didn't know mine. Why did we wait so long to read this book? Since reading it, and talking about it - my love meter hovers between 3/4 and full tank. When I read the chapter describing my main love language, I started crying because I felt exactly like the people described in that chapter. My wife said she also cried when she read the chapter pertaining to her love language. We highly recommend this to others.

With these many positive reviews there are some critical reviews as well that are worth reading to get a balanced overall review - there may actually be more (and likely are more) than 5 love languages or categories. The author has a significant amount of knowledge and experience regarding married couples and it is certainly worth considering his input. What will make the information in this book the most beneficial is incorporating it with personal experience, and this subject will likely be a \\"work in progress\\" project with a focus on getting better everyday to result in a lasting, happy, and fulfilling marital arrangement.My favorite review is \\"Learning to Speak, December 23, 2010\\" where the reviewer's review could have been a superb foreword for this book. May I suggest reading it as in my opinion it is brief, clear, and simple. If you have time consider reading the other reviews and comments too.Of course, some may not agree or totally agree with this book's author; however, the subject of marriage is simple, yet complexed - and even compounding at times.In my opinion this is one of the better books on this subject. There is some good material here making it worth considering reading it.This book did stimulate my thinking on the different viewpoints in marriage and if you'd like to read my comments on this marriage subject contine, if not please feel free to move on. I am just hoping that some of these thoughts may help some considering marriage or who are already married.Some believe that men and women basically use different parts of their brains. Often heard are: \\"The left brain thinks, the right brain feels.\\" \\"The left brain analyzes, the right brain intuits.\\" \\"The left brain is logical, the right brain is emotional.\\" Likely, our thinking, feeling, and loving are more complex than these simple statements; yet, at least on occasion (likely more often) men and women think and feel differently and express themselves differently - the author of this book identifies, categorizes, and classifies love into five languages. I would add one additional language, which is the ability to sincerely and promptly say \\"I'm sorry\\" from one's heart. From my 45+ years of marriage and from what I have learned from many others, a successful, lasting, and happy marriage involves two great forgivers and apologizers. In my three and a half decades of managing people I have found that those who never or almost never say \\"I'm sorry\\" have difficulties with their working and personal relationships.A husband and a wife differ to varying degrees about how they both think and feel about things, and this is in harmony with how the Creator said regarding Adam that He was going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him (not an identical twin of him - she was made different in a good way). A complement completes, perhaps making something just right. A husband and wife will benefit from loving each other, especially as the other person wants and needs to be loved.Couple this with deep respect and you hold the two keys to a successful, lasting, and happy marriage and family life - Love and Respect.Hopefully adding this thought will help your loving and respectful marriage grow more each and every day: \\"I love you more today than yesterday, but only half as much as tomorrow.\\"And one additional thought: \\"It is more beneficial for me to be respectful and loving in all that I do, than for me to be loved (something I very much want).\\"Every marriage has the potential to be successful, lasting, and happy, especially using the two keys of \\"Love\\" and \\"Respect.\\" Your marriage can be a most precious, valuable, and wonderful gift by using these two keys with sincerity and heartfelt caring; and, never let pride, the childish silent treatment, or other unloving disrespectful traits mar your treasured marriage!A good \\"PRIDE\\" antidote expressed before the end of the day: \\"I'm sorry - I was mistaken - How can I make it up to you? - I'll do my best to be better - Will you please forgive me?\\"A good \\"CHILDISH SILENT TREATMENT\\" antidote as soon as possible: Rescue the loving, caring, and respect adult within you. \\"Whining\\" and \\"I won't talk to you\\" are childish - they rarely worked in childhood and have no place among true adults. \\"Scolding\\" and \\"Lecturing\\" is easily blocked out. The best communications are loving, caring, and respectful adult expressions coupled with a big dose of attentive listening and understanding.In ballroom dancing it has been said that \\"it takes two to tango,\\" and \\"it takes one to lead.\\" Many have found a successful, permanent, and happy marriage includes three - the loving husband, the respectful wife, and the Creator and Author of marriage (who perfectly knows what's best).A good question to ask yourself at the beginning of each day: \\"What will I do today that shows I both love and respect my spouse?\\" TIP: While certainly one positive act or action daily is a good start, many are even better and will bring more benefits.ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL READING: \\"One Minute for Myself [Yourself]: How to Manage Your Most Valuable Asset\\" by Spencer Johnson, MD - while it is good to have a great relationship with your spouse; it is essential to have a good relationship with yourself, especially if your goal is to love your neighbor as yourself. Keep in mind if this is one of your goals that your closest neighbor is your spouse. Good relationships with ourselves and others I believe is what our true success in life is all about. My thought is that one needs a good relationship with oneself first in order to have good relationships with others - and it is wise to pursue \\"self-respect\\" by being respectful of yourself and all others. I like the thought of \\"self-respect\\" rather than \\"self-esteem\\" because it is easily possible to think too much of oneself; better to just focus on being respectful, caring, loving, and having proper self-respect.ADDENDUM: One of best ways to tell your spouse \\"I Love You\\" is to say \\"I love you just the way you are.\\" The principle here is if you want to be accepted in any relationship you should give your acceptance first. How many of us really want someone to relentlessly badger us to change this or change that about ourselves. Change in itself can be difficult, but that is another subject to consider."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Anyone who will ever be in a relationship needs to read this book.

Then I found out my husbands love language and how I have really neglected that aspect of his needs without even knowing it.

Unfortunately, I lost my husband to cancer over a year ago. As I consider getting back into the dating world, a male friend who went through a really ugly divorce suggested this book. It explains so much about why marriages fail. I could never understand why some of my female friends dumped their good husbands. This book helped me understand it. The husbands and wives needed different things. You have to know what makes your partner happy before you can make them happy. It's that simple. But we're not always good at explaining what makes us happy, so how can our partner know? This book explains the 5 different languages of love. We each have one of these languages that provides us with what we need. Our partner can be an awesome person, but if he or she isn't providing what we need, it's not going to work. This book will help you understand your language so you can help your partner and vice versa. As good as my marriage was, I wish I'd had this book 30+ years ago. Things could have been even better."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I forgot who had recommended me this book, but it has been in my bookshelf for years before I decided to actually read it. It isn't the type of book I usually read :) But, in the end, I was positively surprised with the book. Yes, I felt (like some other readers) that the author does oversimplify things a bit, but it does offer an interesting perspective to look at marriage.\\"The five love languages\\" has 14 chapters. The first 3 are introduction, the next five are about the five love languages that the author proposes and the rest of the chapters are about application in certain context.The introduction chapters ask the question what happens to love after marriage. The author claims that in many marriages, the initial love disappears after a couple of years of marriages often leading to divorce. He takes the analogy of a \\"love tank\\" where each person needs to receive love to keep him happy and if he/she doesn't then that will eventually be the end of a marriage. He then continues to explain that \\"in love\\" is actually very dangerous and that it can never last for a long time, but that \\"to love\\" is a choice you have.The next chapters introduce the five love languages, which are:- Words of Affirmation- Quality Time- Receiving Gifts- Acts of Service- Physical TouchIn each of the chapters, the author gives different examples from his experience of couples that discovered the love language of their spouse, learned to speak it and how that saved their marriage.Chapter 9-13 discuss the these ideas in more depth and how to apply it to different context such as with someone who you hate or with children. The last chapter was a huge turnoff for me as the author talked about how religion has been so important in his life, which is wonderful to know but felt totally irrelevant for this book.All in all, I actually enjoyed the book more than I expected. It was well written and contains lots of actual stories that make it more real. As said, I do think the concept is a bit of a simplification but I can see how it can be a useful simplification. The only thing that really turned me off what the references to religion, but luckily it is limited to the last chapter and a couple of examples. So, all in all, an interesting book. I've been doubting whether I ought to give it 3 or 4 stars and decided to give it 4 stars as I was surprised that I enjoyed the book, yet it isn't a WOW book either. Kinda useful."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book showed me many things that I was doing wrong in my marriage that is almost ending.

It gives clear and practical definitions and examples of the way humanity express and receives love. Though some of it would seem common sense, the light bulb goes on as its described in new ways. Good read and worth buying to keep."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is known as a classic in the genre of relationships and marriage, almost everyone recommends it. I found this book to have a good general idea, but just failed to execute. I agree that each person needs something different, but to just consider that people need to have a \\"love tank\\" like a gas tank and receive one type of fuel is kind of ridiculous. The book opens you up to the idea that people need different things out of the relationship than what you want. That is the gem of this book, and you can skip the rest.The book is worth a read if you are interested in looking at your relationship differently, but there are better books out there."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I ordered this book just for the heck of it while browsing, not expecting much. I'm not that into 'self-help' literature to begin with, but figured why not give it a try, who knows, I might learn something.Well, boy did I learn a few things!First off, the book is divided into sections according to topic or personality, which makes it extremely easy to navigate through (if you'd want to skip to a relevant part).Secondly, it was very interestingly written, and the analogies used to explain complicated topics made it all the more appealing, because we all know that different trials in a relationship (and the causes of it) are really not that easy to grasp or comprehend, let alone FIX.And thirdly, the author, being a couple's counsellor, shares clients' experiences and personal testimonials in regards to their marital troubles, which on numerous occasions while reading the book made me go: \\"AHA, i recognise that! And look, the next paragraph deals with the solution!\\"This book opened my eyes to ALOT of things I hadn't thought about before, in terms of wrong-goings and wrong-doings in relationships. It explained alot of really BASIC things that might seem obvious upon reading them, but that people surely overlook (I know I did).I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone, trouble in paradise or not! It's a really interesting read and you will finish it feeling more enlightened for sure!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a must read book for married couples (or those planning to be married).It contains practical information about learning the type of love that best fills your spouse's needs.

It opened my eyes to the fact that we all have different needs and that we really need to listen to the other person in our life."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Gifts, Words, Service, Touch, Attention... everyone gives and receives love differently. In the beginning of a relationship... everything is hot and heavy... and you are just happy that someone is into you... but as time marches on, the love you give can fall on deaf ears.... And then all of a sudden you don't feel appreciated and the cycle of a relationship ending looms overhead. It's because you keep loving the other person the way that you feel loved rather than the way they feel loved. It's not easy to change the way you love someone... but you must if you want your marriage to last a lifetime. I tell my Honey all the time that she's awesome and touchable. She could care less! She wants little presents reminding her that I'm thinking of her. She wants to feel a part of a team, that I'm doing things for her that make her life easier. We love differently. We feel loved differently. So now, after reading this book, when I'm doing the dishes, the only thing I mutter under my breath is \\"I Love You, Baby\\" as a reminder that I'm not just cleaning, but showing my little lady that she's important to me.the other 4 books are reviewed here: [...]"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The main idea behind this book is that just as people have unique personality preferences, we all have unique preferences for what we find satisfying and motivating when it comes to love."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The advice given in the book was good and valid; however, it seemed to be only a subset that given in a much better marriage book, His Needs Her Needs, by Dr. Willard Harley --- a book which I fully credit for saving my own marriage.I've got to believe that Chapman borrowed from Harley in some concepts. For example, the author uses the concept of the \\"love tank\\". But I believe that Harley arrived first at the party with his concept of the \\"love BANK\\".Also, the readability of of The 5 Love Languages suffered somewhat by the author's overuse of quotation marks, i.e. presenting conversations between individuals, instead of speaking directly to the reader.If you're looking for a quick read, then 5 Love Languages is OK. But if you're seriously trying to save your troubled marriage, His Needs Her Needs is the way to go."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book truly saved my marriage.

After he read it, we sat and cried together realizing how we needed to speak each other's love languages. We spent the next two years living in different states, but spent weekends and time off learning to love each other in ways that made the other feel loved. I quit the job after 2 years and he sold several businesses so we could spend more time together.

In addition, as I filled up his love tank with small acts of service (his love language), he naturally gave me more hugs (my love language).

The reader may not agree with all the examples but most will be revealing to most married couples.Excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The author, Gary Chapman, has a wealth of experiences coming from actual marriage counseling. He started by underlining that love begins or should begin at home. Very often in a marriage crisis, a primary key problem or element that was overlooked, a fundamental truth, is that people do speak different love languages. A healthy marriage means the ability to speak the love language of your spouse. He underlined the 5 love languages; words of affirmation, gifts, physical touch, acts of service and quality time. And within each love language comes many dialects or sub-groups.Within the love language of words of affirmation, comes the dialect encouraging words such as giving verbal compliments. Another dialect is kind words, spoken in a kind tone. In general, all of the dialects have in common the use of words to affirm one's spouse. Additional alternative is to give indirect words of affirmation, which is saying positive things about your spouse when he or she is not present.If a person's primary love language is quality time, it could mean listening and focused attention with a refusal to be interrupted. A dialect could be a quality conversation with sincere eye contact. Another dialect could also be quality activities, when a couple spends time together doing an activity.For the primary love language of receiving gifts, for some of us to become an effective gift giver, we may have to change our attitude about money. However, this does not necessarily imply lavish gifts, but could be as simple as gifts of self or presence, which could simply mean being present together with your spouse.In terms of the love language acts of service, it can be seen as the act of love making requests and not demands. Just like in a parent-child relationship, since the child is young and needs guidance, the parent in this situation, having more experiences and therefore will tend to have more authority, often tends to make demands on the child in order to provide guidance. On the other hand, with request comes choice. Put simply, requests give direction to love but demands stop the flow of love. Therefore a spouse should request for acts of services such as cleaning up the laundry, and not impose this as a demand on the other spouse. In an unhealthy marriage, demand comes from a tyrant spouse and tends to make the other spouse belittled. On the other hand, by making requests, it is more on giving guidance and not ultimatums, affirming his/her worth and abilities. Acts of service could be as simple as making the beds every day, having the meal prepared and ready before your spouse returns home from work, etc.For the love language of physical touch, love touches may be explicit and demands full attention such as a back rub or sexual foreplay, culminating in an intercourse. It could also be implicit and require only a brief moment such as putting your hand on his/her shoulder.For all marriages or relationships, to love and to continue loving is a choice. Very often, the initial in-love experience simply happens in the normal context of male-female relationships, un-premeditated. It tends to temporarily meet one's emotional need for love. Our emotions soar with the thought that another person sees us as number one, that your spouse is willing to devote time and energy exclusively to this relationship. For a brief period, however long it lasts, emotional need for love is met. In time, however, we come down from that natural high, back to the real world and this is when problems start mounting. When he/she descends from that emotional high, he/she may start having the natural yearnings of unmet emotional needs. If one is unable to speak the love language of your spouse, eventually all communication channels will break down and the marriage or relationship is unable to sustain any longer.Simply put, most couples get married when they still have the euphoric feelings of being in love. When these euphoric feelings evaporate some time after marriage and differences begin to emerge, they often find themselves in conflict. With no positive plan for resolving conflicts, they often find themselves speaking harshly to each other. Harsh words create feelings of hurt, disappointment and anger. Over time, this may result in divorce or infidelity.In reality, love is not our only emotional need. Among our basic needs are the need for security, self-worth, significance, etc. Love, however, interfaces with all of these. If you feel loved by your spouse, you can relax and feel secured.Gary relates an actual counseling where a spouse wondered she can ever love her husband after all that he has done to her. Her husband was unwilling to seek counseling and therefore was very much a one-sided request for help and advice. Gary recommended a 6-month experiment where she was the only one who put in the efforts by trying to speak her husband's love languages. Over time, her husband had slowly over this same course of time, started to love her again and begin to learn to speak her love language as well. This is indeed an encouragement for someone who is the only one struggling to keep the marriage alive!This book is recommended for any couple who desires a healthy marriage and seems to provide possible solutions for a world-wide mounting divorce rates."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is great for singles, couples in a relationship and married couples. I wish I had known the five love languages years ago. It could have saved a lot of heart ache and possibly a couple marriages. I daily praise God for it today, now my girl friend and I can use the languages in growing our relationship on a much firmer ground. It has been fun learning each others languages and discussing them. We daily use each others love languages. Believe me it makes for a lot of happiness."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book gave me insight into a relationship that I only thought I knew. Dr. Chapman is a very in tune man and his book has help a lot. I am now onto the teenager book to help me with understand my 3 teenagers."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I stumbled across this book last fall, and it provided some great insight into how the people you love want to feel loved by you. In addition to my personal life, I have also used this book at work. The concepts of feeling loved by either Gifts, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, Quality Time, and Words of Appreciation do transfer to the workplace when it comes to recognizing your staff and dealing with colleagues - espeically those whom you may struggle to understand.I have since read the Singles book, and most of it was repetitive of what was contained in this book, so even if you are single, this book can apply to you if you don't get bent out of shape about the references to married life ;)I probably reference, suggest, or use the ideas contained in this book at least once a week! It's an essential book if you have a relationship of any kind!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I read this book a few years ago before I was married after a friend suggested it to me. I thought...\\"Wow this is really great information! Every single person should read this!\\"I purchased a copy now and we're rereading it together this time. On a personal note, I can relate my communication issues I have with my husband to the people discussed in the book.If you don't have the opportunity to read it with your partner, reading it alone would definately improve your relationship as well, because you can probably figure out what your partner's love language is just from reading the scenarios.It was a quick and fun read-lighthearted writing with funny quirks of the opposite sex! All very true."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I have always been one to try to figure people out, especially those closest to me. A lot of what I find is not in the spoken words, but in their actions and reactions to what life throws at us. This book has been a great TOOL in understanding my family and friends. I not only read it once, but twice, and even at that I tend to go back to it as a reference guide. Sometimes it is frustrating to love someone and not be on the same page of music they are. Try out this book to give you a little insight on the other people so important to you."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I'm reading The Five Love Languages and I find myself impelled to comment on it briefly. Our need and our tradition in the west to dissect and isolate parts from the whole is staggering to me. How can one separate the needs for touch, appreciation, affirmation, helpfulness and time shared, from each other? All of these, in concert with each other, are basic needs of every human being I've ever met. And, to follow the musical analogy, while I can see the wisdom in recognizing that one instrument may assume the lead, that instrument is incomplete without the entire orchestra behind it. So fine, go ahead and dissect all this. Maybe that is the only way in which the western mind, separated from heart for too long, can ever hope to \\"understand\\" and heal itself. All of the aspects of the human heart discussed in this book can be summed up in one word. This word not only has little to do with mind, logic, rationality, and the winnowing out of one \\"need\\" over another, but may in fact be its antithesis."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"For all the 1-2-3 star reviewed people, we all get caught up in life. It's the moments you take to realize what you are neglecting. I train quite a bit in my profession and guess what, yes it takes 13 chapters to not only explain but provide concrete examples and explanations to make it stick and have people grasp the concept. I guess the low star reviewers are perfect...but hey if you're so perfect why did you read the book cause your marriages must be perfect too right?This book is the BGO moment - Blinding Glimpse of the Obvious. But guess what it shows the chinks in our armor and how to correct for those. Of course it doesnt take 100% of life factors in, but those get intertwined into the concepts. Great book, great read on 2 flights this week and gee well worth the $8 I spent.Most people spend that on 2 Starbucks while complaining the whole time that their marriage stinks. If you have any rumblings in your relationship, its worth a few hours and a few bucks to get a different perspective."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I read this book after my first marriage ended and before I remarried. It was a nice way to do some relationship \\"homework\\" before getting remarried. My fiance at the time (now husband) and I read it together and we each identified our love languages. I have to say, I think we not only learned about each other, but learned a little something about ourselves, too. It was an easy read, both enlightening and encouraging. The book did seem a little God/Christian-y at times, and while I am not a religious person, it did not bother me. The principles set forth in this book are sound whether you are a religious person or not. I feel that the information we took from this book has helped us build a strong foundation for our marriage."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I read this book a while back, I think i was engaged at the time... and I will say I truly think it helped prepare me for marriage and improve my relationship with my (now) hubby. But whether youre dating, engaged or married this is deifnitely worth reading... it will only help your relationship! The concepts are easy to understand... Though the author seemed a little cheesy and elementary to me at times, his points are all valid. It helped me realize that I should appreciate the things my hubby was doing for me (even if they didnt seem like that big of a deal) because thats how he was expressing his love for me. I never really thought about people showing their love different ways, but after reading this, i think i understand him a whole lot more!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I usually don't care to read, however this book is so easy to read that I actually don't mind reading it.

If it's not being taught in psychology classes it should be!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book approaches relationships in a different way. It talks about how to make the other person happy by learning their \\"love language\\" so you can show love in a way that is more meaningful to him. The author also does a great job of noting that you won't get immediate results but someone has to be the first to swallow her pride in order to create a more loving atmosphere in the relationship. After showing your partner that you are making the effort to make him happier and feel more loved, eventually he will return the favor. If he never does, then maybe it is time to move on.I think people, or at least I used to, expect a 50:50 give-and-take all the time. And they believe that if the relationship isn't always equal, it will never be. This book is a testament to how relationships require work to reach that level of 50:50.Someone prior had mentioned that there should be a 6th love language of space and I completely agree. I believe not understanding that space was my ex-boyfriend's love language was a reason (amongst the fact that I had other personal turmoil) this book didn't work out for me. I didn't speak in his love language and so didn't truly follow the recommendation of making him feel loved by respecting his love language.While that relationship ended, I now know how to approach my future relationships. I didn't grow up with a good model for a giving and loving relationship. My parents constantly fought, were abusive to each other, and didn't make efforts to show each other how they love each other. This book is helping to change my perspective on creating a healthy, loving relationship.I felt that some parts were redundant but that didn't take away that much from the value of the book."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a book that I wish I would've never been in a position to come across, let alone read. However, I am thankful that I took the time and opportunity to do so wishing I would've been exposed and receptive to its message long before now. It has helped me to process communication in a totally different light. The references to couples the author worked with in the past really helped to explain each of the love languages. Also his way of referring objectively to either sex really made it easy to be able to see both sides points of view. This was helpful when elaborating on a specific language or explaining how to put it to use in day to day life. I was recommended to read this book and very thankful that I did. If you want to improve your ability to communicate to a loved one this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I loved this book and it made a lot of since as to why I get angry with my husband!

Knowing what makes your spouse us great, but acting on it takes time, effort, desire, energy and commitment. Many people won't change."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I resisted buying this book from a long time, even though it came highly recommended by many people I knew on an online forum about dating and relationships. The title just sounded very gimmicky to me and I was curious what it could really tell me that I didn't already know. The answer was, a lot. The basic premise of the book is that there are multiple ways you can show someone you love and care and that different people find different approaches more satisfying and meaningful. It's one of those things that sounds common sense once you read the book but admittedly I hadn't picked up on before. This book helped me figure out what my love language was and it explained a lot for me. For instance, there were past relationships in which I felt my partner was doing a lot of things that showed they loved me but part of me still felt unsatisfied, this book helped me realize it was because while these gestures were nice, they weren't in my love language. Going forward I feel like I am much better at being able to articulate how I need to be loved and to also feel out how future partners may prefer to be loved. Much of the language in the book is rooted in marriage, but as a single person I think the advice is universal enough that even single people can take something out of it. Yes, there are TONS of self help relationship books out there, but this one, in my opinion, is actually sound and helpful"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Purchased the regular edition as well as the mens version.

It will make a difference in the divorce rate if couples read this book when the lust dies down."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My wife and I have been together for 7 years and know each other very well. We both have claimed to have put in much effort to make the other feel loved yet ironically, both of us have felt under-loved and underappreciated by the other. After reading this book, we have found that we are speaking our own love language to each other but it is not the love language of the other! Our love tanks are not full. After discovering what the others primary and secondary love language is using the assessment test, we have practiced giving heavy daily doses of the primary and sprinkkling in the secondary and little doses of the others. What a difference! It has been a big challenge for us as both our primary language is the other's very least needed! Wow. Talk about having to be intentional. But I can tell you it has been well worth it. The more I hold up to the challenge, the more he feels loved and wants to give me what I need. And vice versa. No wonder this is such a successful book. Apart from making God the center of of your marriage, this is one of the greatest foundations in a marriage - keeping your love tank full by speaking your mate's love language daily!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Gary Chapman always delivers quality.

I am so glad I did! This book helps you identify you and your mates \\"Love language\\" and speak it to each other to so you can always have a happy marriage and fill each others need for love. I would recommend this to anyone even if they don't have marital problems it is a great way to ensure you never will."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"As a recent graduate of Psychology, my mentor recommended that I build a library of useful material to expound on when speaking with clients. She recommended Gary Chapman's 5 Love Languages not fully aware of the condition my own marriage was in. I bought the book, and wondered how this book made it to print without them having interviewed me? It is because Dr. Chapman has interviewed countless others who are or were just like me. I shared the book with my husband and now, I offer to anyone who is born with an emotion to read this book! It is the answer to survival and learning how to love, even yourself.Rev. Marsha C.

I highly recommend it to everyone interestedin having a great relationships with others."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I bought this book during a deployment in preparation for marriage. At the time, I was in a serious relationship with someone I thought was going to turn out to be \\"the one\\". (Come to find out, I was simply in the \\"in love\\" stage)But I digress. This is an AMAZING book. I didn't realize that it was written for couples who were already married, but nevertheless it has been very beneficial. Once you read the book, you'll start to see the similar pattern many of the married couples were going through because they weren't speaking their spouse's \\"love language.\\" They weren't doing the things their spouse MOSTLY considers unmistakable expressions of love.There were at least two couples in this book who said that they had wished they had known this information (or read this book) 20+ years before so that they could've forgone the years of NOT feeling loved by their spouse. If that's not motivation enough for you to feed on this information Dr. Chapman offers, I don't know what to tell ya.I STRONGLY recommend this book to married couples, couples who plan on being married, and even single folks. There is so much eye-opening wisdom in here that you'd be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring it. It can save you years of hurt & misunderstanding. But positively, it can spur you and your loved one to newer heights of satisfaction and happiness in your relationship. Be blessed."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Loved this book! I see an individual counselor who recommended this book to me.

Thiis book truly offers more insight then 24 hours of therapy. Gary puts his soul into this book"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I have been married for 16 years. I have searched high and low for answers to why our marriage got as bad as it did. This book explains mostly why and how to fix most of our problems. I expect it will make any remaining problems seem relatively trivial. If only I can get my wife to speak my primary love language. I must be patient....The tank full or empty metaphor is good and I see John Gottman using a similar approach and just as valid with his emotional bank account metaphor. I also recommend his work. For detailing other interactions that make us feel loved and closer or hurt and distant. My wife spent years expressing love for me in the way she wanted to get it and I the same. It does not work, we did not feel it.One thing some reviewers seem to miss is that once you know your partners primary and secondary love languages you need to use them and get comfortable with them even if they are not comfortable for you at first. Quit expecting your partner to feel loved by understanding your language, I am sure it will help, knowing there is more meaning in some of their actions than you once thought, but it will not be enough.. Speak theirs to them and ask them to speak yours to you."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Great book shared by my daughter in love...

Not only is it simple to assess the love languages of those we love, but it's also simple to put those suggestions into action. I said \\"simple,\\" but not always easy.As is often the case when couples pair off, opposites attract and then clash. By nature we automatically show affection to others in a way that we would like to receive affection ourselves. We give love in the only way we know, but it's not interpreted as love by the other party. That person speak a different love language. Fortunately, when we realize what constitutes \\"love\\" to our spouse and other family members, we can learn to effectively speak their love languages.I credit Gary Chapman with a huge breakthrough in healing and strengthening our bonds with one another. No matter how difficult a relationship may be, I believe it can be improved by applying these simple truths."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I loved this book.

My marriage is on the verge of divorce and I read the book with hopes that I may salvage it. I realized some of the things I was doing were not my wife's love language although I did do a lot of things that are in her love language I suppose maybe not enough. When someone attempts to walk out of a marriage for someone else or meets with people of the opposite sex in secret (platonic or not) means there is a possibility that they are not getting what they need in their current relationship. This was kind of shocking to me seeing my nick name is marshmallow to my friends and that I do so much for my wife and I adore her. That said 30 years with one person is hard to walk away from. Reading this book made me say to myself \\"hold on\\" maybe I am not doing everything right. I also realized I feel so un-loved and un-trusting because my love tank is virtually zero meaning my wife hasn't met my love language in several years but because I adore her so I would have lived like this forever. I pray it is not too late for us and that this book can really help. Now the realllly hard part, convincing her to read it at this point she hates me(the last chapter is all about a one sided love and how to possibly change to get the other side back) If you relationship is in trouble please read this book and if you can have your partner read it, if you follow Gary's advice you really could have a wonderful life long marriage."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Ordered this book after it was a favorite on \\"The View\\" Been married 46 years and found it interesting and informative."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a great book (we ordered it as an mp3).
