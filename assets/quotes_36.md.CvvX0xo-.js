This is a must-read for those who like their horror stories on the sophisticated side."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What a gripping, amazingly well written story!I am Legend, is by far the best vampire story of all time. Dracula might win in name recognition, Ann Rice's popularized vampires, they all have a color of fantasy to the story. Matheson's story not only twists the story even darker by focusing on the non-vampire Neville, but sets the story in a realistic, modern (even though it was written in the 1950s!) backdrop. The effect, is that the vampires become a reality to the reader.It reads much like a diary of a shipwrecked sailor on a remote island - a Robinson Crusoe - following Neville's experiences, triumphs, isolation, and humanity. Matheson addresses quesions like what does it mean to be &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;human&quot;, and Neville keeps wondering why it is that he fights to live on all by himself, against all odds.The other short stories in this book are delightfully (and disturbingly) well written, but &quot;I am Legend&quot; is by far the greatest."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If it werent for Jaws, the genre that we know today would not existed. And if it werent for I am legend,by Richard Matheson, Stephen King and Clive Barker would be writting god knows what. Cause I Am Legend, a book about a guy who is trapped in a world of vampiers is amazing, storyfull, scary, paranoic and it has everything that a good novel needs. Bram Stokers Dracula is still the best vampire novel, but I Am Legend is right behind it. Thank you Richard for this great book (i think even vampires enyoed it :))"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Nothing Matheson has ever written has disapointed me (what can I say, all those rave reviews aren't just a smoke screen) but &quot;I am Legend&quot; is different because it is a landmark in the vamp genre. In a world where so much garbage is pumped out into the public and passed off as literature it's nice to read something of substance, something gothic and dark and big enough to make you forget your life. The plight of Neville in this gem made me forget my own worries, and Matheson's unique use of the English language allowed me to visualize that plight in detailed horror. If you enjoy the works of Stoker and Rice, but haven't read Matheson, you don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was excited to purchase this book after long being out of print. I read it in one day. I thought this was an excellent post-apocalyptic vampire story. It is not a scary book, but a good one. You can sure see why Matheson was the inspiration for authors like Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Although not five stars, I would highly recommend reading it. You will especially like this if you enjoyed the movie &quot;Omega Man&quot; with Charlton Heston. It was based on this novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read this book after THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, a book in which I thought Matheson did a better job of conveying his character's thoughts and emotions given his situation. I found I am Legend to be a bit monotonous and lacking in dynamic plotting through much of its first half. However, I found the last forty pages or so ABSOLUTELY captivating, and with a fantastic ending- which made the book. Overall, I never felt emotionally connected to Robert Neville the way I felt towards Scott (I believe that was his name) in The Incredible Shrinking Man. But this emotional element notwithstanding, I am Legend is an amazing conception- for its depth of vision and its penetrating questioning of just what &quot;horror&quot; is- and how much of it is individual perception."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I AM LEGEND is a powerful tale of one man's life in an alienated world. While seemingly an 'end of the world' novel, Matheson manages not to fall into clisch&eacute;, and his story is allways powerful and centered. The book is somewhat dated, and at times maybe unclear, but those are minor points. the ending, when Matheson's tale switches, is powerful, unexpected, and touching."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had to laugh at the reviewer who said this book seems &quot;aimed at young children.&quot; Hello! Did they read the same book that is being reviewed here - I Am Legend by Richard Matheson? Frankly, this grown up was nearly sickened by it, as I am by most good vampire tales. I read them, but I always feel a little nauseous by the end. This one was no exception. This book seemed something of a metaphor for alcoholism - or any addiction - and its attendant symptoms of isolation/paranoia. And I have to admit I didn't quite get the ending. Exactly who were the people of the new society? Nevertheless, it was fascinating. You don't forget it when it's over...there's something about it that spooks you with the feeling that it could be real."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Many ppl will think of Richard Matheson along side of &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; his more commercial successfull book made into a movie, but &quot;I Am Legend&quot; blows it away this is trully one of the best books ever written. Matheson writes Neville like he actually knows the loneliness of being the last man on the earth, i would have to say this book ranks up there with the Grandmasters, Heinlein, and Bester."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I started this and could not put it down...I had to know what happened in the end. Matheson is one hell of an author. I got into the main characters head and felt the isolation and frustration he felt. I only was disappointed when it was over. I wanted to keep up the wild ride...EXCELLENT."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I think the most difficult thing about writing is the ending. It can turn a great book into a so-so book and vice versa. Many books fall short of this, but not this one. The incredible ending makes this a very worthy story.I will not waste my time on the other short stories... they do not measure up to I am Legend. Luckily, this story took most of the pages."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This was a very interesting story, although not at all what I thought it would be. I expected more of an almost 'Resident Evil' style adventure. What it turned out to be was a brooding, introspective vampire story that took very little from the Bram Stoker world (and I mean that in a good way - I think 'Dracula' is an awful book).I would recommend this to anyone. There are good story ideas here, it was well paced, it had a few legitimately frightening / tense moments, and it help my interest the whole way."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is a real page turner and an absolute horror classic. I am familiar with quite a bit of Matheson's work and it is excellent. I am Legend is in a class by itself. I think this one will be remembered as a literary classic in the future like Dracula and Frankenstein. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book about a year ago on a whim. I was in the mood for a little horror, and the cover looked cool, so I thought I would check it out. I was absolutely blown away. The book could really be considered more of a psychological drama than a horror story. The way Matheson sets up his world and the dramatic conflicts that face the main character, Robert Neville, is superb. I will not go into the plot of the book, since plenty of other reviewers have already done so. I will just say that I was enthralled by the book, and I had a hard time putting it down. As for the short stories that accompany this edition, I found most of them to be pretty good, especially Person to Person, and the short but funny The Funeral. Do yourself a favor and get this book!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a very entertaining, albeit pretty short (170pgs) book and I would recommend it to anyone that likes survival type stories.Only problem is that now I don't think the movie will be anything near how good the book was."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book was the best book I have read in a long time. It was short, but very very worth it. His writing style and vocabulary are top notch and this book keeps you glued to your seat for the whole thing.

Can't wait for the movie now and I hope they make it exactly like that book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"While seemingly at first to be about a man fighting against undead creatures at a constant struggle for survival. If one takes the time to prob deeper they would find a completely different tale, one of a man who goes down the path of insanity only to be awakened at the end.Truly a classic novel with memorable moments, Scientific explanations at the Vampire Legends, and a thought provoking conclusion to wrap it up.One of the best novels by Richard Matheson if not the best novel ever written.5/5"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, and did not realize it was written over 50 years ago (I was kind of wondering, though, why it was set in the 1970s!). Anyway, needless to say, I was hooked almost instantly. It is such an intelligent book, and the prose is beautiful - full of clever turns of phrase and colorful imagery.I literally had to put the book down a couple of times when I was reading at night, because my heart was pounding and I was afraid I wouldn't get to sleep. Now, I am no newcomer to horror - my aunt gave me a copy of The Shining when I was 10, and I think like The Shining, this book creeped me out deeply - the story really gets into your head. Now my stepson has been bugging me for the last week to turn my copy over to him so he can read it.It is a brutal story, full of heartbreaking moments, and as others have noticed, the focus on the scientific basis for vampirism draws you in.The additional short stories are a mixed bag, but some quite good - like \\"Prey\\" - I was quite haunted by that one as well.I'm a little afraid to see the Will Smith movie; I'm praying they do a good job with that one. Otherwise, what a waste!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The basis of many zombie movies. This book is a must for fans of zombies or vampires.

Just what on earth would you do?These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book which demands to be read. Read it.

I didn't realize when I purchased it that the book also contains other short stories, which was a nice bonus."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I am Legend\\" is a remarkable novel that tackles vampirism with science-fiction, as opposed to the horror genre. There are scary moments, but the thing that sets this novel apart is the scientific explanation that the main character, Robert Neville, gives for the plague of vampires that have taken over the world.The premise of this novel is that Robert Neville is the only man on Earth who is immune to the vampire virus. The majority of the book follows Neville around as he goes about his daily routines in a post-apocalyptic world. By all means, the beginning of this book should have been boring--but it wasn't. Matheson's narrative and exposition bleed together as we discover the causes and effects of the germ 'vampiris' with Neville.This book is definitely one that gets you thinking about a lot of things; routine, the way a lonely mind changes and hardens, good/evil, and love/attachment.Nevermind Harker's journals, Helsing's tedious explanations, and the card-board cut-out Count Dracula. This is the vampire novel that allowed for today's vampire genre to blow up.10/10 Classic."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Following a worldwide plague, Robert Neville may be the only man left alive. His family is dead. All the surviving humans have been transformed into vampires that surround his house very night in an attempt to break in or entice him out, attack him, and drink his blood. Holed up in his home, which he has converted into a safe house, Robert struggles with his despair and his outsider status, the constant need to seek shelter, food and protection, and the desire to discover the cause and possibly the cure of the plague. A combination of science fiction and horror, I Am Legend is an atmospheric, stark survivalist text with a truly brilliant central concept: the scientific conception and explanation of a vampire. The book is short and difficult to put down, well paced, both intelligent and frightening, and had a huge literary impact on authors in both the sci-fi and horror genres. I highly recommend it, and I consider it one of the most interesting books that I have ever read.This read through of I Am Legend was my first time coming back to it since I read it in high school (now almost four years ago). The story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years--or, more precisely, the science of Matheson's conception of vampires. Coming back to the text, it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly. For the most part, this narrative is a method of conveying Matheson's sci-fi concepts--perhaps like any true SF author, he puts scientific concept ahead of character, and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story's scientific concept has on them. In the case of I Am Legend, that concept is a scientific and (mostly) logical explanation for vampires. And it's a wonderful, brilliant concept, more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years. I still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail, making the end of the book feel a little too fast--nonetheless, the concept is a great one, and very interesting to read about.The flips side of that situation, however, is that the book lacks characterization and emotion. Those aspects aren't entirely absent by any means. Robert, the protagonist, has a back story, goes through emotional phases, and is greatly impacted by the apocalyptic survival setting that he finds himself in. He's realistically faulted and in many ways admirable. Nonetheless, these personal characteristics and even his interactions, past and present, exist primarily to move towards, expound on, and explain Matheson's scientific point, his conception of the vampires. In some cases, this is obvious: Richard's memories serve to build his character, but they also serve to lead him, and thus the reader, to a better understanding of the vampires. At a mere 160 pages, Matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character--not so that it overwhelmed his SF ideas, but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book. The lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result.Despite these thoughts and critiques, I greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it. Matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in I Am Legend, one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown. His SF concepts are detailed, intelligent, and truly absorbing. The book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that I have never seen anywhere else and find greatly enjoyable to read. I highly recommend the text, and it's a good one to own--although short and easily readable, it's wonderful to come back to and reread. It also makes a great atmospheric yet intelligent horror/Halloween text.I haven't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version, and so I can't speak for those."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson is a master craftsmen of the sci-fi and horror genre. This novel is no exception and is my favorite thus far. Only four stars though because the ending left something to be desired, at least for me. Still good, but I've read a better ending in his shorter stories. But definitely check it out - it's a great read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson said, \\"... when I lived in New York, I watched Dracula, the old Lugosi Dracula, at a motion picture theater, and it just occurred to me that if one vampire was frightening, then a whole world of vampires would really be frightening.\\" _I Am Legend_ is about a hard-drinking family man, Robert Neville, apparently the last living human being -- everyone else has been turned into vampires by 'bacillus vampiris' after an atomic or biological war, who lives in a house fortified against the nightly onslaughts of an army of the undead, including his next-door neighbor-ghoul, Ben Cortman, who keeps yelling, \\"Come out, Neville!\\" The suspenseful creepiness begins with the first sentence of the book: \\"On those cloudy days, Robert Neville was never sure when sunset came, and sometimes they were in the streets before he could get back.\\" You just know that eventually he is not going to make it back inside his house in time. The first half of the tale describes Neville's mundane existence: eating, drinking, listening to classical music, hanging garlic bulbs on his outside walls, driving stakes into vampires during the day, going to the library to read about bacterial diseases, etc. In the second half, things happen -- Matheson had to come up with an ending, but like most horror stories, the conclusion is not as satisfying as you might wish. Ten short stories are also included in this book, including most notably \\"Prey\\" about a doll that comes to life and attacks a woman in her apartment, and \\"Person to Person\\" about a man who receives telephone calls in his head from maybe (?) his subconscious. Matheson is an imaginative genius; Google him and see his long list of writing accomplishments and the many movies made from them. _I Am Legend_ was first published in 1954, long before derivative works like Romero's Night of the Living Dead and the Resident Evil video games and movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am legend is great, propably the second best vampire novel since Dracula. I just want to mention the other (short/er) stories in this anthology. Alot of reviewers only talk about \\"I am Legend\\". I can understand that; since it is the title story and the longest story of this anthology. But, in my opinion, the story \\"Dance of the Dead\\" is far greater. It alone is worth the price of this anthology. It has the dystopian atmosphere of \\"A clockwork orange\\" and the nightmarish visual themes of the great J.G.Ballard. Only a master writer can get that mix within 17 pages (and before Anthony Burgess and J.G.Ballard)."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Published in 1954, this book tells the sad, spooky tale of the last man on earth, Robert Neville.

The bulk of what you're getting here is the 170 page novel of \\"I am Legend\\". The main character, Robert Neville is what makes this novel so great. He is reminiscent of John Wayne/Charleton Heston muchismo, a bold, in your face tough guy. Getting drunk, smoking cigarettes, and vampire hunting never looked this good. There is not enough of that in literature, IMO. \\"I am Legend\\" turns out to be a great social commentary, begging the question, \\"Who is the real outcast?\\" in a Planet of the Apes tone.Short stories that stick out most in this edition are \\"Dance of the Dead\\", \\"Mad House\\", and \\"Dress of White Silk\\". Each short is thought provocative in their own ends and it was enjoyable noting differences in style between each.This is a collection definitely worth a look, especially is you are a fan of the horror/suspense genre."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"'I Am Legend' by Richard Matheson, at least in the current published form, actually contains the novel of the same name plus several short stories. The main novel deserves all the accolades by the other amazon.com reviewers; it is a truly original, ghoulish apocalyptic tale where vampires take over the world. It is tightly written and completely enthralling.Unfortunately the collection of short stories generally tarnishes the overall package. I found them either barely interesting or down right amateurish ... hard to believe they were written by the same person who wrote 'I Am Legend'. However there is one very notable exception - the short story 'Prey'. It's about a tribal figurine who unmercifully attacks a young woman in her New York apartment. Terrific.Bottom line: certainly a mixed collection, but the main story 'I Am Legend' is an absolute must read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is possibly one of the best horror novels I have read as of late. I was surprised when I found out, that it is actually a colection of short stories by the author. Each story is enough to give you a chill or two, if not at the very least a few goose-bumps. I enjoyed the dark-humor in a couple of stories. A must read for any fan of the darker side."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" is a horror story written in 1954. It is a founding book in what we now classify as \\"post apocalyptic\\" genre. The story revolves around Robert Neville who is a one-man army against a land filled with Vampires. In his quest to survive, we follow Robert over a three year period where he struggles with survival, depression, alcoholism, and the ever present hope that he is not the last \\"normal\\" human in the world.The book was short, but it was an engaging read that really drew me into Robert's battle for life. I felt for the guy as I learned about what happened to the world, and specifically his wife and daughter. I also felt the highs and lows Robert encountered throughout the story.The ending had one of the best closing lines I've ever read in a book. I won't spoil it for you, but I will encourage you to read the book if for nothing other than the ending!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I have watched this movie many times.

I can't believe I waited so long to read Matheson's book. I have no clue why the movie with Will Smith was even called I Am Legend - nothing near the book! I wish the actual story was adapted properly to big screen."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I didn't realize that the story \\"I am Legend\\" actually only takes up about the first 150 pages of this book. I was, therefore, quite surprised when I turned the page, thinking I'd simply come to the end of the chapter, and found instead a bunch of short stories. It just didn't feel like it should be the end. I didn't expect the main character to give up so easily, after everything he went through up until that point.But it was dark, and I quite liked that.But, unfortunately, overall the book wasn't that great. I found it very slow and difficult to begin with. It got a bit more interesting when there was some actual dialogue (even if it was just with a dog) but that didn't last long...I found sometimes the narrative a bit confusing. Seemed a lot of sub-plots were dropped and never mentioned again. Sometimes the use of flashbacks confused me, because it wasn't quite clear that they were flashbacks.The main character wasn't really all that likeable or interesting, but at least I did feel that I could sympathize with him somewhat.The book didn't have the atmosphere of the movie; in fact, it didn't really have all that much atmosphere at all, never mind the movie!I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. I was surprised when I reached the end, because I was thinking something finally interesting had happened and maybe the plot would pick up a bit from then on. Instead, it's just THE END and a bunch of short stories!I haven't read all of the short stories yet. I read the first two. I thought the first one was a bit boring and pointless. I kinda liked the second because of the dark implication at the end of it. The third, I am reading at the moment, seems okay. But nothing so far has been particularly special. But, it adds a bit of value to a book that would otherwise have seemed very high price for only 150 pages of story, so I guess I won't complain too much at that.This is a book that's worth reading if you're a fan of the movie, just so you can compare. I liked the movie more, which is quite unusual for me - typically I prefer the books."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book came across my email when Kindle was having a sale and I thought, \\"Why not?\\"Written in 1954, it hits the vampire genre far before \\"Twilight\\" romanticized it. The book's main character is Robert Neville, who very well may be the last man on earth -- other than the half-dead and full vampires who try to lure him out of his home every night.The book only lightly touches upon WHY there are vampires. Apparently, there was a plague or virus or \\"something\\" unknown that created a world of vampiric entities. Robert thinks he's been immune because he was bit by a vampire bat while he was in the war.It's interesting to see how Robert handles being alone. I personally would go stark raving mad, but Robert handles the madness and frustration by trying to figure out just what causes a person to become a vampire. He discovers a potential reason, but the irony is it's just too late.The ending I'll leave to you to read. It's faster paced than the rest of the book (which in and of itself is a short book and a quick read) and the ending leaves you wondering about \\"what if\\".People who are in love with the romance of vampires will hate this book. People who loved Van Helsing will likely enjoy this book. Either way, it's a classic and worth the time."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I don't know what to say about this novel other than that it's the best of the best. You are missing out if you haven't read it. It's a story that will haunt you for the rest of your life. In my opinion, it is nothing like the movie. I was not a fan of the movie. But the book is incredible. The only complaint I have is that it ended so soon. It was in an anthology with a couple other short novellas when I first read it years ago, and I was so disappointed when I reached the end unexpectedly because I thought I still had a few hundred pages to go!Definitely one of the top gems of the horror fiction trade."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is worth your time.

As soon as you read the first page or two your hooked. It's incredible how Hollywood recently made such a bad film from a such a great short story.

I won't explain too much as not to ruin anything, but its basically the last man on earth struggling to survive from day to day after all of humanity has become undead.Read this book! It isn't long but it is one of my favorite stories ever, and the ending is spectacular (and nothing like the movie)."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was interested in listening to the audio presentation of 'I Am Legend' and was not disappointed in it. The story differs greatly from the movie and it was a pleasure to hear it. The narrator of that story did a great job.However, when I got to the 'Other Stories' part of the audio book (about 4-5 disks into the 10 disk set), I found myself very disappointed by the poor narration (performed by a different narrator). I suppose some of the stories might have been ok, but like a previous reviewer, I stopped listening at about disk 7 because I couldn't stand listening to the narrator anymore ... couldn't even force myself. I've listened to a lot of audio books because I do so much driving and of the hundreds of books I've read this narrator was by far the worst. The short stories weren't Mattheson's best. I have read many of his short stories and liked others much better.My recommendation would be to find another audio version of I Am Legend that doesn't include the short stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The novella \\"I am Legend\\" holds up very well after half a century. (FYI, I have not seen the movie or read the other stories in the book.) The writing is fast-paced and lively. The character emotions are a bit dated. Our protagonist is a classic White male who demands \\"reason,\\" balls up his fists when he gets mad, belittles women, and so forth. Despite our blockish hero, we can immediately identify with this man who finds himself alone in a world of vampires. He suffers the loss of his wife and child, and wonders about his existence. The science of vampires he uncovers is original and sometimes compelling, and his changing moods--sometimes purposeful, sometimes forlorn--are captivating. The terrible alienation of this hero makes for a surprisingly fun and fast read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Works created with the intent of bending genres can prove instructive, if not uniformly entertaining. Some never manage to overcome inherent tensions and break apart. Others end up squiggly and shapeless, more exercises in frustration than anything else. Still others try to twist together wildly divergent ideas, the pieces never quite meeting no matter how hard the author tries. Then there are narratives -- rare and wonderful ones -- that shift from element to element so easily you wonder why no one has tried their particular combination before. Richard Matheson's I Am Legend is one of these.Robert Neville is the sole survivor of a plague that killed his wife and daughter, the inhabitants of the city where he lives, and (as far as he knows) the world's entire population. By day he scavenges, digging up necessities such as food and water and wooden dowelling. Mirrors, too, if he can get them, and garlic. Because while might be the last man alive, he is not the last man on earth. When darkness falls, the plague's victims come out, transformed into viscous, blood-drinking vampires by ... By what, exactly? Neville doesn't know, but he'll do everything in his power to find out.Post-apocalyptic, horror, hard SF and myth -- there's genre divergence if ever you saw it. But Matheson twines them into a single story with a contortionist's grace, leveraging commonalities to make the styles meet. Anyone who has experienced a catastrophe of some kind knows that such things hold hands with horror. And melding science and superstition isn't too much of a stretch, either. Indeed, Matheson's naturalistic re-imagining of vampirism is one of the novel's high points. The same can't be said for its dour ending. While downbeat conclusions are fine and good in their place, the close of Neville's struggles strips them of significance through no fault of his own. A disappointing turn on an otherwise excellent piece."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The three adaptations of this book are well done but they will never be as good as the original.When the last version was produced I just had to pick up the novel. I have seen all three versions in film and enjoyed each and every one of them immensely.The novel for me was a real page turner and I could not put it down."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a series of short stories, which I wasn't aware of when I bought it. But, every short story in this book is exceptionally well done, with different writing styles and tones as needed. I was very impressed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The 'I am Legend' compilation is a fabulous book and must be taken on it's own merits and not on one's enjoyment of the 3 subsequent movies (good or bad). The fact that it was written in 1954 can only make the reader more impressed with Matheson's scientific references and the way in which he weaves mythology with the \\"modern\\". Although there are other definite classics included, I felt less of an affinity with some of the other short stories until I again reminded myself of the vintage of these tales. A short story like 'Prey'(1969) falls foul of numerous 'Chucky' type 80's horror flicks, the memories of which now permeate ones imagery during the reading of such a story and needless to say, ruins it.But to harp on the negative is futile when the 170 pages of 'I am Legend' are magnificent. The ending, the very final line, outshines anything that movies have done with this work. I would however, recommend a viewing of the three movies, 'The last man on Earth', 'Omega Man' and 'I am Legend' as something of interest after reading this book. That's not to say there's not an absolute lemon in there, but it is interesting to see the treatment of the material from the 1954 text through to 2007."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Notwithstanding comparisons with the movie, this is a very creative and classic horror/sci-fi novella. The plot is essentially that a virus has been unleashed on the earth that has turned everyone in the world into vampires. One man has the anecdote and was able to remain untouched by the virus; however he has as yet been unsuccessful in saving others from the virus. Thus, by day the main character hunts the vampires and conducts his experiments against them. And by night, the vampires attempt to break into his \\"stronghold\\" and destroy him. The vampires seem to loath the fact that someone exists who is not like them and has seemingly remained untouched by the virus.The above is the premise but of course, something has got to give....The story \\"I am Legend\\" is actually closer to a short story than a novel -less than 200 pages. The particular edition I read included several other Matheson short stories, which I did not get all the way through. I struggled through a couple but felt they sub-par especially by comparison to \\"Legend.\\"I give it 4 out of 5 stars, and definitely recommend it. I probably still consider Dracula the essential vampire classic, and also recommend \\"the penguin book of vampire stories;\\" but \\"Legend\\" is a very good and is probably one of the better examples of horror and sci-fi crossover out there. Again, it is a rather quick read. Another reason I recommend it if you have seen the movie is to learn why it is called \\"I am Legend,\\" which is not entirely evident in the Will Smith version in my opinion.I also recommended the book to a friend who thought it was one of the best things he has read, and considers it a lot better than the movie versions.(Note - In addition to Will Smith's \\"I am Legend\\" the book has also been made into 2 other movie variations - \\"The last man on earth\\" starring Vincent Price, and \\"The Omega Man.\\" Starring Charleton Heston. \\"The Omega Man\\" is a nice interpretation of the book and one of my favorite sci-fi movies, though it deviates from the book.)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I just finished this story --> after seeing the latest film adaptation.(The Fresh Prince version of the story is similar in name only.) The novel clearly is the inspiration for many of our modern day scifi/horror stories. Standing alone, I Am Legend is a well written novel exposing the innermost human condition, reminding me of Joseph Conrad. It also reminded me of Poe -- the human mind and soul pushed to the limits of sanity. I Am Legend is a winner!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read the book because I saw the movie (as surely many others did). I have to say that I actually liked the movie more, but they are so different that it's hardly worth comparing them.The whole story is about what it would be like to be, basically, the last man alive. Although the conclusions it reaches are not entirely happy, the ending left me with a lot to think about in a way that the movie did not. It felt like it was political in some sense, but I'm not sure exactly what to think of it.Although the story is older (1950s? I think '54...) it is written in a very modern style -- and it's horror that's neither gothic nor \\"splatter.\\" I'd recommend it if only because it's not what you're expecting, and it does not end how you expect it to end.The best thing about this book, however, is that it is followed by a collection of short stories... actually, about half of the book is short stories. Some of the stories were better than the novel, in my opinion, although not all."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It is perhaps the greatest novel written on human loneliness. It far surpasses Daniel DeFoe's Robinson Crusoe in that regard. Its insights into what it is to be human go far beyond genre, and is all the more surprising because, having read his short stories- which range from competent but simplistic, to having classic Twilight Zone twists (he was a major contributor to the original tv series) there is nothing within those short stories that suggests the supreme majesty of the existential masterpiece I Am Legend was aborning.Not only is it more than a horror or sci fi tale, it is more than just a post-apocalyptic work as well. It is (written in 1953, and published in 1954) a far more subtle allegory on the McCarthyism of the day, as well the rigid conformity of the 1950s leading to the cultural sterilization and death of the masses. Compared to such filmic fare from that decade, as On The Beach- or its written source, or even The World, The Flesh, The Devil, it stands even higher because criticism from either side of the spectrum, politically- the idle and gullible Left and the vicious and pandering Right- was generally heavy-handed and obvious. Even when compared to later works, some with direct debts, like George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead, or those intriguing alternative visions to the end of the world- Ursula LeGuin's The Lathe Of Heaven (another great apocalyptic novel) or the 1985 New Zealand film The Quiet Earth, I Am Legend stands alone with its relentless focus on the self, and the relation to things exterior.It deconstructs the vampire myth with modern methods, attempting to explain many of its legendary aspects with science- such as why non-Christian vampires would fear the cross- they don't, why a stake kills a vampire but not a bullet- a stake allows corrupting air into the bodily glue of a vampire (although the silver bullet myth is untouched), why vampires can metamorphose into bats or wolves- they can't, why some vampires turn to dust at death- their already long-dead bodies instantly decompose while living vampires' bodies don't, why mirrors repel them- psychological traumas, and a number of others....a mark of any enduring work of art is its continued, and renewable, relevance through time. A half a century on Neville himself emerges as another sort of figure of the Right- not as the Van Helsing-like McCarthy, but the solipsistic, indolent corporate fat cats and paranoid, self-pitying Goddists of the Bush era. Like the modern Right believes itself to be, he is besieged in a redoubt, fending off the mindless drones of blood and hedonism (the harlot vampires \`posing like lewd puppets in the night'), even as he is anachronized. He joys in small victories. He loses himself in an idealized past, fortifies himself with the remnants of a lost glory (Classical music), lashes out at his enemies with no regard to differences, and that some of them are far more like him than he admits, and loses himself in fantasies of violence and sex, not unlike the Timothy McVeigh crowd.Many questions remain at tale's end: Why did the New Breed have to wait so long to come and get Neville? Was Neville really the last man on earth, or just in LA, or his part of LA? Why were the dead and living vampires so dumb- even Neville queries why they didn't simply set his house on fire?We'll never know, and why should we? Have we been enlightened, entertained? Yes. That's all that a work of art need do. Too many modern writers go overboard with masturbatory detail, thinking that good writing consists of the curlicues of minutia, squared! The idea being that detailed boredom is better than plain old boredom. My wife has complained of passages in the novel Cold Mountain where the author, Charles Frazier, spends pages describing the details of Civil War weaponry, yet his characters are utter stereotypes. He doesn't get it. Matheson did in I Am Legend. There are gaps in the science of I Am Legend- they were apparent in 1954, and some of the science is even more manifestly dated now. But, it's still plausible, if not as real science fiction, certainly as fantasy, and truly as allegory, and the book's real raison d'etr&eacute;. Yet, a work can be wholly fantastical and succeed if its tale grips and its characters connect. Plausibility gives way to the motive- in both senses of what drives the tale and what the style accomplishes in doing so.That all said, I have no hesitation claiming that I Am Legend is easily one of the ten best novels I have ever read- right up there with Mark Twain's The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn, Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, or The Whale, Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, and a few arguments over a tale or two from William Kennedy and some others.And yet, somehow, I am still drawn to the Vincent Price interpretation of the Robert Neville character (called Robert Morgan in The Last Man On Earth), and my sonnet Vincent Price In The Drapery Folds, for that is where our deepest terrors lie- in the mundane, in the human tendency to see a curtain rustle and expect some ghost or nosferatu to be its cause, rather than a stray breeze. This is why \`the divine chaotics of wish and snowflake' is so essential to science fiction and horror. It is the within, admixed with the without, however briefly (for snowflakes are amongst the most ephemeral things in the macro-world), where horror spawns. Matheson knew it, and I Am Legend is a perfect snowflake, whose beautiful fears are forever frozen in words."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I originally bought this book well in advance of the movie version (staring Will Smith) release, but never got around to reading it (it got buried in my ever growing mountain of books to read). Needless to say, I saw the movie and heard the opinion of many, many, many people with regards to its flaws (mainly dealing with deviation from the source material). I admit I enjoyed the movie and I've also seen the 1971 version with Charleton Heston, so I have always been rather puzzled about the avid dislike some people seem to hold for the movie versions of this book. Having finally sat down yesterday and read through it, I can now honestly say I see why. I'm not about to jump on the bandwagon, but I can see why. For me, the movie version(s) are radically different stories, they diverge from the book on many points and frankly, I don't consider them the same story. The movie versions are built on the same bones...but they do NOT tell the same story and so (speaking for myself here), I judge each on its own merits (or lack thereof).That said...I absolutely LOVED this story (and yes, I say story, not novel). I Am Legend comes housed in a book that should be titles I Am Legend and Other Stores by Richard Matheson. I Am Legend takes up only the first 170 of the 317 pages in this \\"novel,\\" the rest consists of nine short stories of varying genre and which vary greatly in how enjoyable I found them. I was surprised to note I recognize several of them as also having been made into movies in their own right (Masters of Horror, Trilogy of Terror, Creep Show, Etc.)...if you read them you're likely to recognize them (if you are also a fan of these programs/movies).Of the title story alone, I was quite thrilled to read it at long last and am rather angry with myself that I kept putting it off as it's one of the best in this genre I've read in a good, long time! I love that Robert Neville is a \\"real\\" person...he is something of an everyman, he could be anybody (though I do admit that I have trouble picturing him as anyone but Will Smith since I saw the movie recently, much less as a blond haired Californian). He's an average working man with an average life prior to the \\"plague\\" that wipes out nearly the entire human race as we know it. Matheson quite deftly weaves a believable premise of contagion based on chemical (or other) warfare in some vague reference to \\"conflict\\" and \\"war\\" that eerily mirrors recent conflicts around the globe (9/11 included).Faced with utter loneliness (being, he believes, the last man on earth), nightly taunting by the vampires, and unquenched sexual drives, Neville skirts madness (and sometimes succumbs to it utterly), drinking and smoking too much while trying to live as normal a life as he can. As the book progresses, Neville begins putting his time to good use, going to the library and begins researching the how and why behind the vampire \\"infection,\\" and he struggles through it (as any normal man or woman would)...he's not a genius, he holds no special degrees or knowledge...he must come to his understanding as we all might, with a lot of hard work, a few thrown books and a lot of frustration. Neville also takes time to ferret out the truth to his theories and unflinchingly applies the knowledge he acquires slowly learning more and more and becoming quite an accomplished vampire killer. It is fascinating to \\"watch\\" as the story progresses his struggles with core issues; humanity, loneliness, human nature, sexuality (or the absence of it), and more.I love that the details are given slowly, that we learn the scientific (or other) basis for the vampire mythos, that we discover Neville's past in bits and pieces (flash-backs) and are just as haunted by the nightly taunting of the vampires as he is. There is a quiet desperation to Neville's story and one can come to fully understand the burden he bears and how he tries to deal with what has happened...and just when you think you understand...when you side with him and believe that any one of us might do the same things given this circumstances...Matheson turns the story on it's ear and quite successfully pulls the rug right out from under us, turning Neville from a rugged, survivor into something else altogether! What a wonderful ending, so much starker and real than either of the movie versions I've seen gave. I was utterly shocked when I read the last few paragraphs...and completely satisfied. I Am Legend is a classic for a reason, it's a great story AND it really leaves you thinking about the entire set of circumstances when it's all said and done. Wonderful, I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The story 'I AM LEGEND' is a must for any vampire library and is the story used to make the film, 'The Last Man On Earth'. It is dark, tragic and enjoyable to read. Robert Neville is as close to a real person that a fictional character can get, a person trapped between the logic of his mind and the new dark age that has fallen outside his house, a new age of vampires. This story ALONE is a great reason for buying this book, but wait, there's more. 10 other stories within its covers will delight and entertain you. In fact, as most of them have been on TV(or the big screen) in one form or the other, they already have.Richard Matheson is one of the major sources for many horror stories dealing with the undead, having influenced such authors as Stephen King and 'I AM LEGEND' is one of the many books that inspired the creation of 'Vampire: The Masquerade'.Even the cover of the book I have, is cool, good artwork, so why not buy it?"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I admit that I picked this book up after seeing the Will Smith movie of the same name. I thought the movie was fairly good and so, I thought, the book must be great. But this book is by far the exception to the \`book is always better than the movie' rule.The main character, the last man on earth, is incredibly flat. He's your stereotypical, aging white man that turns to alcohol to ease his troubles. He mourns his wife but spends most of his time brooding and drinking. A daughter/child is mentioned early in the novella but then never again.The thing that endeared me most to the movie was the dog, Sam. It gave Will Smith's character depth and an excuse for dialogue. There is no dog in this book. There is no dialogue.The ending is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny. I would love to enlighten you all and save you the pain but I don't want to be a \`spoiler'.Perhaps the worst part of this \`book' is that it's actually only about 150 pages. The rest of the book is filler of other short stories. Fine. Except nowhere on the book (cover or back) does it say this. It felt extremely deceitful to not disclose that half the book was short stories. Also, there is no division between I Am Legend and the rest of the stories. After what was the last page of Legend, I turned it and kept reading because there had to be more. But that was it. No transition.This was one of the few times where I enjoyed the movie much more than the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I gave \\"I Am Legend\\" 3 stars because it's uniquely different from run of the mill vampire stuff. However, I was disappointed. It's a short story, barely long enough to promote the lead character, and much of the text seemed, to me anyway, unrelated to the storyline - filler if you will. Having suffered through that the story becomes interesting, and then, yes and then - it's over, as in finished, done with, fini. And I truly felt let down. Yes, I read the book but didn't like it. Forget the book - go see the movie; it's really good."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"For anyone that hasn't seen the film or read the book........the book is nothing like the film.......and the film is nothing like the book.. Normally, when a film is based on a book I love the book so much more. But not this time. I have to say that I'm liking the film more this time.The book is good, don't get me wrong. I was scared in parts. However, it's nothing like the film. If you're looking for similar, but better, read 'Salems Lot' by Stephen King.The only thing the book and the film have in common is that they both involve a man who is probably one of the last few survivors after a virus strikes the population.With both though, I'm left with lots of questions that aren't addressed and it's frustrating to be 'almost' at the point of knowing it all, but not quite having enough information. I read the book thinking that the unanswered questions from the film would be answered, but all it's done is given me more questions."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I didn't know it was a book of short stories!I Am Legend was too short for me~! Is that it??Half of the book was other short stories, I felt ripped off!I thought I am Legend was too simple, vampires,, snore!I will not see the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's sad that they had to put Will Smith on the cover in order to generate interest. I'm pretty sure that the movie remake will be much different than this book. There will probably be more action and plot holes will be filled and expanded. And Smith doesn't seem like he could portray the same tortured soul from the book.Anyway, on with the book review - after all the hype I expected something better. This story has influenced a lot of authors and filmmakers so I wanted to like it. And Matheson is the guy who wrote Stir of Echoes which is one of my favorite movies. But I didn't enjoy reading this.The plot seemed to be lacking something and there were not really any characters I could relate to except maybe the dog. In fact, I might have enjoyed this better if it were from the dog's point of view rather than a misogynist drunk who somehow miraculously teaches himself bacteriology and solves the riddle of the plague all by himself."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book, which is sadly short, is easily the second greatest vampire story written, behind Dracula of course.Once i started reading I Am Legend i just could not put it down and finished it in one long sitting. It starts off superb and doesnt let up one bit. The ending also is beautiful, smart, and tragic. Truly original.And what many people arent mentioning is that I Am Legend only takes up half of this book. The second half is a compilation of Matheson's short stories and are extremely entertaining also.Buy this book. Now!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I think fiction has to follow rules it creates. Take example the last sentence at the end of the paragraph at the back of the book.\\"How long can one man survive in a world of vampires?\\"Twist this around...\\"How long can vampires survive in a world of one man?\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Though the first half of this book was very good, I was definitely disappointed that only the first half of the book was actually 'I Am Legend'. There wasn't anything indicating that the book was written this way. It took me a while to realize that the last half had nothing to do with the first half because I haven't seen the movie yet. I just kept thinking \\"what is going on?\\" I also was quite disappointed in the short stories at the end too and don't think they should have been there."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Kind of a combination of Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula. I was so not ready for the ending I kept turning the page, like what happened. It just ends, that's it? I didn't like it at all, although I will say at times I found it disturbing. Short story material, not a novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"For those who does not bother about editions, covers, special introductions, and so, I think this is definitely a great chance to buy a great book.However, it is still a bit small, which means small letters but handy on the other side.Nice purchase"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a great book, and I cannot stress this enough, NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE! You can read/see one without the other and not have anything ruined for you. I really liked this novel, the spin on vampires. Its reminiscent of a post-apoctalyptic zombie novel (one of my fav genres) and overall a great story. 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The book contains the 1954 novella, I Am Legend, and ten superb short stories. It cannot be emphasized enough that Richard Matheson literally wrote the book on the modern horror genre.The romp through vampires, politics and war in I Am Legend will draw many new readers - due to the recent runaway smash movie with the same title - but the terror of The Near Departed and the giggling secret weapons of the military, Witch War, are brilliant. The raw hate, survival and murder in Prey must be read several times to fully appreciate Matheson's art of taking the reader on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.Few books can truly be pointed to as groundbreaking works of art. This is one of a mere handful."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book after seeing the new movie, and as is the usual case, the two vary quite a bit. The book is a very good read, though the written \\"I Am Legend\\" is surprisingly short (less than 200 pp.). The book also contains several other short stories by the author, of which I've read a few, but not all. The namesake story has the protagonist as a much simpler character than was presented in the movie, without much in the way of scientific background. However, he does attempt to sort out the story behind the plague that has turned all others in the world into essentially vampires. The movie touched on the madness of being alone in the world, but the book goes further into showing how hopeless one person can become and how their perspectives in life will change. The ending is quite different from that presented in the movie and I feel gives a better and more ironic explanation for why the story is titled the way it is. I highly recommend the read. As it is short, it is perfect for long plane rides or that relaxing weekend."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"THe book is great, but what they don't tell you is that this book is one of short stories and a novella. The novella is \\"I am Legend\\" which is about 177 pages. The rest of the book is short stories; some good, most only adequate. \\"I am Legend\\" is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book because I had seen the movie and heard it wasn't quite the same as the book.Being an avid reader, I know that most books don't make it to the screen without 'hollywood' adjustments (Harry Potter, etc).I was pleasantly surprised at the main story (I Am Legend). The story/ending wasn't at all like the movie (this was a good thing). The movie should've kept to the book (rumor has it Will Smith tried to get the studios to but they wanted a more happy \\"hollywood\\" ending).I've started reading the other mini-stories and some of them are really creepy & for the time period in which they were written; well ahead of their time.I would recommend this to others but to be warned at times; the book can be a bit slow. But definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's been made into many movies - here in its original form, and a great concept that is revealed at the end."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is one of the best short books I've read. This version has several short stories by the author in the back, which are well-written."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"first, let me say i had this book before i even knew they were making a movie out of it.second, there is no way the movie will ever live up to this book. ever.yes, it's about vampires. but not really. it's more kind of a psychological study about what someone might go thru if they were suddenly the absolute last person on earth (or at least their part of the earth). it has some very dark moments in it.i really don't want to give anything away, but i really, really loved the scientific analysis of vampirism.the main character--the last man on an earth of vampires--does have his freak outs. but he also resolves to keep on living and figure out how to solve the problem of vampires. it is a strangely hopeful position to take, because why bother if you are the last person alive? it really just embodies the human desire to keep living and keep exisiting. i find that desire to be sometimes beautiful and sometimes terrible.the entire novella (i'll get to that bit later) is hopeful. hopeful that he'll suceed. hopeful that he'll outlive the vampires. hopeful that somehow he will find another human being. but then the end just crushes you. and then stomps on your bleeding body. and then throws you over a cliff. truly, it was one of the most heartbreaking endings i have ever read.so. the novella was really great. this edition ofI Am Legendalso included several of his short stories, which were not so great. definitely could not follow \\"i am legend\\"."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Wow. The style of this book is probably its best aspect, perfectly attuned to the pace of the story, showing how a man deals with a Robinson Crusoe scenario, alebit one where his neighbors and friends are the undead trying to suck his blood. I would give it five stars but I didn't like the ending, not enough of a wrap-up."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I just finished reading I Am Legend and must say it was a disappointing read. Although it is a very short novel, I had to put it down a couple of times and come back to it later because it did not grab and keep my attention. I must say the treatment of loneliness and depression is quite well done but the rest of the plot and frankly the quality of writing is not what I expected. At least three or so times I noticed repetition of phrasing that seemed more like flawed writing than something done on purpose. Nagging questions come to mind while reading the book on the line of; why don't the vampires do this or why don't Neville do that? The ending evokes a lot of unsatisfied questions of \\"why\\" itself.I decided to buy the novel after I heard the new movie was based on the book. I researched the book superficially by searching on the open Internet for reviews and many of those mentioned how influential the story has been to some modern well know writers. I guess I expected a better written story and a more gripping plot. I suppose however the book just was not my taste and others might find it a wonderful read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The \\"I Am Legend\\" NOVELLA (160 pages) is GREAT... I, too, bought it in anticipation of the upcoming Will Smith movie.The ONLY problem that I have with this \\"BOOK\\" is that the book is NOT JUST the Vampiric mutants story \\"I am Legend\\" ...You get the I AM LEGEND novella followed by 10 other short stories after that. NOWHERE on either cover of the book is this explained to you. That is a HUGE LETDOWN!!!I was not aware when I had finished reading \\"I Am Legend\\" ... I kept waiting to see how these new tales would 'tie in somehow' since NOWHERE (except in the table of contents) is there any indication that there might be more than ONE story here.After reading the third short story, I began examining the book to try to determine 'for sure', if these new tales were indeed 'separate stories'... so the first thing I did is 'google' the ISBN number to get a description of the book and who would be 'more dependable' than Amazon....Welllll nowhere in any description of this book and it is EXACTLY the same book they have pictured here with the same ISBN number and all... NOWHERE does it tell you that you are buying a collection of short stories with the 'novel', as it is called.There is not even one blank page between the 'novel' and the short stories and since the book DOES END abruptly and without warning, I just kept reading waiting for the next thing to happen and all the while having questions building in my mind such as \\"what the heck does this have to do with what I have been reading?\\"I am seriously blushing here especially since I AM a seasoned reader but I am sorry there was no indication of what was going on here.... I don't feel ripped off since I did get other works by the author but I would have REALLLLLLY appreciated being able to savor the end of the story as it was without discovering after reading 30-40 more pages that I had already come to the conclusion!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Good writing style, but lousy ending, particularly when the book ends halfway and you are left with short tales that I, at first, thought were a continuation of the novel. While there are always vampires outside the hero's house, you only get one good vampire/hero encounter...The woman leader of the new society is bizarre to say the least and the only person the reader gets to meet from the new society. The story has much potential (I find myself building on the story), but the author lacked the ability to spin out a good ending."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend starts with a solid, if not overused and interesting premise. Nelville is the last man left on earth, or so he suspects, after vampires have taken over. If anything, that in itself adds a reason to read the book. It's really a rather formulaic book, pretty predictable at points but symbolic and poignant at others. And perhaps that's where the strengths end.I Am the Legend is just far too choppy, short and unable to flesh out into something bigger. Much potential, wasted on the second part of the book where the book starts to climax (and of course I won't spoil it). Nelville himself, his past, could have been used better emotionally, truly characterizing him as the sole survivor. Rather, the novel uses his rage has a device to characterize him - lacking the depth needed to sway readers.I am the Legend, is with no regard a bad book, but by the standards of literary masterpieces, it has not a good book. It is a popular, enjoyable, and straight forward easy book to see, maybe, like the brainless shows we seem to enjoy on TV. Far too simple, far too little, far too less is in I Am a Legend to win it the literary strength it needs to succeed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My sister and I recently did a literary quid pro quo - she read my favorite novel, Marilynne Robinson's Housekeeping, and I read one of her favorites - I Am Legend. Not being much of a horror fan and having already seen several films based on the story (which sis assures me are all totally off the mark), I'll admit I was a bit leery going in.But I've come to discover that this is so much more than a spooky tale of vampires/zombies. Matheson wrote this short novel in the midst of the Cold War and during the height of McCarthyism. In addition to the constant (albeit largely imagined) threat of communism, the status quo was beginning to be challenged by the burgeoning civil rights and feminist movements. The middle class suburban white male was feeling threatened and, in many ways, this book reads like a paranoid redneck's worst nightmare. After reading it, I'm extremely surprised that two of the most well-known film adaptations/interpretations (I Am Legend and Night of the Living Dead) starred African-American actors. That right there suggests to me that the filmmakers missed the point entirely.Robert Neville is the lone survivor of some sort of plague that has infected every other human on Earth. Some of the plague victims are living, some are un-dead, but they all come out at night to quench their thirst for human blood. During the day Neville roams the suburban California landscape dispatching the vampires as they sleep with hand carved wooden stakes. Every night, he barricades himself in his home while they cluster outside pounding on the walls and moaning his name. Typical horror story, right?But look a bit closer.Spread of the plague has been hastened by the fall-out from some vaguely referenced nuclear explosion(s). At one point, Neville himself ponders the demonization of the vampire race, likening them to minorities who \\"...are loathed because they are feared,\\" before mocking his own compassion toward them with, \\"Sure, sure...but you wouldn't want your sister to marry one.\\" He holds a particular hostility toward the women, mainly because he lusts for them, and his neighbor, Ben Cortman, the vampire who calls out to him by name, is a Jew. In a particularly creepy scenario near the end of the story, he describes the enjoyment he gets from hunting for the well-hidden Cortman each day. Not so funny, when you consider this was written less than ten years after the fall of the Third Reich. This is a man who spends his entire existence trying, literally, to beat back the alien hordes from his doorstep. Naturally, his battle is a futile one.Robert Neville is a man clinging to his carefully preserved little world even as he realizes that his time has come and gone. The Earth has been overrun by \\"the other\\" and he is no longer in charge. He is now the minority...loathed because he is feared."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"this was so different from the movie that you can still respect the 2 as seperate but equal. i really enjoyed all teh short stoires and had a good time readign this book, it was hard to put down"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"There is something must say before I say anything else about this book. Unfortunately I have been jaded by the fact that I bought and watched the DVD long before picking up this book. The story I am legend in and of itself is neither spectacular nor a failure. Regrettably, the story is unexceptional. Having seen the movie first, I was surprised to find that the story line from the book is nearly entirely different from the movie viewing experiences. This can't be blamed on Mr. Matheson though. The production company and writers had their share in that scandal. Had I read the book first, and seen the movie later, Perhaps I'd have enjoyed the book considerably more.As noted by others. The story I am legend is particularly short (Being only about sixty percent of the book), the rest being a compilation of short stories. These range from brilliant to downright foolish to just plain strange. All in all, I don't particularly feel that the short stories added any reading value to the book for no reason more than the fact that so many of them fail to deliver any sort of sensible plot.Overall, as I've stated earlier. I must rate the book no better than \\"average\\".One piece of advice to those of you who may be reading this, if you are interested in this book, and have not seen the movie. I highly recommend reading this BEFORE seeing the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I don't typically read vampire novels, but when a friend tossed I Am Legend my way I gave it a shot. If this is 'one of the best vampire novels out there,' then I will never read another one. The premise of the story is looking at vampires from a biological perspective, and the author never substantively departs from that single idea. Even then, Matheson fails to make his vampires original in any sense. The book's action is weak, emotional appeals are less than compelling, and there is virtually no horror. Skip this one."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I thought this was a great story, well laid out with a good pace. There weren't too many lulls or too much action. I can't compare to the movie because I haven't seen it. The only disappointing thing about this book is that the I Am Legend story only takes up the first half, so just when you think things are getting exciting, the story ends! The rest of the book is filled with short stories by the author that have nothing to do with I Am Legend."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book was a real letdown. I did enjoy the story but when I came to page 159 I was shocked to see that it ended. I think a lot more of the story could have been told. I looked over the entire paperback to see where it stated that it was a book of short stories. Nowhere does it state that. Even the narrative on the back cover only talks about the \\"I am Legend\\" story. I've been robbed!!!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"As usual Matheson creates a story that was completely original for it's time. I've seen people say he copied other stories like Return of the Living Dead,,etc. etc. But they fail to realize that this story was written in 1958. There was nothing like it at the time. It's not so much of a vampire story as it is a story of humanity and loneliness. The main character is the only survivor of a plague that turns people into vampires. He's the only human left and he has to find ways of surviving while not going to far from his Shelter-Like home. The story also proposes some interesting viewpoints on how the vampires were started.It's not really scary at all but haunting in that you feel a sense of doom for the main character. Really, How long can someone survive in an enviroment like that completely alone.I gave it three stars because the story was actually written in the future from the original copywright,, 1976. Matheson didn't really attempt to forecast any changes in the world between 1958 and 1976. He pretty much assumed everything would be the same including cars being started with a ignition button and black people still being called Negroes.:) Other than that it is a great and quick (178 pgs.) Novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is coming to movie theaters on December 14th, 2007, starring Will Smith. So before the movie comes out, you should really listen to the talented Robertson Dean narrating this novella. Legend is about the last man on earth and his life. You see everyone else has become a vampire-like being. Dean brings this novella of Richard Matheson alive.Those unfamiliar with Matheson's work, he wrote the novels The Incredible Shrinking Man and Bid Time Return (which became the film Somewhere in Time) and many short stories. He also scripted many episodes of the Classic TV show The Twilight Zone and such films as Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and many of Roger Corman's horror films (The Raven (1963), The Comedy of Terrors (1964), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), and The House of Usher (1960)).This fearful audio volume is chock-full of horror stories as well as Legend. Matheson wrote horror long before Stephen King and Clive Barker. The stories written more than 50 years ago, however they seem as good as if they were written today. Matheson prayed on your fears and the human condition and still had you interested. It is that way on audio as wellDean and noted audio actor/director Yuri Rasovsky take turns narrating stories in the volume. They do an amazing job, but some audio tales in this collection are hit and miss. Some lack the audio punch that it deservesNote Blackstone audio always does the best unabridged audio work in the country these days.

It is obviously influential on how vampires and zombies have been depicted in other books, tv shows and movies.GREAT novel (novella? it was pretty short).

Its a classic.The movie is nothing like the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"...at least based on scripts I've seen, the trailers, and the previous film versions (Charlton Heston in The Omega Man and Vincent Price in The Last Man on Earth.) Both took the story and made the vampires into, well, something else--diseased zombies. It LOOKS like the new Will Smith movie does the same, but we'll see.Anyway, the most important aspect of this book hasn't been touched on by the dozen or so reviews I've read here, so I thought I'd comment. That aspect is the idea of how we define the \\"other.\\" The hatred Robert Neville holds for the vampire population and how we \\"root\\" for him because he's \\"like us\\" is remarkable, and turned on its head by the end of the novel.Speaking of the end--if the movie ends like the early drafts of the script, I, for one, will be sorely disappointed. I won't comment further (to give it away) but the \\"new\\" ending doesn't allow Neville to come to the realization in the title..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I make it a habbit not to read too much into the reviews as too many times plots are ruined and the whole story is given away. I'm glad I didn't read the editorial review on this book here on Amazon as it gives just about everything away!!! If you haven't read it, good, don't! If you have, well it's still a great story eventhough the review blew the ending for you.Just to clear things up, this book has around 10 stories in it. The title \\"I am legend\\" is the first story in this book and the longest.I am Legend is a great story. Matheson's style of writing is a bit jagged but it adds tremendously to the atmosphere. I thought about this story many days after I read it. It's the kind of story that will kick you in the head.Do your self a favor and pick it up, it's a quick read and worth it.So far I've read several of the other shorts in the book and they are ok. Sort of Twilight Zone-ish, nothing that really stood out so far. These are just quick little reads at bed time.All the pages following the title story could have been blank for all I care. I am Legend was that good."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The title says it all. The last days of the last man on Earth. Richard Matheson paints a pretty grim World, and of the conflicts of Robert Neville as he struggles to cope with the loss of his wife and child and of the rest of the known world. Matheson expertly puts us in Neville's position and the sadness and futily at times in overwelming. A superb testament to the writing of one of the best writers of the 20th century. Buy it...buy it today."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In 1976, the pandemic plague devastated the earth. Most people died while those who survived were biologically altered into nocturnal blood drinking in-humans. That is everyone except for one remaining purebred; Robert Neville never changed as he apparently was immune to the plague. He is the last surviving Homo sapiens, but the converted see him as being different as the monster tied to the dead legendary past who must die. He endures his ordeal through alcohol, but his loneliness is driving him insane as each night he considers giving up until he meets his first non vampire friend since the disease, a dog fearful of him.This book actually contains a reprint of the 1954 classic novella I AM LEGEND in conjunction with an upcoming movie (note that Vincent Price starred in the 1960s film The Last Man on Earth based on this tale) and ten short stories that are entertaining and well written, but feel like padding to almost double the size of the book. Readers will understand why some of the great horror writers like Stephen King consider this novella one of the best ever as it crosses science fiction with horror yet holds up well because the bottom line is this is a character study of the human need for companionship as well as a Frankenstein like question as to just who is the monster?Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Vampires are usually associated with supernatural or gothic fiction. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; was the first to go against this trend. In this novel Richard Matheson depicts vampirism as a disease and offers explanations for its symptoms.The main character is Robert Neville. He is the only normal man (from our point of view) left in the world, after a plague has turned everyone else into vampires. He spends his days growing garlic, making stakes, and killing every vampire he can find. At night he is a prisoner in his own home. He drinks himself into a stupor. He listens to classical music, which he plays to drown out the screaming vampires who gather outside his house.This is a good story because it delves into the mental anguish of isolation and the strength of human will. Even though the hero can never hope for a normal life he is determined to survive.&quot;I Am Legend&quot; has been filmed twice. Ten years earlier I saw the film &quot;The Omega Man&quot;. If you really liked the novel you should probably avoid this film, as it bears only a slight resemblence to the book's storyline. For one thing, there aren't any vampires!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I liked this ground breaking vampire novel. I also liked the artwork on this latest edition. But I just wanted the novel by itself!The other stories are good but I hated them being in the book! This should not be a short story collection. I am nit picking but I didn't want that stuff in this book.It's weird to think of the characters in this book living in 1950's Los Angeles County. They even name actual streets that still exist! Like in places like Compton and Inglewood. Which are really bad gangland areas. They have some nice areas there, yes, but they are pretty ghetto these days. Hard to believe they were once nice suburbs. Before the REAL vampires and bloodsuckers moved in. The gangs. And what does one of those gangs called themselves? The Bloods! Ha! Unreal.Matheson was right that violent hordes of bloodthirsty monsters were invading the suburbs of the once beautiful Los Angeles County. More than he realized. Is the book an allegory for what happened to this once decent area? Are the vampires symbols for the invading hordes of lowlife thugs and degenerates who were invading and destroying a good place? And all the law abiding, good citizens of the area fled or came to violent ends?Food for thought to be sure! Or it could just be a decent vampire story. Read the book, enjoy it, and maybe take a drive through the L.A. neighborhoods mentioned in the book. But stay out at night. That's when the vampires come out."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I hesitated to read this book because of seeing the movie first years ago, but after reading so many reviews that said the book was so different that it wouldn't spoil it, I went ahead and bought it. WOW!! This book was great!I don't want to give too much away, but the title of the book should in noway mislead you into thinking that a \\"hero\\" will emerge, be self sacrificing, and put the evil in its \\"proper place.\\" Will Smith is no where to be found among the pages, this Robert Neville is not the Hollywood stereotype hero. He is flawed, a little crazy at times, and can even be slightly annoying. In all honesty the only reason you root for him is because it would seem he is the last of our kind.I am so glad I went ahead and read this, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Decided to read this book after watching the trailer for the movie. I couldn't put the book down. The power of this book is that the main character development is fantastic and then the author completely shocks you with a plot change. Just when you think you know what's going on, the author surprises you. Loved the book. Just wished it was longer."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A very good read. Full of suspense, well written. can't wait to watch the movie. Just a warning to buyers-the book it self is 312 pages....I am legend is only 160 pages. The rest of the book are short stories. The short story prey is quite chilling and an excellent read. I would have given this book 5 stars, it was truly amazing, but being so short and the short stories confused me i rated it at 4."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"There are allot of reviews out there toting Richard Matheson as the father of the vampire story but to be honest I only knew of him because of the upcoming film version of I Am Legend. I'm not a \\"vampire\\" enthusist by any stretch of the imagination and this is probably why I knew very little about I Am Legend.The story centers around Robert Neville, a normal \\"every day\\" man who travels to work with his neighbor each day. One day, there is a virus outbreak that converts everyone in the world but him into crazed, flesh seeking monsters that only come out at night. Much like the Resident Evil stories, the dead comeback, reanimated by the virus until either subjected to sunlight, effectively killing the virus or being stabbed with a stake, exposing the virus to oxygen.Robert embarks on a mission to understand the \\"vampire\\" virus only to rule out vampires completely in favor of a much more scientific understanding of the disease (thank god).In the novel, he is not a Military LT or genius scientist hellbent on curing the disease but rather a very lonely man, desperately missing his wife spending his time studying about the horrible nightmares that attack his home each night. He spends his days scouring for food, information, disposing of bodies in a fire and trying to better understand what has happened to the world, theorizing on his immunity.His final undoing is by that of a woman he meets and I'll leave it at that so as not to give any spoilers away.I saw the movie this weekend and was greatly impressed by it (nix the crappy cgi) and I expected them to take liberties over the book but was surprised to see that other than Robert Neville and the virus everything else was pretty much created for the film or greatly embellished from certian aspects of the book. So, if you liked the movie then read the book for a much different experience with a really great twist.On a side note, there are several other short stories included here one in particular about a little statue that comes to life I found particularlly fun to read. I mention this because I thought the entire book was I Am Legend and when I got the the afore mentioned story I quickly became confused thinking it was another chapter to I Am Legend. :)- Dan."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The absolute coolest vampire concept ever! My friend recommend I read telling me how the ending left him speechless, and now having read it myself I can definately say it is the best ending of any book I've ever read. The concept is that Nevelle is the last man alive due to a virus that changed everyone else into vampires. The book starts with him making repairs to the outside of his, which he does every day due the damage the vampires do trying to get in at night. His house has become his fort, the only thing that protects him each night from them. He can't stray too far away during the day cause he needs to have enough time to get home and seal himself up at night, which removes any hope of him finding any survivors beyond a certain radius. By day he wonders out for supplies when he needs them and reinforces his house, and by night he locks himself in and tries to ignore the vampires outside trying to get him to come out. The book is mostly about this one remaining man who's all alone, researching and trying to figure out what the virus is and how it works. At the end he is in a situation which explains the title of the book. The book is very short, I was disappointed when I Am Legend ended after only 100+ pages with the rest being short stories. But for such a short story it is still incredibly powerful and intresting, and the other short stories are worth a read too.... Don't let the movie ruin it for you, while it follows the same concept as the book it leaves out all the things that make the book so good. They should be punished for changing the ending to the way they did.... BOO Hollywood...... LATE"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I decided to read \\"I am Legend\\" before I saw the new movie with Will Smith, opening on Friday. On the back cover, we read Stephen King and Brian Lumley crediting author Richard Matheson with being a profound influence on their own work. After reading the book, I can see why. Modern horror writers, as well as makers of the post-apocalyptic horror film, are deeply in Matheson's debt.\\"I am Legend\\" concerns Robert Neville, the last man on earth living in a world of vampires. We follow Neville as he struggles through his daily survival routine, which involves him looking for supplies and getting home before dark, when the vampires come and surround his house. Among other things, Neville must gather garlic from his greenhouse to put around his house at least twice a week, keep the house boarded up, and make stakes to kill the vampires with during the day. In the end (and I won't reveal too much), Neville realizes that he may have a much bigger problem on his hand than the vampires.Despite what you may think, \\"I am Legend\\" is far more complex than the typical horror story. Neville struggles in his isolation to find a meaning in his life, and nearly goes crazy when the vampire women do things like lift up their dresses to get him to come out of the house at night. In addition, there's a bit of humor in the vampire character Ben Cortman, who perennially shouts \\"Come out, Neville!\\" Another interesting aspect to \\"I am Legend\\" is that of scientific discovery. Through intense reading and research, he finds that a germ, which he names \\"vampiris,\\" caused people to turn into vampires. The germ was spread by mutant insects and dust storms after an implied nuclear war.Besides \\"I am Legend,\\" which turns out to be a novella of about 170 pages, there are other short stories by the author included. One of the most memorable is \\"Prey,\\" about a cursed Zuni fetish doll attacking a woman in her apartment. The story was memorably brought to life in the movie \\"Trilogy of Terror,\\" and arguably inspired the \\"Chucky\\" movies and the whole \\"killer doll\\" genre. \\"Person to Person,\\" about a man who has a telephone ringing in his head every morning at 3:00 a.m. and finally decides to answer it, is quite memorable.If you're a horror fan, or even if you're not and just looking for a thrilling page-turner, you can't do much better than this."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a GREAT book. Mr. Matheson really draws you into the bleak and terrifying idea of being the last \\"normal\\" person on earth. What a great writer!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book just based on reader's reviews and found it to be a good read. It has more than just I am Legend within it and found it to be a lot more than I had bargained for!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\", the title work of this anthology, is a classic vampire novel and very well written. I enjoyed it and would give it 4 or maybe 5 stars.My problem with this collection though is that every other story in the book is terrible. I would give all of them 1 star. I literally had to make myself read some of them. I don't know if they were included as filler or if the author was just using the first story as a hook to get people to read his other stuff, or what the deal is, but they don't even read like they're by the same personThe only thing I can think is either they are very early work or something he threw together just to run up the page count. I say all this to tell you if you can find \\"I Am Legend\\" by itself for cheaper than this version is listed for, get that instead. There is nothing other than that story worth spending your time on hereTo sum up: Definately read I Am Legend, just read it by itself."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was stunned to learn that this story is actually a short novella, and even more stunned that Richard Matheson was able to pack so much into so few pages.The story of a last man standing in a world radically altered by a virus that turns the world's population into a human/vampire species, is singularly focused through the eyes of our hero, Robert Neville, and written with a focus that makes this tale very powerful.Matheson draws the reader into Robert Neville's plight quickly, and then effortlessly begins to build the tension of psychological torture he feels during his days and nights alone, trapped within his house and his thoughts. The secondary horror is trying to stay a step a head of a nightly group of Vampires looking to, of course, drink his blood. The skill of Matheson forces the reader into this hell of loneliness and really sells this horror from all angles. From resisting his desires, to controlling his anger, to repressing his memory and longing for the world before the virus; the mental pain Robert Neville experiences in a society where he doesn't belong is stunningly told.An interesting twist is how Matheson uses the Vampire legend to feed into our beliefs and superstitions, and then tears those beliefs down by introducing scientific explanations to our understanding of Vampires and our role in society. Why does garlic repulse Vampires? Why is blood important to Vampires? What is the significance of the cross? By examining these questions, and other things, Matheson makes these \\"monsters\\" much more human and sympathetic, leaving us wondering: Who are the monsters and who are the victims?The ending is superb and shocking. What a terrific book..As a bonus, the book has 10 additional short stories that are well worth reading. I had to laugh when I read \\"Prey\\" because I had no idea that the horrible \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" film staring Karen Black was based on his story. Horrible film but good story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The classic vampire storyline has a tried and true formula: a single vampire is slaying person after person; carefully choosing his victims. This storyline then revolves around the hero's pursuit of capturing and defeating the vampire. Likewise, there's a classic formula for George Romero style zombies - zombies have overrun the world like a plague and survivors must fight to survive. \\"I Am Legend\\" (the novella contained within this book) combines the two plots.In the story, there is a lone survivor of a vampire plague. We follow his fight to survive and combat the vampires that everyone else he encounters has become. The story is not focused primarily on the protagonists physical fight with the vampires but instead looks at his emotional state - how he handles being the lone survivor, having lost everyone he cares about. I thought Matheson's writing and development of this was excellent. The hero is well-developed and comes off as a realistic portrait of the emotions that one would go through in such extreme conditions.All in all, I really enjoyed \\"I Am Legend\\" - and the ending did not disappoint.In addition to the novella \\"I Am Legend\\", included in this printing are a number of short stories. Most of these pale in comparison to the title novella. The majority of them come off as plots where Matheson came up with an interesting ending or dilemma but never bothered to fill an entire plot out for the rest of the story. That is not to say that all of the other short stories are poor. I enjoyed \\"Person To Person\\" quite a bit. \\"Dance of the Dead\\" and \\"Witch War\\" were poor, in my opinion. Examples of Matheson coming up with a single idea but never writing a full story around it.All in all, \\"I Am Legend\\" is such an entertaining read that the mixed bag of other stories included is easy to ignore. I give this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book surprised me and intrigued me from the first page to the very last. You really feel like you are inside the head of the main character. I enjoyed the psychological aspects of the book as well as the overall feeling you get when you read it. It made me think more about human nature and I shall be reading it again. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I revisited this book I first read about 10 years ago upon hearing that they plan to make a movie of it for release this year (starring Will Smith). I Am Legend was also the inspiration for Last Man on Earth (Vincent Price) and Omega Man (Charleton Heston). Some say it inspired George Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" series, as well. I read the screenplay for this latest version and it's MUCH closer to Matheson's original vision than Omega Man. Can't wait!Even though it's a novella (140 pages or so) and not a novel, it's the quality of the story that draws you in and makes you feel Neville's pain, loneliness and despair. It does the most important thing a good story does in engaging the reader as one is constantly asking, \\"how would I behave in this situation?\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Being such an avid reader of \\"horror\\" and \\"suspense\\" stories I am pretty much open to reading anything that falls within the abovementioned categories. However, I usually distance myself from stories about, or centering around, vampires. Why? Well, it seems that more often than not vampire novels are usually cheesy, gothic melodramas that turn the character of the vampire from something sinister into something romantic. I'm not sure if they're all like that but in my experience that seems to be the case.However with \\"I Am Legend\\", Richard Matheson managed to take the formula of the vampire story and turn it into something different and enjoyable. The story centers around Robert Neville, the LAST man on an earth that is overrun by vampires. Now I don't know about you but the very idea of being the last human being on earth is a terrifying thought in and of itself. I think what I like most about \\"I Am Legend\\" is that it centers less on a guy killing vampires and more on a guy doing the best he can to live from day to day. Isolation, depression, happiness, desire and pretty much every other emotion that a human being can experience is touched upon in this book. You don't have to be a die hard horror fan to enjoy \\"I Am Legend\\", just someone who appreciates a great story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is very well written. The lead story I am Legend is a great tale that breaks down what could be the hard science of vampirism. The lead character is solid and his tale is a sad one, his existence made easier only by the rituals he performs daily. I think the tale is very realistic and it even touches on his basic needs as a mortal man. The other tales are also very good one of my favorites being the one with the phone ringing in the man's mind. I think anyone that is a sci-fi and/or horror fan would thoroughly enjoy it!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I AM LEGEND is one of the most important vampires stories written. A lot of what hollywood has done with both vampire and zombies come from this novella. Chuck Heston has done at least two movies based on it. The writing is crisp. The story movies at a pace not usually found in horror writing and the whole things wraps up neatly. If you like this kind of stuff then you need to read this.You need to read this before the movie comes out. Too good of a novella to not be read before the movie makes a mockery of the story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"As a little boy I remember watching \\"The Omega Man\\" through the crack of my bedroom door--bed-time was well past. It became my favorite horror film because it requires deep thinking and analysis of what the world--and your psyche--would be like when you are the last remaining \\"normal\\" human being. Movies based on books can be so far apart from the orignal story that it would seem that the name was highjacked only as a box-office draw. This book while not the same has all the darkness and developed ethos and pathos of \\"The Omega Man.\\" I would--and will--read this book several more times in my life. It so well written that I wish the \\"great\\" authors would write more books like this. If you are a horror and/or sci-fi fan, here is a great book for you. If you are a modern day pseudo-vampire, you will be disappointed for there is no romance related to the life of a vampire. The author makes it is clear that the dead are really dead, the tertiary beings--who are now the new species of homo-sapien--are deluded, and Neville is and always will be Legend. This book the perfect companion for a long airline flight."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Yes, this book is a timeless classic. Although written in 1954, it could have been written yesterday.

It tells the story of a man who believes he is the last human left on a planet ravaged by vampires. Methodical in his methods, every day he hunts vampires in his neighborhood and gathers supplies, constantly searching for signs of life and encountering people he used to know in his former life, before they were transformed into vampires.I am Legend is a story that has a conclusive ending but still leaves you wanting more, showing that Matheson is truly a master horror writer.In addition to I am Legend, the book also contains short stories that Matheson has written. While not nearly the same caliber as Legend, these stories are both entertaining and well written.This book is one of the finest horror collections I have read since HP Lovecraft, and in a genre filled with mediocre work it stands out as a shining example of how good horror can be."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Aside from drinking alone and hording dry goods, Robert Neville enjoys barricading his house and playing hide-and-go-stake with his neighbors. This life, which has been thrust upon him by a widespread plague, tests the limits of human loneliness and misery, and also human accomplishment and transcendence. Some of the most memorable scenes for me are those involving the dog that Neville finds. After surviving in a solitary existence for so long (being taunted by dead friends and tempted by cold, naked flesh), he all but gives up hope of ever seeing another living thing. A wandering mutt renews his hope in a hopeless situation, and gives him a better reason for living than existing out of habit. I Am Legend is less about monsters and cellular warfare than it is about the last man alive learning what truly defines humanity."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Aside from I Am Legend which after watching both movies based on this book I deem \\"The Omega Man\\" to follow the book much closer then \\"I am Legend.\\" Easy to read and enjoyable. Good story. Following I am Legend are 10 short stories. Strange and interesting. Some of the prose is rich and wordy, a huge difference in writing style then I am Legend. Weird and creepy are some. Was dissapointed at first that half way through the book the story ended then there was this \\"other stuff\\" however I have found the reading of these other short stories to be quite entertaining. Because of these I will pass this book to my daughter."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Though I am not a real fan of post apocalyptic fiction, this is truly a great novel. I am Legend should be on everyone's must read list. It is truly a master peice of story telling. Set in the mid 1970's Los Angles it is a story about the lone surviver of a plague hit world. You see how he adapts and searches for the truth when most people would have given up. He is not a scientist, or any exotic profession but a humble factory worker. The story is fantastic and well written, which great pace. That being said it is surely not a feel good book, it is rather depressing at time. But the story is fantastic and the main character is very easy to relate to. It is sometimes scary how easy it is to relate to the main characters and most readers will see a bit of themselves in him. I can not recommend this book any higher."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is where it all started. I Am Legend was the inspiration for George A. Romero's take on zombies. This book was actually first published in 1954, so it differs from the new movie. But I assure you, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read the original novel R Matheson wrote in the 1950's out of curiousity with the movie coming out. The book is absolutely amazing! Matheson expertly draws you into Richard Neville's desolute and bleak world where Neville is trying to exist where he has lost his family, knows he is the only human left, and nightly hears the vampires (one of whom is his former neighbor and friend) outside his home calling for him to come out.Matheson created a down to earth, every day kind of Joe with Neville. He isn't surving to be a hero, to \\"save\\" the world, or because he has made it a crusade to stop the vampires. Neville questions why should he go on? Faces his loneliness, fear and anger created out of the situation in a very real and relatable way.The turning point of the book is when Neville starts to do more than just keep going and starts to question the vampire disease. It is at this point that takes it from a standard Stephen King or Bram Stoker horror/sci-fi format to something more. Neville could be anyone and the \\"vampire\\" disease could be real.I was completely mesmorized with the writing, and finished it in less than 2 days. I couldn't put it down. No surprise that when I went to see the movie I was GREATLY disappointed. I love Will Smith and he does a wonderful job acting in this film with what he was given. But the story is completely changed in the movie. The novel had a wonderful, almost humerously ironic twist at the end, whereas the movie went for classic \\"happily ever after\\" ending. The character went for a relatable, every day kind of guy, to sterotypical hollywood \\"Hero\\".5 stars for the ORIGINAL novel, wait until video for the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I enjoy \\"end time(s)\\" stories and this is a particularly good one written in 1954 by Richard Matheson. I have seen the movie \\"I Am Legend\\" (2007) and an earlier movie version of Matheson's story, \\"The Omega Man\\", starring Charlton Heston (1971). I think I prefer the written word, in this case, to either of the Hollywood renditions.I think Will Smith and Charlton Heston deliver outstanding performances in their respective movies and some of the cinematography in \\"I Am Legend\\" is striking with views of a deserted Manhattan replete with empty cars and stores, vegetation growing in the once bustling streets and wildlife roaming free in what was once one of our world's greatest cities. Regardless, the world that Matheson conjured for me with words on paper is hard to best even with all the skills of modern film making.In this case, I don't know if my preference for the written word would be shared of others. Perhaps the problem for me is that the scope of these kinds of stories and their implications for the human species is so broad that even good writers, directors, and actors and modern cinematography have difficulty delivering the story with the same impact that words on a page, coupled with one's imagination, can produce.A counter example, for me, is Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films based on J.R. Tolkien's marvelous three-volume triology of the same name. In that case, I was delighted to find that the actors and Mr. Jackson were up to the task - and what a task it was.Endings to stories or movies can always be discussed and debated, of course, so my personal opinion is that the ending of Richard Matheson's story and the ending of \\"The Omega Man\\" are better than the ending of \\"I Am Legend\\".I would recommend this story (and both movies) to anyone who likes stories of survival set in end times or post-end times."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson is the godfather of modern vampire horror, so it's no surprise that he packs such a powerful punch in this novel. After all, it has spawned three mainstream movie remakes, and none of which compare to the novel. Signs of success.My only regret is that the copy I purchased had a red decal on it advertising the Will Smith movie, though when I bought it the display image shows the original cover. Bummer on that.Worth reading, worth remembering. Movies don't stack up to this masterpeice."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book was ahead of it's time. Great read, even though it's a short one."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I loved the beginning and the middle of the book. I thought Matheson had a really good treat wrapped up in a beautifully horrifying and action packed horror ride with the books' advanced and highly descriptive writing. He really did a good job forcing the reader to become Neville, not just sympathize and feel pity for the character. I really felt alone and isolated, I really felt like I was going insane, it really stimulated the imagination because everything was written in vivid detail. Near the end of the book is what sapped some enjoyment and sucked two stars from this review. The short stories made me feel as if I was cheated out of a potentially enthralling ending."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Maybe too late for most reading this review, but I would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie. The ending in the book is far more rewarding in my opinion. The movie could have been better if it held to more of the essence of the book I think. You should also know that \\"I Am Legend\\" is a novella and only constitutes about half of this book, the rest being other short stories. (\\"Witch War\\" one of the more twisted of these, with the Voodoo doll story from the 70's camp classic \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" being another)In any case, I read alot of apocalyptic/end of world stuff, and this is a must read for anyone into that kind of thing if for nothing else than a historical perspective on the evolution of the genre. I thought it was well written and ahead of its time. Its a little dated as you would expect, such as Robert's seeming devotion to keeping himself healthy by flossing and brushing... while chain smoking the whole time. :-)This book is worth the money I think, as long as the reader goes in expecting a vampire/zombie novel written in the contextual background of the 50's. It makes a statement about society and what constitutes 'normal', and once again should be considered a 'classic' of the end-of-world/plague genre."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend is a classic horror/sci-fi novel that has been adapted three times and each missed the greatness of the novel. The concepts and characterizations used in this book are rarely seen in other vampire books. Robert Neville must survive in a world taken over by vampires. During the day he hunts the monsters while at night resting and studying the origins and weaknesses of the vampire plague. It is tightly plotted and well thought out. The reader empathizes with Neville and he acts like a real person in horrible circumstances.The ending is an shocking twist that will make you rethink the entire book you just read. Matheson is a master of science fiction who is not read nearly enough."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This short, creepy vampire novel is such a seminal work it is impossible to count the number of books and movies it eventually inspired, including much of the current zombie mania. The book is about a lot of things, from existential dread to evolution itself. Matheson is the author Stephen King credits as his inspiration, and with good reason. If you haven't read \\"I Am Legend,\\" grab this, you will thank us. If you have, read it again, with the history in mind. This was an absolutely amazing piece of work from a master at the peak of his powers...and it holds up brilliantly."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The short novel \\"I am Legend\\" is much better than any of the three movies that were based off of the story. It gives an interesting spin on the Vampire legend.Matheson was the inspiration for a number of horror writers, and this short story shows why."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I'm usually not one of those people that reads the book AFTER seeing the movie, but this was the case for this particular story. I seen the Will Smith version and was somewhat confused as not much was explained correctly. It was all too 'extreme' with the way the movie portrays it.The book (or rather short story) is really a fascinating dive into the brain of the last survivor of a vampiric plague. It really makes you feel like that last person siting there, while reading in bed imagining Vampires bouncing bricks off your house. The different moods the main character goes through in his daily routine.Only thing I didn't like was the ending, but not for the reason that it ends, but that because after I flipped to the main page and continued reading 5-6 more pages before I realized I was reading ANOTHER short story. This cover makes no mention of 'short storys' it just finishes the 'I am legend' one and continues into another, and another, and another.So it left me confused if THAT was it? that was the ending? But then I got pissed off because I kept reading and was confused by other short stories. I can't say I really enjoyed the other ones tho, I bought this book for 'I am Legend'."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Solid collection, from the titular novella (very different from the movie, of course, and far more interesting) to the various short stories, all with a strong Twilight Zone vibe. Some of the shorts feel a little dated, especially From Shadowed Places' painful stereotypes, but Matheson is undeniably a top-notch storyteller."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It seems that I am not alone in giving editorial praise for this unique novel written by one of the most prolific and influential writers of not only the zombie genre but of science fiction and horror as well.Mr Matheson,instrumental in influencing such other'minor'writers along the way such as Rod Serling,Steven King,Anne Rice to name a few has perhaps written the defining literary vision of what others dealing in books and movies have relied upon to give life and form to the creatures that tend to lack them both,what we call the undead dead or simply the zombie.Its place in history is,I think, sealed forever in the minds of those who read it or of those who have ever seen \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" with Vincent Price who comes closer to the story of Robert Neville than Will Smith does in the later version.The story is one of survival and danger in a world gone mad.Vampirism touches upon the story with its garlic and crosses and adds some spice to the mystery of just what is the underlying nature of the enemy and how or if it can be killed, controlled or remedied.All in all it is depressing to think that despite ones best efforts to remain alive,eventually you find yourself so totally outnumbered that your will to live slowly dissipates and death seems a welcome relief.Such is the daily grind of Neville and the ending is for you to ponder upon.Some could even compare the theme to the rapid encroachment of the worlds population upon the U.S.A as a zombie like horde determined to take over and start over,their way.Some may see the viral attack scenario as a visonary warning.Either way you look at it or come up with your own interpretation the book serves as a paradigm of horror and the mindboggling confusion,shock and terrible times one would have merely surviving such a trauma to mankind.If you like this stuff than this book should be included in the canon of its type and read at least once.There are other stories included which range in their ability to register on one's spookiometer.Anyone remember Karen Black being chased around by that homicidal,overly dentitious,tribal doll with the Al Sharpton hairdo and a fancy for knives included on Trilogy of Terror,well Matheson wrote it.From Star Trek to the Twilight Zone this guy's done it all just check the credits.I'll stop here because you don't need my approval just look at what the other 500+ reviewers have to say and read it.Unfortunately, by todays standards I'm afraid it probably won't grab you or scare you that much but it was fun to read.Somewhat draggy in the middle to late scenes but keep going,it's worth it.Then compare movies and see who comes closer to what Matheson invisioned.You might be suprised.I gave it 4 stars for its impact on so many and its place in the history of what we now delight in calling the modern day world of the zombie. Just think, if George Romero had never read it we would never have had \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".They're coming to get you Barbara,look there's one now.They're coming for you too,they might be right behind you,don't turn around,keep reading my reviews with some garlic knots and chianti.That'll keep em away.Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you are interrested in this book, and you liked the film, buy it!!! The movie adaption totally slaughtered this book. From the Zombies to the Dog even his location in the U.S. It's deep and enlightened. My only issue is that the main story is only half of the book and the rest are short stories that don't even pale in comparison."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"While I was doing research for a thesis article, I came across this title and heard positive reviews for its writing content and its affect on literature after its publication. I was not disappointed when I read this book. I was not a huge fan of the film, but I really wanted to try the original story to see where the film came from. I think that it can sometimes be hard to sort through a book that is completely internal and contains essentially only one character, but the thoughts and trials, and behaviors reflected in the main character, were an enthralling exploration into the human mind. The end of the film and the end of the book are completely different. Personally, I think the film should have taken more from the book. The ending was perfect and wonderfully daunting. As far as the other stories within the text, some made me very scared, some just didn't do anything for me. I would absolutely recommend this book for anyone who love science fiction and influential literature."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Pros: Alright, so this guy can write. He can even write well, most of the time. Good. He can even write well and manage not to contradict established scientific facts. Great. He writes well, pens good action sequences, and creates witty dialog. Amazing! But is he among the best? Man, there are a few short stories in here that are nothing short of gold, just gold. He spares not the details nor the mood, and the characters are seductively real. He has sympathy for the feminine persona that is dynamic and believable. He sticks to the story as opposed to weird tangents that have nothing to do with anything. Yes, he's really really good.Cons: The \\"weakest\\" section of this collection is the novella \\"I am Legend.\\" Yes it is worthy of the title of classic as it does vampires right yet again (Twilight, this ain't) with a fresh perspective that is necessary when you reuse a classic image like the vampire. Its weak point is its main character. Perhaps realistically, he fumbles about quite a bit and has deep emotional problems that prevent him from taking care of things until crisis is inevitable. This is a little more distracting that I would've liked, for I was fascinated by the vampire plague the author masterfully constructs and with a flawed lens, there are some things that we never get around to. Fortunately, this isn't the only story with the undead in it.Summary: These days, we take horror survival techniques for granted, but in the 1950s when this was written, they'd only just passed the golden age of film horror. Goth subculture predecessors like the Munsters and the Addams Family hadn't hit the scene yet. Horror was presented by the likes of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Vincent Price. For its time, this survival-horror genre book, with accompanying short stories featuring so many psychic and apocalyptic visions, is a real rarity and genuinely good despite its age. It stands well above most of its contemporaries, such as Psycho by Robert Bloch or The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. And, not to be a spoiler, none of the movies do it credit - NONE."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson has never been lacking in imagination, and his signature novel I AM LEGEND is solid proof of that. The last living human on earth, Robert Neville, eeks out an existence in a post-apocalyptic world by day, then barricades himself in his fortified house by night while under attack by snarling vampires. If that's not a powerful, frightful premise for a grand spook tale, I don't know what is. Yet I AM LEGEND disappoints on several levels, often getting in its own way. Here's why.The story itself is confusing; the reader is informed there are infected humans who eventually become the Undead, and apparently the infected lay for months, then years, in a comatose state before becoming vampires. That the bacterial infection causing the deadly transformation/mutation accelerates faster in some people than others is believable--Neville's investigation as he tries to defeat the germ is not; it meanders, is uneven, confusing, with several subplots ultimately abandoned. I found myself continually going back in the story in an attempt to reconcile numerous inconsistencies (until I finally, in frustration, gave up). Matheson's ending is wholly ingenious, and very fitting, for such a dark, sad tale, yet overall it couldn't overcome how disappointed I was in the overall read.Then there's Matheson's style, which is often problematic: reliance on too many words and/or phrases (wish I had a nickel for every time I read \\"his throat moved\\"), combined with awkward, ineffective adverbs by the cartload. I've read several of Matheson's titles and it is what it is: the author just writes this way, and as a reader you either like it, or you don't. Alas, I don't.Extras. If you purchased the Orb edition of I AM LEGEND (the cover you see on this product page) you also get the extra treat of thumbing through several Richard Matheson short stories. Some of them I enjoyed, such as \\"Prey\\" (which I immediately recognized as the basis of a Seventies made-for-TV movie starring Karen Black) and \\"Person to Person\\"; some were absolutely silly, including \\"The Funeral\\" and \\"Dance of the Dead\\"; and some annoyed me to perdition, especially \\"Mad House.\\" Regardless, you will get a grand glimpse of the inner workings of Matheson's vast, albeit bizarre, imagination--imagination I appreciate, even if the writing fails to match.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really liked this book because it was interesting. When I first read this book I didn't understand it really. Then when I read this book again I understood it better. This book is hard to understand, and the book is more for adults and young adults because it has bad language in it. The book has one big novel which is I am legend and the rest of the book has scary stories in it. My favorite story is \\"Prey\\", because it has a lot of mystery and suspense in it. I would recommend this book to older readers because of the language."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I AM LEGEND is probably one of the finest books on vampires, those undead and oft nightmarish bloodsuckers of our own creations. However, Matheson presents his vampires as the ultimate human terror, that of a replacement species for our race. The story follows Robert Neville, the sole survivor of a biological holocaust that created night stalkers who has turned his home into a fortress in suburban Los Angeles. During the day he hunts sleeping vampires, staking them through the heart and barricades himself in his home at night while they mill about his yard like cadaverous door to door salesmen, calling his name while the females raise their dresses to tease and taunt him.Neville is a beautiful study into the deterioration of the human mind, aside from the loss of his wife and daughter that haunts him constantly, he begins to lose his own grip on humanity. For three years he has lived this life of solitude, but surrounded by human monsters who, incidentally, do not wear 18th century regalia, top hats nor do they moan about how much their unlife makes them do such terrible things. Matheson's vampires are a paradox of life, do not turn into bats, wolves or mists and haven't an ounce of pretense or angst found in the likes of Anne Rice's Eurotrash vampires or the found in Vampire: the Masquerade. Neville has forgotten the sound of his own voice and much of the common etiquette that we as humans all share.Matheson's masterful descriptions of the monotony of daily life mingled with the nagging question of why he just doesn't give himself up to them permeate the book. He constructs arguments for both sides, and deconstructs the myth of vampires by producing a wonderful scientific explanation that Neville learns over a period of a few years, literally by educating himself at the UCLA libraries. The reader is so aware of the protagonist's torment and the surging desire for companionship, human or otherwise, that when he finds the stray dog, we are captivated and pulled along as Neville spends weeks trying to coax the terrified animal into his home. And, without giving it away, the ending will knock the reader off of whatever he or she is sitting on.Some might see similarities to this and the Chuck Heston flick, the Omega Man, which was a pale adaptation of the novel into a typical 1970's dystopian film. For myself I churned through the pages with a certain eagerness that I never possessed while reading Rice's morose and trite endeavors in the world of undead. This book soars and packs emotion into fluid verse that never stalls or loses direction. I Am Legend fits beautifully with movies such as Blade and John Carpenter's Vampires."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is very scary. This book makes you think. Just think if were the last of your kind but your not alone you with a race of blood sucking vampires that want to eat you. That will give you something to talk about. I don't know about you, but I would be hinding so they couldn't get me. I would recmoend this book to people 10 and up."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is one of those stories you just have to read to believe, and even then you question it. It being what was written, how it was written, and the originality of the story. This is in no way your traditional Vampire tale, very reminiscent of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (although I think this story preceded the movie), except the monsters possess intelligence. The feeling of being alone is invasive on the reader and the whole thing is pulled off with an eerie, dark beauty. There isn't a happy ending folks, it is scary, it is a classic rendition of those fanged demons we all associate with long capes, coffins, and widow's peaks. It is the demonic offspring of that traditional view. And you leave the reading wishing to adopt that ugly child as your own. Essential reading for any horror fan."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I spent four years of my life searching for this book when most of Richard Matheson's works went out of print.I originally became a fan after putting together this prolific and influential writer's various pieces of fiction. From 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' to inspiring the movie 'Somewhere in Time' to his work on the TV show, 'The Twilight Zone', Matheson is a giant of speculative fiction.'I Am Legend' offers a claustrophobic vision of the last man on earth and his daily battles against the vampire hoard who wish to consume him. Filled with some taught moments, the book drifts a little at points but it's the tangents that often become so compelling in Matheson's work. All in all, a wonderful read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Anyone who has seen the two filmed versions of this fine novel, &quot;Last Man on Earth&quot; with Vincent Price and &quot;The Omega Man&quot; With Charlton Heston, are in for a treat. This novel easily surpasses these films, and I suspect it will surpass the remake currently in pre-production. Matheson masterfully weaves the psychological torture of isolation and the gothic horror of of a good old fashioned vampire story into an unbelievable tapestry of terror and pity. The ending is a true classic. Even if you are not a fan of the genre, I implore you READ THIS BOOK! - you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Contrary to common belief, I Am Legend is not a vampire novel. What this book is in reality is a series a short horror stories written by Richard Matheson that range from the 160 page long story I Am Legend from which the book gets its name to a three page story called The Near Departed. Although I must admit that I Am Legend, the first and longest of the stories, is far and away the best, only talking about that one part does a disservice to the other ten incredible stories that are collected here. I will do a short review on each story in this book.I Am Legend, 5/5, 160 pages. WAY better then the movie.The new movie I Am Legend, staring Will Smith, takes place in New York City after a \\"cure\\" for cancer mutates and turns the worlds population into flesh eating zombie/vampire mutts that can only come out at night. the movie was unimpressive, the book is outstanding.Everyone knows the basic plot of this story, there is only one man left alive in a world full of vampires, but despite what you might expect from a plot like that this isn't an action novel. In fact there is very little in the way of action or suspense and for the most part in moves a slower pace. What makes this book amazing is the attention to detail that author Richard Matheson put into his post apocalyptic tale. Main character Robert Neville starts out about 3 months after last seeing another human being, held up in his house at night as thousands of undead vampires call for him to come out. every day is a rigid routine, fix the houses defenses, throw the dead corpses he finds on his lawn every morning into a fire, hunt for vampires, make stakes to hunt more vampires, and then back inside before nightfall and drink himself to death. As time goes by he starts to learn how to deal with the vampires, how they live and how they die; what they are and why the act the way they do. He conducts experiments, for instance why do vampires fear crosses? Why does garlic repel them? Why do only stakes kill them? Does said stake need to go though the heart to kill? These are all fascinating questions and we get answers to them all.But what makes this story a true masterpiece is the ending. I will not spoil it for you who haven't read the book yet (and I encourage you to do so as soon as possible) but lets just say that it is truly amazing. If you've seen the movie, brace yourself for a shock. I am very confused as to why any writer would want to tamper with such an amazing ending, why would anyone touch this gold?I Am Legend has been made into three motion pictures from the original The Last Man on Earth to The Omega Man to this years blockbuster I Am Legend. Not only that, but horror master George Romero said it was the inspiration for his horror classic Night of the Living Dead. Truly I Am Legend is one of the most influential horror stories in history.Buried Talents, 4/5, 8 pages. An interesting story.Right off the bat I expected another short story that takes place in the I Am Legend universe, but the rest of the stories are completely independent and have nothing to do with one another. Do not go into this story expecting to read more about Vampires and garlic.Buried Talents is a curies piece indeed. At only 8 pages this story brings up a lot of questions but never answers them, allowing the reader to come up with their own conclusions. In this short, a carnival man runs a booth where players try to throw ping pong balls into a fishing bowl to win a prize. No one seems to be able to do it, until a mysterious man walks up and lays down his quarters. He hits every shot, making the balls go into the bowl without so much as bouncing on the bottom, and then makes the two others land right next to them in the same fashion. He keeps this up for the whole story until the very end when the carnival man tells him to leave. Doesn't sound interesting right? Sound stupid? You'd be wrong. Once again, the ending is what makes this story good. Until the very last paragraph this story isn't anything special, but the last two lines make this a story to remember.The Near Departed, 3 pages, 5/5. Short and to the point.There really isn't a lot I can say about this gem of a story, not without giving away any spoilers. Think of this story as a joke, a three page joke and nothing more. Once again, the last paragraph of this story is simply amazing.Prey, 15 pages, 5/5. Chuckey's inspiration?Its inconceivable that one book, or rather a collection of short stories, could not only be the inspiration for Night of the Living Dead, but also for a little film called Child's Play this that might just be the case. Prey is a nail biting thriller about an African doll called \\"This is he who hunts\\" comes to life and starts attacking its owner. Although I don't know for sure whether or not this story inspired Childs Play, it is very safe to bet that the director of that film must have read this book and used it in some way. Although there are parts in this story that just don't make much sense (how can a doll overpower a full grown woman?) it is none the less a very entertaining read. If you liked Childs Play, you'll love this gem.With War, 7 pages, 3/5. Huh?Now this is a strange one indeed. Matheson goes for the surreal and the supernatural in this story even more so then previously, but in the end this story is just too off the wall to be taken seriously. set in an alternate world (or possibly WWI, its hard to tell) Witch War starts off with seven cute little girls talking happily with each other about, well, girl stuff. Gossip, cloths, hairstyles, stuff like that. Then a soldier enters the room and informs them of an upcoming attack.\\"Oh my, here we go again,\\" one of them says.Outside in the rain a group of soldiers, supported by trucks and tanks, are attempting to attack the city the girls are supposedly in. Out of nowhere lightning starts to strike, lions and tigers jump out of the rain, the tanks blow up in huge fireballs and the mud starts to consume the troops as they run; you know, friendly stuff like that. Although this is an interesting story, I can hardly say it's up to the high standard set by previous entries.Dance of the Dead, 19 pages, 3/5. Leaves too many questions unanswered.I know I know, I said the same thing about Buried Talents and still gave that story a 4, so why not this one? Well, because this story tries to be a little more ambitious. For one thing it's longer and has room to expand and answer some of the questions it raises, and for another it creates a whole different world that is never explained or elaborated on. Set, I guess, some time in the not so distant future, the government is in a weakened state in the aftermath of a devastating war. four teenagers go on a trip to the city to see what they call the \\"Loopy Dance.\\" a Loopy, apparently, is a dead corpse that reanimates because of some chemical and does a strange kind of dance. Although the dystopian future intrigued me, nothing really happens of interest during this story, and that's the main reason for the lower rating.Dress of White Silk, 6 pages, 4.5/5. What just happened?That was my immediate reaction after reading Dress of White Silk. What happened? What did that ending mean? Although I have my guesses, there really is no way to know for sure that I'm right or wrong (don't worry, I won't spoil it for you). Written in the head of a young girl, maybe 7 years old give or take, this story is very simply written to say the least. Here's an example of the kind of writing you can expect.Pg , 213. \\"When I pretend I brush my hair long. But I only use my own brush from my room. I didn't never use mommas brush.\\"Although this kind of writing can be a little hard to get though, it is very appropriate for the kind of story being told. It's told though the mind of a very little girl after all, so this incomplete writing is very nice to see and shows the versatility of Matheson. The ending is what truly got me hooked on this. It seems that almost every ending in this book is brilliant.Mad house, 72 pages, 5/5. Inspiration for Monster House?Yes, once again, Matheson delivers another inspiration for another movie, this time the kids film Monster House (Widescreen Edition), although the book itself is anything but kid friendly. Mad House is about struggling writer/professor whose life is leaving him and can't seem to control his anger. The angrier he gets, the more accidents he starts to have around the house. A rug slips out from under his feet, a pencil points break off and sticks into his finger, his chair falls down, ect. His friend warns him that he's afraid that if he doesn't control his anger, his house might actually turn on him, which of course is exactly what happens.This is one of the longer stories in this book, and also one of the best. The story makes the main character is sole focus, diving into he mind and fleshing out what kind of person he really is. Along with Robert Neville from I Am Legend, the main character from this story (I can't remember his name right now) is probably one of the best characters in this book. The story really is about him, at least up until Matheson gives us yet ANOTHER killer ending. My God, how many can be pull off?The Funeral, 10 pages, 3/5. My least favorite.Why is that? Well, because it's a not so funny comedy about vampires and goblins and such. a man tries to run a funeral home when a vampire walks in and say he wants a funeral because the one he had in real life wasn't that great and now he wants to make up for it. What follows is a somewhat humorous tale as all his vampire friends come for the ceremony and try to eat the poor owner. Overall a nice story but nothing great.From Shadowed Places, 25 pages, 4/5. Warning, graphic content ahead.This is, far and away, the most graphic of all the stories in this book. Naked people galore, African voodoo, more naked people, lots and lots of sexual content so if that's not your cup of tea stay away. The story itself really isn't half bad. A man is being tortured by some African witch doctor and is slowly dieing a horrible death. When his fianc&eacute; calls for help, they get their friend Dr. Howl, a woman who just happens to have been taught all about African voodoo while on a trip to the Dark Continent. But the only way she can get the voodoo out of him is to, uhh, get naked and pretend to be having sex with him, no kidding. Still a very good read.Person to Person, 23 pages, 5/5. The second best.After I Am Legend, Person to Person is my favorite story here. When a man starts hearing a phone in his head, he tries to find a way to make it stop, but to no avail. When he gets the bright idea to answer the phone (in his head of course) a mysterious stranger starts talking to him on the other end. Who is this man? A government agent testing a new way of communication? An inventor using him as a guinea pig? His long dead father? His uncounsis mind? Every time he \\"answers\\" the phone, he gets a different story. Little does he know that this voice in his mind has sinister plans for him. This story also has one heck of an ending. I'm surprised no one has made this story into a movie or something.OVERVIEW.You must read this book, whether or not you are a fan of the movies. This horror classic inspired so many movies and books it's not even funny. It inspired Romero's Night of the Living Dead, which inspired every other zombie movie every made, enough said. No horror fan can afford to be without this classic book. Do yourself a favor and buy it now.Re-read value; high."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This haunting and original 1955 science fiction novel started the modern post-apocalyptic vampire genre. It is called the first modern vampire novel and influenced the zombie genre as well. However, the movie with Will Smith is at best loosely inspired by it. I fear many people will not read the book because they have seen this or one of the other movies inspired by the novel. That would be a shame.The novel has roots in science fiction and has spawned dozens of other books and movies. Three movie adaptations were directly inspired by it,The Last Man on Earth,The Omega Man, and now I Am Legend. In all three movies very little of the original novel remains.Richard Matheson wrote a number of episodes for the Twilight Zone including \\"Nightmare at 20,000 feet\\" and \\"Steel.\\" Stephen King listed him as a creative influence and once said, \\"without Richard Matheson I wouldn't be around.\\" The 1957 movie the Incredible Shrinking Man is based on his story. There is even a character named \\"Senator Richard Matheson,\\" who appears in several episodes of the X-Files as a tribute to his influence. I could go on, but you get the idea, his influence has been great.Within the vampire and zombie genre this is a superior story. If you want to know the plot of this superior novel, you can find it online. I won't be the spoiler. I will say that if you enjoy this kind of story this is a novel you should read.Recommendation: Don't judge this book by any of the movies inspired by it. They are at best passing entertainment. This novel remains original and haunting. I found myself mulling it over in my mind days afterward. I recommend it. Five stars.Kyle Pratt"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Just to clarify, only half of the book is I Am Legend while the rest consists of some of Matheson's short stories which aren't really any good.It's still worth the purchase though. Plot is very different from the movie with Will Smith and the title actually makes sense in the book. Not very scary but poses some intriguing questions to think about."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A plague has wiped out humanity and left vampiric creatures in its wake. Robert Neville, a former factory worker, is the sole surviving human being as far as he knows. He spends each night barricaded in his home with vampires outside his door calling for him to come out. During the day, he fortifies his home, kills vampires, and even researches the cause of the plague. Neville is obsessed with explaining what has happened in rational, scientific terms and discovers a bacteria that appears to be the root of the problem. His struggles to stay alive and find a purpose for his life form the crux of the story.I Am Legend has been cited as influential by virtually every horror writer, but you should not expect to find a classic horror story here. The first third actually conforms pretty closely to the norm with some harrowing moments, but then the book focuses much more on Neville's research, his attempt to befriend a dog, his state of mind, etc. The ending is more of an ironic social satire than it is a climax to the story. None of this is to suggest that the novel is not worth reading, it certainly is. Just don't pick it up expecting a thrill ride of scares because you'll be severely disappointed.For those who have seen the movie I Am Legend, with Will Smith, you should know that there are more differences than similarities. Whether you loved the film or hated it, reading the book is a very different proposition and it should be evaluated on its own merits. It should also be noted that the two previous attempts to adapt this storyThe Omega ManandThe Last Man on Earthalso took significant liberties with the story.I Am Legend is a classic and likely to remain so for some time. The basic concept of the last human in a world of vampires is too chilling and evocative to ignore. I enjoyed it, but would not recommend it to those looking for a hard-core horror novel. This story is part character study, part social commentary, and, yes, part horror. Go into it with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The book is by far better than the movie. If you enjoyed the movie but felt as I did that just something was missing and you werent exactly sure what it was.. Read the book. All Questions will be answered and you find out exactly why he is a Legend.. It is all clear to me now.."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"If one vampire was scary, a world filled with them would be really scary.\\" This is what Richard Matheson himself said in an interview about his book \\"I Am Legend.\\" He takes the stuff of fantasy and brings it to light once again. These days we can hear the word \\"vampire\\" and dismiss it as magic phenomena during an age of ignorance. But Matheson does away with the medieval whimsy and applies (albeit crude) science to the legend. And what do we get? Something that could be possible in the land of reason. The dark, hidden fears that we humans have pushed to the back of our minds can resurface somewhat when the magic is explained in a way that makes the logical mind pause and consider. Matheson's repackaging of these ancient, inborn fears seems to have lent a hand in its continued fascination and popularity many years after it's first publication.In the book, we follow Robert Neville as he goes through the phases of forced solitude and loneliness. He treads the precarious line between sanity and insanity as he tries to re-establish himself in this new world he finds himself in. As the last man on earth, what is his purpose? Where can he belong? To keep from going mad he fights (physically and mentally) to find a reason to continue living. It's not until the very end that he finds out what his new place has become."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"while the movie was coming out i decided to do some research on it. i didn't want to get the new edition of the book because i figured they'd be watered down with loads of crap to apeall to a more MODERN, public... so i decided to go strait to the source and get the original. this book is very exciting you will not be able to put this down."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"You know when Steven King praises a novel (that he didn't write) it's probably pretty good! This one is excellent. Not too long, but long enough to make its points. One of the books I've remembered from my youth and wanted to read again so I went ahead and bought a copy -- expecting perhaps that it hadn't held up well over time. It has. Very fun to re-read. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" is only the first half of the book. The book is a collection of short stories written by Richard Matheson and it doesn't indicate that on the cover or anywhere else. Anyway, it's a great book that hard to put down, far better than the movie. Don't stop at IAL though, read the whole thing, there are lots of gems in this one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson wrote this book in 1954, and imagined into a future that was 1976. It's a pretty amazing piece of writing for any time, but the very bleak nature of the entire book was pretty unusual for 1954. It obviously came out of that whole paranoia about us destroying ourselves in an hydrogen bomb holocaust that was so prevalent in the '50s and '60s (ON THE BEACH, DR. STRANGELOVE, FAILSAFE, etc.)It tells the story, in about 150 pages, of a suburban man (Robert Neville), probably around age 35 or so, who is apparently the last man on earth after a horrible plague has infected the rest of humanity...leaving everyone dieing...and worst of all, the people who die come back as vampires. It's almost like a zombie story...and in fact, the details of just what the vampires can do are the least interesting parts of the story. What I really enjoyed were the very specific observations on Neville's emotions and actions during his time of extreme isolation and desolation. He's lost a daughter and a wife to his disease. He's now holed-up in his home...venturing out during sunny days for supplies, research books, and to shore up his home's defenses. At night, he drinks a lot and endures the howls from the vampires who assemble outside his house each sunset to sunup.Neville is, after months alone, a man tormented by the past, by his own desires, and by sheer loneliness. He lives wrecklessly, but not wrecklessly enough to actually want to die. (Although there is one very exciting sequence when he's forgotten to wind his watch and he makes it back home a bit late. Talk about tense!) And occasionally he turns his attention to the idea of a \\"cure\\" for this plague, or at least an understanding of what it is.If you've seen the movie...there are few similarities. A similar plague has swept mankind...but the Robert Neville that Will Smith plays is very different from the 1950's sensibilities of the suburban white man that populates the book. Smith did a fine job, and his character wins our sympathies too. But the Neville in the book is a man seemingly even more tormented and more alone. And he has no science to help him and no DVDs to divert him. He's alone with his whiskey, his murals and his depression.Also, the endings of the two stories couldn't be more different. The reason for the title of the book is completely different from the movie. Again, this is a bleak book indeed. It grips you quite powerfully, and when the climax comes in the final few pages...you will be dismayed. The story doesn't leave you hanging...but it doesn't exactly take you where you might have hoped either.Matheson's writing style is solid and no-nonsense. This guy wastes no words...I venture to guess that many lesser writers would have doubled the size of the book and accomplished half of the intensity. It is taut, terse, exciting and yes, it feels just a bit like it came from the 50s. But it is unfraid to examine its subject matter and its main character...and that's what makes it so great.A true classic...yet to be filmed properly."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Many readers have already written fine reviews of this riveting book. While I enjoyed the novella, \\"I Am Legend,\\" and will only comment that it's look at the psychology around isolation was interesting, I was more impressed by some of the short stories in the second half of the book. I was especially glad to read \\"Prey,\\" the story about the Zuni fetish/doll that was the basis of a filmed trilogy of stories starring Karen Black sometime in the 1970s. \\"Mad House\\" was also an excellent short story that focused on an academic man's descent into madness. These ten short stories could very well have served as the foundations for some fine \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes with their spooky, bizarre and macabre twists. While I can certainly recommend the entire book, I especially urge readers to take a closer look at the short stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this a few months ago, before the movie came out, although it had been on my wish list forever. I read Hell House years ago and it was one of my favorite horror novels, so I've wanted to read I Am Legend for a long time. I read it before the movie came out, but the movie was so different that it really didn't matter. The book was written in the early 1950's and I think it was pretty innovative for that time. Apparently it was first marketed as sci-fi, and only later became known as a horror classic.Robert Neville is - he believes - the sole survivor of some kind of worldwide plague that has killed off most of humanity, and doomed a small portion of it to a vampiric, raging, bloodthirsty existence. For some reason Robert is immune to the disease for reasons he doesn't understand, and everyone he ever knew and loved is either dead or stalking him. The atmosphere is very tense right from the beginning, when we're introduced to the horrible simplicity of Robert's everyday survival: wake up, re-fortify the protections on his house, go out and hunt for supplies, kill a few vampires to lessen their appalling numbers, get home before sundown, eat from his dwindling food supplies, and then wait, with dread and fear, until nightfall when the others come and torment him from outside, all night long. His alone-ness is stark and terrifying, and you feel the kind of deadened desperation he must live with as someone who has nothing to live for, yet can't allow himself to die.The book is very short - a novella, really - and ends much more ambiguously than the the movie. Even if you've seen the movie, I recommend the book. It has quite a different feel to it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A cult classic that has been revitalized by the Will Smith movie.The movie and book differ in several significant ways, but each still has at the core the concept of isolation of man, and overcoming a massive change in the world order.The movie was decidedly more positive in the final outlook for \\"humans.\\" The book has a darker undertone to it. I found both interesting, and enjoyable. Horror does not have to be thrust in your face, and this is a good example of that - not that it lacks in death or blood, but that is not the core of the story. One man's battle, against external forces, as well as against internal ones, comprise the essence of this well done story.The book is a bit short, but complete in its narrative. The added short stories in this collection run from serious to comedic, but all have some supernatural or otherworldly aspect to them. I Am Legend is by far the superior story in this, but the others certainly well crafted stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Excellent book that has a twist at the end. Something the recent movie version completely failed to capitalize upon among many other problems. The only negative I have with the book is that it's comes across a little dated as far as setting is concerned. That's easily overcome by the overriding arch of the story though."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"As the title of this review indicates, this book is not just \\"I Am Legend\\". In fact, it only makes up about half of the book, the remainder being made up of what I found to be rather pedestrian short stories. I found this to be rather irksome as there is absolutely no mention anywhere on the book that it contains work other than the title piece. Other than \\"I Am Legend\\" I thought the stories were rather weak Bradbury rip-offs and not worth any particular note.That said, the title piece is writing of the highest caliber. \\"I Am Legend\\" is the story of the only man who has survived a plague that has turned the remaining population into vampires. Admittedly, that sounds rather uninspired, but what gives the plot its heft is that Matheson approaches vampires from a scientific viewpoint. As the main character struggles to survive, he cuts through the legend surrounding vampires and comes up with a scientific explanation for them.At the same time, he is forced to struggle with his own loneliness and the encroaching madness that it inspires. He is not altogether sympathetic, but through him Matheson explores the crushing hopelessness that those who are alone feel. Rather than trying to make a sympathetic vampire, he turns his main character, a normal human, into the freak, the outcast, and explores how reacts.In addition to the interesting psychological elements, there are some intriguing Cold War overtones within the novel. Matheson's vampires seem to have elements from Soviet Russia: they are brutal and coarse, but not necessarily evil, just different. Matheson seems to be arguing that the root of the Cold War (the brutality of the Soviet system acknowledged and aside) doesn't stem from competing ambitions but from inherently conflicted world views. That's not entirely true, but when one considers that \\"I Am Legend\\" was written in the 1950's that view seems oddly dead on.\\"I Am Legend\\" is a superb, albeit unconventional, vampire novel. It is also an intriguing work of apocalyptic fiction. Above all though, it is an examination of the nature of being different, and the fragility of the human psyche."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is one of the few books that I can honestly say that I could not put down. I finished it in a week and a half of visits to my local bookstore, simply perusing it over midafternoon tea.I am Legend tells the story of the last man on Earth, actually the last truly human man on Earth. Apparently, there was a nuclear war as well as biological warfare(?). Anyway, the combination of the two weapons generated a bacteria that's transmitted by mosquito bites and windstorms (a result of the nukes),infecting humans and causing them to turn into vampires. Much of the book deals with this man Neville's search for a way to end his lonliness (at times he considers suicide, at other times he considers locating other humans). You can truly empathize with his struggle to justify his existence.The other major prime mover of the plot is the protagonist's investigation into the vampire phenomenon. He plays the amateur scientist trying to discover the origin of the vampires, their biological processes, and their weaknesses. There is a kind of macabre fascination that he has with regard to his vampiric enemies. On the one hand, he hates them for their persecution of him. On the other hand, he feels some degree of pity for these unfortunate mutants, some of whom were his friends and neighbors.There are some really suspenseful scenes in which you can feel how he is constantly pursued by these vampires at night - the feeling of perpetual besiegement is palpable. The one scene in which he loses track of the time and is racing in his car to get back to his house/fortress before the vamps come out really had my heart pounding for a while. The ending is somewhat ironic - a play on the book's title - and reminiscent of the Salem witch trials."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I've read this book a total of 4 times. And I must say that once I start reading this book, I cannot put it down. It's so damn realistic that I always end up trying to imagine myself as a survivor and joining forces with Robert Neville to battle the creepy vampires. That is, until I find out we were the bad guys who needed to be terminated..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read this short story in one night. I could not put it down. Will Smith does no justice to the Robert Neville in this book. Anyone who enjoys a good horror/vampire/apocalyptic story should read this. Wonderfully written."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First. Don't watch the movie. Second. Read this book instead. What in the world it was amazing. A must read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A great book. An apocalypse story that's different than most. I saw the movie and really liked it. The book is surprisingly different and better than the movie...but isn't that always the case! I highly recommend this book if you liked the movie and end of the world books!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I would have given this five stars save for one thing. The slider bar and description said there were over 300 pages to this book. It reached the end around 150 but the slider said there were still 312 pages to the book. I hope this can be fixed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I have a really hard time giving a book five stars when I don't like the ending, however in this case I feel the writing is definitely worth it. As a helpless idealist, I prefer happy endings, all is well with the world, everyone good survives, all the bad guys somehow miraculously are killed, jailed, converted or cured ... Oh yeah. But somehow all the best books are more realistic, maybe because that's what life is! Oh well, guess when I need a good happy ending, I'll have to pick we a nice romance novel, but for now ... I loved this book ... all of it. Even though the ending was unexpected, or wanted (LOL), I can certainly imagine a book two with a surprise beginning! I doubt it after all these years, but you never know. Maybe Mr Matheson has one hidden somewhere that will be a surprise release someday. In any case, I loved reading all the places where the movies (3) got their beginnings. Great read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This was really good book. It has nothing in common to the movie that was made, the book is much better."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is an interesting book that focuses is on the mental aspect of survival rather than the physical ones. Many people can survive with their guns, and freeze-dried food, but are they mentally ready? The story follows the main character and how he occupies his time trying to find out what is causing the epidemic and eradicate those infected who are near him. Low on action, but high on thought provoking and I found myself coming back for more!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's a very good story and quite different from the movie version. I finished it in a couple of days."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Nice story with surprising twists, turns, and ending. Having only seen the Will Smith movie, this completely different storyline was refreshing to me."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's been a while since I actually finished the title story of this book \\"I Am Legend\\" but I needed some time to think on it and decide how I felt about this story without letting my thoughts on the movie cloud that.First of all, I will say to anyone that has seen the movie and wants to read this book in hopes of a more detailed version of that story is going to be very disappointed. Basically the only thing that is the same between the story and the movie is the character Robert Nevill's name. I think if you liked the movie than you will like the story as well as long as you keep in mind that you are basically reading a completely different story.Like the movie, Robert has been alone for a very long time but we don't really get to see all of the bizarre loner activities he engages in in the movie. The book is basically his inner monologue so we don't see or know anything other than what the protagonist knows. This obviously leaves many holes in the story which is where I'm sure the movie tried to capitalize.I really liked this story and would just give a heads up to anyone that is thinking of reading it, that it is a very tragic story. It doesn't end happily in the normal sense of the term but I definitely felt that it was a more realistic and appropriate ending than the movie offered. I will also say that when I was done I was very confused on my own feelings towards the story and wasn't sure if it was dislike or just my own subconscious comparisons between the book and the movie. However, once I gave it a couple weeks to just sit on my brain I realized I actually preferred the story over the movie. It's so much more vibrant and deep because we truly see a normal man's way of coping with the harsh realities of a new world without all the Hollywood hooplah."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Let me start by saying that this has virtually none of the elements that are associated with popular horror: gore or gross-outs, demons, boo! moments, or anything else like that. This is a first-rate psychological drama with a science fiction setup. Don't be scared off if (like me) you have no interest in zombies or vampires.This is the story of Robert Neville, the last human being on Earth. This short novel, told in three vignette-like segments, follows the psychological (and occasionally physical) struggles of a man utterly alone in a world of blood-crazed killers. Though there are some vague references to bombings and germ warfare, the story begins in media res with Neville fortified in his house. Thanks to his foresight, cleverness, and immunity, his basic needs are taken care of. Each day he ventures out to destroy as many of the slumbering vampires as he can find. Each night he sits alone in his home as the monsters assault it to no avail. Neville's real enemies, it quickly becomes clear, aren't the vampires: they are alcohol and loneliness. The fantastical themes in the book serve as an excellent backdrop for the story within of a man standing on the edge of sanity. The remarkable paradigm shift that takes place at the end of the book is worth the price of admission.I first became familiar with this story after seeing about half of the movie adaption starring Will Smith (a travesty akin to Smith's adulteration of I, Robot ... one wonders whether he might adapt Jane Eyre to be the story of Rochester, the hard-bitten ex-cop who falls in love with Jane, a stunningly beautiful cyborg assassin who helps him kill his undead wife). Although the book was spoiled for me when I happened to read a list of great sci-fi endings, I still found it a very enjoyable read. Matheson's skillful development of Neville as a character as he faces the terrible mental pressure of loneliness makes the book worthwhile, even though I was denied the pleasure of the \`twist' ending. When I went to get a page count off of Amazon, I was surprised to discover that this book was written in 1954. It has a very modern feel to it for a sixty-year old novel (though the word \`Mohommedan' did strike me as a bit odd)."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Let me start by being completely transparent: the main reason I bought \\"I Am Legend\\" was, essentially, to \\"kill time\\" until \\"The Twelve\\" by Justin Cronin is released. I wanted a fairly short, quick read for my Kindle, that was also inexpensive. Having heard and read many good things about Richard Matheson's work, I decided this would be the perfect appetizer to set me up for Cronin's main course.Perhaps the aforementioned good reviews set my expectations too high, but I found this novella to be good, but not great. I'm certain Matheson was ahead of his time when this was published in 1954, but the language and concepts just seem dated today. I realize it's probably not fair to judge a book based on the work that's followed, and no doubt built upon, the concepts Matheson introduced here. But it is what it is, I just have a hard time putting more modern, sometimes fresher, work out of my head when reading an older novel.All of that being said, \\"I Am Legend\\" is definitely worth your time, and the paltry $1.99 the Kindle version costs. It's a quick read, and the idea of just dropping you into the infected world, with barely any backstory, gives the novella a heightened sense of suspense and realism. In short, if you're a fan of the vampire or post-apocalyptic genres, then you should read this, as it's a seminal story in the evolution of both genres."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was very interested to see the original version of this story, having seen the Will Smith version a few years back. I must say that, like most movies, the book is better. I prefer the ending of the book over the movie, too.

First, it is number one on my list for most scientific books about vampires I have ever read. I was surprised to see the book was very different from the Will Smith movie, but I loved this version too. The thing I liked most about the novel (especially compared to the movie) was the ending. The events of the ending portion of I Am Legend really came out of left field for me. I wasn't expecting what happened, at all. It is very much the most important part of the novel. It leaves us with a message, questioning what we have known and what we believe. I thought it was poignant and powerful, and it certainly left me thinking.A superb book, filled with such powerful emotions when pondering the existence of humans.Yes, this book is Legend."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson was a fine writer for his time. This was an interesting book but I was continuously jarred by the main character doing stupid things: Putting his life in danger over and over by forgetting real basic stuff that someone with reasonable intelligence would not do in his situation. These plot devices detracted from what was otherwise a thought provoking novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read I Am Legend after seeing the movie and was interested in reading the book. I was unprepared for what I read.The first 160 pages or so were what I expected - an interesting, capturing story which was undoubtedly imaginative and well written. What people fail to stress and/or mention of this book is that the story about Robert Neville comprises only half of the novel!The other half was filled with horror stories that were frightening and disturbing. I was unable to sleep at night and had nightmares from the images I conjured from reading them.Does that mean these short stores were well-written? I'm not sure. I absolutely can't believe that after reading such an amazing first story, I was bombarded with extremely frightening and NOT fun to read stories which led me to believe Matheson had to be a very disturbed man (besides the point, I suppose). I would just like to prepare readers for what they may read after the first half of the book!I was creeped out and could only finish the book because I hate leaving books half-read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was under the impression that this was a novel. The book doesn't let on that it was a compilation of short stories. So, when I reached the end of the Short Story half way through the book \\"I AM LEGEND\\" I felt disillusioned, if not tricked.The story was interesting but not very moving. There were inconsistencies as well. The main character visits the mausoleum where the body of his baby girl is being held, later in the story he mentions that the body was taken from his arms and burned with a multitude of others. (What really happened?)In any case, I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. I hope the movie is better."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First off I am Legend is great.. all 160+ pages of it.. That being said the book is not just the Vampire story \\"I am Legend\\" You get the I AM LEGEND short story then 10 other short stories of varying quality after that. Nowhere on the cover of the book is this explained to you. That is kind of a let down. The book should cost MUCH less than it's face value OR better explain exactly what you are getting."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"That person wouldn't be me but happens to be my husband. He has a thing for vampire novels and vampire films. So I've heard and seen and read quite a lot about vampires, if only by default, not being nearly as obsessed as he is..at first. Then he got me hooked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer (tv show) and that's when I knew I was getting interested in the vampire thing, the pain of remembering what it was like to be human after crossing into the world of immortality, with its own set of pains.So I moved on from Buffy (and an interlude reading Interview with the Vampire) and went on to read this book. Couldn't put it down. It floored me. Yep, it IS that good.It isn't a long book so those of you who don't have the time to tackle a large work will be glad of that...but every word counts, every detail, every nuance. It is also highly original, from the \\" scientific explanation\\" of how vampires came to be to digressions about religion,etc.In the end, however, it is a good story that generally holds readers' attention and it was the plot that kept me intrigued. I also liked the apocalyptic elements (I'm a sucker for books about the apocalypse, end of the world,etc).The story? It focuses on a man who is the last guy on earth (but not the last \\"being\\") and his alienation and feelings as he (slowly) traces the history of his life and the deaths of those around him.I had to keep pausing at points in this book, lost in thought as the writer forced me to confront what it means to be \\"human\\" and the \\"meaning of life\\" (yep, I know that is pretty deep, but that's the type of book this is, that's where it takes you) and what I'd do in the face of all the obstacles that Neville faced, all the losses and his world gone awry, far off its axis.Make no mistake - this one has all the elements of good horror writing so if you want to stick to nonfiction or even fiction \\"based\\" on real life, fine... but if you're wishing to push your boundaries, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised (I did). It is one fine book an an excellent introduction to the vampire genre, even if it isn't predictable or \\"the norm\\"."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Rarely do I pay attention to the fanfare on a books cover, but Dean Koontz is right on the money calling I Am Legend &quot;the most clever and riveting vampire novel since Dracula.&quot; A scientific twist on the vampire myth, with a great ending. Read this and you'll see why Matheson is the well from which so much modern horror flows. Matheson makes you feel like you're the last normal person in a world overrun with vampires. I don't know what was the bigger reason in my tearing through this in one night...the page-turning suspense or me looking for an excuse to not turn out the lights that night! Also check out the short stories &quot;The Near Departed,&quot; two-and-a-half pages that will cut you like a razor's edge, &quot;The Funeral,&quot; a comic twist on the vampire genre, and &quot;Prey,&quot; basis for the terrifying tiki doll with a vengeance story from the old &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot; movie (I had almost gotten over my phobia of tiki dolls that movie gave me until I read this!)."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend by Richard Matheson is a story about a man named Robert Neville and his struggle in facing the end times. He is possibly the last uninfected human alive. There are several internal and external struggles. His internal struggle is for companionship and questioning why things have happened the way that they have. His external struggle is to stay alive. The story is told in third person with an all knowing narrator.The GoodThe story is relatively short and only needs to be endured for so long. One thing the author does really well is not speak about gore in an offhanded way, in our society, it has become acceptable in movies and books to glorify violence; Matheson does not do this. The author did use some narrative techniques that aren't common. The way that we are brought into Neville's consciousness was interesting. It was telling and showing in the same moment.The BadThe author spends a great amount of time in the present and it isn't until later in the book that we find out anything of importance about Robert Neville. Too much time is spent describing the world that Neville is living in. Matheson uses repetition well to point things out to the astute reader but scenes don't flow well. Time jumps around constantly and almost a third of the book seems to be flash backs. This interrupts the story and while is interesting for character, it doesn't add anything to the story, it doesn't add to my understanding of the conflict. While I understand carnal urges Matheson focused on (for the first half of the book) Neville's sex drive. A major theme of the book was companionship and he could have been trying to compare the both of them but it was distracting at times.The UglyOverall the book did not tug any heart strings except in flashbacks. Neville hardly seemed real. The struggle between Neville giving himself up or not seems a hopeless one and at the end of the book that is what I am left with: hopelessness. But it isn't even that hopeless, it just is bland. When I enjoy a book, sometimes it is because the good guy wins but more often it is because I can relate and root for someone. Matheson's writing style didn't bring me into the struggle the way that I want to be when reading a novel. Neville is constantly going to alcohol to drown his lack of companionship and even is glorified for it. Matheson seems to be saying that people who are alcoholics just need to have something to be doing in order to be rid of their alcoholism.I would not recommend this book to others. It wasn't terrible but I'm not left with anything after it ends."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really enjoyed this story. I bought this book as a short story collection on paperback a year or two before the film, starring Will Smith, came out. I had heard about the premise from a family member and i just had to read it. I am not a casual reader, but this story had me hooked. Its a bit dated by todays technological standards, but im still familiar enough with technologies of our past enjoy the scenes.One note: Kindle books should be cheaper and not equivalent to their paperback counterparts in price. Digital products have minimal overhead with no manufacturing and shipping cost involved. I bought this story in a single paperback short story collection for $12. It included more than one story by Richard Matheson. Ok..km stepping down off my soapbox now."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is an enjoyable novella and very reasonably priced. I liked in particular that you're given one man to follow through his experience with \\"vampires\\". That decision helps to create a wealth of questions in the reader's mind and also build an appropriate sense of dread.I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book, because if it had been in reverse I would have been disappointed by how Hollywood switched a lot of Matheson's stuff around.If you're looking for other novella's with a similar feel to them, try Stephen King's UR and Ralph Lagana's The Monkey's Paw Trilogy."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is just okay. Doesn't take long to read, so if you like post-apocalyptic stories or vampires this is worth reading. The interior rage of the main character preoccupies the majority of the book. The plot is pretty simplistic and the one character in the book has no real developed. Not really much scare to this book in my opinion. I will say that it is better than the movie which I would give a 2 star rating."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First off let me say I saw the Will Smith movie version of I AM LEGEND, none of the others & while I thought it was good I wish the writers had tried to honor this book as the previous movies didn't by staying closer to the storyline since it was practically perfect as is.This volume contains I AM LEGEND along with a collection of short stories by Matheson that considerably bulk up the page count. I AM LEGEND is the 1st story in the volume clocking in with only 159 pages in the story out of the books 312 page count. Besides I AM LEGEND there are some very good short stories, most notable, Prey, Witch War, Dress of White Silk, Mad House & Person to Person. All are similar genre-type to I AM LEGEND.But onto the I AM LEGEND review.....WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!!!!After seeing the Will Smith blockbuster based on the book I thought I wouldn't enjoy the story but was curious. Man am I so glad of my curiousity!!!! I LOVED this book. It's set in California and a strange \\"virus\\" has caused all citizens of Earth to mutate into vampire-type creatures after exposure. The quick onset & spread eliminated the human race after an implied world war that ravaged but didn't destroy earth but did cause massive climate changes, huge dust storms, etc...The novel revolves around Robert Neville, the only remaining survivor BESIDES the infected vampires/former humans. He is neither a scientist nor in the military, he's an \\"everyman\\" who works with his hands & teaches himself things throughout trying to understand the virus, but a scholar he's not. You become acquainted with Neville & Neville alone throughout his daily existence of fixing his defenses on his house daily after nightly vampire attacks, scavenging for supplies in the dead city, harvesting garlic & killing vampires by day. There is some flashback to get one up to speed on what happened to the world, Neville's family & friends but most of it is current day for Neville.It is his isolation & the chance to \\"peek\\" into Neville's solitude & acceptance of his situation/life, it's those details that thrill & scare you. His character finds a place in your heart & mind where you'll have a seriously hard time letting him go, I know I did. His perseverance & strength make you wish men like Neville existed other places besides the page. His trials will break your heart & make you root for him to find another human alive in the book because you will want Neville to be happy, even if it's impossible.Matheson wrote Robert Neville in such a way that he not only jumps off the page & into your mind, he stays there. For weeks after finishing I AM LEGEND I found myself pulling it off the shelf & re-reading certain parts, eventually reading the book several more times. I wish a movie could he made to follow the actual story more closely, it's amazing just as Matheson wrote it, no Hollywood special effects or embellishments needed.A must read for horror, sci-fi or fans of any good book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson's novel is every bit as solid, thought provoking and well written as what we expect from authors such as Bradburry or King (he certainly outshines the latter). I Am Legend is one of those sparkling moments in an otherwise dull genre. The protagonist is three dimensional. The story is rewarding to the end. And the prose is crisp and intelligent. Not to mention the most important demand of a horror book. It's really goddamned scary."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you love the vampire genre, you must read this book.The science is dated (it was written in 1954) but the story isamazing. Without question it has influence hundreds if not thousands of subsequent works. Read it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book was very interesting. Right from the get-go R. Neville explained his situation, and through the book he dropped details as to how the vampire \\"plague\\" came about. Eventually discovering for himself all possible methods of killing them (trial & error), and facts about their orgin. The weirdest part of the book is how it skips ahead months or even years at a time. I'm surprised the guy wasn't completely psychotic... being the last of his kind and all."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I finished the book in two nights, its fairly short, but it is simply amazing, and then i found out it was written in the 50's, and that made it pure genius. I cannot believe Matheson could write something like this that long ago, it is one of the, if not the best books ever written, i suggest everyone reading this book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Actually I just read I am Legend, and couple of the stories afterwards. But this book is well worth it for I am Legend alone. Fantastic--- I couldn't put it down. That hasn't happened to me in quite a while. Recommend strongly."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson,a writer of many horror and sci-fi novels brings a wonderful story of the last man alive fighting against vampires.Rovert Neville had a great life and a wife he loved very much.Well,one day all that was taken away from him,as a deadly plague hit the world causing everyone to die except for Neville.Later on,we find that Neville is not alone though.In the day time he spends his time scouring the streets and stores looking for what he needs and driving stakes through the vampire's hearts.Then,at night time,he retires to his home hiding from the vampires that went him badly.The vampires at night throw rocks at his house and call his name over and over again to try and get him out.The book almost makes you feel like your reading a Stephen King book.Once you start reading it,you won't want to put it down.Classic vampire novel right here."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you haven't read this vampire novel, you need too. Richard Matheson wrote one of the most original, gritty horror tales ever with I Am Legend. I picked it up back in 1985, while working on a ranch in Wyoming for the summer. I read this dark, bump-in-the-night tale while sleeping in the bunkhouse, and at times found myself looking at the opened hay-loft doors and windows to see if a white, bloodless face was peering in at me.This is a gothic vampire tale placed in modern America and crouched in science. Robert Neville is the last human survivor after a plague has either killed everyone else (including his family) or transformed them into blood-lusting vampires. He now lives a barely sane life in a constant fight for survival, battling vampires, depression, and alchoholism. What he goes through is both heartbreaking and terrifying. And yet he portrayes mankind with all his weakness, and strengths, as he pulls himself up by the straps and begins teaching himself blood chemistry and medicine, in a heartfelt attempt to cure the vampires, and save his sanity.The novel is tightly written, filled with scenes that will raise the hackles and send your skin crawling. Try reading this one at night."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Without a doubt, one of the most compelling novellas ( its very short, really) ever written. The plot is a tad unbelievable- a hideous disease has gone through the world, turning everyone to vampires, leaving the central character as sole survivor. During the night, you have the compelling and gripping scene of the central character locked up in his house, surrouded by crosses and garlic to keep the vampires out, while listening to classical music to drown out the sounds of them trying to get in.During the day the central character is out with his stakes and mallets, doing the impossible task of staking as many as he can before the sun goes down again..This is the essence of the plot. It is impossible not to idnetify and sympathise with the central character and ask yourself the question:&quot; What would I do in this situation?&quot;. Written in taunt, crisp sentences the story carries itself admirably, although the ending, while memorable seems a bit abrupt. Aside from that, gentle reader, this is a great read, and one you will find impossible to put down. Like &quot;The Stand&quot; this is a rare blend of drama, horror, and &quot;post Apocalypse&quot; writting, and well worth your money. It will stay with you for days."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Not quite all it could be...just settling down to enjoy a good novel that would hopefully last a week or so, and finished it in one night. Felt it had a lot more to offer, even though it did have a relatively satisfying ending. Brief, shocking and to the point, the story is luridly entwined around one man's stance against loneliness, and how he responds to unexpected development. Excellent scientific and biological descriptions of vampire anatomy, good characterisation and solid emotional descriptions, but once again, the tale winds down prematurely. Saddened that the second half of the book is filled with four-page long short stories that, although well written, would better serve as furthered chapters of the headline title.Still waiting for more....."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Written in '54 this book is still the best vampire novel around. A cataclysmic plague left the world inhabitted with vampires and this robert neville is the last man alive. Salem's Lot and Anne Rice pale beneath this story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book, besides being absolutely amazing on a lot of levels, gets my vote for Best Last Sentence Ever. Watch for it. It's a killer."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a great book that ties in with the movie it's based on.I think you should read it and enjoy.I hope you read this book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"great movie cant wait to read the book I was told it is 100x's better"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book in anticipation of the film starring Will Smith. I must say it was a very short story. I continued on into the short stories afterward thinking I was still reading I am Legend, only to quickly realize they had nothing to do with it. I was very disappointed. I suppose I should have looked over some of the other customer reviews first.I would not have bought this had I known that merely half the book is I am Legend. I gave it 2 stars because at least what I read was interesting enough. I hope the movie is better and doesn't end the way the book did."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Let me just say first that i saw the movie trailer for I am Legend before i read the book because i loved the idea so much. But now that i have read the book i think that the movie i goin to be a let down. I have always loved VAMPIRES and i have always loved the idea of someone being the LAST PERSON ON EARTH but i never thought that somebody had wrought a book with both these things in it. THANK YOU RICHARD MATHESON.The book starts off with Robert Neville the only man that had survived the vampire attack. He now lives in a world were no other human is alive (except for the vampires). Doing the day Neville does the usual work to his house fixing the generator; replacing boards that have broken off; hanging up garlic; and going to the ruin civilization for supplies. But at night he bolts the door shut and prays for the dawn to come. That is the one thing i loved so much about this book is that in the day he could do anything he wanted (which included killing of the vampire in there coma like sleep during the day) but at night he has to stay barricaded in his house waiting till the sun up.I never felt for a character as much as i fell for Robert Neville and Richard Matheson makes you fell like you are there with Neville and going through every emotion that he is going through.All and all I am Legend is the best book i have ever read and i doubt that any other book will beat it.I totally think that if you love vampires or have any good taste what so ever you should definitely like this book and think me for writing such a awesome review.LONG LIVE ROBERT NEVILLEThank you."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I've seen the 1970's movie version called \\"The Omega Man\\" based on this story but I'd never read the original which is why I purchased this book. The story is okay... not bad. My rating is due to the fact that I assumed I was paying for a novel and instead bought a book of short stories; the first of which is \\"I Am Legend\\". There is nowhere on the cover... front, back or spine, that warns this is a collection of short stories. I rarely buy short stories. As a rule, I prefer novels and would not have bought this one had I known. Tacky way to sell books... tacky and blatantly dishonest.Richard Matheson is decent author and screenwriter but this book is merely a means to use the upcoming movie to sell a handful of mediocre short stories. Appalling way to treat his fans and consumers in general."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read Richard Matheson when I was a kid.Now am rereading his works and appreciating them.My favorite of all his works is I Am Legend, a tale of Robert Neville, who is the only non-vampire on earth. He spends his day trying to kill vampires and must endure their attempts to get him and taunt him by night.It is in short brilliant.But remember, it is part of an collection of other stories, but saying I Am Legend is just a short story in a book is like saying McGavin's Night Stalker was just another series.I read this every few years since 1970, and regrettably lost track of it until now.For fans of this genre it is a must. Who becomes a legend and the feared? The population or the last of his race?"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What a great airplane read. I bought this at LAX and it kept me devotedly busy for the next couple of days. I'm not much of a vampire-reader... not into the whole Lestat/Ann Rice scene or style. What I liked about this was the narrator's scientific, blunt approach to his highly macabre predicament.Don't want to give away too much of the plot, and I'm sure most of the other reviewers already gave you what you need in terms of the general story line.My main criticisms:1) The ending is too swiftly delivered to us. I wouldn't mind a little longer denouement to pay me off for my patience throughout Neville's ordeal;2) Mr. Matheson uses too many adverbs. There are some real clunker descriptions sprinkled throughout, but luckily they seem to fade into the background once the pace picks up.But on the whole, a very cool book. Written in 1954 -- it must have been revolutionary. The whole genetics/epidemic storyline was way ahead of its time, and contemporary monster lore and hit movies -- most recently, \\"Twenty-Eight Days Later\\" -- owe it a huge debt of gratitude.If you buy the Orb Book edition, copyright 1995, you get the added bonus of a handful of short stories at the back of the book. Most of those were fun, though \\"Dance of the Dead\\" annoyed me and tested my patience a great deal. Actually, a few of the stories tested my patience. But to finally read \\"Prey\\" --the story forming the basis of the Devil Doll segment of Karen Black's classic, \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" -- was a real treat for me.\\"The Near Departed\\" is an amusing gag story, and \\"Buried Talents\\" is suitably mysterious and satisfyingly unresolved.Matheson is an interesting writer, responsible for a whole heck of a lot of Twilight Zone episodes -- so if you're a fan like me who can sit in front of the marathons for days at a time, it's in your best interest to read this novel and the stories that come with it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I have been a big fan of Richard's work on The Twilight Zone and Rod Serling's Night Gallery, but have never read any of his actually works until I picked up this book. \\"I am Legend\\" has influenced many greats from George Romero to Stephen King, but for some reason or another this book didn't blow me away like I was hoping it would. First off, the vampires are basically just talking zombies that drink blood and are afraid of garlic and crosses. Personally, I think Romero's vision of alienation and horror in the films \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" is much suprior to that of \\"I am Legend's.\\" Second off, I hated the ending. I will not go into details, but I was disappointed and was left scratching my head at the logic of it. The book is still a pretty decent read. My favorite parts were Neville's relationship with befriending the dog and I also liked how the female vampires tried to lure Neville outside by using their sex appeal.The short stories (at least 7 of them) on the other hand are absoultly brillant. Espically, \\"From Shadowed Places\\", \\"Witch War\\", \\"Buried Talants\\", \\"Prey\\", \\"The Funeral\\", \\"Dance of the Dead\\", and \\"Mad House.\\" The other stories are average at best, but these are the real keepers. \\"From Shadowed Places\\" is one of the most creepy and unnerving things I have ever read. \\"The Funeral\\" was always one of the most charming Night Gallery segments, and the short story is just as good. And \\"Mad House\\" is funny, demented, and horrifying all rolled up in one. I think I like Richard more as short story writer."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" is not to be thought of as anything other than a masterpiece. Unfortunately, I had to give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because the accompanying short stories that fill out the other half of the book aren't remotely as good. It doesn't matter though, because \\"I Am Legend\\" is just too powerful a story to pass up."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's beyond me to understand how horror fans can go on and on about their favorite horror novels as if they were masterpieces by Pynchon or Nabokov. The bottomline about \\"I Am Legend\\" is simple: it's about loneliness and loss in a post-apocalypse world overrun by vampires. If that doesn't cause you to dissolve with laughter, then \\"I Am Legend\\" might be for you. It's well-written, holds the reader's interest, and has been the basis for three movies. It will appeal to most teenage boys (or to grown up men who remember how the world feels to teenage boys). However, it doesn't deserve five stars because it doesn't have enough cool details about the end of humanity.I didn't see \\"The Omega Man\\" when it came out in the early 1970s. However, one of the kids at my junior high school got to see it, and he described every detail of the story to me. I was captivated. Now I'm almost 50. Now Charleton Heston is dead. I am legend."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had seen the movie and liked it so much that I could not wait to read the book! Unfortunatly, the book was a slight disappoinment. It is very different from the movie so do not expect the same \\"cancer drug\\" issue or the same ending."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is great book that can really make one think for a long time. It has a great ending that has yet to be captured in any of the films made of the book, The Last Man on Earth(1964), The Omega Man(1972), and I am Legend(2007). I am Legend was surprisingly short, coming in at 160 pages. The rest of the book is filled with some of Richard Matheson's short stories which I could have done without. I would have easily given the book another star or two had the short stories not been included because they were just plain bad. A lot of them started off well just to disappoint at the end and the rest were just bad from start to finish."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Usually the book is so much better than the movie, not in this case. First of all I Am Legend is a short story. The only things the movies and the book have in common are: a dog is briefly in the book and the main character's name is the same. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"i read it and i was sadly very disappointed. no i never watched to movie and actually bought it before i knew it even was a movie. the beginning was ok, slow but ok, but it never picked up. i really didnt like the idea of the vampires, was obnoxious from a vampire-lover's perspective but the bateria idea seemed interesting enough if you could get past that. nothing happened though and the ending was horribly corny, probably bc the bk was written in the 50s than it wasnt \\"corny\\" yet, well, now it is. srry dude. he sits around listening to records and moping and rarely goes outside. the dog seemed kinda pointless bc it's only in a few scenes and SPOILER, dies shortly after."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Honestly, I did. I can see why the story of \\"I am Legend\\" has some serious appeal. I, at least, loved the ending, but it just couldn't make up for the disdain I had for the earlier parts. Coupled with the fact that this book is 312 pages and the story of \\"I am Legend\\" ends on page 159 means that this entire book isn't \\"I am Legend\\". Considering I wasn't a huge fan of \\"I am Legend\\", this might sound like a good thing, but the latter half of the book is filled with some incredibly bad short stories. I have no idea what this publisher was thinking by doing this.Naturally \\"I am Legend\\" is the more famous story in this book and it is definitely the best one by a long shot. It's the story of Robert Neville a man who believes he is the last man on Earth after a plague has wiped out most of humanity and changing some into horrific vampire/undead beings. This is the story of Neville trying to overcome his plight and facing these creatures on a daily basis. Now let me just say that I can understand why people find the book so good. It's written very vividly and you can really feel the ordeal Robert Neville is going through. My problem was that I just plain didn't like Robert Neville. He flew off the handle with frustration far too much and he just did stupid things that a collected person wouldn't make. I realize that's part of who he was as a character. It's really hard to like this book when you don't like the main character since this is the sort of story that deals with isolation where the only character you really get to interact with is the main character. The world Matheson constructed was very interesting to read about and I do like what he did with it. I even ended up liking the explanation for why certain Vampire legends worked, that's what really saved this book for me.I'll admit, I saw the movie starring Will Smith before I read this. I'm sort of torn, in a way, because I did like the movie a little better than the book, but that's solely because Will Smith played a rational and very smart Robert Neville. He didn't fly off the handle in crazy tirades. A friend of mine put it best \\"if I were stuck in this situation, I would want to be with the Neville from the movie, not the book\\". I think that aptly displays why I had a hard time liking this book. As far as the book versus the movie, it's nothing but confusing. I have no idea why they titled the movie \\"I am Legend\\". It doesn't have nearly the same creatures as in the book and it doesn't have the same ending. The lack of that ending completely invalidates the title of the movie, because the book simply ended on a brilliant note that actually fully explains the title, the movie does not.Now these other short stories we have to suffer through at the end is just atrocious. Yes, I read every single one of them... simply so I could say I have and that my review is fully based on my experience. There is one story called \\"Witch War\\" in which Matheson goes into detail about these underage girls who display magical abilities. For whatever reason they're in a military compound and they mentally fight troops with magic before they can even engage their target. It's just a stupid story. It makes almost no sense. \\"Dress of White Silk\\" drove me insane because it made no sense at the end. I have a general idea of what happened, but I really don't know for sure. It has to do with a little girl who is obsessed with her mother, but she's dead. Then it goes off in some tangent of killing a friend. I had my girlfriend read it and she couldn't figure out what happened either, so I guess it's not just me. Then the most infuriating is \\"Mad House\\". It's a concept that this guy who is angry all the time is transmitting that anger into the things around him until the house eventually attacks him. This would have been alright if it was only a few pages, but it's a twenty plus page story with excruciating detail that I didn't care to read. The best one is probably \\"Person to Person\\" though, which was written well after the others. That's about a man who is hearing a telephone ring in his head and he eventually answers it and speaks to a voice on the other end. You eventually figure out who the voice is and it's sort of clich&eacute;, but it wasn't a bad read overall. This isn't all of them, but the others were also terrible. Having one decent story in that mix didn't help rating this book any.Overall \\"I am Legend\\" was a pretty solid story, but the novel ended on such a bad note with the other stories. \\"I am Legend\\" is definitely an excellent tale given it's time frame, but I just couldn't fully get into it as I explained above.

About half way through the book, the story ended, then the author started writing short stories that had nothing to do with the book.So you have this fantastic vampire story that has tested time, then suddenly BAM brick wall. After the brick wall, you have a dozen short stories about voodoo, a man who magically wins carnival games, and coming of age stories where a kid is shocked because she experiences a rave for the first time. Oh no!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Rather than repeat the good reviews on the story of \\"I am Legend\\" I am offering a review of the book itself. I am disappointed in the marketing ploy of this book, relying on the movie to sell the book. Nowhere on the cover, the back of the book or the inside flap does it state this is a compilation of short stories. It instead relies on the reader's interest in the movie with Will Smith to sell the book. In fact, the story itself used to sell the book is only 159 pages of the 312 page book. There are in fact 11 stories in this book. Not all of them great reads. I probably would have bought it anyway but I resent the obvious deception that this entire book was a novel of the one story, \\"I am Legend\\" and was hoping for much more. The story itself was good and well written. I will wait until the DVD is released to see the movie. I won't buy books again from TOR without researching further to find the truth about their packaging and what is actually inside."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Excellent descriptive writing. Unfortunately, there is more description than plot. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; turns out to be more a novella than novel and the paperback contains several unrelated short stories that immediately follow.

I guess it was writing style that I disliked.Lord knows I read every novel or story by real writers who wrote horror (Edgar Allan Poe , Ambrose Bierce) and writer-entertainers like Clive Barker, Stephen King, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. I loved everything when I was 18-19 , fiction, science fiction, epic fiction, horror and read even the worst books to the end, including James Herbert's 'Survivor' . OMG, was THAT one bad!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book sucks, you read it and get to the middle of the book to be left with no sort of ending.

What I though was a 300+ page fiction thriller is a 170 page half baked silly story about vampires followed by a group of uninteresting short storied. Guess I won't bother with the movie.

What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book which demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Here's a summary of what's inside this book.(1) The title story, which takes up 50% of the book. As you can guess by now, this is a great story. However, what you may not know is that this is more a post-apocalypse story and less a vampire story. The epidemic of vampirism which leads to the collapse of civilization and to the main character becoming the \\"last man on Earth\\" is more of just a setup. The story is more concerned with how the main character deals with being alone, with trying to get supplies while avoiding getting killed, finding meaning in continuing to survive when everyone you care about is dead, etc. Matheson does an excellent job at this, but don't be surprised if you're expecting a thorough analysis of vampirism or if you're expecting a new exploration of vampire culture. My only regret with this story is that the ending is somewhat abrupt, as if Matheson couldn't come up with a satisfying ending. It's still a great read overall though.(2) The other 50% of the book contains various short stories of various lengths, written from the 50's to the 80's. You can actually tell how Matheson has refined his writing skills over the years because his earlier stories are somewhat clunky, doesn't grab you as much and are sometimes too verbose for their own good. These would be _Witch War_, _Dance of the Dead_, Dress of White Silk_, _Mad House_, and the _Funeral_. They're ok but not stellar.(3) The later stories are short, concice, grab you immediately and won't let go, and Matheson really gets you to feel a sense of fear and dread as the stories progress. You know that you're in the hands of a master craftsman who knows how to skillfully weave a engrossing and frightening story. These would be _Buried Talents_, _The Near Departed_, _Prey_, _From Shadowed Places_, and _Person to Person_.(4) One thing to note though is that these stories all have a Twilight Zone feel to them. You have to imagine Rod Serling presenting these stories and you have to be in a mood for an \\"interesting\\" setup for each story, be willing to suspend your disbelief and be curious about how the initial setup of each story will pay off. If you're in that mindset, the stories will be a lot of fun, especially the latter stories which feel like very good Twilight Zone episodes. That's not surprising since Matheson has written a large number of Twilight Zone episodes.(5) Also interesting to note is that the title story has been adapted to film twice (_Last Man on Earth_ starring Vincent Price and _Omega Man_ starring Charlton Heston). The _Prey_ story was adapted to a film (_Trilogy of Terror_ starring Karen Black). This isn't surprising either since a large number of his stories have made it into film, like _The Incredible Shrinking Man_, _The Legend of Hell House_, _Somewhere in Time_, _What Dreams May Come_, _Stir of Echoes_ just to name a few."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I must confess, after reading a few chapters I believed this novella was another parable about the HUAC and McCarthy's political reign of terror. This story was written in 1954 and a similar theme: the lone individual standing up to hysterical mobs that sprouted overnight, had been addressed in films such as &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (based on a Finney short story).However, when I finished the story, I was convinced that a previous reviewer made a more accurate assessment. _I Am Legend_ is a pure existential novel, along the lines of Camus's _The Plague_ and _the Stranger_.Robert Neville is the _involuntary_ and rather pathetic, disempowered survivor of a plague that transformed the human race into a race of blood-sucking vampires. The plague also took his wife, daughter and best friend.Every night his former friend leads a small group of vampires who torment Neville and remind him he is less than a man and not much more than a cornered animal. In his alienation, despair and anger Neville sinks deep into drink and kills vampires during the daytime wherever he finds them sleeping and vulnerable.In a sad episode, the lonely Neville, desperate for companionship, reaches out to a stray dog.Neville, much like an addict, finally hits rock bottom. He resolves to overcome his ignorance and the centuries of superstition and scepticism that helped the plague spread. He studies science to understand the rational causes of the plague and the vampires.In the process, Neville empowered by knowledge--alone but no longer lonely--understands himself, the vampire and the new culture of fear and violence of the ascending specie. Neville accepts reality for what it is and determines to play the hand he has been dealt. He loses his fear of death, an inevitability and a constant in the human condition.Neville, in a deft touch of irony, realizes that by _choosing_ to transform himself into a sober, deliberate, understanding and fearless individual, he has acquired the very qualities that make him an outsider in the newborn, conformist order.Yet, he realizes he is the better man for it. This existential man accepts and courageously confronts his fate, the common fate of all mankind, and in turn bequeaths to the new masters of the earth the unique gift he has discovered within himself.This Nietzschean transformation makes Neville more than a man, he becomes a legend.Ordinarily, the horror genre does nothing for me. After two pages of Stephen King, I set the book down. I much prefer the romance of SF, from _The Time Machine_ and _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ to _Childhood's End_ and _Ender's Game_.Who would have thought that in the vampire genre, by definition stories of cold, dead blood-suckers, one would find a touching story about the promise of the lone individual being open to life's existential possibilities? Matheson deserves high praise for his accomplishment._I Am Legend_ deserves to be read--today, now, here--where, frankly, a disempowered citizenry is spooked into silence, anger and withdrawal by (unnaturally propagated) fears of the so-called &quot;War on Terror.&quot;"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Prior to reading I Am Legend, I had never read any other 'vampire' novels. This is the 2nd book in the SF Masterworks series, and once you read it, you know why. The story is reminiscent to John Wyndham's Day Of The Triffids in the fact that it's a 'one man against the world story'. It is based around the daily life of Robert Neville - the last normal human being left on Earth - everyone else being blood hungry vampires, who are all rather keen to get hold Neville and suck him dry.You find yourself greatly empathising with Neville as he goes about his daily routine of venturing out of his heavily fortified house until sunset, to try and dispose of his antagonizers in a slow and grizzly manner. By night he remains sheltered, drinking himself stupid with whisky (the glasses of which always end up rather comically smashed against a wall).The book more than anything, explores the endurance of Neville as he endures the endless daily battering of his house and mind against his innumerable foe. The book flows from beginning to end, and regardless of your usual choice of book, I'm confident that I Am Legend would be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" is not a novel, but rather a short novella that, due to the recent release of the film, has been advertised in this edition as 300-page novel. The synopsis on the back of the book describes the story \\"I Am Legend\\" and nothing more. After you complete about 150-pages of the novel, you realize \\"I Am Legend\\" is over and the rest of the book is a compilation of short stories. Unfortunately, most of these stories suck. \\"I Am Legend\\" is good, about a man named Robert Neville who is the last man on Earth. By day, he goes and gets supplies from empty stores and by night he fights off the vampires that surround his house. Than he discovers a young woman and realizes that maybe there is hope for humanity. The story inspired Stephen King, reportedly, more than any other book. \\"I Am Legend\\" is no masterpiece, but it's short and entertaining enough. The next story \\"Buried Talents\\" is short, but rather pointless and not too interesting. \\"The Nearly Departed\\" is about three pages and is terrific. The next 4 or 5 stories are rather tedious (especially the dreadful \\"Dance of the Dead\\" and overly long \\"Mad House\\"). In fact, this collection doesn't pick up until the final story \\"Person to Person\\" which is (almost better) than \\"I Am Legend.\\" You know, this book is cheap...But is it really worth buying? I don't think so. I think you're better off hitting up a local library or something. It's decent, but hardly a masterpiece.I Am Legend: BBuried Talents: CThe Nearly Departed: B-Dance of the Dead: FMad House: DALL THE OTHER STORIES, EXCLUDING \\"PERSON TO PERSON\\": DPerson to Person: B+"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What's good about this book:Richard Matheson did a superb job creating the bleak, horrific world that Neville inhabits, as the sole human survivor of a plague that has turned the world into a living nightmare filled with the undead. He does a magnificent job getting into Neville's tortured mind as the vampire slayer struggles to find a way to cure the illness that is the true cause of civilization's demise. You can taste a little of the ordeal the character goes through in his battle to make some sense of his life in a world surrounded by the dead.What's bad:The ending. Late in the story Matheson takes it in a completely different direction, abandoning the human versus vampire theme that occupies the first two thirds of the book. He replaces it with an odd, rushed through climax to the story that left me wondering \\"where did he get that from?\\"There are also numerous holes in the story. What, for example, is the difference between a \\"living\\" and a \\"dead\\" vampire? Why didn't Neville watch the vampire named Cortman as he headed back to his hideout as dawn broke? Why were his final adversaries so hostile, when they knew he had done invaluable research on the infection and might have vital information?For that matter, why develop the whole story line of Neville studying the vampires from a scientific perspective, when it essentially led nowhere?And why do stakes succeed where bullets fail, if Neville's theory of the vampire's Achilles' heel is correct? Either one would allow oxygen to get into their systems.Overall the story impressed me with Matheson's talent as a wordsmith, yet made me feel he didn't think the plot out very well before publishing the story.If you enjoy good writing then the story is worth reading for that reason alone. But don't expect to put the book down and say \\"wow, what a great story!\\" That is, unless you have a penchant for confusing, depressing, implausible finales to otherwise great tales."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"For those than haven't read the book: You can read this review in it's entirety, I give nothing away...This book is outstanding. Period.A contemporary classic. The template for many works, both written and filmed. Eventhough you've no doubt read or seen something inspired by this, \\"I Am Legend\\" will be as fresh and riveting a read as it was back in 1952 when it was first published.By the way, don't let its age discourage you from reading it either. There is absolutely nothing in this book that is dated or that is so different from today that it will take you out of the story (aside from a flashback the main character has about talking to a \\"Negro\\" at work).A reoccuring complaint that I've been reading is that it's hard to tell when \\"I Am Legend\\" ends and the compilation of short stories this book has afterward, begin. I have to admit I laughed out loud when I read that. HOW OLD ARE THESE PEOPLE? What are they in, KINDERGARDEN? Excuse my language, but how stupid do you have to be to not know that the main story is over? Didn't the big, bold title \\"BURIED TALENTS\\", of the new story give you a hint?Plus, if you couldn't tell that \\"I Am Legend\\" had ended, then you weren't really paying attention to it. BOLDLY printed title aside, you should be aware that \\"I Am Legend\\" has ended simply by what you're reading.This one-star reviewer even goes on about how the movies sucked but said nothing about the book. Amazon really needs to screen these reviews.The story doesn't end abruptly either. Yes it's a short story, but its end came at just the right speed and with a lot of closure. The end was phenomenal. If the book is considered to be in the top 10 horror stories of all time, the ending should defenitely be in the top 3 endings of all time. No other ending I've read has had such a deep impact on me. As I read the last couple of lines, I was completely lost in the story. When it was done, I closed the book, took a deep breath, and sat back to meditate and digest it for awhile. I couldn't get it off my mind for days after that.The one thing I will say is that the end is a bit depressing, but hey, most things in life are.There have been to movie adaptations made in the past. \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" with Vincent Price, and \\"The Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston. Both of these are O.K. on their own, but don't compare at all to the book. I wonder how this latest depiction with Will Simth will do?Bottom line: This is one of if not THE best novel/novellas of the past century, and undoubtedly one of the top ten horror stories of all time. BUY IT. READ IT. BE AMAZED."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book after learning it was being made into a movie later this year. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Actually, I found boring and very nearly as exciting a read as others found it.The main character spends most of the time in the book drunk, breaking glasses and consumed by self pity in a virus-vampire filled world. The only dangers he encounters are from situations he himself creates. The \\"vampires\\" are more like the retarded zombies from night of the living dead than the smart and fast creatures from other novels. They just sorta stumble outside his home-fortress and hope he comes out so they can get him. Very uninteresting stuff. With a lack of any other supporting character, and the main character being so unlikeable and unrealistic, I found the story falls flat. It also ends suddenly, just when something interesting looks like it's starting. \\"I am legend\\" is only half the book, the other half are a collection of short stories.Hopefully \\"Hell House\\" is a little better. I can't recommend this book, it may have been scary when written but now it's outdated and a bore."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a story about the sole survivor of a plague that has turned the world's population into varying forms of vampires. While the idea behind the story itself is intriguing, it feels more like reading an anthropological study than a horror novel. The whole novel is filled with the protagonist repeating the same actions and his reactions to those actions over and over again.There is little in the way of plot, rather the story plods along aimlessly. Matheson may have done this intentionally to convey the protagonist's uncertainty about the past, present, and future. Nonetheless, it makes for a less than gripping read.Matheson's writing style is, at best, mediocre in this novel. I had to force myself to finish reading it. On the plus side though, it did have a good ending. If you're new to Matheson and must read something of his, pick up Hell House, a far superior novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I guess I'm an outlier- I was really not impressed with this book. The writing is mediocre, occasionally feeling like the author was abusing a thesaurus and awkwardly working in ten-dollar words. But really, it's the fact that 90% of the story basically goes like this:\\"Robert thought about the vampires but couldn't figure everything out immediately, so he became enraged, drank a bunch of whiskey, and smashed the glass against the wall. The next day he found a book and tried to do some research, but the first sentence did not explain everything, so he became enraged, drank some whiskey, and smashed the glass AND the bottle against the wall. Later he found a microscope but it wasn't calibrated very well so he smashed it against the wall. Then he was so angry that he drank all the whiskey and smashed it against the wall too. He realized he was running out of glasses, which made him angry, so he smashed several more of them against the wall. This whole time, there was some clicking noises in his throat. Also, his throat made a clicking noise. And he was angry. Sometimes he almost thought of something sad, but that made him too angry, and then he had to drink.\\"Finally it starts to get interesting and you think maybe the novel's going to GO somewhere and...boom, it's over. It's over, and the next half of the book are unrelated short stories. They're okay... kinda cute little horror vignettes. But at least on my edition of the book, there is ZERO indication that half of the book is not \\"I Am Legend\\"- no mention on the front, or the back, or the end pages. There's a table of contents but it just looks like they are chapter names. For some reason that really sticks in my craw- feels like false advertising.Now, granted, I'm not big into vampire novels so maybe this is as good as the genre gets (I mean, look how highly Twilight is rated :-P ) But I'm very much not impressed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Great all around. Suspenseful. Grips you right up to the end, and you'll be surprised.What didn't come across to me before buying the book is that \\"I Am Legend\\" is only the first 80% of the novel. The remainder is a series of unrelated short stories. I was confused and tried to link those stories to the main material at first; then I realized that they were separate works.The short stories are worth the purchase price alone, they're interesting, thought provoking glimpses into other worlds. Their subject matter ranges from humor, to war; from surreal, to outright horror. Each one is self-contained and leaves your imagination free to turn the story around in your head afterwards.Very satisfying read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"... to read this novel? I see there are already 300+ reviews before me so I'll just say that this was an AMAZING story!! Real book lovers will want to read this sometime in thier life! The added short stories that are in this edition are very good as well."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"i liked the story and most importantly where audio books are concerned i liked the narrator for this book. nothing worse than having a good story destroyed by a poor reader."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In \\"I Am Legend\\" (which is a short novel at best) Robert Neville finds himself the only \\"human\\" in existence. By day he barricades his house with garlic and crosses and searches the barren city in his car looking for food, gasoline and other necessary things to survive. By night, he hears vampires call his name and he can see them as they try desperately to figure out how to get to him.The tension in the book is amazing. Matheson builds up the plot layer by layer and it is clear that Neville's time is running out. Still, Matheson gives you hope that maybe Robert Neville will find other humans or animals that can at least help him try to survive the emotional turmoil and fear that he lives with knowing the vampires want him dead.There are other short stories with this edition and all of them are excellent, but \\"I Am Legend\\" is an incredible vampire story and worth every second of your time to read and see the genius that is Robert Matheson."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Good reading and interesting enough to make it a fast read. I was a littel surprised to find out that I am Legend is a short story. It is followed by many other, much shorter stories. My wife read the book too. She felt there was not a good line of demarcation between I am Legend and the following stories--so much that she was surprised and thought the book was hard to follow.I am Legend though is definitely worth the read. The character is well developed by the end and the story is hard to put down."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I've always found the mythology of the vampire and it's relationship to the human psyche to be extremely facinating. Yet few authors manage to say anything creative about these creatures of the night, and choose instead to portray them merely as either highly sexualized or purely evil caricatures hiding in the shadows from humanity at large. Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\", however, offers a different take on the traditional vampire tale. Following a devestating plague, it is Matheson's human protagonist, Robert Neville, who is hated and hunted by the vampire majority. Alienated from life, from humanity, and the endless plague victims who surround him, he himself becomes a monster. Relatively safe within the confines of his vampire-proofed shelter, Neville's primary enemies are boredom, loneliness, anger and self-doubt. He struggles to fill his days with meaning and hope while gradually loosing ground to the vampires who want his blood.Overall, this is a dramatic, suspenseful and chilling story with an unforgettable ending. The novella's one flaw: it's too short. I wish Matheson had written more about, for example, the emergence of the vampire plague, Neville's relationship with his wife and Ben Cortman. Yet, like any good horror novel, much has to be left to the imagination.For people drawn to this novella because of the recent film adaptation staring Will Smith, I think in the end you may be either disappointed by the film or the story on which it was based (depending on which you experience first and your personal tastes). If you're expecting loads of action, car chases or explosions from this book, then you may be let down."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"IT'S AN END OF THE WORLD NOVEL WITH SOME TWISTS ABOUT VAMPIRE LEGEND.FINE HUMAN DRAMA WILL GET YOUR HEART!

Enjoy it.."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend is one of the best short stories you'll ever read. His next best would be in my opinionThe Shrinking Man (Sf Masterworks). Like with that story you can either choose to buy the story as a standalone novel or in a collection with others of his short stories. Granted not all of his other short stories are in the masterpiece league so depending on price you might want to evaluate your options to either buy I am Legend as a standalone or part of an anthology. It's important to point out that some reviewers have not specified what they are reviewing so don't just assume this book on whichever cover art version you have selected comes with the other stories they mention. As well as standalone books there are various anthologies that come with different short stories inside to other versions.I am Legend is the can't put down thrilling tale of Robert Neville who to his knowledge is the last non vampire on the planet. Even animals seem to also have caught this strange virus. He has a theory of why he's immune but I won't divulge it as it is near the end of the book and I'm not a fan of people who give away spoilers. Anyway his daily existence is filled with repairing his house from the nightly attacks by vampires who want him including his now arch enemy Ben Cortman a former work colleague. On non cloudy days he likes to venture out into the community to get supplies and put a stake through the hearts of vampires he comes across to lessen the amount outside his house each night. A great tale, well written and well worth your money!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Horror novels ever written. Richard Matheson wrote TV & film screenplays (such as Duel) as well as writing his own novels. He wrote The Shrinking Man that The Incredible Shrinking Man was based on.The story has already had two filmed versions of it made (Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man) and another is to be realeased shortly. George Romero's zombie movies were surely influenced by the novel as well. As can be gathered from the above one man remains alive and 'normal' and fights to survive against the ever increasing numbers pitted against him.What is pitted against him, and how the story resolves (I can't tell you...) at the end is very cleverly done and in my admittedly limited litary experience quite unique. This is very well written and easy to read. If you don't believe me ask Stephen King who rates this highly."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Brrr. Horror stories are not my cup of tea. I did enjoy the strangeness of Will Smith in the movie production ofI Am Legend. Often books read after the movie give the reader a deeper understanding of the plot. So I tackled this one.In this case, it's almost a different story. I won't say anymore about this, except that the finale is quite different.This volume is a collection of the \\"I Am Legend\\" novella, and a number of short stories.

Though I really enjyed the movie, the book is exceptional.If you have seen the movie you know the general concept of the book - due to an outbreak of some disease, humanity, except for one, has changed into vampires (the movies were more zombieish).The emotions of alienation and lonliness come through the pages, and there is more here than just a horror or science fiction story (which I read from time time, more so because of movies that I see more than anything else.) It is a debate on actions and what is justified. It is trying to remain human in an inhuman world.And it is an egrossing story overall as he tries to solve mysteries surrounding his world. The writing is able to bring us more into the mind and thoughts, which makes it ultimately more powerful than the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"first i should just say that this book is way better than the movie. the movie really butchered this book. that upset me a lot. i like the book so much more than the movie. i love the cover of the book as well. this book also has short stories but i haven't read them yet.the book really talks a lot more on the lonliness and despair neville feels. how the vampires really were and how they acted. how he really dies and says \\"i am legend\\". how much of an alcohol problem and where he would find solace. he would talk about his wife a lot more than almost anything else in the book. how he misses her. you can really feel how in love he was and how bad he misses her. i could feel how depressed neville was and lonely and the despair he felt.i really loved this book. i couldn't put it down for anything. just one chapter after another of how great this book really is. i would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First of all, let me say that I Am Legend is a true classic and when looked at in the context that it was written in 1954, it is an amazing work. But when you read the book in 2009 and have already seen the Will Smith movie, it is not quite what you expect. The book is very short, only 160 pages or so. Also, the story is very different from the movie. Not saying that either one is better, but they are just very different. I would say that reading the book is definitely worthwhile because it is so different. Say what you want about I Am Legend, but it was certainly a groundbreaking book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson's horror novella, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a finely crafted novel which mixes vampire horror, survivalist end-of-the-world themes, and questions of morality in a world turned upside down. Will Smith's pretentious, overblown film version completely missed the point of this beautifully written and generally frightening novella. Both Vincent Price's \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" and Charleton Heston's \\"The Omega Man\\" were far closer to this book in both story and tone. The protagonist, Robert Neville, is the only survivor of a plague that either kills its victims, or turns them into a flesh-eaten vampires. When Neville begins to kill the vampires in his quest to stay alive and find a cure, he fails to understand the depth of their remaining humanity, and therefore he becomes the monster, he becomes the legend of their nightmares. This is the point that the Will Smith version completely missed. Read the book and then see Price's and Heston's films. You decide which is best."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I saw the movie with my friends and liked it a lot, but one them told me it had changed things (specifically the ending) quite a bit from the book. But he wouldn't be specific. \\"Read the book,\\" he said. Well, I mumbled and grumbled, but finally I got the book. It has been totally worth it.I'm not going to bother doing a comparison between film and novel--it's best to appreciate them on their individual merits. I will tell that I Am Legend was an intriguing reimagining of the vampire genre. It looks to science not magic for an explanation for vampiric phenomena, while following an individual who is trying to survive a world that appears to be in its death throes.This book contains other short stories by Matheson. I have not read all of them, but the ones I read were pretty good. Clearly I Am Legend is his best work, but his others stuff isn't bad either.This certainly is a book I would recommend on its own merits, but would caution movie groupies to be prepared for the differences."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Wonderfully fast paced and extremely well written don't begin to do this gem of a book justice. Written in 1954!!! I'm in awe - it is that good.I'm not gonna go on about the plot or characters, other reviews do that.I rented it from the Library, because I liked the deeply flawed movie. The movie in only very minor ways matches the book. The book IS better. WAY. BETTER. I loved it. You will too - go read it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet for all the quick broswers out there. This is very different from the film version released with Will Smith in the lead role. While some ideas were carried over to the film, the story is superior in almost every way. I Am Legend was a good film with some great acting from Will and his furry companion, but the book is much darker and has less of a \\"Hollywood\\" ending. One large fact about the book, that wasn't obvious to me before I purchased it, half of the book is actually I Am Legend. The rest is a collection of short stories that are a nice surprise, as they give you a break from the loneliness of the first half of the book. Great book and it will not dissappoint fans of horror/suspense and fans of post-apocalyptic settings."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The premise of this story is very simple. A man named Robert Neville is the last man alive on Earth. Everyone else have become vampires and this story is about Robert's life being alone in a world full of hideous beings. It is a very simple and basic premise and yet Richard Matheson has taken it and spun a really deep and complex tale out of it.All throughout the book, there are instances where we truly feel for Robert, the pain and frustration he goes through on a daily basis. He struggles with the isolation of being alone, the defeat of not able to find a cure for vampirism, the mysteries surrounding vampirism, and ultimately the seeming 'betrayal' of a woman named Ruth, the only living being he knows after the plaque. Mr. Matheson describes all of this in beautiful, beautiful prose. Not only that, he also has a knack for creating believable characters; all of these characters, even his animal ones, behave the way they should, and it is a delight to read about them.There were some highly technical parts of the book which I felt dragged the pace down, but not too badly as to make the book feel too long-winded. For the most part, the story chugs along nicely.One more thing I've noticed about I AM LEGEND was that it felt very allegorical of the problems we have in our world today. Man is a very territorial and violent species and we see that even in a post-apocalytic context, wars and conflicts of interest can still happen, and will happen.I am Legend is truly a triumph of story telling, Mr. Matheson was clearly at the top of his game when he wrote it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This started as an interesting lone-survivor/end of the world story. I was disappointed at the lack of any \\"End of the World\\" feeling or story. The author missed an opportunity.I quickly grew bored with Neville's sniveling and drinking.There were lots of things in the story that were unclear. The twist at the end was a surprise. In fact, so surprising that I'm not sure what happened.I was annoyed to find that it was a novella (about 160 pages) with a collection of short stories. The novella, I am Legend, was why I bought the book. I read the first six short stories. They read like not quite complete Twilight Zone or Night Gallery episodes. I may read the rest of the stories eventually, but I was not interested enough to finish them now.I am Legend was a good enough story, but the telling of it had holes. The writing was uninspired.As mediocre as this book was, it was worlds better than \\"The Road.\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" is the riveting psychological thriller about someone who might be the last man on earth. Robert Neville is the only person he knows that is not infected with or dead from a epidemic that turns ordinary people into bloodthirsty monsters. The ultimate survivalist, Neville spends his days preparing for the nightly attacks by his former neighbors and others who not only want him dead; they want to drink his blood. Neville not only has the stress of fighting for his life, but he also must deal with the internal problems of living with loneliness with no end in sight. Are there others who were immune to the plague? Will he find them? Should he go in search of them? Richard Matheson delves deep into the mind of the ultimate outsider in this amazing work of fiction.\\" I Am Legend\\" is just one of the stories in this multistory volume. The rest of the stories range from pointless three page stories that make you wonder why you bothered even opening the book to riveting short stories that could be episodes from \\"The Twilight Zone\\", which Matheson wrote tele-plays for. All told even though \\"I Am Legend\\" deserves a 5 star rating as a short novel, the some of the other stories drag this volume down to a 3.5."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Fast paced. I couldn't put I Am Legend down. Hell House is my favorite haunted house story. It is not appropriate for young adults, or children. Both stories far outshine the movies based on them, and the movies are great for that era."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a book that is supposedly about vampires, but in fact it really ends up being about normality and stereotypes. If you are interested in a book that turns normal genre roles on their head this will not disappoint. I am not much interested in vampire nonsense but this was so highly recommended by a friend I had to read it and it justified the praise. Interestingly enough it also deals with the question of boredom: What would you do if you had all the time in the world and no one to talk to? The extra stories at the end are quite short and look more like aborted attempts at novels, skim read over them, one or two are worth a read. However, the main feature deserves the reputation it has."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I first ordered I Am Legend because I read that it was going to be turned into a movie, but now that I've read it I'm dreading the big screen version because I know that it won't do the book justice. Without giving anything away let me just say that the book has a less than happy ending which adds to the story, but the movie makers will probably change for the adaptation. When I heard that Will Smith is going to be in the motion picture, I cringed. When have you ever seen a Will Smith movie that didn't have a happy ending? Hollywood is going to turn this book into Blade IV:Sucking Hard.The book is about Robert Neville, who is seemingly the last human man on Earth. The story delves in detail into the meticulous preparations into which Neville goes to fend off the vampires. During the day he can travel freely outside and stake the undead while they slumber, but at night he is at the mercy of the bloodsucking horde and must stay locked in his house. The book also invetigates what started the vampirism in the first place and Neville's quest to find a cure which is fascinating and probably could have been a book in its own right. For some unknown reason Neville himself is immune to the vampirism so if he gets scratched or bitten he doesn't have to worry about being turned, but he can still die. Neville is desperate for companionship and finally encounters a young seemingly human woman that walks around in the daylight. Bringing her into his home he is leery at first and then begins to trust her. This leads to a conclusion fitting of a Legend. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This version of \\"I am Legend\\" is a tad misleading. \\"Legend\\" only takes up about half of this book. The rest of the 300 some pages are left to some very short works, some only a few pages long. The good news is that \\"I am Legend\\" is worth the price of admission alone. The bad news is that few of the remaining stories aren't really worth exploring.\\"I am Legend\\" is a vampire tale set in Mathenson's future of the mid 1970's (Mathenson wrote this book in the 50's). Our protagonist, Richard Neville, seems to be the one sole survivor of a worldwide plague of vampirism. He spends his days scrounging for food and tools as best as he can and his nights barricaded inside his fortified home as the victims of the plague surround his house, taunt him, and try to coax him out. Neville eventually becomes obsessed with the plague, why he survived, and if he can possible find a cure. The story has several well developed layers and an ending that keeps you briskly turning the pages.As for the others stories, few with the exception of \\"Person to Person\\" stands out. \\"Person to Person\\" starts out as ringing in the ears of our protagonist and leads to the invasion of his mind by an unknown force. Other stories deal with living Fetish Dolls, funerals for vampires, and crazed husbands. All the themes boil down to \\"death\\". Death is a major theme amongst most authors, especially horror writers, but no one seems to wear it on his sleeve more than Mathenson does in this series of stories.\\"I am Legend\\": 5 StarsThe rest of the book: 3 StarsAverage: 4 Stars"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"That's right, what was I doing when I could have been reading this book? 'I am Legend' is perhaps one of the finest reading experiences that I have encountered in some time. I love horror, and I cannot believe that I missed this one for so long. I would highly recomend 'I am Legend' to any fan of the genre, yet it goes beyond that. The story, although taking place in the late 70's, was written in 1955. The book holds up incredibly well in this day and age, and that is a true testament to the author Richard Matheson's genius. I fully intend to read into the rest of his works."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Sure, it's only February as I am writing this and I've only read 5 or 6 books but the title still stands.I am Legend was my first introduction to the wonderful Richard Matheson. I had never heard of him before this book and picked it up after noticing the many recommendations on a particular good vampire novel thread. The book itself is presented well and not only includes the great I am Legend but also a variety of short stories from the author some of which are as gripping as the novel itself. This is a book you'll fly through due to it's short nature but also because the writing style lends itself to quick reading with Matheson using mainly short sentences in his work. Therefore, it's not too complex and reads very well.The story follows one character for the majority of the novel. Robert Neville is the last living man in his area. He has boarded himself up in his home in hopes of evading the constant swarms of vampires that haunt him nightly(He goes out during the day and does some hunting of his own). The vampires here are not what I was expecting. Most vampire novels I've read present us with vampires as intelligent creatures. The vampires here are more akin to zombies with their lack of intelligence and primal instincts. Therefore, the novel centers around Robert Neville with no specific vampire characters.You can probably finish this book in one sitting. Some of the writing is particularly fantastic. One scene early in the play has Robert Neville staying out too late and having to speed home to avoid the zombies. The writing in that scene is just perfect with short quick, and thrilling sentences that really suck you into the novel.I give this book high praises not only for I am Legend but also the numerous quality short stories from Richard Mathenson. Not all of them in that group are good, but the majority are and all of them are worth reading. If you're looking for a good vampire novel, or even if you're a fan of zombie flicks then you should definitely pick up this book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is such a outstanding book. It is completely original and told in a unique way. The story is also keep short and this also was the right thing to do. I mean you can only go so long with a story about the only human left on the planet. Be forewarned this is without a doubt the darkest story I have ever read. This is not bad, on the contrary it really gives the story an atheneic feel. You really feel like you are there, like your looking through his eyes. Wow, how depressing and frightning.If you like horror and want to read something completely original in every aspect then by all means find a copy and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Only one guy left on earth, trying to survive. Should be boring, but it isn't. Instead the novel becomes a type of modern-day Crusoe as the main character tries, day by day, to improve his living conditions and gain more essential knowledge about the creatures that stalk him by night. As you can imagine, many things need to be taken care of to ensure this man stays alive; food must be procured, shelter must be protected, travel arranged, water source provided, etc. This isn't a vampire story; it's a story about survival. A story about survival with a totally awesome ending."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Haven't seen the movie because I wanted to read the book first. If you like apocalyptic-themed books, this one is a must."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was disappointed at first that the story line was so different from the movie starring Will Smith, which I loved! But I just had to let go of that and realize that this was a different but similar story, a good read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A fascinating exposition about what it means to be a monster cleverly wrapped into a chilling horror classic. The book is indescribably better than any filmed versions (all of which remove the meaning of the title completely in my opinion), and one I consistently recommend for others to read. It's short and easy to get through, driven by fast-paced dialogue and just enough description.Additionally, the other short stories in the collection are disturbing -- in a good way. Many feel like they could have easily been some of his Twilight Zone episodes."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really liked this book.

It was so different I actually don't know if the director of the movie even read the book at all lol. Still worth reading though and was actually glad it was so different because it would have been boring if it was the same as the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"After seeing the movie with Will Smith, I was interested to read the book that supposedly birthed the idea for the movie, so I thought I'd give it a go (and costing only $3.99 wasn't bad either). This book was different from the movie (aren't they all) and in my opinion was more interesting because it offered a much clearer look inside Neville's head. His motivations for his actions, his wide-ranging and fast-changing emotions allowed me to connect with him much better than the movie in that I, like many people, have felt these same emotions. The author did a great job of helping the reader to relate to how he was feeling.The flashbacks confused me a very tiny bit, but they were easy to get along with once you figured out what was going on. All in all, a very good read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Started off odd because it just jumps in not telling what is happening but once you quickly figure out what you're dealing with it gets good.

I would recommend to my friends!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"To my understanding, this book is what most modern vampire and zombie movies are based. A great ready for any fan of the genre,but yet also a great read for anyone who likes a well written book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Synopsis: The world has been taken over by a powerful virus, leaving one man alone to fend for himself. Robert Neville is the apparently the last man on earth, with every other human being either dead or undead (infected by a virus causing vampire-like qualities). Neville is completely alone, while the vampires outside taunt him relentlessly. He develops a routine to gathering supplies and experimenting on sleeping vampires during the day, and then locks himself in at night. This may make it seem like a simple story, however each chapter brings in a little twist.Thoughts: I read this book before watching the movie or even knowing what it was about (if that's even possible)... It turned out to be one of the most engaging books I have ever read--there was rarely a time when I could put it down. Every part of the story is fascinating. Neville is the last man alive, so you read what he is thinking and feeling rather than experiencing it through dialogue or character description. You read about how lonely he feels, how hopeless he feels because of the loneliness, the excitement he feels when he sees a stray dog, the unease when he comes in contact with another human, etc. You are in his head the entire time, and so you feel every emotion he is going through. The only problem I had with the book was the ending. (For my thoughts on the ending, scroll to the end of this post). This story is a must-read. The character of Neville is so thoroughly ingrained as a part of the reader that every action he takes seems real. His obsession with researching the virus and finding a cure will be able to explain every vampire novel (or movie) you have ever read (or seen).There are also many short stories contained in this book:Buried Talents: a man is surprisingly skilled at a carnival game.-The description and repetition will bring the story alive. This was my favorite story.The Near Departed: a man plans his wife's funeral-Very creepy!Prey: a voodoo doll comes alive-This one started out very exciting, but I lost interest about halfway through. The ending was predictable.Witch War: Young girls create war-I didn't enjoy this one very much.Dance of the Dead: Young college students visit a nearby town to party-This one was especially creepy, but I had a hard time staying interested.Dress of White Silk: A little girl narrates and describes how she misses her mother-This one was creepy, particularly because young children were involved. I don't think I really understood the ending.Mad House: A man's anger transfers to the house he lives in.-I had a hard time getting into this one because of the repetitive introduction, but I quickly grew interested as the story went on. This is one of the longer short stories, so there was more detail and the story was more developed.The Funeral: A vampire wants a proper funeral.-This one was actually funny. A vampire wants to have a real funeral and invites all of his monster friends.From Shadowed Places: A man must be cured of an African curse-At first this one was interesting, but then when it got into the cure I was a bit turned off. It just wasn't interesting to me.Person to Person: A man can't get rid of the ringing in his head.-A man hears an unexplainable ringing in his head every night at the same time. His therapist insists it's a psychological problem, but the man believes it's something real. The ending is creepy.**SPOILER***************************I didn't like that the people of the \\"new\\" society were merely findingways to remain human (and just live with their disease). I feel like itwould have been interesting to see them develop a completely newsociety that lived during the night and slept in the day. Because ifthey just wanted to live with the virus, then what was the point ofusing supplements to try and suppress it? And why get rid of everyonefrom the \\"old\\" society if they are just trying to be more like them?[...]."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I purchased this book because of the movie, thinking it would be similar. I guess in a way it is, last person alive, vampires trying to get to him. What I didn't realize was this book was written back in the 50s and it really doesn't have anything to do with the movie with Will Smith. Now this is a short book, it's pretty good, I like the idea, but I prefer books more closer to my era. It's very easy reading, a page turner. If you are looking for a good quick read this is the book for you. If you are looking for the movie in writing, avoid this book.

This is a collection of short stories, and I enjoyed I Am Legend better than the others included. This is a great imaginative twist building on vampire stories of the past. It has a much darker outlook than the movie. I think Hollywood decided it couldn't leave their audience hanging without hope. I preferred the original story to the movie, but enjoyed both.The influence that Richard Matheson had on Stephen King is apparent."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The story is absolutely FANTASTIC, but beware that this book is I Am Legend coupled with several short stories. There is no indication of this to be found anywhere.I wouldn't mind except that I was a few \\"chapters\\" past I Am Legend thinking the story just took a massive twist before realizing what was going on. Do you have any idea how dissatisfying it is to finish a book without knowing it haha?Just something to keep in mind, but aside from that, I fully recommend this book. I Am Legend is a GREAT story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Contrary to common belief, I Am Legend is not a vampire novel. What this book is in reality is a series a short horror stories written by Richard Matheson that range from the 160 page long story I Am Legend from which the book gets its name to a three page story called The Near Departed. Although I must admit that I Am Legend, the first and longest of the stories, is far and away the best, only talking about that one part does a disservice to the other ten incredible stories that are collected here. I will do a short review on each story in this book.I Am Legend, 5/5, 160 pages. WAY better then the movie.The new movie I Am Legend, staring Will Smith, takes place in New York City after a \\"cure\\" for cancer mutates and turns the worlds population into flesh eating zombie/vampire mutts that can only come out at night. the movie was unimpressive, the book is outstanding.Everyone knows the basic plot of this story, there is only one man left alive in a world full of vampires, but despite what you might expect from a plot like that this isn't an action novel. In fact there is very little in the way of action or suspense and for the most part in moves a slower pace. What makes this book amazing is the attention to detail that author Richard Matheson put into his post apocalyptic tale. Main character Robert Neville starts out about 3 months after last seeing another human being, held up in his house at night as thousands of undead vampires call for him to come out. every day is a rigid routine, fix the houses defenses, throw the dead corpses he finds on his lawn every morning into a fire, hunt for vampires, make stakes to hunt more vampires, and then back inside before nightfall and drink himself to death. As time goes by he starts to learn how to deal with the vampires, how they live and how they die; what they are and why the act the way they do. He conducts experiments, for instance why do vampires fear crosses? Why does garlic repel them? Why do only stakes kill them? Does said stake need to go though the heart to kill? These are all fascinating questions and we get answers to them all.But what makes this story a true masterpiece is the ending. I will not spoil it for you who haven't read the book yet (and I encourage you to do so as soon as possible) but lets just say that it is truly amazing. If you've seen the movie, brace yourself for a shock. I am very confused as to why any writer would want to tamper with such an amazing ending, why would anyone touch this gold?I Am Legend has been made into three motion pictures from the originalThe Last Man on EarthtoThe Omega Manto this years blockbuster I Am Legend. Not only that, but horror master George Romero said it was the inspiration for his horror classicNight of the Living Dead. Truly I Am Legend is one of the most influential horror stories in history.Buried Talents, 4/5, 8 pages. An interesting story.Right off the bat I expected another short story that takes place in the I Am Legend universe, but the rest of the stories are completely independent and have nothing to do with one another. Do not go into this story expecting to read more about Vampires and garlic.Buried Talents is a curies piece indeed. At only 8 pages this story brings up a lot of questions but never answers them, allowing the reader to come up with their own conclusions. In this short, a carnival man runs a booth where players try to throw ping pong balls into a fishing bowl to win a prize. No one seems to be able to do it, until a mysterious man walks up and lays down his quarters. He hits every shot, making the balls go into the bowl without so much as bouncing on the bottom, and then makes the two others land right next to them in the same fashion. He keeps this up for the whole story until the very end when the carnival man tells him to leave. Doesn't sound interesting right? Sound stupid? You'd be wrong. Once again, the ending is what makes this story good. Until the very last paragraph this story isn't anything special, but the last two lines make this a story to remember.The Near Departed, 3 pages, 5/5. Short and to the point.There really isn't a lot I can say about this gem of a story, not without giving away any spoilers. Think of this story as a joke, a three page joke and nothing more. Once again, the last paragraph of this story is simply amazing.Prey, 15 pages, 5/5. Chuckey's inspiration?Its inconceivable that one book, or rather a collection of short stories, could not only be the inspiration for Night of the Living Dead, but also for a little film calledChild's Playthis that might just be the case. Prey is a nail biting thriller about an African doll called \\"This is he who hunts\\" comes to life and starts attacking its owner. Although I don't know for sure whether or not this story inspired Childs Play, it is very safe to bet that the director of that film must have read this book and used it in some way. Although there are parts in this story that just don't make much sense (how can a doll overpower a full grown woman?) it is none the less a very entertaining read. If you liked Childs Play, you'll love this gem.With War, 7 pages, 3/5. Huh?Now this is a strange one indeed. Matheson goes for the surreal and the supernatural in this story even more so then previously, but in the end this story is just too off the wall to be taken seriously. set in an alternate world (or possibly WWI, its hard to tell) Witch War starts off with seven cute little girls talking happily with each other about, well, girl stuff. Gossip, cloths, hairstyles, stuff like that. Then a soldier enters the room and informs them of an upcoming attack.\\"Oh my, here we go again,\\" one of them says.Outside in the rain a group of soldiers, supported by trucks and tanks, are attempting to attack the city the girls are supposedly in. Out of nowhere lightning starts to strike, lions and tigers jump out of the rain, the tanks blow up in huge fireballs and the mud starts to consume the troops as they run; you know, friendly stuff like that. Although this is an interesting story, I can hardly say it's up to the high standard set by previous entries.Dance of the Dead, 19 pages, 3/5. Leaves too many questions unanswered.I know I know, I said the same thing about Buried Talents and still gave that story a 4, so why not this one? Well, because this story tries to be a little more ambitious. For one thing it's longer and has room to expand and answer some of the questions it raises, and for another it creates a whole different world that is never explained or elaborated on. Set, I guess, some time in the not so distant future, the government is in a weakened state in the aftermath of a devastating war. four teenagers go on a trip to the city to see what they call the \\"Loopy Dance.\\" a Loopy, apparently, is a dead corpse that reanimates because of some chemical and does a strange kind of dance. Although the dystopian future intrigued me, nothing really happens of interest during this story, and that's the main reason for the lower rating.Dress of White Silk, 6 pages, 4.5/5. What just happened?That was my immediate reaction after reading Dress of White Silk. What happened? What did that ending mean? Although I have my guesses, there really is no way to know for sure that I'm right or wrong (don't worry, I won't spoil it for you). Written in the head of a young girl, maybe 7 years old give or take, this story is very simply written to say the least. Here's an example of the kind of writing you can expect.Pg , 213. \\"When I pretend I brush my hair long. But I only use my own brush from my room. I didn't never use mommas brush.\\"Although this kind of writing can be a little hard to get though, it is very appropriate for the kind of story being told. It's told though the mind of a very little girl after all, so this incomplete writing is very nice to see and shows the versatility of Matheson. The ending is what truly got me hooked on this. It seems that almost every ending in this book is brilliant.Mad house, 72 pages, 5/5. Inspiration for Monster House?Yes, once again, Matheson delivers another inspiration for another movie, this time the kids filmMonster House (Widescreen Edition), although the book itself is anything but kid friendly. Mad House is about struggling writer/professor whose life is leaving him and can't seem to control his anger. The angrier he gets, the more accidents he starts to have around the house. A rug slips out from under his feet, a pencil points break off and sticks into his finger, his chair falls down, ect. His friend warns him that he's afraid that if he doesn't control his anger, his house might actually turn on him, which of course is exactly what happens.This is one of the longer stories in this book, and also one of the best. The story makes the main character is sole focus, diving into he mind and fleshing out what kind of person he really is. Along with Robert Neville from I Am Legend, the main character from this story (I can't remember his name right now) is probably one of the best characters in this book. The story really is about him, at least up until Matheson gives us yet ANOTHER killer ending. My God, how many can be pull off?The Funeral, 10 pages, 3/5. My least favorite.Why is that? Well, because it's a not so funny comedy about vampires and goblins and such. a man tries to run a funeral home when a vampire walks in and say he wants a funeral because the one he had in real life wasn't that great and now he wants to make up for it. What follows is a somewhat humorous tale as all his vampire friends come for the ceremony and try to eat the poor owner. Overall a nice story but nothing great.From Shadowed Places, 25 pages, 4/5. Warning, graphic content ahead.This is, far and away, the most graphic of all the stories in this book. Naked people galore, African voodoo, more naked people, lots and lots of sexual content so if that's not your cup of tea stay away. The story itself really isn't half bad. A man is being tortured by some African witch doctor and is slowly dieing a horrible death. When his fianc&eacute; calls for help, they get their friend Dr. Howl, a woman who just happens to have been taught all about African voodoo while on a trip to the Dark Continent. But the only way she can get the voodoo out of him is to, uhh, get naked and pretend to be having sex with him, no kidding. Still a very good read.Person to Person, 23 pages, 5/5. The second best.After I Am Legend, Person to Person is my favorite story here. When a man starts hearing a phone in his head, he tries to find a way to make it stop, but to no avail. When he gets the bright idea to answer the phone (in his head of course) a mysterious stranger starts talking to him on the other end. Who is this man? A government agent testing a new way of communication? An inventor using him as a guinea pig? His long dead father? His uncounsis mind? Every time he \\"answers\\" the phone, he gets a different story. Little does he know that this voice in his mind has sinister plans for him. This story also has one heck of an ending. I'm surprised no one has made this story into a movie or something.OVERVIEW.You must read this book, whether or not you are a fan of the movies. This horror classic inspired so many movies and books it's not even funny. It inspired Romero's Night of the Living Dead, which inspired every other zombie movie every made, enough said. No horror fan can afford to be without this classic book. Do yourself a favor and buy it now.Re-read value; high."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A man, perhaps the last human alive, has to fight off otherworldly-plague created vampires by day, and try and hide and survive during the night.Alone in his quest, and dealing in gore and violence in large amounts, every day, does not do wonders for his mental health, needless to say."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I picked this book up because I had nothing else to read, and it was within my favorite genre. I had no idea of what it was about. The only thing I knew about it was that it was one of the books that made Stephen King want to write novels. So, either it's good, or it's great.It turns out it's neither. This book captured me for the whole three hours it took for me to read it. I couldn't put it down. It is now my favorite book.The book is about a man's dealings with vampires. For some reason, and I don't know why, even though vampires have been over-written in the past couple of decades, the story in &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is engrossing.If you like the genre, do not miss this book. This is a must read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I don't normally like short stories but this book is full of great short stories! Each one has a wonderfully horrible twist'ed' ending. I found myself unable to put the book down. The novel &quot;I am Legend&quot; was outstanding. You really got into Robert Neville's world and I found myself wondering what I would do in his position. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is just a great example of a pacy, exciting and thoughtful novel. The book begins by introducing us to Robert Neville, the last man alive on earth after the rest of the population have been killed or turned into vampires by a strange disease. By night he barricades himself in his house and plays opera and gets drunk, by day he makes stakes and goes about hunting the vampires who were once his friends and neighbours...The book is so good at giving you that feel of deserted cities and landscapes and as a result, a strong sense of loneliness that Robert Neville feels. He drives through once busy streets that now stand deserted and quiet. His vampire neighbours taunt him and scream all night keeping him awake in his boarded-up house and making him go slowly crazy. No-one makes products anymore or works in a store, money is meaningless, no fashion, no weather forecasts, no telephones and the only power from a petrol run generator.How long can he survive in this world on his own and will he want to? How can he stay untouched by the acts of killing his friends and neighbours during the day? How long will the petrol and food last for? and what if they break into his house one night or he gets tired and careless?You find yourself constantly questioning how he lives, right up until the final page and the upside down revelation that makes you go, 'huh?'Oh and you get to see where Stephen King got all his best ideas from, too."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was really enjoying I Am Legend when it suddenly ended just partway through the book. What I didn't realize, was that this classic vampire yarn is only a novella, and that the rest of this paperback is filled with other short horror stories by the author. Whereas I Am Legend is still a good read, generally standing the test of time, the other stories are almost comically outdated. In an era of greatly sophisticated horror films and novels, these short stories of yesterday seem almost like a caricature of themselves, though they must have been scary enough when they were first published. If you're interested in an absorbing vampire tale, definitely pick up a copy of I Am Legend. Just don't expect it to last for an entire flight across the Atlantic."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is wonderful! Matheson has inspired me to write my own novel. I absolutely loved this book. It was by far the creepiest story I have ever read. The beginning of the book just screams to be made into a movie (there have already been 2 made: The Last Man On Earth starring Vincent Price, and The Omega Man starring Charlton Heston). I heard that there would be another movie made starring Arnold Schwarzenegger but I hope to God that the film never comes out."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I normally do not like to read books from the horror genre. Occasionally I will read a Stephen King book or something along those lines. I had read some reviews of I Am Legend on Amazon, and when I saw it at the library, it was a very thin book, so I thought why not.What I found was an Orwellian book about human nature, about the desire to continue on, to assimilate. I would compare this book to Animal Farm on several levels.Furthermore, the writing is superb. I understand that this was only Matheson's third book, but his brilliance with the written word, and his understanding of the human condition, was already evident.Horror fans should not miss reading this book. I am not an expert on horror writing, but I believe this book would have to be considered on of the best ever written in that genre. However, if you are not a horror or vampire fan, you should still try this book.I think it would be nearly impossible for anyone who is a fan of great writing to dismiss this book. Read it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I re-read this book about every year to year and a half. that's how great it is. i've included this book with kerouac's on the road, kafka's work, and many other works that have had huge influence on me. everything about the book is great, the voice matheson uses, great plot (ahead of his time using science as an explanation for vampires), believable characters, and a good ending, with one of the best last lines i've ever read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was apprehensive about getting this book because of all the &quot;good&quot; reviews surrounding it. I am somewhat skeptical of what everyone else thinks is good because I like to form my own opinions. It's not that I go out looking for things with bad reviews, (because most of the time, they're right *grin*) just that I don't like to be overly influenced by other people. However in this case I can assure you, the hype is all that. All the stories in this collection are worth your while. Some are funny, some gross, all intriguing. I am Legend is the stand alone best though. It reminded me of The Omega Man, a movie with Charleton Heston, or perhaps it should be other way around. . .I am not sure about the dates. The one &quot;true&quot; man against a world of monsters. It is fantastic, people at work kept giving me strange looks because of how obivously into the book I was. I read it very fast, then again, it goes fast once you get past I am Legend, which takes up most of the book. The book is set up with I am Legend which is like 126 pages or so, and the others are kind of tag alongs, they don't deal with the first story at all, in fact none of the stories are related in any way, but as I said before, each have their own flavor and I loved each one and began to respect Mr. Matheson more and more as I went on. Check it out, if you're into horror, you don't know what you're missing.

But that is not the reason I read today. I read to be entertained. 50 years ago I am sure it was cutting edge, but today it is slow and borderline boring.The story itself only takes up 154 pages.

He drinks all day and sleeps all night almost everyday for two years. He spends his days starring at naked zombie women. That is pretty much the book until the ending that is beyond stupidity, It makes the book useless. He contributed nothing in the story and somehow he is a legend. I for one have never seen a legend do nothing and then fail at everything else."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is has been misrepresented as the entire \\"I Am Legend,\\" rather than a compliation of short stories. Of course, it is my ignorance that led me to believe that I Am Legend was a novel rather than a short story.Regardless, the story starts off as an attention grabber, but it only goes downhill from there. While Matheson creates a fabulous premise for a novel, he fails to deliver a well developed literary work -- particularly with the end. It just falls flat, as if Matheson got bored and decided to cut it short.I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, becuase most times the book has greater detail and character development, particularly when the book precedes the movie and with these such subjects. However, this time, I am hoping that Hollywood can save this book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I didn't like this book at all. Most probably because I watched the movie first and I am a big Will Smith fan. I realize the book was written first but there are a lot of people like me who bought the book thinking it was an adaptation of the movie, considering the jacket has a big picture of Will Smith on it. Well, since I thought the movie was awesome and I wanted to read what I thought would be an in-depth and detailed version of the movie, I settled down to enjoy, only to be surprisingly disappointed. I quickly realized that the book was almost completely different from the movie. First and foremost, the Neville that Will Smith plays in the movie is worlds apart from the wimpy, out of shape, slob of a guy in the book. Will Smith's character was strong, both physically and mentally and he was a scientist of some renown, doing expert tests and analysis to find a cure for the disease. The Neville in the book was an emotional un-kept wreck who smoked and drank himself into oblivion. Yuck! And it's obvious that he doesn't have a clue about the disease because he has to drag himself out of a drunken stupor to go to the library and get books to learn about it. However, one of the biggest differences is that in the movie, Neville has a dog. It wouldn't be so bad but the dog (Sam) plays such a major part in the movie! I mean, a big part of what makes the movie so good is Neville's relationship with his dog and she (Sam) is not even in the book! And on top of that, the mannequin (Dave) in the movie is actually Neville's next door neighbor, turned vampire leader in the book. In the book the vampires actually talk and they attacked Neville's house on a nightly basis. In the movie, they were more creatures than vampires and they didn't even know where Neville lived, at least not until the end. I understand that there are those who read the book first and because the movie was so different, they can justifiably complain about that, but the fact remains that this book was sold with Will Smith on the jacket. That, and the fact that this is nothing but a compilation of short stories that have nothing to do with each other is a gross deception to the consumer. I could go on and on about all the various things I found wrong with this book but why bother. Suffice it to say that the book was just boring. I couldn't even finish it. What a big disappointment..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was given this book as a gift. I wanted to read the book before I went and saw the movie. I now hope the movie is better than the book because the book leaves a lot to be desired. I also didn't know the story would end halfway through the novel and was mildly surprised at the ending. I can't say I'm a huge fan of \\"horror\\" novels anyways, but this takes the cake for worst I've read. Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I wouldn't waste my time with this novel. Its' unrealistic portrayal of the protaganist is odd even for the realm of Science Fiction. Neville's bizarre fits of sexual lust and his awful decision making leave you shaking your head. His situational awareness is like that of a chicken. Who acts this way?? He's a ridiculous person who has been given a chance no one else has, and he blows it. The scientific jargon is silly and dated to the extreme. You don't care for him at all, and if that is the point, what a waste of time."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am an avid reader; I read perhaps 3-4 novels a month. I've read dozens of horror/suspense novels from great authors like King, Koontz and Ludlum. I've also managed to find some less than impressive offerings. This however, is among the worst. I'm sure it has great literary prowess, but I found it difficult to follow and ultimately unsasifying. Many times it seems to lose track of the basic story motivation, and becomes soley about the characters battle with alcohol and self-loathing. It is a virtual certainty that movies spawned from a novel don't live up to its forebearer, but in this case, I think the movie has improved upon it exponentially."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It was okay.

The book is billed as \\"one of the greatest vampire stories\\" and while I thought it was good, it wasn't as suspenseful or scary as I had hoped. The novel is very short and ends rather abruptly, and the majority of it is rather tedious. It talks an awful lot about Neville's day to day activities, and the pacing seemed slow, especially for such a short novel. I was irritated by how much liquor and glassware he wasted in the novel, it seemed he was constantly smashing his glass on the floor or the wall. The part with the dog was the best part, really the first time I got in touch with the character. The novel was decent overall, at least for the fact that it seemed much more realistic than the majority of modern vampire stories. If I had read this before all the hype was out, I probably would have liked it more. I just was expecting something else.I actually enjoyed the other short stories in the book better. They were strange and often very confusing, with all the same outcome: is this person crazy, or is this stuff really going on? Matheson does a good job at making the implausible seem real. The book was worth it just to read a few of those short stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I made the mistake of seeing the movie first. I was warned that the book was different, and as far as I am concerned, they could have been completely unrelated. As a Stephen King lover, it's fair to say that horror is probably my favorite genre where fiction is concerned. Having said that, short horror stories don't usually do it for me. I like details, and in that respect, I felt this book was lacking. Neville started projects and left them unfinished, how the \\"infected\\" evolved or what it meant to be living or undead was never really explained, and there were several other things that left me thinking. I don't mind a book that makes me think, but answer SOME questions, for crying out loud. All in all, not a complete disappointment. It was good for 2 nights' reading, and I think had I not seen the movie first, it might have ranked 4 stars. Bottom line: For me, the movie was FAR better... Or maybe I just missed something."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Anyone who has seen the recent movie starring Will Smith knows the basic idea: one man, alone, and vampires. Lots of vampires. And lots of scary. That said, the book in its particulars is very different from the movie.I'm having a hard time deciding how I feel about it. I saw the movie first, and I wish I hadn't. The movie version changed so much: the location, the main character, some major plot points. For the movie, the story was flattened and simplified, more clear-cut. The adrenaline level was ramped up for some jump-out-of-your-seat moments.The book is more subtle and creepy, less jolting. Themes of evolution and questions about human survival are explored in an intriguing way. The story is well-written, and not nearly as dated as you'd expect, given this was first published 50 years ago. And yet, I really hoped for something more intense, some culmination of the suspense and lurking danger. The movie was all about loud noises and climactic fights, and I guess it left me expecting something that the book was not written to deliver. That's not fair, but it did color my experience.Librarians: this book is a must-read, if only for the passage that takes place in LAPL's Central Library.

I am Legend is the most brillant piece of vampire fiction that I have ever read- and trust me I have read almost all of it out there. I am a Master's student in Literature and I took a vampire literature course as an undergrad, where I read I am Legend for the first time. Matheson is brillant, and many of the stories that were in the book in addition to the title story were made into Twilight Zone Episodes, which I realized after watching 48 hours of Twilight Zone over New Years break- the stories seemed uncanny, so I check the writer of the episodes- and sure enough- Richard Matheson. Not to mention, years ago as a teenager I watched the movie Trilogy of Terror which scared the pants off of me, the scariest part was one which I found out in college was inspired by Prey, a short story in I Am Legend. Matheson is truly a great horror writer, who will scare your pants off."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Despite being reasonably entertaining and diverting at times, &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is ultimately unsuccessful. Despite its short length, it becomes quite silly and boring after a while. And the inept, juvenile redundancies! How many times must the reader be subjected to descriptions of whiskey being drunk, spilled or thrown across a room? Who does Matheson think he is, Charles Jackson?Comparatively speaking, this book is inferior to Matheson's very good &quot;Hell House,&quot; but superior to his awful &quot;Now You See It.&quot;As for the stories in &quot;I Am Legend&quot; -- they are singularly amateurish and sophomoric, and I don't know how I got through them. If they constituted the book, without the presence of the novella, my rating would fall to one star.The bottom line? Younger readers will enjoy this book, but more sophisticated and experienced ones will be less than thrilled."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This novella is sloppy, vague, and suffers from poor editing. It's unreasonable to call this work a classic of any kind. Matheson is loose with his details: within the first couple of pages, we have a main character in the 'afternoon' sunlight, enjoying his 'mid-morning drink.' Strange duststorms spread vampirism-causing bacteria worldwide. But what exactly does the bacteria do? It kills people; or rather, it turns recently-dead people into vampires; or rather, it kills people and within a few days it turns them into vampires; or exactly what does it do? Matheson never makes it clear. A significant point of the plot is that there are two main categories of vampires: those who were already dead, and turned into vampires by the bacteria, and those who were infected by the bacteria while alive, and turned into 'living vampires;' the two types have different behaviors and weaknesses. But Matheson is inconsistent; some 'living vampires' act like 'dead vampires' and vice-versa. Matheson never clarifies how the vampiric bateria differently affects living and dead people, even though this difference is key to the story. When Matheson tries to give a scientific explanation of how the bacteria works, things get ridiculous. Matheson confuses whether he's talking about a virus or bacteria, and his pseudoscientific description of how the disease works is weak, even for 1950s science. (One way he describes the destructive effect of the bacteria is by saying that the bacteria enter cells, then soak up so much water that the infected cells explode. Huh?) Apparently, as this strange disease swept the globe, no one was clever enough to look at vampire blood under a microscope (until Neville thinks to do it, years later). The vampire/zombies also display an inconsistent intelligence. The female vampires are smart enough to use sex to try to lure Neville to his doom, yet none of the vampires can manage to use a doorknob. About six pages of this book involved Neville trying to make friends with a wandering dog. Neville tries to take care of his health, since there are no more doctors or dentists, but he shatters enough bottles and glasses in his house to coat its floor with two inches of broken glass, quite a health hazard. Early in the book, Neville is ethically torn: is it right for him to go about during the day, killing sleeping vampires? After all, they're somewhat human. But late in the book, Neville blatantly says that he never hesitated to kill any vampire, which both contradicts his behavior early in the book, and removes a layer of his character's depth. What exactly does the vampire bacteria do? How does it differently affect the living and the dead? Why does it affect 99.999% of the population, but not Neville? How does Neville go about his business for three years in Gardena and its environs without noticing a huge 'new society' of hundreds (or thousands) of people in Inglewood? The allegory of a 'normal' man becoming the 'monster' is an effective conceit, as it emphasizes the subjective nature of what is 'normal' in society, but that point is tacked on to the end of the tale. In the course of the story, sometimes paragraphs don't follow each other logically, and it confuses the reader. This story might be significant in its influence and historicity, but it's not written well, and it's barely entertaining."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I felt that this book went nowhere.

The not very good ending came and you sit there saying to yourself \\"Thats it?\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I found it funny that some of these reviews called this suspenseful. This must be the first book they've ever read because it is anything BUT suspenseful. I gave it 2 stars only because of the concept, not the actually story line and how it was written. You can sum this whole book up on a single page, double spaced, probably less...so I'll try. Neville barricaded himself in his house after everyone turned into vampires ***SPOILER*** by bacteria ***END SPOILER***. He worked on his house for a lot of the book, making it sound proof, etc., he ate through a lot of the book, and drank for even more of the book. He fought with himself and his thoughts (obviously since he was alone). He found a dog that wasn't affected by what was going on and had survived the vampires, so he lured it in for what seemed like an eternity ***SPOILER*** and then for it to die immediately after he brings this companion in to live with him ***END SPOILER***.The last chapter was the only one of any interest and I won't even include that in my summary because I hate people that ruin books by writing about how it ends (the rest of the spoilers I've written are just from the front half of the book). It is interesting the thoughts and psychology behind the last chapter, and how the book came to be titled \\"I am legend\\". It was the only good part, but when compared to other suspenseful books and thrillers, this ranked dead last for that.If you were a fan of the Will Smith movie \\"I Am Legend\\", if you liked all the concepts in that and were looking for a book that was similar to that theme, definitely PASS ON THIS BOOK. There is only one \\"chase scene\\" where he gets a scare by being outside when it is getting dark and the vampires all come out (not even that late in the book either). There is next to no suspense, even with that \\"chase scene\\". All he did was ride around the block, accidentally forget his keys in the car, have to run and get them as the vamps were getting closer, then get them and get inside. All this happened on what seemed like 2 pages on my kindle touch (so probably about a page long in the real book).I love scifi thrillers/suspense and this was anything but that. Definitely one of the worst vampire books I've read so far...I'd say it ranks worse than Twilight in terms of story line about the vampires (minus the teen love story in Twilight). I was bored with it and couldn't wait to finish it...luckily it was pretty short. This coming from a guy that read vampire books when he was younger (around 20 years ago, way before the vamp fad we see now days). This is anything but a vampire book IMO. It talked about blood sucking 1 time...ONE TIME. I can't even go on without spoiling it...the vampires were just stupid in this book...please, just find a different book to read. Idk what these other reviewers are smoking, but I want some if it can take a bad book like this and turn into something interesting."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Book is much better than the movie, but the ending sucks. The solitude of the main character was interesting, especially for the decade this was written. But it falls short on a lot of explaination. There were a lot of opportunities to really explore the psychological aspects of an isolated man left dangling.The short stories (most of which were featured on the twilight zone) inserted at the back of the book by the publishing company were a lot more enjoyable than the main story. Save yourself a headache, rent the movie, or wait for it on cable."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I purchased this book because it was on promotion on Amazon. I read it in two days (OK, it is short). This story keeps you connected because of the possibility. Considering this book is dated, it was 'avantgardiste'.This is not a horror story by today's standards. The background is horrific, but the impact is psychological. As with many stories, 'I am Legend' asks \\"what if?\\" With context, you must question what (or who) is good or evil....particularly....why! Society's rules were defined because of a context.For those who saw the movie: yes, the same background, but a completely different story. Forget the movie, start the book when you have time to read it in one shot."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Reviewing a classic is rather strange for me. It's like reviewing Oliver Twist, when almost everyone knows what it's about, due to movies, TV show references, and most recently in commercials urging kids to use manners.When people think of I Am Legend , they usually don't know it's a book, and just know it's a post apocalyptic movie where most of the population has been mutated into vampires, and Will Smith is the last man standing, blah, blah, blah.The movie was great, I admit it. But that was before I read the book. And like every other movie supposedly based on I Am Legend, like The Last Man On Earth and the very horrendous The Omega Man, the movies seem to exclude many of the main points that make the novel so great. I hope they actually make an accurate movie based on the book someday.Richard Matheson deserves a better movie adaption.Ok, now enough about the movie and on to the book. The book is set in the late 1970s. The world was decimated by a horrible virus, that turns men and animals into vampires. Robert Neville, the last man, as far as he knows, is fighting to survive. The book deals mainly with Robert's internal struggle with insanity, which Matheson handles beautifully.I don't want to spoil the main points, so I urge you to read the book. :)Overall, I give the book 5 out of 5 stars!Available in most eBook formats and in print."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I heard this book was better than the movie from a number of sources...and those sources are all correct. You dwell into the setting and character development much more. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but if you enjoyed the movie, pick up the book without a doubt. If you like post-apocalyptic/zombie/horror books, pick it up also. Worth your time."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had first read this story when the movie came out. But, realizing that (as usual) the story far outweighed the movie in terms of plot and twists, I continued reading the other shorts within. The combination of thought provoking characters and horror elements really makes for some delightful scares. Keep the nightlight on."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"After watching the Will Smith blockbuster THEN reading the book, I was very surprised at how very different they were; feeling they're almost two seperate stories. I was also surprised that the book was actually a collection of short stories by Matheson; all of which were good. However, this review focus' on the title of the book and story, \`I Am Legend'.This story follows Robert Neville, the last man on Earth, as he struggles to survive in a world taken over by a vampiric plague, which he appears to be immune to. You're immediately thrown into the current existence of Neville. It's in his flashbacks that we learn of his past where you can't help but feel his pain and root him on as we follow his attempts at survival and destruction of the undead. By day, he scours the city for food and supplies but spends most of his time repairing his house and carving stakes. By night, as the vampires call out to him and try to break into his house, he struggles with lonliness and sexual frustration. Even with his drink of choice and classical music he blares every night to drown out the vampires isn't enough to keep the depression at bay. However, along the way, he begins to conduct his own investigation to understand and maybe even cure the plague. Neville is by no means a scientist but with the library as his aid, he is able to perform scientific experiments which sheds light on logical causes of the worldwide epidemic.Although, different from the movie, I still enjoyed the book just as much. Going back to old school vampires straight from vampire myths: garlic, stakes, mirrors, sunlight etc... sets this story apart from modern day vampire novels. I was immediately drawn in, so engrossed in the story; anxious to find out what happens next! Wrapping it up and tieing it with a bow, it has an ending you won't see coming. I definately recommend this book especially to those who enjoy science fiction, horror and classic vampires. Do you dare join him on this journey?"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I gave this 2 stars because the novella, I am Legend, is interesting. Had it been published on its own, or if there was at least some warning that completely unrelated short stories were going to immediately follow it, unannounced, as just chapters, I would have given this 4 stars. I am Legend is drastically different from the movie. Just consider it a different story with the same name. The short stories that follow the novella are nowhere near as interesting or good in quality. I wish I had read some of the reviews here beforehand so I wouldn't have wasted my time reading them, bored, and highly confused as to how they related to the first half of the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I lost my hard copy of this book years ago, but I have read the story many times. For anyone who is a horror or sci-fi fan, Matheson is a must. This book is easily one of his best. If anyone just saw the movie and was confused or disappointed by it, I would seriously recommend buying this book. It's the sort of story that haunts the reader long after it's over, and unlike the movie, the book makes sense."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"regardless of what you thought of the movie, READ THIS BOOK! Besides sharing a title and the main characters having the same name is there is absolutely no similarities between the two. This book Rocks!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I don't like vampire novels much, so I wasn't planning to read Richard Matheson's classic vampire story I am Legend which was published in 1954, is also known by the title The Omega Man, and is, of course, the basis for the movie I am Legend.But then I recently read and was enthralled by two other books by Matheson: The Incredible Shrinking Man and Steel and Other Stories. I realized that The Incredible Shrinking Man wasn't really so much about a man who was losing his height as it was about a man who was losing his manhood. Likewise, the novella \\"Steel,\\" the titular piece of Steel and Other Stories and the premise for the movie Real Steal, isn't so much about a fighting robot as it is about a man who, similar to the shrinking man, is fighting to keep his position in life. The psychological aspects of these stories fascinated me and I began to wonder if perhaps I am Legend wasn't really about vampires after all.As I suspected, it's not. Well, on the surface it is. Robert Neville is the last human being on Earth. Everyone else has been infected with a virus that causes vampirism, but for some reason, Robert is immune. He spends his daytime hours securing his house, staking vampires, and trying to discover a cure for the virus. At night he hides indoors while the vampires, some who are his former acquaintances, try to break in. During the story there are flashbacks which show the gradual loss of Robert's family and friends to vampirism.I was fascinated by Robert's preparations and daytime activities, and his studies to find the cause and cure for the virus. The thought, for example, of having free access to anything you want, including cars, jewelry, clothes, houses, art, scientific equipment, and every book in every bookstore and library in the world is exhilarating... until you realize that there's nobody to share it with. All those things are almost meaningless outside of their social context.So, this is Matheson's gut-wrenching focus -- what it means to be the last human on Earth, especially when you're fighting for your life. We all know that humans are social creatures, but none of us has actually experienced a total lack of companionship. What would it mean to rule the entire world alone? And yet, as depressing as that is, why, when there's nothing to live for, do we still cling to life so desperately? Matheson writes so powerfully about these emotions. I ached for Robert Neville and a few of Matheson's scenes had me in tears.The story is called I am Legend because Robert Neville gradually comes to realize that vampires, the creatures he thought were only legend, are real. Now, Robert Neville, the elusive human being who vampires fear, has become the legend.I listened to Blackstone Audio's version of I am Legend which is perfectly read by Robertson Dean. This is one I will listen to again. By the way, I am Legend is not a full-length novel, so some versions include additional stories in a collection called I am Legend and Other Stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had seen the movie (with Will Smith), and I loved it. So as soon as I found out that it was based on a book, I had to get it! Though the book and movie are quite different, I absolutely loved it! My only complaint is that it was to short :( It also has a bunch of neat, unrelated, short stories at the end!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson's I Am Legend is a short story about a man named Robert Neville, the last living human on the planet. To complicate things, due to a bacteria there are now vampires running amok who know where he lives. By day he hunts the vampires and kills them while they sleep, by night he inebriates himself and holes up in his house. He finds a dog, and another survivor, but both feed the fire of despair, loneliness and inebriation. And by day the legend grows.Matheson weaves a compelling and frightening tale, and the emotions of Robert Neville are felt by the reader. The ending offers a wonderful twist, and the original story is far better than the recent Will Smith film of the same name. I Am Legend is such an influential story that it almost single-handedly invented the vampire/zombie apocalypse genre that is so prevalent in modern cinema.This specific omnibus also features ten other short stories. A reader unfamiliar with Matheson may pass over them, or read them expecting very little compared to the titular story, but reading them will quickly change the readers mind. Several of the short stories are wonderfully frightening, and they all offer a horrific twist at the end. Highlights include Prey, Madhouse, and Person to Person, although each story is well written and highly entertaining."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is (if you've read other reviews) great. The rest of the book is meh. Once I finished I Am Legend I foud myself kinda forcing myself to read the rest. With anywhere from 4-12 pages for each story its kinda hard to care about most of the events or people in the stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Excellent SF by Richard Matheson. In an alternative present or near future the human civilization has been destroyed by a virus that turns people into vampires. The story focuses on Robert Neville, maybe the only human who seems to be immune. On the days he drives around the empty city looking for resources and make his house/stronghold more resistant. In the night the vampires arrive and try to break in. The story is very well written and full of suspense. And very dark. Not exactly a feelgood book.Mathesons' novel was made into a movie in 1970: \\"Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston in the role of Neville. The film is very well worth watching, if just to compare with the novel. There are many differences which is interesting. (Also \\"I am Legend\\" was recently made into a film by some Hollywood studio with Will Smith as Neville. I haven't seen it but I really don't think it is as dark as the novel, or half as interesting.)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is an amazing book! It's nothing like the Will Smith movie, but it's great in it's own way! It's different enough that someone who has seen the movie before reading the book, like me, can really appreiciate it. And it's not scary but exciting and keeps you reading. There is also a bunch of Richard Matheson's short stories after I Am Legend, so you definitely get your moneys worth with this book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"As others have said, one of the great novellas of all time; I read it more than three decades ago, and always thought it would make a terrific movie - too bad they never made one to match the book. As an aside, after reading it I always thought that Matheson's original intent was to title the book \\"I Am Legion,\\" based for those who are biblical on the story of a demon (demons) being cast into a herd of swine, who become mad and fling themselves into the sea. The demon answers when asked its name \\"I am Legion, for we are many.\\" My suspicions were, and still are, that some editor thought it was a misprint or that he/she could do better, and re-titled it \\"I Am Legend,\\" which makes absolutely no sense as a title for this story, other than the (I suspect) modified last words of the protagonist. Perhaps someone can weigh in with the history..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I still haven't seen the movie, and from what I've heard about it's departure from the book that inspired it, I'm not in a particular rush, either. However, as a lifetime fan of horror as well as a writer and editor of dark fiction, I've felt like somewhat of an outsider when my colleagues mentioned this book. I was able to remedy this condition by picking up a copy of the book at a Dallas Target store while distracting myself from the financial pain of a mother-daughter shopping event.I took as much joy in reading this 50's horror story as I do when reading classic sci-fi and fantasy; I've read bits and pieces of classic horror, but while I've had to strain to get through a few other famous notables, I ripped through I Am Legend as readily as the latest King or Koontz. I can see why it's so commonly listed a favorite and influential vampire novel. It's also refreshing to finally read this as a fan of Vincent Price's movie, Last Man on Earth, which was inspired by I Am Legend.I feel fortunate to have stumbled across the edition I did; it contains a clutch of Matheson's short stories as well as the title story. As good as the novella itself was, I like the short stories even better. I won't discuss them at length, as I can't discuss them in a useful manner without spoiling them. But they're good. I'll definitely be reading more Matheson, and I'm sorry I didn't get into him before."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I very much enjoyed the movie \\"I Am Legend\\" and i am pleased to say that the book was just as good, if not, better. I don't read a lot of books, but this one had me hooked. It was very original, very clearly worded, and the plot was fantastic! I loved how the author was able to put a reason behind everything that happened which made it not only logical, but very believable. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys books with suspense, horror, and that keeps you guessing throughout the whole story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Robert Neville is the last man left alive on Earth. At least that is how he looks at his precarious situation. Those soulless vampiric creatures outside are clearly not alive but simply undead. Each night is for Robert a battle for survival. But each day he finds it more and more difficult to obtain enough energy to go out to find food and supplies. Being an academic he is capable of investigating the cause of this worldwide apocalypse, but more importantly finding a way to finish the evil outside. Lately his investigations are not delivering any conclusive results. On the verge of giving up all hope Robert meets a seemingly uninfected women, Ruth, abroad in the daylight.With I am Legend Richard Matheson has created a milestone of post-apocalyptic fiction that has set the standard for many works that followed. The utterly concise and measured narrative is showing its sharp edges when describing the desperation that the main character of Robert feels. As a reader you get sucked into the experience of dread from page one. On top of that the author adds excellently crafted suspense scenes that makes you want to turn the pages faster than you can read. But the best part is definitely the denouement, where the build-up of the story delivers one of the best final chapters of any horror novel. I am Legend is not only an immensely scary novel, but has a profound sociological and visionary message that we should take at heart now more than ever in times where living together with other people is often seen more as a thread than an opportunity."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Definitely 5 stars.If you write horror stories, this one ranks up there with PSYCHO as one to learn from. I read the whole 160 pages in one sitting."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"After watching the blockbuster movie I just had to read the book. In all seriousness, I actually preferred the contemporary story-line of the movie. Best of all, when I looked at the last pages of the book I discovered that Richard Matheson was the author of other books that were made into some of my favorite movies: What Dreams May Come, Somewhere in Time, and Stir of Echoes. I've become a huge fan and I'm also interested in reading Hell House."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was amazed by this book. Succinct, fully immersed within its context, believable, well written, and satisfyingly horrific!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I love this book! It is very interesting to read about some of the superstitions of vampires and learn how the main character deals with being the only uninfected person left in the world."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The title story is amazing - shocking how contemporary his writing is considerign our view of the 50s and the horror is both types: action-packed and psychological. But the real gem is in the bonus short stories: \\"PREY\\". Anyone who has seen the movie \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" with Karen Black will never forget the terrifying Zuni Devil Doll! This is THAT short story - it and the other bonus ones are phenomenal."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The quintessential \\"last man on earth\\" novel.

Vincent Price is the perfect person for the part.. So if you havent had a chance to read the book but have seen the movie you should definatly check it out.. and vice versa....

Robert Neville is the last human on earth and everyone else has turned into a vampire. During the day if its sunny out, he can go about to get supplies and kill the sleeping vampires. At night he has to lock himself into his house and hope the vampires don't break in and get him.This book it different from other books, the writing style is simple yet very visual, you get a picture in your head every page of the book. The story is unique and good if your a horror.I enjoyed the book though, I'm just not a big fan of horror so the book didn't grab me. But I could see how anyone interrested in this type of fiction would like this book a lot. There is suspense and action and drama all mixed together with a good story. So if you are a fan of &quot;living dead&quot; horror, you can't go wrong with this one.&quot;Sound; a murmured rustle in the air. Robert Neville coughed weakly, then grimaced as the pain filled his chest.&quot; from page 152. That is a good example of the description, it not only gives a good image of how he looks but also of how he feels.But if your not a fan or horror then this book will probably not get your attention. There is lots of small action which does not pull you in eather. But fans of horror will probably eat up all the horror and suspence. Give it a try though, you never know."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"you'll love this book"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson has been a staple sci-fi writer for as long as I can remember. The title story, \\"I am Legend\\", had a brief fling with mainstream with Charleton Heston's \\"the Omega Man\\". Aside from that, the story is just as powerful as when it was written in 1954. Mentioned as one of the top 10 books of Vampirism, I would rate this as one of the top three stories of Vampires, with Dracula, and the Vampire Lestat rounding out the list."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend is the best of two of my favorite genres; post-apocalyptic fiction and vampire stories. Reading this for the first time many years after it was published, it is amazing to see how much it has influenced movies and books that came later. It's a very quick read that makes you wish it were longer."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Just &quot;pretty good&quot;...that's the best I can say. At 170 pages, you hardly get into it and it's over. I enjoyed this book but can't see how so many reviewers are able to call it the best Vampire novel ever. Calling it a novel is a stretch in the first place. It's a short story. And the characters don't compare to Anne Rice's in complexity. To me, when you take away the mystery of the Vampire by labeling it as a bacterial infection, you take away the enjoyment of the whole genre. It's a worthwhile read but far from the best."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Including by me. I did not think the genre has a right to exist. I thought Stoker said all that needs to be said.Then came this book, some 50 years ago, and combined the vampire theme with the 'end of the world' genre and created a strong story in its own right. In its simplicity and clarity it has a chance to be a long-term survivor. Well, typical vampire.I had watched the recent movie and liked it, and this way I learned about the book, which an AF recommended to me. I picked it up for a long distance flight and started reading early in the flight. Then I noticed it was on offer in the video system (one of Lufthansa Business Class strong features), both in the new version with Smith, which I knew already, and in the older one with Charlton Heston. Since the man just died, I was tempted to try the movie, but found it not worth the effort. It is a wooden pointless aged product without merits. (While the Will Smith version is likeable.)So back to the book. Its hero Neville is a soulmate of mine, a hermit. He also calls himself a Robinson (this for my critic who blamed me for that comparison im my film review.)Neville is not a scientist, but tries to understand what happened, why mankind has been seemingly eradicated by a plague and why the dead have become vampires unless burned. His fight against despair, lonelyness, alcohol, suicide, vampires, cluelessness makes it a very strong piece of storytelling."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The writer had trouble giving his main character depth and an orderly sequence of events would have given the reader a developing interest."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Good movie, different from the book of course, but a very good book.I read the kindle version and was inpressed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book moves about as fast as any 300+ page book I've ever read. That's the good part. It jumps right into the story with Neville isolated in a last-man-on-earth setting, able only to go outside during the day as factions of \\"living\\" and \\"dead\\" vampires prowl the night. There really are hardly any dull parts. There's one short chapter just of his thoughts that doesn't do much, but that's about the only slow part. And the book introduces a good amount of mystery as Neville tries to sort through the false parts of vampire legend versus the bacterial infection in the blood causing his current plight.There is a bit of stereotypically false \\"religion is just superstitious\\" theme in the book, whereas science is generally the only place he can turn for answers. There's a poke at the European Catholic Church for spreading the rumor that a cross can deter vampires when in the reality of the I Am Legend universe, only Christians who were turned into vampires are affected by crosses because of remaining psychological factors. Neville does pray in a moment of desperation in the story, but the incident is fairly isolated and is not a point of focus.The biggest problem with the whole theme of Neville seeking to find a rational, medical explanation for everything is that the author throws in an unexplained \\"deus ex machina\\" ending that changes the story such that he can proceed with his ironic ending that otherwise wouldn't work. But it seemed so forced, so contrived, and it leaves the reader unsatisfied with regard to the character's goal and one of the themes of the book, that the clues presented throughout the book actually pointed to some explanation."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Okay so there are a lot of reviews on \\"I Am Legend\\" but I just have to put in my two cents worth of reviewing of this book.This book is nowhere near anything like the movie. The book is so much more better than Will Smith's version and I was mildly surprised that this is not really a book, but a short story. The other stories in the book are quite good too and it makes for an enjoyable read.As I was reading \\"I Am Legend\\" I did not know the story had ended. It wasn't an abrupt end, it just ended if you know what I mean. Still a really good story and I thoroughly enjoyed reading Mr. Matheson's other short stories too. Just a bit surprised at \\"I Am Legend\\" as I was expecting a lot longer story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This collection of short stories essentially has 2 parts. The first part is I am Legend which is excellent and it is clear to see why this is a classic. 5 stars for the I am Legend story.The rest of the book is a collection of so-so short stories some of which are barely comprehensible. I would give the rest of the book 3 stars.This is review specifically of the audio book. The audio book also seems to follow this breakdown as well. There is a different narrator for I Am Legend than the rest of the book. The narration for I am Legend is superb and a joy to listen to. 5 stars.The gravelly, raspy, nasal narration for the rest of the book is absolute torture to listen to. 1 star"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is one of the best \\"after the plague has wiped out everyone else\\" books I have read.

I'm sure many people did not hear about this story until they've watched the movie starring Will Smith. Not surprisingly, I am one of those people. However, I Am Legend was a novel published back in 1954! Of course the story got popularized and a couple of movies was actually created based on the novel. With that being said, I didn't really like the movie version and I don't even remember if I finished it or not. I decided to give the book a try since there has been so much talk about it in the past. At a little over 300 pages, it wasn't that big of a risk. Upon completion though, I still find myself not really liking the story all that much. In fact, I was pretty close to not wanting to finish the book just like with the movie.The story is simple. Robert Neville believes that he is the last human in a world infested with vampires. Somehow he is immune to the plague that managed to transform all other humans into vampire-like creatures and make his world a living hell. As the story progresses, Robert decides to try and solve the mystery of what makes these creatures tick and why it is that they are afraid of garlic and the holy cross.Throughout the story, Robert will have self doubts as if you think about it and put yourself in his position, why should he even care? He is the last surviving human and its not like he will make a difference even if he finds out the truth about the whole affair.One of the biggest disappointment I had with I Am Legend is that Robert is just so boring! Robert spends most of his days fortifying his home against the vampires and once night comes, he locks himself in his home and drinks himself to a stupor to try and forget about his situation. This pretty much continues until about the first 40% of the book. Now, I do understand that this is a depressing story and as such, the character should also follow along those guidelines. It just wasn't that fun to read. For the last 60% or so of the book, things do get a bit more interesting once Robert actually does his best to find out the reasoning for the plague and how it affects humans. While reading, I was so anxious for them to explain the \\"legend\\" part. Towards the end, once I realized what it actually meant, it did give me some chills.Upon completion of the book, I just can't help it but to think of how this story could be rewritten for the modern day era. Robert practically has the whole Los Angeles to himself and it felt not much was accomplished. It would have been awesome to read about Roberts adventures when he goes foraging for food and supplies throughout the city. I also wished more emphasis was being put on the vampires. At certain times, they seem more like mindless zombies to me than vampires. To give credit where its due though, the author did successfully create a very depressing atmosphere and I think that was his intention. Its not so much about the action or killing but more so about human weakness. My final conclusion is that I Am Legend is very average and does not really deserve the hype it did."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought the book yesterday, downloaded it last night and read in under four hours this morning. I have to admit that though the book is a good read, i enjoyed the movie more. I guess i must like almost happy endings to sad endings."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"With the hype surrounding the release of the film version of this book, I Am Legend - I had to put reading this on hold until I got to see the movie, just in case it stunk and the book was awesome...That said, I enjoyed BOTH the book and the movie, but this may be the rare case where the book was actually NOT AS GOOD as the movie... Ther book was still good, but the movie was better.I would give the movie 5 stars and the book 4.As always, there are some pretty fundamental differences, mostly being that the movie is simplified, as you cant fit everything in a book into a movie. I am Legend had the advantage of being more of a 160 page Novella, than one of them huge 300 - 400 - 500+ page monsters - so it transitioned well to film.So if you have an hour or two to fill, give this one a try..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I never heard of Richard Matheson's work before seeing the Will Smith movie version of I Am Legend. I'm not proud of that knowing that he pretty well thought of but after reading, or at least trying to read this I'm not exactly sure why. The main story here while almost nothing like the movie also wasn't that good. The story could have been fleshed out and the \\"science\\" didn't make much sense. The ending was good but overall not very good in my opinion. Sadly the rest of the book contained short stories that I struggled to get through then finally relented and gave up. Clich&eacute; followed clich&eacute; which is odd for stories printed so long ago.

It was a very unique and in depth story that ended way to soon.The big problem is that halfway through, the story just ends. Your done by an abrupt ending and are left thinking \\"wtf? was that the end?\\"Of course that isn't the end there is still half a book to read... Only problem is that half the book has nothing to do with I Am Legend. It is a series of crappy short stories.So in conclusion to my ramblings it is a good story that is way to short and the ending is abrupt and very poorly done. So many strings were left open. It suffered the fate of so many movies and books... bad ending. I don't know if there is a sequel to this, but if there is that could help clear up the confusion."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In short this was a suspenseful, fast paced story. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Nothing like the movie (they rarely are). The ending was classic, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A novel about vampires taking over the Earth at first sounds incredibly hokey and stupid. Trust me folks, I Am Legend is anything but that. It is not your typical vampire story. Forget all the others. This is a master writer of science fiction and horror at work, and this is easily his best. I have read I Am Legend so many times, I've lost track. It is absolutely spellbinding, mezmerizing, and riveting. The book has been turned into motion pictures twice.. once about 40 years ago with Vincent Price in the lead. That one is far superior to the 1970s remake &quot;The Omega Man&quot; with Charlton Heston. The plot of the remake is so terribly twisted, that anyone seeing it, if they can withhold laughing at its stupidity, would certainly never pick up this book to read if they thought it was the same as that film. Just forget &quot;The Omega Man.&quot; Pretend you never heard of it. Matheson is one of the legendary kings of science fiction, right up there alongside Ray Bradbury. He wrote the screenplays for about a quarter of the original Twilight Zone series shows. His writing style is fluid, literate, and very easy to read. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is about Robert Neville, a regular but smart kinda guy in the 1970s who watches the population of Earth die around him, infected by a world-wide plague which cannot be stopped. Somehow, he's not sure, he is immune. His friends and family die. Bodies are burned in huge pits until even those doing the burning die. Society shuts down. Some of the dead return as living zombies, who hide and sleep during the day and come out at night to raise Hell.. He spends his days combing the empty streets of Los Angeles for clues, for supplies, food, gasoline, to take back to his suburban home which he's turned into a sealed fortress, and looking for the undead into whose hearts he drives wooden stakes that he tediously grinds himself on a lathe. He rummages libraries to read medical texts for clues as to what it all means. At night when the undead come out to taunt him, he hides in his home, cranking up his hifi to shut out the noise of their howling. He's the last man on Earth, as far as he knows. How long can he last? How long can he keep his sanity in this totally insane world? Are there any other normal people out there or is he totally alone? Read this short novel and you will never forget it. Perhaps it'll become your favorite, as it became mine the first time I picked it up in the 1960s."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This isn't just the best vampire story ever written, it is a great book in any genre. I have read this book so many times that I've nearly memorized it and yet I enjoy it intensely every time I pick it up. The book has many themes within it---loneliness, isolation, alienation are just a few---and you cannot help but put yourself in Robert Neville's situation. What would I do if I were in his shoes?It would make a tremendous movie if it stayed true to the original story (instead of Tom Hanks being marooned on an island, how about him marooned in a city of vampires?). Charlton Heston's &quot;The Omega Man&quot; was based on &quot;I Am Legend&quot; but makes major changes in the story to have a more upbeat ending. Don't watch the movie, read the book.I will confess that I haven't read the other Matheson short stories in this collection but he is a magnificent writer. &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; is probably his most famous work after &quot;I Am Legend.&quot; He wrote the screenplay for the memorable &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode where the Enterprise crew and the Klingons are trapped on the ship by an alien being who feeds off of the emotions of anger and hatred. He also wrote the screenplay for the sensational TV movie, &quot;Duel&quot; which was Steven Spielberg's first film. It is easy to see the parallels between the isolated Robert Neville doing battle with a world of vampires and Dennis Weaver's &quot;everyman&quot; commuter who is having to battle it out with a faceless, psychotic truck driver on an empty highway."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Following my usual preference for reading before viewing, I looked up Richard Matheson's book after one of my Amazon friends reviewed it. Though not a big vampire fan, I was completely absorbed in this classic story.Robert Neville is apparently the only survivor of a plague that turned the rest of mankind into vampires. Barricaded in his house by night, he roams during the day when the creatures hide from the light. Anger, alcohol and the horrors he's seen threaten to push him into madness but he channels his energy into searching for the science behind the phenomenon. The story--a short novel--keeps its relentless pace and tension right through to the jarring conclusion.There's always a challenge in keeping the \\"voice\\" all the way through a story with essentially one character and not much dialog. Matheson meets that challenge. Neville goes through the fire of his solitary horror-ridden years and comes out rusty-voiced but not without hope. At the end, a tipping point, a synthesis--too late for Neville to ponder it, but it will stay with the reader for a long time.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"....I...loved the book because it didn't portray its main protagonist as a super hero but as a normal man, with normal man's emotions and feelings. I could easily identify myself with I Am Legend's Robert Neville, especially that I read the book in a period where I was enduring excessive amounts of emotional stress. I felt so close to Robert neville. Almost half a decade after it was 1st published, the novel's depiction of modern society and Man's every day struggle is still quite vivid and quite alive today more than ever. The only difference between the novel and the real life is that in real life, the vampires are disguised as normal people and they feed by sucking on your soul and not on your blood. This novel belongs to the horror genre indeed, but you will be gladly treated to a social/psychiatric study of the human nature, tinted with hints of theology, mysticism and occasional humor. I also loved the author's scientific approach in unmasking the unknown and demystifying the vampire myth. I Am Legend is truly an avant-garde and a riveting tale of a man overcoming adversity by fighting against his inner demons and coming face to face with himself. I Am Legend is above all a wonderful modern-day fable and an inspiring metaphor of courage and humanity."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I purchased this (by accident while requesting a sample) as a Kindle daily special for $1.99 expecting to receive a book of 312-pages (as described) containing the novella \\"I Am Legend\\" and numerous short stories (referred to in various reviews) and seemingly apparent by the book's page count. However, the title book concluded far short of 312 pages--although the progress bar at the bottom of the Kindle screen was FULLY EXTENDED--and nothing more appeared. In other words, there are no additional stories in this ebook edition. (Ironically, many earlier reviews complained of their inclusion; I am complaining of their omission.)I initially read \\"I Am Legend\\" not long after it was first published and I suspect I was too young to fully appreciate it at that time; my idea of SF back then was the derring-do of space opera (which this most certainly is not). I re-read it ten years later as a $.40 Bantam paperback and was better able to appreciate both the story and its essential point (one that is not particularly profound, but worth contemplating). I was also able to recognize its stylistic imperfections; in particular, specifics and background explanations are sometimes lacking, vague, imprecise and/or contradictory. Despite these flaws, it's a pretty good story, and after more recently reading it yet again (for a third time), my estimation of it remains positive. I do think, however, it has gained a greater reputation and cult-following than it qualitatively deserves. So, is it too short? No, not given its ending; any longer to reach that same conclusion would have been mere padding. Is it a SF classic? It is arguably a classic, but I think it belongs more properly in the horror category; its science is dubious at best. Is it great? Debatable, because the theme regarding majority/minority reversal and what constitutes normalcy is better than the actual writing itself; true greatness, in my opinion, requires excellence in both.Earlier in his career (the period in which \\"I Am Legend\\" was written) Matheson was usually better at coming up with imaginative ideas than fully and stylistically developing them; that's why so many of his ideas/stories were better suited to the half-hour television format than to that of the full-length motion-picture. A brief exposition leads to the fully revealed idea, the \\"punchline\\" as it were (for example, in a \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode). That is also why movie adaptations of his early stories (such as \\"I Am Legend\\") are so very different from the actual stories on which they are based; he supplied the seed-thought, but someone else had to develop a more substantial plot to fill a two-hour time-span. His later works are better-written and more fully developed, two notable novels-to-movies being \\"What Dreams May Come\\" and \\"Somewhere in Time\\" (originally his novel \\"Bid Time Return\\").Having already read \\"I Am Legend\\" three times, the reason I contemplated making this purchase was to receive the OTHER stories I thought it contained. Not getting them, I returned this ebook for a refund. Thus, you should be aware that this is NOT the 312-page version and it only contains the title story. This \\"defect\\" accounts for my 3-star rating of this ebook edition; otherwise I would assign a 4-star rating to the story itself."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My 14 year old son gave me this book for Christmas since I expressed an interest in seeing the movie and he knows how I almost always believe the book to be better than the movie. So what I have to say is that the novelette/short story of I AM LEGEND is very well-written, compelling and hard to put down. I am frustrated that the book is marketed as one novel or one story. It is actually a collection of short stories from author Matheson. It is amusing now to think I read the whole book waiting for things to fit together after page 170. Needless to say I became more and more confused and (STOP READING HERE IF YOU PLAN TO READ--PLOT SPOILER AHEAD)I kept wondering how the book was going to go on when halfway through, the hero dies. All the time I was reading completely different stories. SO anyway-----it is well worth the read, but it should say somewhere on the front or at the front that the book is a collection of short stories. Thanks!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"(Helpful? Not? Please vote, so I know someone is reading these :^) The book and the movie have only the basic premise in common. The movie has been updated and 21st-Century-ifyed, and Will Smith is great, yada, yada, yada...that was the spoiler, of sorts. I think I enjoyed the book more, but honestly, they're so different, it's hard to make a comparison. Hollywood did what Hollywood does best, and made a drama into an action movie (see Lord of the Rings, where books full of peace and philosophical ramblings somehow became three completely, unbelievably EPIC war movies. I liked 'em, but it was hardly the same story ... I digress)The book is rather short, as other reviewers have noted. The author is excellent at putting you \\"in situ\\", the plot development does suspend disbelief, and it really is a different angle on the vampire stories of old. Many felt let down by the surprise ending, and it was indeed a twist. I still found it thought-provoking, if not a bit sudden. I truly think Matheson missed an opportunity to finish a \\"great American novel\\" here, though perhaps his novella will suffice for you as well. I note it was left wide-open for a sequel, some \\"dues ex machina\\" surprise, that could easily continue the storyline. I think this was common in the popular fiction of the day (1950s), though it's a bit obvious today as a comic book ending. I can't criticize it very harshly on that note though. This IS the same guy who wrote \\"Stir of Echoes\\" ... All in all, I think you will enjoy the \\"headliner\\" story \\"I Am Legend\\", and some of the shorts afterwards are kinda cool too (while others are decidedly nothing special). You can consume this book in short order, so don't miss out on reading a truly classic story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Remember when you were a child and a girl or a boy said, &quot;I wouldn't kiss you if you were the last person on earth.&quot; How would you feel if you were the last perosn on Earth?

The unpredictable ending provides a shocking twist. Screenwriter and novelist Richard Matheson reinvented the vampire story in I am Legend, but his apocalyptic vision of legions of the undead also inspired dozens (if not hundreds) of zombie novels, comics, and movies (including three based on the novel itself).This particular edition includes a bonus: ten short stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I ordered this book after seeing a preview for the Will Smith adaption out this year (hence the cover). Great story, though much shorter than I thought. The reason for this poor review is because of the packaging. I had no idea I am Legend was one of almost a dozen other short stories in this book. The book itself if 312 pages long. I am Legend ends around page 162. No where on the cover, spine of back cover of the book does it say \\"I am Legend and other assorted short stories.\\" I thought I paid for a novel, not a short story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Reviewing a book by comparing it to its movie is not the ideal thing to do, but I did watch the Will Smith movie first, which itself was not the first movie adaptation of the book - The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man both were based on the novel and came out more than 30 years ago, and only more than a year later read the novel.Robert Neville's character in the book is more complex, more prone to weaknesses, and more fallible than the movie character.In a post-apocalyptic world where a bacteria has killed most of the world's human population and turned the survivors into blood seeking vampires that stalk Neville's house at night, Robert Neville must live and survive, though seemingly without purpose. He frequently succumbs to bouts of drinking, frustration, and rage. He wages a lone, sometimes gruesome, and what often looks like a pointless battle against the vampires. Company comes in the form of a dog, that brings back to him a modicum of humanity he had long forgotten he had, and then in the form of a young woman who has just lost her husband to the vampires. The end is bleak and quite unlike the movie.This book is supposed to have inspired such legends, so to say, of the field as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Not to mention its influence on a whole genre of gore-filled zombie infested movies of the 70s and 80s."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Last night I finished reading I Am Legend and have to say: WHAT AN ENDING!! It is an incredibly original story because of the point of view from which Matheson chooses to narrate, to then turn the tables in the ending, leaving you every bit as astounded with the revelation as the main character is.When the movie came out a few years ago, I liked it; it was scary and I thought Will Smith had done an amazing job at supporting the movie by himself. Now, after reading the book, I will never look at it the same way. It totally misses what makes the book so incredibly original and it makes so many changes to the story that renders it almost unrecognizable. In sum, the film story doesn't hold a candle to the one of the pages.I have to say, though, the section where the main character is going through medical knowledge to explain himself the basis of the 'infection' gave me a stomachache. If you follow me and my work, you know I'm an MD. I don't know if the medical knowledge was that much far back in 1954, or if Matheson just picked and chose whatever he needed and made it fit the story, but I tell you: It was physically painful. Chances are, you aren't as versed in Physiology and won't notice a thing, so by all means, don't let this detail keep you from reading such a wonderful story.I enjoyed the whole experience very much and was unable to put the book down from the moment I turned the first page. In my opinion, the story is a lot better thought out than Matheson's Hell House though the aforementioned has a richer vocabulary. I recommend it thoroughly and is now, among my favourite books ever."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read this book over and over when I was much younger. The idea of the story completely captured my imagination every time I read it! I wanted to be that \\"last man on earth\\", to fight the good fight.The funny thing is, I recently read the book again. What a difference time and maturity can make in perspective. The idea is still there, to be the last man, struggling against evil, but that really isn't the main premise here.Yes, this book probably influenced all the post apocalyptic and zombie stories that were written after it was published.But this story is, and always will be, the story of a man coping with the death of civilization as we know it. He also struggles with personal loss and grief while trying to come to terms with devastation on a global scale.If you like zombie/vampire stories, by all means read this. Make sure you look at the publishing date when you do. Then you will realize how many clones of this story are out there.If you like stories dealing with one man's struggle against overwhelming odds, read this as well. The last scene, where the crowd quiets as he walks into sight is epic! When he realizes what he is and what he represents to that society gave me goosebumps. Very deep and very powerful!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"i am legend is horrifying and brilliant a must read but it will haunt you for weeks.This is no will smith save the world story!!!!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Let me begin by stating that this is a short story compilation, something that was never mentioned to me at any point in time. True, the title story is by far the longest in the book, and would qualify as a novella, but it is in length similar to \\"The Mist\\" being the largest short story in \\"Skeleton Crew.\\"The Title story of \\"I Am Legend\\" is a brilliant story following Neville as the sole survivor of the vicious plague which has claimed the lives of most of the world, and then brought them back as terrible vampire like creatures. Neville is not a scientist, he is not a genius, and in fact he is far closer to an alcoholic slowly losing his mind. \\"I am Legend\\" is not an action packed thrill ride, it is instead a drawn out study on madness, the breakdown of civilization and what it does to the human psyche. We follow Neville as he tries to not only stay alive, but also retain his sanity after all that he has been through. He is alone and sees no hope for the future. True his behavior may not mimic what our choices would have been, but then again none of us know how we would behave.If you bought this book because of the Will Smith movie, you will probably be disappointed, the story is very different, far less scientific, and doesn't take place in NYC, not to mention there is no action, the dog isn't a main character (though it is a very touching part of the book) and the ending is completely different. Do I think one is better than the other? I don't know, I enjoyed them both but find them to be completely different stories. If you can keep from comparing the two I think you can really enjoy both.As for the other stories in the book, much like all short story books, they are hit and miss. You have everything from psycho dolls with warrior spirits inside terrorizing apartments, to houses that have gone mad from the negative energy. Some of the shortest were the most entertaining. Most have been turned into movies (many in those Creepshow/ Twilight Zone/ Amazing Stories type movies) so when you read through, a lot of them will seem familiar. I highly recommend this book to those looking for a quality set of short stories complimented by a wonderful 160 page or so novella."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I can't explain exactly why I enjoyed a horror novel about zombies so much. But I did. Beware that I Am Legend, 160 pages in length, is followed by ten short stories.The tale begins in January of 1976 with a tall, thirty-three year old blue-eyed blond man named Robert Neville fighting for his life in Compton, California. It covers his experiences for the three years that follow. He has survived a plague that, in its earlier stages, causes persons to become weak, sick and affectless. In later stages, victims transform into vampire-like creatures that shy away from the usual: daylight, garlic, and crosses. Magyver-like at times, Neville, drinker, smoker and classical music aficionado, has been able to sustain himself through his ingenuity, living in a boarded up house adjacent vacant lots (having burned down the neighboring homes) complete with an adequate supply of food, a generator, and means of transportation. By day, he patrols the area in a search of the plague afflicted. Those he finds are killed for good and disposed of. He also spends time at the library, researching blood and diseases in hopes of finding a cure. With a lot of idle time on his hands, he thinks back on his family, the circumstances surrounding their infection and fate. Additionally, he reflects on his former relationship to a persistent nemesis as well as the likely reason for his survival. Especially good are his encounters with other possible survivors, the vocabulary, and the plot. Although I loved the story I Am Legend, it ended too soon, since I thought the book contained just one story and plodded on to the second short story that followed before I realized it had ended. \\"I Am Legend and Other Stories\\" may have been a better choice for a title.The short stories ranged from okay to good. Prey, on which one of the three stories from one of the scariest movies I've ever seen (as an eleven-year-old), Trilogy of Terror with Karen Black, was based, was non-stop action packed horrifying. Some of the others: seven teen witches use their powers to help fight a war, a man meets with a mortician to get \\"the best\\" for his wife, futuristic kids visit a bar where they see a plague riddled \\"woman\\" dance, an intelligent anthropologist takes on the role of witch doctor to save a person possessed, and a man experiences the incessant sound of a phone (or something) ringing in his ears. Similarly great choices: The Lottery and Other Stories by Shirley Jackson, The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe, and The Road by Cormac McCarthy."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Who else could create something so masterful?

It is almost like the film was based on a brief two minute description of the book.The book is a real masterpiece of sci fi-horror writing, much darker and deeper than the film, which is a very much a popularised feel good Hollywood knock off in comparison (even if it is a good film). I won't go over the story itself, as other people have already done a very good job of that. It is very short, so it can easily be read in and evening or an afternoon, but it is definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I AM LEGEND is a classic apocalyptic survivor (at least for a while) story. When you consider that LEGEND was written in 1954, the story concept is even more outstanding. It is very well written and fascinating in its charactor depth. It is no wonder that LEGEND has been made into three successful movies. If you have loved any of the movies, read the origional story. You won't regret it. The book also includes some short stories that are less outstanding."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My first introduction to I am Legend was as a child in the 70's via the old Black and White Vincent Price movie based on the novel.

Imagine a world destroyed by plague and you seem to be the only survivor ....at least the only survivor with half a mind left. Wife...gone...child...gone...best friend...gone(almost)....just you and your canned food ...oh and of course the angry horde of seeming zombies who just want to kill you because you are alive. Rumors have been flying rampant and there is a script out there for a movie already that was originally going to star the &quot;Govenator&quot;."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The only complaint I have of this book is that it was too short. Otherwise it has swiftly become among one of the best vampire stories I have ever had the fortune to read. Far from being a typical vampire tale, Matheson takes the vampire out of its Victorian era setting and Gothic castles and into the streets of your mundane suburbanite life; wandering aimlessly and mindlessly through shopping marts and supermarkets seeking for living blood to sustain them, these vampires have more in common with George Romero's zombies than to Bram Stoker's Dracula.Incredibly, superstition plays no part in Matheson's dark tale of these ambling mindless children of the night, as the story's struggling hero experiments scientifically on the zombiefied vampires, discovering that the ultimate cause of vampirism was a parasitic germ. Matheson satisfyingly tosses out the long held and cliched use in literature of religious artifacts to repell vampires and instead explains his vampires' revulsion toward them to be psychological rather than by any innate divine power that they might contain. Philosophically, this book could be looked at as a thinly concealed venture into existentialism.In any case, I advise anyone who enjoyed Romero's zombie films and Stephen King's The Stand to pick up this book, I almost guarantee you will not regret the choosing of it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The story I Am Legend is a very well-written vampire story with a nice twist. It's not the usual vampire hunter type book, but ends up making you look at things from two different points of view. It's amazing that the author can keep the reader interested and captivated in the story of one single man. As an avid reader of Anne Rice, Stephen King, and Dean Koontz, I was apprehensive at first about this novel, but ended up being very satisfied. The other stories in the book are hit or miss, some better than others. He does have an interesting writing style and interesting ideas. Some of his short stories were a little on the windy side, but all in all he's a rare mind. Definitely worth picking up and reading the whole thing though, especially I Am Legend."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I usually shy away form vampire books. I've enjoyed other books and short stories he's written, so I gave it a try. It was wonderful! Included in this book is a collection of short stories as well. I have recently discovered that Richard Matheson wrote episodes of the vintage Twilight Zone series as well as books that were made into movies. The movie from the early eighties, Somewhere in Time was based on Matheson's Bid Time Return. What Dreams May Come was also written by Matheson. You can't go wrong with any of his books!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Robert Neville is Legend. And what a ride Richard Matheson gives in what is perhaps the finest vampire novel ever written. From the first page the reader is sucked into the nightmare that the protagonist lives through night after terrifying night. Richard Matheson's deft prose keeps the readers eyes glued to the pages, often way into the morning hours in a desperate attempt to find out what happens. And boy can he write. You will not find better storytelling anywhere. With the added short stories, especially Dress of White Silk, From Shadowed Places, and the sublime Person to Person, this is a justified purchase for fans of horror fiction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I have to say that this book was a pleasant surprise. A nice vacation from reading about the romatic vampire, or the postmodern vampire who is a rockstar and is far too effeminate to take seriously. Matheson's vampire is a filthy corspe who is not quick footed or witted and is basically a zombie only the passion is for blood and not brains. The struggle of the protagonist Neville is both heartfelt and realistic. A great book from beginning to end!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book was one of the most amazing novels I have ever encountered. It was truly captivating from the first page to the last - I read the whole book in one sitting. The monologue is thought provoking, profound, yet realistic. Rather than taking the conventional route of fantasy vampire novels, Matheson takes a more scientific approach, as he explains the true vampire through an analytical approach. The plot is very believable, and the main character is very well developed. If you haven't already done so, BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Beautifully (and sorrowfully) written, this stands as my favorite novel by Richard Matheson. The tragic tale of Robert Neville, the last human in a world of vampires is chillingly real, bringing in a new concept into the world of vampirism. Not based heavily on the legend of vampires like Dracula, but rather on a mysterious condition that leads to vampiric behavior and the results of such.The survival of the last human in the world, former soldier Robert Neville is the sole focus of the novel. An incident in his past has made him immune to the disease that has overthrown the human population, leaving him to do the dirty word of getting rid of it. During the night, he barricades himself in his home, hoping the sun would come sooner. Throughout the day, he lays waste to the afflicted he finds. For you see, living alone in the world where everyone wants a chunk of you leads to some rather necessary changes to your lifestyle. The world that Matheson builds is exceptional, to the point that it becomes frighteningly real and you feel the joy and remorse of Robert as he struggles in a world out to get him.A surprising mix of horror and tragedy, one has plenty of time and reason to feel for our poor Robert and his failing crusade. A lusciously-written novel that is, indeed, legend."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Our protagonist has a problem; everyone is a flesh-eating vampire but him. Sound familiar? It ought to if you watch horror films: Vincent Price acted in a film based on this book, called 'The Last Man On Earth', and George Romero gives this film credit for an inspiration for 'Night of the Living Dead'. later, Charlton Heston starred in 'Omega Man' based on the same book. In fact, many later zombie, end of the world, and vampire films owe homage to this book.Richard Matheson provides a delightful and sometimes terrifying read as he weaves his dark world where death and decay is the rule of the day, and the man-of-the-hour doesn't enjoy the role in which he's been placed. Plague has spread everywhere, affecting everyone aside from Robert Neville. His neighbor from hell, Ben Cortman, leads the neighborhood vampires, always trying at night to eat Bob. His days are filled with shopping from a degrading food supply, building weapons, and killing sleeping vampires. His nights are filled with an incessant and nightmarish attack on his abode by said vampires, who are after his blood.This book deserves to rest on your shelf next to Dracula, Frankenstein, Poe and Lovecraft."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Neville is the last human on earth, or so he thinks. A strange plague has swept the world and has left in its wake an army of bloodthirsty creatures of the night. Vampires are now the dominent lifeform on the planet and one man must fight for his life and his sanity in this new world. At first he spends his time proofing his house from the vampires, and gathering supplies. He then sets out to destroy every beast, they must all die! Soon he realizes they are to many and begins to study them, there must be a logical explanation for this horror. But are they the monsters or is he?I never thought a 170 page book could enthrall me so. I read this book in about 3 hrs, but it has been with me for much longer. Richard becomes so realistic you start to forget he is not real. The realism with which Matheson weaves his tale is uncanny. I have read many vampire books and i think \\"I Am Legend\\" is by far the best i have read to date. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this book, I can't recommend it more."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The title of my review says it all. Richard Matheson is obviously twisted, but the way he takes such horrifying things out of his imagination and puts them onto paper is rather amazing. I was expecting something entirely different from this book; for one thing I didn't know that it was a compilation of various stories. However, it held me entranced the entire time I read it, and I would definitely recommend that you check this book out if you want to read something VERY different."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A great twist to the end-of-the-world story at a time when such stories were not even cliches. Similar in dry, almost depressing style of the Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road,\\" Matheson takes us into a hard world of survival and dread, where the protagonist fights lonliness and fear, and the loss of human companionship. He deftly weaves in some mumbo-jumbo science to convince us of the possibility of \\"real\\" vampires, and then gives a credible twist ending. Bravo! Can't wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is the basis for the Charlton Heston movie \\"The Omega Man\\". It's cheesy, but good. Can't wait to see the new version of a great book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What can I say about Richard Matheson that hasn't already been mentioned here. He's great. He's amazing. He's a master at his craft and nothing exemplifies that more than his novel \\"I am Legend.\\"The first time I picked the book up, I couldn't put it down. And when I got to the end, my throat constricted and a tear almost--I said almost--appeared at the corner of my eye. When words on the printed page can do that to you, you know you've found serious talent.\\"I am Legend\\" belongs on any serious sci-fi or horror fan's bookshelf. I'm getting a chill up my spine just by writing this review.I'm going to stop now."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This was a great novella! I absolutly loved it, everyone should go buy \\"Detained Differences\\" by J. Robert Rowe, that should also be a movie made from novel as well!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Not at all what I expected. I read the book in preparation for the movie - now I'm even more interested to see how the film version is handled. Great, fast read - easily done in one sitting. This version of the book is about 1/2 short stories after the I Am Legend story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I first read this book many years ago as a teenager. It left a very long lasting impression of what it means to be utterly isolated and completely alone. A terrifying prospect for most of us. Throw in the fact that you are completely surrounded by souless former human beings, and it becomes an unbearable premise. Richard Matheson pioneered this concept in literature to great effect. Witness the number of similar books that have been written since. Not to mention the three (that I am aware of) film renditions: The Last Man On Earth, with Vincent Price, The Omega Man, with Charlton Heston, and now the first film to actually bear the title of the book. I look forward to the new film. Although I'm not sure Will Smith was the right casting choice. We'll see. At one time Arnold Schwarzeneger had planned to film and star in another remake! That would have been an interesting signature film for his acting career. In any case. This book still has the ability to chill and make one feel the unbearable loneliness of the protaganist. It also evokes the atmosphere, quite effectively, of an empty (of humanity), lonely world. New fans of this genre should find this book affecting and entertaining, if somewhat dated. (It was written in 1953 after all!) I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"About: Robert Neville is seemingly the only survivor of a plague that has turned everyone else into vampires.Pros: Neville is a wonderfully developed character. Perfect pacing throughout. Very engaging, hard to put down.Cons: None notedGrade: A"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really was rapt to this tale of Richard Neville, who apparently is the last of the human species left alive. All other \\"people\\" have mutated into different degrees of vampires. Neville locks himself in his house by night to avoid the gang of vampires led by his ex-neighbor. By day he goes out looking to destroy sleeping vampires and getting supplies and studying (he is self-taught about blood disorders). The story turns into a type of \\"Nazi-nightmare\\" (to explain this would be a spoiler). My only complaint is that the story ends about midway through the book. The rest of the book is a collection of Matheson's short stories. When I was reading I was not aware that this was the case so I was very surprised when the tale ended.Some of the short stories are very good like The Prey which was later made into a scarry movie (Trilogy of Terror) where Karen Black was terrorized by a demon doll. As good as some of these stories are, they are not as good as the I Am Legend main tale and that is why I only give this book four stars."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read a lot of end of the world books and this is one of the best. It's not a vampire novel as much as a story of a man alone in the world. The ending is rather abrupt but that may be because I couldn't put it down and read it so quickly. Many of the other short stories in this version are also good reads. However, they also have some abrupt endings."},{"Title":"Religions of the World","review":"I thought this was going to be only an audio reading of Huston Smith's classic, The World's Religions, which I would have been very happy with.

This could have been another version of the classic book."},{"Title":"Religions of the World","review":"many of us have tasted comparative religion studies in the past andmany of us also have experienced huston smith's writings. however, when ifirst heard these tapes several years ago, i knew there was something veryspecial, almost mystical, about them. it is as if one can listen with theears of one's heart, as if one can hear the deeper truths that lie beneaththe surface expressions of faith. one hears the bells, the chants, thedrums, the hymns being prayed by the persons for whom they bring meaning.one hears the poetry and the music in the text. there is something rich andconnective in these tapes....connective to God, connective to self, andespecially connective to others with whom we usually cannot get past thedifferent way we look.in seeking understanding, i have often been distracted by such surfaceclutter and illusion...gods and goddesses, rules and rituals and the like,and been unable to find the essence lying underneath. with these abbreviatedtapes, it is as if smith takes you directly to the source, to thatunderground river from which all springs emerge. perhaps it is his emphasison the mystical aspects of the various religions, the followers in eachreligion who most often directly experience the Love at the root and thedestination of a path. perhaps it is his insistence that he not speak forany religion until he lived it himself, so that he could understand what itmeans to the follower.smith is a seeker of wisdom and of truth and so he immersed himself in thecommunities he wished to understand. he explains how one comes to befamiliar with and then to understand and then to experience and feel andfinally to be transformed by a religion. he likens the movement ofunderstanding and compassion as a movement through the pronouns one useswhen speaking about a religion. first, one talks about the other as a 'they'(they believe, they feel, etc)...soon it becomes a 'you' as the otherbecomes one you relate to face to face, intimately; then, as you begin toconnect within yourself, you begin to use the pronoun 'i'; and finally a'we'....these tapes are very accessible to the average person. one need not be amystic or a poet or a saint (although i believe we all are all of theabove). their magic is perhaps in their brevity...not enough time to getcaught up in the details.these tapes are universal in scope and have the potential to heal much of that which has been torn apart in this world...if we could only learn to listen to the story beneath the stories that each of us claim as truth.."},{"Title":"Religions of the World","review":"Ten cassettes, ten hours of lectures by the renown Huston Smith covering the role of religion is humankind's history, specifically covering Hinduism, Buddhism, Confusionism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam plus the \\"primal religions\\" of \\"primitive\\" humans.

After I bought the book and started playing out of it I found a few faults:The songs in the book were obviously transcribed by a piano player; as about 90% of the songs in the book are guitar songs, this causes some major problems. The book is meant to be able to be used on any instrument so a lot of the chords in the book are written as slash chords to combine both the guitar and bass notes. For instance, if the guitar is playing an F while the bass is playing a C, the chord would be notated as an F/C. This is no problem when playing bass or piano, but the guitar often doesn't play the bass notes to these chords. It takes a little common sense and figuring out with the album to make out what the guitar should be playing. There are no chord boxes to show what the chords are. This is not a book that a beginner is going to be able to use! Be warned that it is written in standard notation; no tabs in here! Also, as I am primarily a bassist, I found it a little annoying that about half of the transcribed basslines were written in G clef, presumably to save space.A couple of other minor quibbles I have are that some of the songs in the book are not what I would consider to be in the realm of \\"classic rock\\". There are at least 20 songs that I would consider to be folk or pop more so than rock. It would have been nice to have a few Doors, Stones and Hendrix tunes in the book, but I assume that is because of publishing restrictions.Overall, I found the book to be quite good. The song selection is comprehensive. The chords are accurate as far as I've seen so far. The print is nice and large, so it can be used while playing from a music stand. The binding on the book is sturdy. I hope that they might put out a guitar edition of this book with chord boxes to solve most of the problems that I found listed above."},{"Title":"Just Classic Rock Real Book C Edition","review":"The selection of songs for this book was most remarkable: There is no Hendrix, The Doors, The Stones, King Crimson, one obscure Led Zepplin etc. in a book with 350 songs of &quot;classic&quot; rock. However you can find plenty of Elton John, Bon Jovi, Heart, Sonny and Cher and other &quot;pop&quot; classics instead. The actual sheet music has confusing arrangements and major ommissions of song parts (ie: the introduction to Traffic's &quot;Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot; was not written in). This book was a frustrating disappointment."},{"Title":"Just Classic Rock Real Book C Edition","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the table of contents and the great selection of songs. However, I found the book difficult to use because of the typeset. The chords are all written in very large bold letters often buried next to other large letters indicating sections of the songs. The chord letters were also written in an italizised font that made them difficult to read at times. That would have been simply an annoyance if the songs sounded like the recordings after playing them. However, many of the transcriptions sounded far off from the original recordings when played on a piano.My only wish is that I could return this book and apply that money to some of the much better fake books out there such as \\"Hal Leonard's Classic Rock Fake Book\\" or \\"Hal Leonard's The Ultimate Pop Rock Fake Book\\"."},{"Title":"Getting to know the Bengal cat","review":"If you are planning to get a Bengal Cat by purchasing or adopting, and are looking for information, then this is the book for you. I've looked around about a month and currently there are not a lot of books that deal with the breed except in a superficial way. In this book specific information regarding Breeding, Genetics, History, Care, Diseases and more are covered. I do want to point out that there is a lot of information on the internet available but it's easier to just buy the book unless you want to spend hours on the internet. A couple of caveats one this book is short, a little over 100 pages and two somewhat small but I found it to be worth the cost despite the minor shortcomings. Anyone looking for more in-depth discussion will need to go to textbooks on Feline Genetics, Feline Anatomy and Physiology and Feline Diseases."},{"Title":"P-47 Thunderbolt - Walk Around No. 11","review":"many thanks, great book, full of information, narative and pictures, useful and relevant for research and uses in scale modelling"},{"Title":"Napoleon's Hussars (Men-at-Arms)","review":"I'm consider myself as a big fan of the napoleonic cavalry, on his time was one of the best and if on waterloo most of it was finish by the English infantry it never loose their title as one of the best prepare and well trained of his time in Europe. One particular unit is the famous HUSSARS, this book try to explore their equipment, uniforms and weapons with the help of the great Illustrator Angus McBride.Their famous pursuit of 1806 in Jena make then change the idea of why the light cavalry was so important, this is why Emir Bukhari describe the organization with the help of some great illustration taken from the Book of Cdt Bucquoy, La Cavalerie Legere by Pierre Benigni, all the black illustrations are from the 1st Hussars but the color plates are from almost the most important regiments, trumpeters, officers,sappers and troopers are some of the uniforms portray in this book.Emir Bukhari describes the organization, war records, dress and equipment and the weapons.If you are a re-enactor or just a fan of Napoleonic Uniforms this is what you are looking for also the small bibliography would help you if you want to know more.I recommend that if you are interesting start reading the great Book by Edouard Detaille L'Armee Francaise or the great books by F.

The novel's parallel and intersecting storylines between Washington (portrayed here in very human and historically plausible terms without the mythic quality so often attributed to him) and one of his slaves, aptly named &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; who escapes to join the British Army are compelling and offer a unique and welcome glimpse into the ironies of 18th century life. Cameron's well-developed characters represent the relative views &quot;freedom&quot; as it was interpreted by American rebels and their slaves in very different ways.As a fan of Jeff Shaara's historical novels on the Civil War, I rate Cameron's attention to historical detail and writing style on an even higher plane. Military and social historians alike, as well as the casual reader just looking look for a great story, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Washington and Caesar","review":"As a Canadian with ancestors in the infamous Butler's Rangers and many relatives in the United States, I find this book fascinating, relevant today and holding me to the end. Cameron's research brings out the character of Washington and Caesar, two military men from classes at the opposite ends of society, with credibility. And in the dialogue with the captured British Captain Stewart comes close to making Patrick Henry's concluding remark in his famous speech, \\"Give me liberty or give me death\\" seem hypocritical. Douglas R. Kinsman"},{"Title":"Washington and Caesar","review":"As an historian/author/interpreter of the Revolutionary War I give this book a stamp of approval. I usually shy away from fiction novels on history because they have a tendency to re-write history and take poetic license with facts. Nothing upsets a historian more than ready a story and having to correct every other paragraph. No one was more surprised than I that this was a wonderful book to read. Are there historic inaccuracies in the book? Yes, but not bad enough so as to take away from the overall content or flow of the story. As a previous reviewer wrote, \\"I found myself rooting for Caesar.\\" I did the same thing and took it one step further, cheering for the Continental soldier, George Lake. The story was marvelous, pulling you in and taking you on ride that brought both up and down. A great villain in the book that really gets your blood boiling, beauties that the men are attracted to, but no steamy sex scenes and action that makes you feel like you are a British, Hessian or Continental soldier on the battlefields of Colonial America. I can pay this book and its author only my best compliment. Look for another book written by Christian Cameron."},{"Title":"Washington and Caesar","review":"Washington and Caesar is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read. Cameron's knowledge of the period is outstanding (I am speaking as a history teacher and Revolutionary War reencator of over eight years experience).

I hope that Cameron plans to follow up W+C with more Revolutionary War period novels."},{"Title":"Washington and Caesar","review":"I can't give much better review than the previous reviews, but I can't tell you that it was hard for me to put the book down.

I even found myself rooting for Ceasar even tho I know the British were going to lose.. :P. This part of history is dear to me becuase some of my ancestors were involved thru the war or starting out the country. This book has driven my desires to learn more about this time of history to an all time high.

I love that the protagonist is a former slave.The compelling everyday detail in city scenes and camp scenes makes you feel that you can smell the setting.

There is so much description it is unbearable. It would have been a lot better if the author let the reader's imagination have a chance at visualizing what was happening instead of describing every square inch of the scene.I remember one part when he takes two paragraphs or so describing how Caesar makes a fire. Wouldn't it have been easier just to say, \\"Ceasar made a fire.\\" ??I liked the first 30 or so pages because it was something new. There also seemed to be less description. But now i'm on page 520, and there's been so much description in some parts that I had to put the book down after reading a single page. It was unbearable.Also, Washington doesn't seem to be playing that much of a major role in the book. But whenever he's there, he's just the same old Washington we've seen and learned and read about a million times before. There's nothing new to him, there's nothing more special about the Washington in this book than there is in an average history book, except for the fact that he has dialogue in this book. But in my opinion, his dialogue is bland and uninteresting.Caesar, on the other hand, is something new, and I think that the book would have been much better if the author left out all of the continental army scenes and all of the scenes where Washington wasn't interacting with Caesar. The continental army scenes and the Washington scenes serve no real purpose whatsoever. The book would have been a gem if it had been only about Caesar. But instead, there are two plots; the one I have already mentioned, and the plot about the continental army, which I couldn't care less about.Now, the Caesar scenes are pretty good, but they still have one fatal flaw; there is still too much description. Now, I don't mind description that much, it helps me visualize the scene better, but I just can't bear it when there is an extreme overload of gratuitous description that really wrecks the story, like this one.The book did offer a nice twist, about slaves joining the English army. But it didn't offer any new twist on the continental army. In fact, it didn't even need the continental army scenes, as I stated earlier. All it needed was Caesar, and nothing else, and it would have been great. But by adding the continental scenes and the Washington scenes, what we get are new scenes that we don't need that serve no purpose to the book except make it longer and bore the reader. It seems the author added these scenes just for the sake of adding them.Revolutionary war buffs will probably like this one, cause that's what it's about: the Revolutionary war.But as for everyone else, i'm not so sure. I, for one, find it unbearable.The book could have been so much better had the author cut down on the description and left out all of the continental army scenes and all of the Washington scenes where Washington wasn't interacting with Caesar (which are only at the beginning (and end, from what I hear, I haven't reached the end yet)). That's how it could have been great. But that's not what happened. Instead, it got turned into a boring, prolonged, unreadable mess.Again, Rev War Buffs may like it, but I don't think much of anyone else will.1 out of 5"},{"Title":"AAA Spiral Guide New York (AAA Spiral Guides)","review":"As noted in another review, this is not the most comprehensive of guidebooks, but that can be an advantage when carrying it in your backpack while touring the city!

It's a funny book, though not riotously so: more witty and arch, or getting its humor by deflating stereotypes. Its plot is devious and twisted, but though there's sex and a riot and some explosions, it seems restrained compared to other Sharpe books.

Start reading Sharpe with Wilt or Blott."},{"Title":"Great Pursuit","review":"The zany plot lines and characters of Tom Sharpe are present, but the language is toned down slightly. The plot is rather summarily tidied up at the end as though the word limit was achieved and the author just decided to work into a close. Early promise in the plot was therefore not fully realised. The characters were as likely and unlikely as ever. On the whole not up to the great 'Blott', but not quite as raucous as some of the others by Sharpe."},{"Title":"Great Pursuit","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all.

I've read his books, seen TV versions, and always with the same result. Raucous, bawdy, and, at times, bitingly satirical tales. This is another of the same.I'm reviewing the UK 1977 Pan Books edition.The novel falls short in the hastily fabricated ending, and I see I'm not alone to think so. Was Sharpe's own Great Pursuit to finish in a predetermined number of words? The story rushes to an end through the last couple of chapters.I think Brits would appreciate the humor more than anyone else, because it fits a comic tradition that's British more than it is American. Nobody I know hereabouts has read any of his novels. Their loss.It was a minor niggle, and odd, that Sharpe's research for the US scenes was lacking, with things such as misspelled place names (e.g. Ashville, NC) and huge errors in distance between Bangor and Tuscaloosa (2000 miles?). Maybe I'm being picky, but for me the little mistakes take away from the enjoyment. I haven't noticed those kinds of things in the other novels I've read, such as Porterhouse Blue, the Wilts, Blott, etc.But it's still a damn good read. I've re-read it a few times, and will do again. I'd recommend it, but not for a first Sharpe experience. Try Blott or Wilt first.Four stars instead of five, due only to the rushed ending and the niggles."},{"Title":"Great Pursuit","review":"This was the first Tom Sharpe's book I read. It was so funny!

He ends up physically flashing back in time. This book will keep you as it did me, glued to your seat unable to put down the book.

This well-written and insightful book kept me up into the wee hours. Besides a full account of Dion Fortune's life (written with the cooperation of her Society of the Inner Light, and the use of its archives), there are rare photographs, and numerous excerpts from spiritual communications received by her. In addition to the outer history, Gareth Knight seamlessly weaves in a deep understanding of the inner dynamics of DF's life, and the life of the Society she founded. This is a book not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Dion Fortune And The Inner Light","review":"This is a significant book about Dion Fortune and Knight has the advantage of being in possession of many documents that were originally available only to members of the Servants of the Inner Light.For anyone wishing to know more about the woman who was Dion Fortune this is required reading."},{"Title":"Dion Fortune And The Inner Light","review":"Having enjoyed Dion Fortune's novels and other occult works, I eagerly anticipated this supposed definitive biography.However, as a biography it has its shortcomings.It tells us very little about Dion as a person. It does not bring her or her associates alive, as a good biography should.It says nothing about her personal relationship with her husband Dr Thomas Evans or their split up.It may be argued that her occult work was more important than her personal life, but we expect in a biography more personal details than are given here.The biography by Alan Richardson, though opinionated, is more interesting to read and gives a more extensive discussion of her novels.It is interesting to find out that when she was born Dion was thought to be dead.This happened also to pioneer mystic Anna Kingsford, an influence on Dion through McGregor Mathers and the Golden Dawn.The book gives for the first time a reliable estimate of Dion's birth time: 55 minutes past midnight(6 Dec.1890, Llandudno).Some may find the inner workings of her occult group as given interesting, but apparently the Society of the Inner Light as it exists today has moved on from the fuddy duddy stuff. We still wait for a real biography of Dion."},{"Title":"Dion Fortune And The Inner Light","review":"I think I have read most books on Dion Fortune, but this one is definitely my favorite. It is an engaging, well-informed, and well-writen account of this fascinating woman's life and work. Gareth Knight was granted access to the archives of the Society of the Inner Light, and the material from these archives offers a fascinating insight into the workings of the group in Dion Fortune's days. Despite being very involved with Fortune's work (he was trained in the Inner Light during the 50's and 60's), Knight manages to stay fairly objective and factual, more so than Fortune's previous biographers. I absolutely couldn't put this book down. I consider it to be the definitive DF biography, and I don't expect it will ever be bettered."},{"Title":"Deeds for California Real Estate","review":"Even if you will be hiring a real estate lawyer or title company, this is a good book to have in order to become familiar with deeds and changing them.If you aren't familiar with the NOLO brand of legal books, these books give a good layman's overview of the legal area they cover in everyday language."},{"Title":"Deeds for California Real Estate","review":"I bet local lawyers hate Nolo press because they unshroud the mystery & legal mumbo jumbo of various common legal transactions most of us sometime in our life need to deal with.this time the nuts & bolts of deeds is clearly & thoroughly explained & how to file them. the best part is the cd-rom which has an editable deed form which let me rewrite my own deed for transfer of my house to my trust.after reading the book & using the cd, i found that the actual deed document is quite simple & i think most average adults could write & file there own deed & avoid expensive lawyer fees."},{"Title":"Deeds for California Real Estate","review":"This book is among the best that Nolo has to offer in its self-help series. I was curious what would be said about warranty deeds (in which the seller provides some level of guarantee that title, area, and condition of the property have particular characteristics) and it says very little. Which is good, because if there are particular aspects of a property about which you seek assurance, then you should work with an attorney. Instead it notes, that few consumer deeds are in this form as title insurance addresses title and generally buyers haven't the leverage they have now (and in some sense, concerns about area and condition are better addressed up front through survey/inspection and resulting adjustment of the price).Grant deeds, quitclaims and deeds of trust are covered and good information on when to use each is given in nugget-size.

I've used many Nolo products in the past and have always found them to be informative and practical. \\"Deeds for California Real Estate\\" is no exception.Anybody who needs to change or transfer ownership in real estate they already own will find this book to be an invaluable resource. The text is very comprehensive, with guidance for all of the important activities in preparing and filing real estate deeds in California, as long as the new deed is not for an open-market sale, for out-of-state property, or for removing the name of a deceased co-owner.As with just about all Nolo publications, this book is organized in a very straightforward way. Each chapter covers a broad topic, such as Who Must Sign the Deed?, How Should the New Owners Take Title?, Recording Your Deed, and When You Need an Expert. After a brief introduction, the text explains the key principles underlying each topic and helps you figure out your legal rights and responsibilities.The book includes a CD-ROM with a small collection of forms for creating and recording deeds. Access to a basic word processor and an Adobe Acrobat reader are required to view the forms. The deed forms are in Rich Text (.rtf) format, so they can be filled out on a computer, while all the other forms are .pdf files and can only be printed out. I had no problems opening any of the files on an i7 iMac using Microsoft Word 2008 and Apple Preview 5.0.2 .Bottom line: \\"Deeds for California Real Estate\\" is a reliable, no frills-no hype guide.

I think 120 pages is a lot for the topic, which means the book covers it exhaustively.I didn't know there were so many legal issues. The book discusses types of deeds (quitclaim, trust, grant, etc.); how marriage and divorce affect deeds; tax issues; inheritance; title searches; disclosure requirements, etc.A DVD, containing various legal forms, is included.The book directs you to Nolo Press's website for updates in the law, after you've bought the book.Since this book seems to cover everything on the issue (what more can you ask?)

Coal mining is what the Morgan family was all about, this was their life, their valley and their existence so when the mining companies make the Morgan family's way of living unbearable, the Morgan boys had no choice but to rise up against the oppression and there goes the beauty that was once their lives.Huw makes this story come alive. Through the eyes of the innocent, then the dawning adolescence and finally the man that has been through love and heartbreak, we see the valley that Huw loved so much. Llwelyn's first person narrative allows us to see each character through Huw's eyes. The eyes that grow with time and with maturity.I can see the charm of this book growing with each reader. There are many layers and with each readers personal experiences each will see this book differently. If you have read it in the past, re-read it again and you will see why this book is a classic."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"This is not only one of the best books I have read in a long time, but one of the best I have read in my life (and I'm pretty old). There's a reason How Green Is My Valley is a classic - Llewellyn is a masterful writer. I loved the sense of family and community he created in this Welsh coal mining town, pre union. His characters were so believable and their struggles and conflicts realistic. I especially enjoyed Llewellyn's descriptions -of people, places, and even the minister's answer to young Huw's question, \\"Where do babies come from?\\"I enjoyed the book so much, I decided to rent the DVD and was not disappointed. Books are always better than movies, but in this film, the viewer could actually hear the villagers singing to mark any noteworthy event in their midst. Netflix describes this tale as the \\"disintegration of a family,\\" but I don't see it that way. Yes, heart-breaking events happen in a person's life, things change, and loved ones die, but what great love and joy this family experienced. Huw would always have his memories. For me, How Green Was My Valley, both book and film were inspirational."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"Definitely on my all time top ten list of reads, even after reading at least 4 times over my life. Every time I read it, new inspiration flows out of it, as different things resonate with me as my life evolves. I find in uncannily relevant today--- the same issues we deal with here and now-environmentalism, corporate control, labor issues, religous interpretation, hippocracy, physical and mental illness, bigotry, generational gaps, love, sex, meaning of life stuff, are all there. The more things change the more they stay the same. I find Huw to be wonderfully human, innately good, yet he certainly struggles to cope with the \\"devil\\" within, as we all do-and sometimes the devil wins. His deep and poetic appreciation of the small things in life help me to do the same. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who is attracted to bittersweet coming of age stories."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I love this book which is the most beautifully written story I've ever read. It is a lovely story of a boy growing up amid the ever-blackening hills of Wales. A sick child, he is a keen observer the changes in his green valley as it goes from a green valley to one blackened by coal dust along with the joys and tragedies of a Welsh coal-mining town. It may not sound interesting, but Llewellyn's beautiful writing style is reason enough to read this book. And the story is wonderful."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"As engrossing and natural as Herriot, but a bit more dramatic, a bit more foreign feeling and much more beautifully written.

The most off-putting thing about How Green... was how after initial laying out of scene,characters,atmosphere the author broke into a Messiahnic stride or as though there was a bible-bashing foundation to the narrative or as if all the Devotion to kith and kin was pivoted in Devotion to God. Possibly this is why the post war novel was such a hit because it upholds Faith as much as Community and with so many loved ones killed, a novel with these values was a big comfort as people went about re-building there lives.So i found the subliminal preachiness off-putting and just as i was about to put it down i fast-forwarded one last time and sure enough it's put into words father to son how the poor welsh britons/celts were cut-off and marginalised by the english from the Culture and the world and all they had was the bible to guide them and seeing how its all they had it's a marvel the welsh were able to pull themselves out of barbarism as they did.Does Greeness refer to loss of the good old days of Wales when the welsh were good sheep in the church and before industrial revolutiion produced fat cat bosses lacking in the noble obligation of the fuedal aristocrats not to mistreat the workers?If so I would suggest there is an element of propaganda in the book to entreat that if soceity is going to be modernised then religiously it would loose all worth and value if folk strayed from the church in the process: a lament as such would have made a readable novel, propaganda and welsh evangelism does notIn the film they actually have the Welsh miners coming home.from the.pit singing hymns of all things about as far fetched as it gets since the Welsh are not more pious than the rest of.Britain."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I think that the beginning of the book was the worst part.

Back when he was a little kid. He tells about different experiances. how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years. he tells about all the troubles that his family went through.

I found it not to be overly exciting and I would not claim it to be a book that I simply could not put down. This book's setting is in Wales in a small minning town, in a valley, as the title implies. However, also as the title implies, the valley in the present time was not as beautiful and green as it was in the narrator, Huw's, boyhood. As the valley turns black because of the slag (waste from coal minning), Huw seems to loose more of his innoscence. Huw must cope with many tragities, including the death of his brother and father, his brothers and girlfriend moving away forever, and problems dealing with the formation of a coal minning union. Despite these tragities, in the end, when Huw has finally decided to leave the valley, he misses many of the happy memories of his childhood (the memories of his brothers, father, friends, etc...)."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I read this book a few years ago for my English Class, and I seriously thought it was the worst novel I'd ever read. Not only was almost unbearably insipid, it was so depressing and ugly that if it could have drawn me in enough to have cared about it, I would have been filled with only negative emotions such as grief and sadness."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"The warmth and love Richard Llewellyn had for his Welsh family and the coal-mining village where he grew up has remained with me for maybe 40+ years since I first read it. Written in 1939, How Green Was My Valley has become a bittersweet coming of age tale of a boy growing up in a large family in a small town, and of his love for his lovely sister-in-law. This is a coal mine story, so you just know there's going to be some tragedy involved, and of course there is. The story is written from the depths of the author's heart and soul. No wonder it won an Oscar when it was made into a movie.If you've never read it, do it now. If you read it 40 years ago, read it again. It won't be stale."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"Within pages, I felt that I was reading a masterpiece. Richard Llewelyn does a marvelous job of introducing his audience to the lush history of Wales. Not only does he descriptively carry us into the past through the home of the Morgans, but slowly introduces readers to Welsh sentence structure; it is not merely an attempt to sound sappy or sentimental, but an effort to share the beauty of language used by the Welsh. The result is undeniable liquid poetry. At first, the unusual phrasing may strike you as odd and make reading difficult, but before you know it, you will be swept into it.The story itself is gripping as it carries us through the hardships and triumphs that bring a family closer together and at times, tear it apart - told through the eyes of a boy. You will find yourself remembering life's many &quot;initiations&quot; through the eyes of Huw Morgan as well as forgotten sensations of childhood. Because of this, the story holds universal appeal and will leave a long lasting impression on those who partake.There is beautiful it is!!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"From the very first line of this book, I knew I was in for an interesting, unique experience. This novel was beautiful~ the flowing language, the flashes from present time to the past, the intricate detail of each character. The simplicity of the narrative of this story carries the plot line along. The descriptive use of words, especially adjectives, sets the reader right in the middle of all the action. Although the characters seem too &quot;good&quot; a lot of the time, I think the reason for this is because the society which they inhabit is so. They do have their bad qualities which they acknowledge and try to remedy. Llewellyn chose to write this book with simple Welsh language; a wise choice I heartily agree with it. The reader can feel the words coming straight from the heart, and can therefore connect well with the characters. This book had me captivated from beginning to end, and even when it ended, I found myself wishing for more.

I recommend them all."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"This melancholic elegy for departed loved ones and the vanished way of life of a Welsh coal mining town is one of the most beautiful books ever written. The narrator, Huw Morgan, tells the story of the lives and loves of his extended family and their townfolk as their closeknit community disintegrates under the pressures of modern life and the decreasing profitability of the mine--from brothers who have to move to America to make a living or others who are killed in the coal pits, to the widowed sister-in-law who Huw loves for years but never tells, to Mr. Gruffudd the local minister who helps Huw through childhood paralysis &amp; becomes his tutor, to Dai Bando who teaches him to box and most of all to the beloved parents who suffer long but love greatly. The language itself is lyrical and haunting, the story ineffably sad. But always, Huw reminds us that these remarkable people live on in him:Courage came to me from the height of the mountain, and with it came the dignity of manhood, and knowledge of the Tree of Life, for now I was a branch, running with the vital blood, waiting in the darkness of the Garden ....to bring forth sons and daughters.I saw behind me those who had gone, and before me, those who were to come. I looked back and saw my father, and his father, and all our fathers, and in front, to see my son, and his son, and the sons upon sons beyond.And their eyes were my eyes.As I felt, so they had felt, and were to feel, as then, so now, as tomorrow and forever.Then I was not afraid, for I was in a long line that had no beginning, and no end, and the hand of his father grasped my father's hand, and his hand was in mine, and my unborn son took my right hand, and all, up and down the line that stretched from Time That Was, to Time That Is, and Is Not Yet, raised their hands to show the link, and we found that we were one, born of Woman, son of Man, made in the Image, fashioned in the Womb by the Will of God, the Eternal Father.It is the permanence that these mortal souls gain through the medium of memory that ultimately makes the book uplifting.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I have one thing to say about this book: I have NEVER had to go back and re-read so much of any book just for the sheer enjoyment of the passages as I have this one.

The reader is impressed by the simple, vital pleasures of the life that the Morgan family experiences. Industrial capitalism takes its toll on the family and community, proof that capitalism is often not conservative in its effects. The several Morgan boys are driven from their family home because of the stresses and wild cycles of early industrialism. The town in which the Morgan's live, once a community of friends, gradually becomes a mean, more brutal town by book's end.

I went into this book expecting another &quot;classic&quot;. In other words, a boring book that has some symbolic meaning that students are supposed to interpret.

It is a moving novel about life in which the characters grow close to your heart and you become part of the Morgan family in an English mining village. The ending is not perfect, and perhaps there isn't as much closure as one would like, but then again, life isn't perfect either. This is what makes &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; warm the heart and haunt the soul. I will never forget this story as long as I live, and I will carry these life lessons with me forever. I reccommend this book to everyone, and my advice is to read it with a box of tissues."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"&quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; is one of those magical books that make you actualy feel like you are there. You can feel the coal dust on your arms. You can smell the food from the Morgan table. You can even see the encroaching slag heap. The characters in the book seem like old friends, indeed, I have friends like those from the book.It is truly a travesty that this book wasn't picked as one of the best books of the century, for it surely is. Honestly, good character, morality, Christianity, and honour are all promoted in it. Well, given the current moral climate, perhaps I can see why. None the less, it is still a favourite, and I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"The title say it all. A delightful book, allowing the reader to live that life in the little coal mining town of the mid 1900's. Sad & joyous - just as life is!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"The story is a enduring coming of age epic, that pulls the reader into the life and times of a Welsh coal mining family. From a child's eye view the beginning of the twentieth century is narrated in a poetic voice. The protagonist Huw grows up into a young man and along the way he enjoys his favourite recipes and fights bullies. The writing is transliterated and anglicized Welsh and at first, can be a bit of a strain, but it grows on you as you dwell deeply into the domestic joy and challenges of the Morgan family.The book has allot in it; nature, trade unions, good and bad religion, colonial oppression in schools, love stories, fights, and allot more. Universal life themes are to be found as if digging in a mine. The slag heap the coal mine produces slowly takes over the valley. It is a metaphor for the slow decline of the community. As greed overtakes the miners the slag heap overtakes the valley and it is no longer a time \`when all a man needed was a good meal, a warm bed, and a couple of coins to jingle in your pocket.'Like other stories set in the same time frame the book in some ways critics the coming of modernity. Money becomes more important than the fish in the river. An experimental engine becomes a multitude of engine shops draining oil into the river. The extended family beaks up as the offspring emigrate all over the world looking for work.The strength of this book is the poetic voice that narrates the rhythm of life, and it is something like the voice of god reaching out of the pages. The poetry is so enduring and so touching that it can pull tears out of the most stoic of readers. The men of the valley sing their joy as they go to work and chapel. But the singing stops like the proverbial parrot in a coal mine as the community declines.This book was made into a Academy Award winning movie and into a TV series. I am keeping my copy for the poetry written in these worthy pages. Pick up and read!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"A stunningly good book -- Language, character, plot, sensibility, depth of understanding .. a true wonder of a book.

As with most books, it was ten times better than the movie, which I also very much enjoyed.This first person narrative of a small Welsh coal mining town from decades ago, could very well be a story in present day America. This tale of the joys, trials, comradeship, faith, family, and community was underpinned with the disputes of workers seeking better salaries. But it was the faith of God and love of family that ran through all the emotions that make up a great story.I highly recommend this classic to everyone who has yet to read the book. Superior writing also made this book a real treasure for all times!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I loved this book when I first read it as a 4th grader. My teacher, Miss Kopeck, gave it to me (as I was quite an advanced reader). I spent many hours reading and rereading the lush descriptions of the valley, imagining myself living there. I remember begging to be allowed to stay up to see the movie, and my bitter disappointment at how much of the book had been cut out.Just this morning I had the incredible urge to read it again and was very disappointed to learn that it is not yet available for Kindle.I've ordered the book through my local public library system. I'm giddy at the thought of being able to experience the magic of this story as an adult."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"How Green Was My Valley was our bookclub selection for this month. This book was written way before I was born, but it is timeless. The descriptions of Richard LLewellyn are music to the ears, like when he is describing the perfect cup of tea. The culture of these Welsh people comes through loud and clear, and I can picture events, people, and settings quite clearly. Definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"When I began this book, I wondered about what had happened in this man's (Huw, the main character) life that made him look back in such sorrow. As I went though the joys this boy experienced as a child, the hope he had, I wondered what tragic event could change his life so. As Huw grew older, a few sour notes were added to the song of his life. But, no matter, they were accepted to be life. Going further and futher into the book more and more bad notes entered and the tune began to change. When I reached the end of the story, I relized how all those small things had made such a difference in Huw's life; that there was no one destructive incident that made him so sorrowfull, but many little pains. This book shows the small cruelties of men, the joys of a small gift, and the accurately portrays life. It makes you tressure all that you have, and apperciate all that you can do for your world.-LJ"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"How Green Was My Valley is, without a doubt, among my top two or three all-time favorites. I also just finished listening to the unabridged book on audiotape and I think it's even better hearing the story read aloud.

Fabulous book."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"The largest Welsh speaking communities outside of Wales are in the anthracite coal mining regions of Northeastern Pennsylvania, which is where I was born and raised. When I was a child the Welsh Baptist churchgoers still sang the hymns in Welsh, the neighbors spoke Welsh, my grandparents spoke Welsh, and everyone worked in the mines. While this book is a memory piece set in Wales, it might as well be set 70 years later in my hometown. Every character is authentic; every word is authentic; every emotion, reaction, sentiment and family situation is authentic. There are lots of \\"big canvas\\" sagas, and memoirs, and historical novels, but there is no other book I can think of that so honestly recreates a lost time, place, and people. If you have any interest at all in Wales: The First Place, this is the book with which to begin."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY by Richard Llewellyn is a stirring, rich, beautiful story of life, love and hope in the mining region of Wales. Written in the first person, Llewellyn paints a portrait with such stirring artistry, the spirit soars.Huw Morgan is the fifth son of a mining family; respected, middle class, hard-working and faithful. Headed by a loving father of matchless integrity, the family grapples with the strains of unionization of the mine workers, economics of uncertain employment, marriage, life and death in the plight of those times.The story is largely about the relationships within and without the family, in the community, congregation, and working class. It is here that genius takes full flourish. Page after sweet page flies by as the delicate yet strong relationships are forged and tested and strained and mended. More than all, Green is my valley is a study of a boy growing into manhood as told in richest detail and highest artistry.The green hills marred by slag truly come alive in this magnificent tale and all the people with it in richest array."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I cannot imagine a better way to encounter this novel. Reading it, unless you are yourself Welsh-born, the \\"voice\\" would not be there--the accent and the charm of the way of speaking of all the characters. On audiotape, this was simply brilliant! I rented a copy of my own but am ordering a used copy for my mother, who was born in Wales but left as a small child. I think she will love the sense of being there that the audio recording gives.Patrick Tull is a brilliant reader. I have heard him read many books, and he is in a league of his own.This is a PS, written some months later: my mother did indeed love the tape, and actually listened to it twice. She said it brought back the past so vividly that she dreamed in Welsh the whole time. And she was shocked to find that Patrick Tull was not actually Welsh, but English. She thought he spoke exactly like her grandfather, who did not even leave Wales for Canada until he was over 50."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars.

Read this book."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"This is a truly magnificent book, which tugs at the heart strings and takes us back to a time when the world was very different.It is a lovely tale of a family which shines through good times and bad, through joy and adversity, and which ultimately provides us with a rich tale cleverly interwoven with some of the strongest characters in literature. In addition we have the magnificent Welsh country side, the horrors of the mines and the love of a family who cannot manage without each other.It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and you won't want o put it down until you have finished it."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I happened to see this old book in our municipal library a decade ago. I read it. Then I re-read it. I watched the Hollywood version of the book too.

Still I remember the visit to the Daffodles in the mountains with the Pastor. So enchanting story for me."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"Everyone in our book group loved this one. The character development was evident in each individual. The cadence of the welsh language was causing our families to look at us in concern by the time we'd finished the book.

A good primer in fisticuffs, also.BTW, I tried watching the old movie (40/50's) afterward, but it was bad (not just in comparison to the book, but in it's own right). Your mileage may vary."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"\\"How green was my valley then, and the valley of them that have gone\\" records Richard Llewellyn's final words in this 1939 novel of the Gilfach Goch (Rhondda Cynon Taff) coal-mining region of south, central Wales.The novel is nostalgic, but not in the negative sense of looking back to a sanitized world we would have preferred, but which never was. For Llewellyn, nostalgia is a tempered and well-honed tool for liberating us from the stunted vision of our popular culture with its trendy media and revisionist historians. Laurie Lee and James Herriot would have agreed. Good fiction is the best non-fiction in this sense, not to be confused with the selected-omitted-arranged elements often encountered in mainstream history. Must we cite Shakespeare's histories?Book publishing today understandably promotes the commercial notion that \\"real truth\\" resides in just-released bestsellers, but Llewelyn would almost certainly have disagreed, arguing perhaps that if the humanities pledge to monitor the human condition, then books from long ago, often the less-well-known ones, might well be our best measure of the present.First, take the subject of bullying. Media solutions today favor diplomacy, legal challenges, and police action, but NEVER suggesting fighting back in self-defense. \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" reminds us of the forgotten historical norm: teach your kid to stand up to the bully, teach him or her to fight, and be prepared to go after the bullies and their enablers yourself if the safety of your family is at stake. Fighting in self-defense is preferred, as with character Dai Bando, over passively aggressive measures such as letters to the editor (which might well prolong suffering and confusion). Llewellyn recommends more self-reliant justice to dispense with the protracted anguish that comes with ineffectual diplomacy. As with Welsh back then, we cannot always count on the police or a standing army, both of which affirm violence, just not your own.Second, be alert to the value of prayer in the book, a potent example to children (and readers) who witness it. How can we not find liberating the example of the Welsh father Gwilym Morgan who would spontaneously kneel in front of his family to offer appropriate prayer. What witnessing do our fathers exemplify today? Must those who say grace in public restaurants (their family's hands in a tradition-affirming circle) be the last holdouts of less-trendy moral actions? Where else does heroism reside today?The two themes come together in Llewellyn's support of hereditary self-defense. When the narrator comes upon a very young girl being humiliated for simply being Welsh, a protective impulse from collective memory brushes aside the cowardly restraints of topical manners and other facile turn-the-other-cheek sentiments: \\"I saw, as through the mist of a morning, the grass upon a field torn, and a spewing forth of earth and stones, and men coming to stand before me who wore their steel as I wear tweed, in ease and comfort, and their swords were bright. And I heard a note in the infant voice as of trumpets sounding for battle, and drums beat, and men were shouting, chariots raced and dragon banners streamed, and bowmen plucked strings while steel spoke in the ranks and lance heads glittered in the sun. And battle lust was in me, with blood running red about my feet and my hands red with it, and slippery, and the smell of it hot near me.\\"Llewellyn finds the response wholesome. Yes, the \\"infant\\" young girl is able to keep her healthy survival instincts alive, much as kids today find video games and horror shows to be their only options to preserve a cultural toughness that parents have been cleansed of.\\"How Green Was My Valley\\" is surely one of those classics we must read again, if for no other reason than to free ourselves from the self-defeating social programming--nearly invisible--that pervades modern society."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"when was reading this book, the events,the characters in it made me very impressive.

It deals with how modernisation threatens and annihilates traditional practices and occupation, which is relevant to all periods in history as we ask what we have to give up to progress. A tad depressing and overwrought, but sensitive account of a man's coming-of-age and the idea that Wales is a &quot;nation of song&quot; does make me wanna visit sometime."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"This book will make you wish you knew Welsh.

Thank you."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"A few times in my reading life I have been so been so touched by a book that when it is over I feel a great loss and literally clasp the book to my chest like a loved-one just departed.Some one once said, after seeing the beauty of Alaska, that he wished he had seen it as an old man, for it's magnificent beauty would surely spoil any scene he would ever see after. That's how I feel about this lovely, beautiful, wonderful book. I am afraid nothing I read will ever make me feel like this.It's about a small coal-mining village in Wales and the people in it. The focus is on a big wonderful family that loves each other very much though they sure do have their share of trouble. The point of view is that of Huw, beginning when he is just 6 years old and going all the way to his middle age. The prose is, well, poetry. I collected my favorite bits in a list on the bag page but there are too many to fit here. Here's but a few:\\"Beautiful were the days that are gone, and O, for them to be back. The mountain was green, and proud with a good covering of oak and ash, and washing his feet in a streaming river clear as the eyes of God. The winds came down with the scents of the grass and wild flowers, putting a sweetness to our noses, and taking away so that nobody could tell what beauty had been stolen, only that the winds were old robbers who took something from each grass and flower and gave it back again, and gave a little to each of us, and took it away again.\\"\\"...a tidy house, but open to the weather, and the winds had choir practice whenever they could on every side of it.\\"\\"Ceinwen was in my mind, and I kept her there as men keep libraries of rare books, seldom to be touched but happy to know you have got.\\"I wonder if anyone could ever write such a masterpiece again. If I ever thought I could be a writer, I don't now. I suppose I am just a reader, a proper bibliophile. With books like this, it's enough."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"Read this book and you will forget about all other books you read so far. There is absolutely no match for this book. Once you start reading it, you just cannot keep it without finishing it up. The author takes all the credit by his style of expressing the thoughts. I bet, no one has ever expressed their thoughts in such a beautiful manner. Had there been an option for giving 100 stars, I would have given it 100 out of 100. Go for the book, you will love it."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"The novel was one written with true dedication and emotion. I have never read a story with such description and heartwarming events as this. A break from the typical romance or mystery, this novel has made its way as one that centers on a family that refuses to be broken. This tale reminds the reader of the importance of family, loyalty, and the rewards of such things. Despite the focus on family, this book lacks no adventure, romance, or excitement. A truly well-rounded book!! 5+ stars and 2+ thumbs up!!!!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I'll just go ahead and start by saying this review is a hard one for me to write. My emotions become tied up in all of the books I have loved over the years, and it matters very little what genre they are or what the writing style is or when they were written and by whom. Those books that I really love, I tend to love with wild abandon and, once given, that devotion is rarely retracted. A friend recently commented that I am \\"the queen of re-reading.\\" And this is true. I love nothing better than a cozy sit down with an old friend, and I don't hesitate to put off the shiny new tome I've got in my hand if the battered old one is the one that's calling my name. But there is one book that I can't let myself reread too often. In fact, I've only read it twice in my life. I joke (but, of course, I'm not really joking at all) that I can only read it once every decade, because the contents are too beautiful and too painful for everyday wear. That book is HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY by Richard Llewellyn. It sat in my house the entire time I was growing up, and I vaguely knew that it was a favorite of my mother's because of her Welsh ancestry. It was the title that drew me to it. What a wonderful title. I would go over and stroke the spine, but I never pulled it out. I think because I was worried it might not live up to its beautiful title. Finally, one summer I got the courage up to give it a shot. I've never been the same.***I am going to pack my two shirts with my other socks and my best suit in the little blue cloth my mother used to tie round her hair when she did the house, and I am going from the Valley.***Those are the the first words the reader encounters in this impressive volume. And they're the ones that made me certain this book and I would have a relationship. Growing up in a small coal mining town in South Wales, the youngest of a raft of five brothers and three sisters, Huw Morgan believed life would always be the same. From helping his mother cook her bottomless, delicious meals in the family kitchen, to taking his weekly penny down to the taffy pullers for a length of homemade taffy, to watching his larger-than-life father and stout older brothers make the daily trek down the hill and home from the mines, Huw's life is filled to the brim with the sights and sounds and people of home. In love with his oldest brother's wife from a very young age, and well aware of his lowly status within the family hierarchy, Huw knows what is his and what is not. But his is a heart that knows how to love and he watches closely over the members of his family as they encounter the myriad trials and heartaches of life and as he himself is put through the painful process of growing up and becoming a man. Along the way, almost everything about his humble life is altered, through strikes, schooling, marriage, betrayal, passion, death, and even boxing. Through it all, Huw struggles to reconcile the life that he knew with the life that is and to remember the good and the beautiful along with the bad and the ugly.Written in 1939, HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY is a tribute to the Welsh people and culture. Prior to reading this book, I don't think I'd ever felt as immersed in a version of our own world as I did in this one. Many a fantasy novel captured my imagination, but a work of historical fiction set only a few decades in the past? That was a first. Llewellyn's storytelling is second to none. To this day I'm in awe of the compassion and loving attention to detail that went into the telling. A very favorite passage (from so many it's impossible to count):***Bronwen came over plenty of Saturdays after that, but I was always shy of her. I think I must have fallen in love with Bronwen even then and I must have been in love with her all my life since. It is silly to think a child could fall in love. If you think about it like that, mind. But I am the child that was, and nobody knows how I feel, except only me. And I think I fell in love with Bronwen that Saturday on the hill.***I fell in love with Bronwen (and Huw) that day on the hill as well. And I have been in love with them both ever since. That simple, measured, and certain way Huw has of narrating his story sort of swallowed me from page one. Told in alternating passages between the present and the past, the man and the boy, the narrative incorporates the reader in such a way that it becomes almost immediately painful to contemplate your inevitable extraction from it all at the end. This is one of those ones where you dread the turning of the final pages. And, if you're me, you're having trouble seeing them because the tears are welling up so quickly and so close together. Yes, an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and loss pervades all 600+ pages, but somehow it stops well short of being trite or cloying. So much of it is the beautiful, beautiful language. I would love this book for the language alone, if for nothing and no one else. It is unmatched. It haunts me, tripping after me out of nowhere sometimes. The sing-song sentences, the inverted wording, and the lovely names come back to me over and over again, and I'm once again in the Valley with Huw and Bronwen, Ianto and Angharad, Gwilym and Dai Bando. I read this aloud with my husband (then-boyfriend) and I really can't overstate how beautiful it is read aloud. And shared with someone else who appreciates the endless nuance and the inviting whisper of a language used to its fullest capacity, wrapped in and around characters who wring you out and own a piece of your soul by the time it is through. Truly the most lyrical and beautiful book I have ever read, I'll be all set to pick it up again in another ten years or so."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I loved this book. The writing mirrors real life in all its glories and tragedies. This is the kind of book that makes you feel you have lived with each of the characters, from Huw and Davey to the preacher Mr.Gryffyd (who I especially felt was captured perfectly). The tone of the book is nostalgic but it never sentimentalizes the harshness of coal mining or the other stuggles but rather puts the joy of family and community in sharp contrast to business tactics that destroy that very village life. I felt genuinely sad ending this novel. VEry, very good."},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I first read this book in High School. I loved it, but wasn't always sure what was going on - why would Huw be bed-bound for two years just because he fell into a stream? But the lyricism of the language captivated me; Llewellyn writes the way the Welsh people I've encountered actually speak - he does a better job of capturing the voice of a language than any other writer I know.I have two problems with this book. First, I find the characters somewhat flat - they are all so perfect, and play their roles so well, that they are somewhat predictable. If they were negative, you would call them caricatures. But I'm sure there are people who are that genuinely GOOD, if perhaps occasionally more interesting and human. And I always enjoy &quot;sweep of history&quot; books that trace a family or people through time. My other problem, which is related to the first, is that time doesn't seem to have affected the characters in this book - they are essentially the same at the end as they were at the beginning - they seem quite unaffected by the events that occur in their lives. So the characterizations could have been more realistic without losing &quot;gravitas.&quot;Having said that, I rank this among my favorite books - I recently reread it, after many years, and while I still don't know why Huw was bed-bound, it's still a terrific book and my ears still ring with the language!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"I read this book for the first time back in Junior High School on the recomendation of a friend, and I have always regreted not picking it up earlier.

Start, that is, without indulging in cliche and easy sentimentality. One of those books that you will cite when somebody on a subway walks up to you and asks you to name 3 books that affected you the most and added real meaning to your life. It reminded me of the play Our Town a little in its ability to bring you back and to force you into painful recollections but at the same time reminds you to try, at least once in a while, (here goes the cliche) to live inside the moment and not just let everything rush by. Read it...and call your Mom!"},{"Title":"How green was my valley","review":"This book was fantastic -- a wonderful discussion of family ties and bonds and the impact of change and &quot;progress.&quot; Llewellyn brings you into the Welsh culture with his writing style and use of Welsh phrases. He portrays the Welsh struggle against greed, prejudice and big business through the different actions of each of the family members in a large close-knit family in a small, close-knit town. Although the ending is quite sad, you can't help still feeling hopeful as the son, now an old man, starts anew -- with his wonderful memories. It does make you wonder about the memories you are creating for your own children.

All would eventually be lost, just as the green valley, village and home would perish to an unrelenting mountain of slag. Sounds fun doesn't it? It is.

For the most part the author looks back on village life wearing rose-colored glasses. Long before modern conveniences such as electric light and indoor plumbing the author gushes on about how beautiful everything was, how kind everyone was, and how delicious the food tasted. Although I wasn't looking for an uber-depressing chronicle on the order of what Charles Dickens would write I was hoping for a little more believability in this memoir. But this is not to say this is a bad read.What makes 'How Green Was My Valley' a rich reading experience is the wonderfully drawn characterizations. At the end of the book I felt as though I had personally known the leading character, his large family, and the family preacher. The author infuses such *warmth* into his words that even a humbug like me has to smile.Oh, I forgot to mention on somewhat negative element of this book. A major component of the story is how the coal companies and conflicts with its workers had destroyed the bucolic Welsh life. Although the author expresses his views through this novel quite well I found it disrupted the overall flow of the book. It seems the book was either ultra sweet or some stark (UK) Labor Party propaganda.Bottom line: at times a sublime reading experience.

The information supplied in this book is pretty sparse, with vast chunks pretty much ripped straight from any number of cultures' mythologies and then interspersed with \\"reports\\" from supposed Cryptozoological Society of London field agents.

Not the best way of having someone take you seriously.The other real big deal-breaker for me was that just about EVERY possible mythological creature obviously HAD to have existed; when one of the entries made reference to some variant creature being so \\"obviously fantastical\\" that it couldn't have existed, I nearly stopped and said, \\"Really?

It is not a book on cryptozoology, but rather folklore, set up the same way as The Flight of Dragons, another very good book. It contains a ton of excellant info, on both well known and lesser known creatures, and has some excellant information. However, I could not give it a 5, since it has no real disclaimer that it is not a real crypto book. However, I think most people who have read more than a few articles on cryptos will realize right away that the book is not to be taken as serious research. My favorite sections were probably the fake journal entries, as they gave the most info, while I thought many of the personal logs got kinda of boring.

Anyone with a genuine interest in cryptozoology will certainly be disappointed at the whimsical and irreverent tone, which pokes fun at the visionary pioneers who have conducted scientifically painstaking research into the likes of Nessie, Mokele m'bembe and Bigfoot. A layperson however, will probably find much to amuse them and just possibly enough material to cultivate an interest in this most fascinating of topics. Amongst the silly stuff are some real facts about cryptids. The Chupacabras in particular is fairly well described and depicted. Separating fact from fancy and blatant fabrication however is not always easy and the running gag about some fictional crusty old gentlemens' club (the address given is actually the Royal Academy of Arts) does wear a bit thin after a while. If you are seeking genuine and scientifically researched material about cryptids, you would do far better by starting with Bernard Heuvelmans's seminal work or even dredging the Internet's many cryptozoology sites for references. In that respect, I would only give this book one star. If, however, you are looking for a book to foster an interest in mystery animals in a young relative or friend (my 11 year old son thought it was \\"cool\\"), then you could do a lot worse than this.

However, if you get it thinking it is going to be a serious or archival study of cryptozoology, you will be disappointed. Its greater emphasis is on purely mythological creatures like mermaids, elves, the sphinx, unicorns, gorgons and other creatures of fantasy, only it purports to pass them all off as not only actual living creatures, but as still surviving in remote pockets of the world. The volume does so with a straight face, and purported eyewitness accounts. If you are fascinated by accounts of creatures that \\"might be\\", like bigfoot, lake monsters, mothman, or dinosaur survivors, then stay away from this book, which is basically a treatise on fantasy creatures prepared for a junior high audience with liberal dashes of pseudo-science thrown in for good measure.

That was a little annoying to say the least but shame on me for not researching my purchases better, ok, moving on. My biggest disappointment with this book is its lack of hard facts or any real scientific information to go along with each subject. It does come with some but not to the level I was expecting it to contain. There are numerous stories included for each cryptid but they are just that, stories. Don't get me wrong, they are somewhat entertaining, and most of them come with some very interesting pictures and drawings but if your interested in really dissecting information to get to the cold hard facts of some of the mysteries of life, this probably isn't the book for you.

Being enormously taken with it, I never returned my copy (an original hardback in paperback size with the big \\"A\\" on the front) to the university library. I ended up paying the library $272 in back dues before the university would release my diploma. It was worth every cent.To create \\"A,\\" Warhol followed and tape-recorded one Factory personality, Ondine, for 24 hours. Ondine was reportedly high on amphetamines at the time, so it was a full 24 hours involving no sleep. (Ondine was also a homosexual. He speaks graphically about homosexual sex often in \\"A\\" - that is why it was branded as pornographic in its day.) \\"A\\" is simply the transcription of those 24 hours worth of audio tape. Nothing more, nothing less. The women who were hired to transcribe the tapes reportedly got bored with their jobs and started typing the material in different layouts and formats. This formatting was left in the original book.\\"A\\" is a collaborative work (Warhol, Ondine, Ondine's associates, the typists). It's pre-post-modern, if you will. And it is a splendid artifact from its time. It shouldn't be described or experienced in the context of literature and novels. It is an art piece, like any of Warhol's films. One does not compare the films \\"Empire State Building\\" or \\"Sleep\\" with \\"Sleepless in Seattle.\\"If you like being a fly on the wall, \\"A\\" will please you. It's like being there.

It wasn't until 1967/68 that the tape was actually transcribed, by Factory-ites working for minimum wage, one of whom was Moe Tucker, the drummer for the Velvet Underground. A was first published by Grove Press shortly after Warhol was shot on June 3, 1968. The original dustjacket is a giant red A -- Warhol turns Hawthorne's scarlet letter on its head. A is 24 hours in the life of the Factory denizens. A is Andy Warhol updating James Joyce' Ulysses. Whereas Joyce took 7 years to write about one 24 hour period, Warhol took just 24 hours. A includes all the gossip, pauses, stutters, and drug babble as one might expect. A just might be the only example of true &quot;new journalism.&quot; Tape recorders don't lie. As a document of one typical day in 1965, the peak year of the great sixties decade, A is an unqualified success. Andy Warhol was at the vortex, watching/recording all from his silver throne. Warhol biographer Victor Bockris calls A &quot;part of Warhol's great trilogy,&quot; the other two works being CHELSEA GIRLS, Warhol's 1966 3-1/2 hour film (it's actually 7 hours worth of film, since two reels are projected simultaneously) along with lp THE VELVET UNDERGROUND AND NICO, recorded in May, 1966.

In fact, Andy never wrote one word of it. The book consisted of transcriptions of recordings made by a hand-help tape recorder. The book was intended to document 24 hours in Ondine's life. This \\"documentation\\", however, was murder to actually read. The recordings were made with a primitive (1968) Norelco (Noreco?) tape recorder with a dinky microphone. Ondine is stoned most of the time and there is no continuity to any of his speech. It was indeed a treat to read through a paragraph without having to start over to try and grasp whatever concept he intended to make. Furthermore, the people around Ondine talk openly and freely and their words are included whenever they are spoken, thus sometimes creating two or three separate conversations all intertwined with one another. The typists just typed what they heard, and there was really no need to proofread the manuscripts--I mean who the Hell would read this damn book all the way through--so the many, many typing errors stayed in. This book was, as the inner flap stated, an extension of Andy's films. To me this means an exercise in patience; a depiction of real life and real time on paper as it actually happened. Because the reader was limited to just the oral/aural realms, he had to create his own visuals. Sometimes I found my visuals all wrong and only later, after reading on and realising just what everybody was actually talking about, did I find myself going back and rereading the dialogue but this time in the right context. This book, like \\"Empire\\" or \\"Sleep\\", was more important (or created more of an impact) for what it was, than for any artistic or technical merits. I'm sure when it came out, nobody really intended anyone would read all 452 pages--it was more of an event for existing and for being what it was, than for being read. This is like the two above films: everyone would talk about a seven-hour film of the Empire State Building but no one would actually go and see it. I tortured myself and read all of a, and I can't help but wonder: did I ruin the artist's intent by reading the book? Or should its effect be strictly of wonder and as a conversation piece? Is a only to be talked about and not read? Another part of the \\"novel\\" that made continuity impossible was the frequent distortion, overlapping conversations, blasting Maria Callas records in the background, Ondine's stuttering and rapid change of thoughts and the overall inability of the typists to make any head or tail of what they were hearing. This happened on every page and whenever something couldn't be discerned for whatever reason, the typists left ellipses (...)(...)(...). Sentence fragments, solitary words preceded and proceeded by those annoying dots. It took me long enough but I read the damn thing. Now I can actually tell people I did read it.

After those food fests we'd both be covered with ketchup and milk and whatever ...\\"[Gennifer Flowers, Passion and Betrayal, p.74-75]Bill and Gennifer were also into bondage, dripping wax, ice cubes and spanking - all the standard sex freak stuff. Their nickname for Bill's penis was \\"Willard\\" and Gennifer in her book says Bill would refer to Hillary as \\"Sarge\\" or \\"Hilla the Hun.\\" [When with Dolly Browning, Bill would call Hillary the \\"Warden.\\"]Gennifer says she took silk scarves and tied up Bill to her bedposts. Gennifer says, \\"I teased him and played with him until he was almost out of his mind with excitement ... Bill, as always, wanted to take it a step further, so the next time I tied him to the bed, he asked me to use a dildo-shaped vibrator on him. It was exciting to see him getting so aroused, and I couldn't wait to untie him so he could use it on me.\\" [Passion and Betrayal, p. 75]Then there is this jewel.

Courage is telling the truth, even if it makes you look bad. The book was fast paced, and very insightful without being low classed with \\"dirty details\\". Gennifer was not the first, and will not be the last women to follow her feelings, and be used and abused by a man. What makes the book great reading is you can see how it happened, and see the signs that were ignored along the way by her, and the American public. Abusers always see themselves as the victims, as they trash the lives of those they abuse. It takes courage to write a book, were you expose your own mistakes, as well as others to help the reader learn from your mistakes. Again it's a fast, easy read (no pun intended)about a our history, and how we let a perceived supporter of women's rights, abuse women right in front of use, and we did nothing to stop it, even when we had a chance."},{"Title":"Gennifer Flowers: Passion and Betrayal","review":"That's for lawyers, judges and juries to do. But, judged by internal, emotional coherence, the events described in the book seem true.Gennifer comes across as a warm, down to earth and honest person. In fact, she reminds me of Bill Clinton himself and I suppose, emotionally, Bill Clinton's personality is close to Gennifer's, who is humorous, generous, discrete but not without a temper and the inevitable self-righteousness that goes along with a temper.It's difficult to judge the book's fidelity to Gennifer's true personality, without knowing Gennifer personally, because the book was written \\"with\\" Jacquelyn Dapper. It's not clear how much of the book comes from Gennifer's tape recorded conversations or other direct descriptions and how much comes from Jacquelyn. Since Gennifer signed off on the book, however, we must assume that she approved of the final product, and therefore we must also assume that the book presents an adequate and honest description of Gennifer's views.Gennifer is portrayed as a normal American woman whose life was \\"harmed,\\" (she's too resilient for us to use a stronger word) by her relationship with a married man and by the fantasies that she wove around that relationship.We might wish to find great literature here, but that is not the intention of the book. It is written in simple language, and I believe it gives us a nice snap shot of the American character during the late 20th century. I'm sure it will long remain a classic in late twentieth century political literature when the names Karl Rove and Dick Morris are known only to specialists of the period.Get it and read it. I think you'll learn to love Gennifer with all her faults, just as most Americans love Bill and Hillary Clinton with all their faults. All three \\"happy hookers\\" and as perennial as the American bison (used to be.)"},{"Title":"Gennifer Flowers: Passion and Betrayal","review":"Gennifer tells her story - not from a political angle but from the point of the view of the &quot;other woman&quot;.

Several &quot;juicy&quot; private details revealed...."},{"Title":"Gennifer Flowers: Passion and Betrayal","review":"Can anyone dare to be comical about PASSION AND BETRAYAL by Gennifer Flowers? This book from 1995 fueled scores, if not hundreds, thousands, or millions, of jokes which showed how ludicrous and infantile our feelings are when the basic situation of \\"millions of women everywhere\\" (dedication, six pages before page 1 starts \\"a chain of events that would forever alter the course of my life\\") is subjected to the nightly descent into entertainment values in an effort to show the American alter ego who we are, really. The book has no index, so people who did not want to miss important themes were bound to read every page or guess if the chapter called \\"Baring It All\\" was what they wanted. People who doubt that anything in this book actually happened might try paying more attentions to the Romans who had seen a statue by Bernini and proclaimed: Truth is only at Bernini's house.Books have been an individual art-form that generally say more than any patient could expect to cover in therapy sessions. In a culture which places more emphasis on money than on enduring relationships, it is not surprising to find Gennifer Flowers admitting, \\"I intended to relax and have fun. I had always been a free spirit who liked to have fun, but now I intended to really pursue it.\\" (p. 57). So she was hired as a membership director at the Cipango Club in Dallas, and when \\"Finally someone yelled, \`Gennifer, it's time for you to get up on that bar and dance.' I didn't hesitate for a second. I climbed right up, high heels and all, and danced through two complete songs. Everyone was applauding and egging me on, and I was in heaven.\\" (p. 58). Moving from there to Branson, where \\"I would look out over the audience and see acres of white hair\\" (p. 59) and Roger Miller had to apologize for saying a word that happened to be in a joke he was telling. \\"You'd have thought he slapped their mothers!\\" (p. 60). Then \\"I needed Bill to work his magic and recharge me again--I needed a \`Bill fix.' \\" (p. 60).Entertainment has become so much like an addiction that it is no wonder politics seems more closely related to the behavior of stars and fans than to maintaining a decent foundation for mutual trust in the future. Entertainers need to make a lot of money when they are young because trends go out of style, and privacy has never been big when a society becomes as dominated by its communications media as the modern global world. \\"The security guard would walk around the building and see Bill coming in through the side door, and the guard had a real loose tongue.\\" (p. 63). Soon she was concerned with \\"the reports and rumors that had begun to surface about what happened to those who tried to cross or become a threat to that all-powerful Arkansas power structure that stood behind Bill Clinton.\\" (p. 84). After Bill announced that he was running for president, \\"the possibility that my actions might have dangerous consequences for my mother scared me to death.\\" (p. 93). An attorney named Gary Johnson placed a video camera \\"so that it had a view directly out his front door and down the hall. Because our doors were close together, he also got a very clear view of my apartment door. When rumors began circulating that Bill and I were having an affair, Gary let it be known that he actually had a videotape of Bill coming to my apartment. Big mistake. Not long after that, some large men forced their way into his place, beat him senseless and left him for dead. According to Gary, they kept asking where \`the tape' was. Sure enough, the videotape with Bill on it disappeared.\\"Gary, it seems, was a double threat because he was also acting as counsel for Larry Nichols, the man who filed the lawsuit against Bill Clinton.\\" (pp. 93-94).Later, \\"my whole apartment had been ransacked\\" (p. 96). \\"Thank goodness I had put the tapes of our conversations in what I thought was a safe place, away from my apartment, a few days earlier.\\" (p. 97). Soon she had the opportunity to read about her troubles in the Star supermarket tabloid. \\"Next to that was a picture of the apartment manager, who said in a caption that he had seen Bill visit me there ten to twenty times.\\" (p. 103). On a personal level, \\"What about all those people who had been hurt or killed when they became a threat to Bill Clinton and his circle of power?\\" (p. 105). So she spent two weeks talking to the Star reporter Marion Collins in New York \\"to make sure I had the chronology of events correct. She was insistent I not slip up on dates and give anyone the opportunity to discredit my story on the basis of a factual error.\\" (p. 108). Also on a personal level, \\"I had spilled my guts so thoroughly to her that she almost seemed like my personal psychiatrist.\\" (p. 109).The shrink business is not what it used to be, what with so many mental people being thrown into prisons where the authorities refuse to give them their medications, and the most effective personal drug preferences are likely to be illegal or considered contraband. Dodging other reporters even became an adventure, as \\"Meanwhile, I was thrust into a cloak-and-dagger existence in New York.\\" (p. 110). Watching Bill and Hillary on Sixty Minutes following the 1992 Super Bowl \\"was sensational and they had a built-in audience. . . . It was all hype, and Bill took advantage of every opportunity to make himself look good.\\" (p. 111). Gennifer still thought it was possible that \\"Bill would have been a hero! He would have created the appearance of a politician who could tell the truth, even if it was painful.\\" (p. 111)."},{"Title":"Gennifer Flowers: Passion and Betrayal","review":"This book was what I expected it to be.

He discusses what rock art means and refers you to other well written books. He also provides lists of emergency equipment, camping equipment and more that you should consider taking as you begin looking at rock art.In the next chapters he tells where to go to see rock art. He also instructs the reader about the expected behavior, tours to take, and more.There are directions for taking pictures of rock art and explanations of clothes to wear, weather, and even a few recipes for crockpot cooking... so you can cook while you are looking and come home to a nice meal. Great!This is a very exciting book. It made me want to jump out of my seat and go looking. The pictures are nice. His enthusiasm is catching and the format is easy to understand. Well worth the money.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Rock Art and Ruins for Beginners and Old Guys","review":"This is a fun book and practical guide for campers and hikers who would like to see some well-known petroglyphs and pictographs and ruins on their own. The book tells you where to find some of the best rock art and prehistoric ruins on the Colorado Plateau (Southwestern U.S.); how to gather all the necessary equipment for camping out (or in a motel); the best time to take pictures at a site; and recipes to cook in a crock pot in the car while you are out and about. In his droll way, School spins some pretty funny experiences. He had me really laughing at some of his exploits.The book leads off with a brief overview of petroglyphs and pictographs and a little history of the ancient people that inhabited the area some 6000 years ago. Scholl then gets into important vehicle advice and precautions. You then come to a well thought out, organized chapter on Food and Cooking. He lists \\"Basic Food\\" to keep on hand and cooking equipment suggestions. He has some pretty ingenious ways to make meals when you are camping out of a car or tent. (You may want to try his Carburetor Cuisine.) Then he gets into a comprehensive drug/first aid list, the necessity of physical conditioning, and photography equipment and supply suggestions. If you really want to be organized, use his lists as your base.Once you have digested the tips on camping and surviving, you get to the part about how and where to go to find rock art and the ancient dwellings. This is divided into Chapters by state with a state map for each chapter showing approximately where the sites are. There is a description of the area, how to get to the site, the best time of year to go, type and difficulty of hike, photography tips, accommodations (both camping or motels) and his recommendations for side attractions in some areas.Scholl gives us a practical guide - useful for young or old, as well as new and experienced campers and rock art explorers. I found some new areas I can hardly wait to visit, and with his book in hand, I am confident that I can follow his directions and be successful. Buy it!

As a &quot;beginner&quot; I loved the good background the book provides about how these cultures came to be. Also found the maps to be invaluable as were the recipes for cooking on the road! The whole thing is told with such great fun and humor. Had me chuckling throughout. Made it a joy to read. MUCH different from most books like this that give very dry descriptions and data. Loved the continuing self-effacing references to &quot;old guys&quot;. The author seems like someone who doesn't take himself too seriously and loves to enjoy himself all the while he continues to learn. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Rock Art and Ruins for Beginners and Old Guys","review":"I have always been fascinated by Native American rock art. But a lot of the books I have seen either have great photos but are lacking in details about going to see the rock art, or, they are full of academic details but don't guide you and they are not much fun.This author not only supplied great looking photos in color and black and white but he has provided maps and directions on how to get to these rock art sites and to many ruins. After all a book is one thing-but seeing them is like a relgious experience. And since I am a beginner and an old guy I think I got twice my money's worth.On the cover of Mr. Scholl's book it's says &quot;A fun guide to over 40 major prehistoric rock art sites and 50 other ruins and attractions&quot;. And you can tell it's a fun book because he adds,&quot;How to get there safely, eat well and have a great time.&quot; And he delivers with neat recipes and ways to prepare a meal while out in the wilderness. One of my favorites is his method for &quot;Ironing&quot; a sandwich.All I can say is take a look at this book if you are interested in the Southwest,Indian Petroglyphs and Pictographs,Paleo-Indians, the Anasazi, the Mogollon, the Hohokam and others. You'll spend more time seeing the sites because you'll spend less time asking people how to get somewhere. Believe me when you ask someone how to find an Indian Rock Art site you may wind up wandering around the desert half the day and never finding it as I once did in Utah.This is a great guide book to carry, filled with humor and like me, I'll bet you will have it with you on all your trips in the Southwest.

Everything here is very good, in particular the first two selections. In Blue did not do much for me and Novelty, which is a look into Crowley's creative thought process, while interesting, is not something I would recommend to a casual reader. Anyway, I loved the stories and would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Crowley's longer fiction."},{"Title":"Novelty","review":"This collection of four stories by John Crowley covers a wide range of themes and styles. Here's the breakdown by story.The Nightingale Sings at Night is Crowley's version of a Creation and Fall myth that is clever and cute but lacking the depth of meaning and rich textures that I've grown accustomed to in his writing.Great Work of Time is a strong entry with vivid descriptions that evoke the proper mood for the times and places we're shown. Crowley presents a unique concept for time travel and the \\"effects\\" of altering the past. But he falls into the same trap many writers before him have in writing time traveling stories: eventually he over explains his idea in pages of exposition. Crowley is such a talented writer I felt he could easily have written these portions instead as events in the story, subtly building the air of mystery he so successfully achieves in the rest of the narrative. Some of these passages read more like notes to himself than useful story devices and the overall effect is that this tale would be a good candidate for a rewrite in an expanded and more fleshed out form. The all too brief glimpse into the future shows us a wonderfully distorted world inhabited by strange creatures, but we never learn much about them. I really wanted more. Overall, what's present is classic Crowley, but seems somehow unfinished.With the story In Blue, Crowley departs from sensuous descriptions in favor of a more sparse style to evoke the sterile world in which his characters move (reminding me of a Kubrik film). Every event that happens and thought that Hare has adds to his breakdown in a believable way. But what I still have not reconciled is Crowley's attitude towards this world. At first it all appears a set up for an indictment of the catch-22 logic of this mild mannered dystopia, but what are we to think when Hare eventually finds his place in the Revolution? I'll be mulling this one over for some time to come.And in Novelty we see possibly the kernel of inspiration for the Aegypt books. There are strong parallels between the writer character in Novelty and Pierce Moffett, both impotently trying to convey mystical deep meanings that seemingly lose their impact once expressed. This one was a little hard to get into at first. For me, writers writing about (not) writing ranks up there with films about filmmaking. Can it be well done? Yes, but it still seems too self-involved. Novelty is rather short, though, and by the end I was engrossed, mainly because the writer character gets around to describing what he wants to write instead of describing how he can't get around to writing. In fact, these passages read more like poetry than prose and coalesce beautifully.I highly recommend this book for Crowley fans. But for those unfamiliar with him, Otherwise: Three Novels might be a better place to start. Engine Summer alone is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Novelty","review":"John Crowley's well-deserved recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the English language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980's. His &quot;Great Work of Time&quot; is an intriguing Rashomon-esque time travel fantasy about Cecil Rhodes and British economic imperialism in East Africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. It was almost as compelling a read as the &quot;The Nightingale Sings At Night&quot;, which offers a fantastical twist on the Adam and Eve creation myth saga. The other two tales, &quot;In Blue&quot; and &quot;Novelty&quot;, I found much less compelling, but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose Crowley uses in other tales. It was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library; a surprise which I think many readers will also discover."},{"Title":"Novelty","review":"A collection of four novellas from John Crowley, perhaps best known as the author of Little, Big. I admire Crowley's writing, although, like Howard Waldrop's, I often don't follow everything that's going on. In particular in this volume, I was lost in the time travel story, &quot;Great Work of Time.&quot; History was never one of my strong suits, so I guess I shouldn't wonder why I'm not that attracted by alternate history. &quot;In Blue&quot; and &quot;Novelty&quot; were both reminiscent of stories that I had previously read in SF, but done with an artistic frame of mind.For me it was &quot;The Nightengale Sings at Night&quot; that made this collection worthwhile. One of the hoariest clich&eacute;s of SF is the Adam and Eve story, and although &quot;Nightengale&quot; has Adam and Eve in it, it is nowhere near the clich&eacute;. That's because the starting point of this story is the creation--that same moment in Genesis--whereas the clich&eacute; ends at the creation. Crowley, although &quot;explaining&quot; an aspect of the creation myth here, is also being slightly satirical in his exploration of it. In all, it makes for a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Reich (Modern masters)","review":"The above mentioned slogan based on his works is perhaps the only thing that will rest of the theories of Wilhelm Reich, a very popular author in the nineteen sixties.Charles Rycroft gives an excellent and thorough analysis of Reich's work. He found that Reich didn't have a good knowledge of biology and physics and comes to the conclusion that his work is futile and not scientific (no rigorous experiments).Reich's theories on mental illness are based on the (in)capacity to experience orgasm. He saw the roots for orgasmic inhibition in the 'authoritarian' (fascist) family. This is a patriarchal family not held together by parental love, but by repressive use of power by the father.The treatment of his patients was guided to the restoration of the orgasmreflex.But Reich went further and declared to have found in the universe 'orgone-energy', that he could capture with accumulators and use in the treatment of the mental ill.It is evident that this theory is complete nonsense. The orgasmreflex has been cured today by Viagra (as simple as that).This is the best possible analysis of a once very popular psychiatrist."},{"Title":"Las Semanas del jardin de Miguel de Cervantes: Estudio, edicion y facsimil del manuscrito (Serie Lengua y literatura) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Quiz&aacute; el profesor Eisenberg no desee darle estrellas al libro, pero para m&iacute; es muy grato otorgarle las cinco.

I purchased the book because my ancestors were early French and Spanish. I wanted to get a feel for where they lived in the 1870's. This book gives a bird's eye view of how it was in the early days. These must be made from early sketchs or plates. I think I read where there were maybe 110 plates, but am not sure what exactly that means. Each picture is in detail. This book takes you back and you feel like you were there. The cover is sort of green linen and had gold lettering on the front.Added comment: The picture shown with this review is not my picture. The book is dark Green as described above. And I am willing to sell it if any one is interested.

His story telling talents certainly entertained this reader (actually listener, I got the book on tape and listened on a recent car trip). Stivender certainly has a way with words and the events that he experienced and recollects can be clearly imagined and remembered by anyone who entered a Catholic grade school at that time. Unfortunately our own children of the next generation will not be able to share these experiences. I laughed for 2 hours and then laughed again as I listened to the book a second time with my 18 and 20 year olds! They too enjoyed every word. If by chance Stivender reads this review, I &quot;was&quot; Kathi Reiner and my feelings were hurt (only teasing) that you did not mention me in your trip down memory lane."},{"Title":"Raised Catholic (can You Tell?)","review":"This collection of Mr. Stivender's memories from his first year in Catholic school all the way up to his prom was very funny. I have never been to a parochial school myself, but from what my father has told me about his memories, these stories give a taste of what Catholic schools were like in the 1950's, but in a hilarious manner."},{"Title":"Raised Catholic (can You Tell?)","review":"Gave a clear look into Catholic upbringing and the church life of my friends and neighbors - grew up with Catholics but not one myself - they say it's perfect, and very funny.

Perhaps because of his abundant humor, Abbot has been called a &quot;maximalist,&quot; but that is not fair, really--because that implies a man of messy technique, someone who throws words on the page willy-nilly. He is as careful with his words as is any good writer. He just has style."},{"Title":"The Smart Interviewer","review":"This is a practical book for interviewing potential candidates for a job.

She has captured and made accessible the concept of synergy in a real Mastermind Team, and given us a step by step instruction manual to building our own team.In clear language and forthright thought, Ms. Brecher gives us the 8 steps, the advantages for each step, and the pitfalls that await us if we are unaware. She eloquently makes the case for why we should even consider a Mastermind Team, then goes about helping us to know that we too can form such a team.My Mastermind Team was formed in much the same way Ms. Brecher describes in her book. It has been an invaluable asset in my business. And in the spirit of full disclosure I must confess that Natalie is part of that Mastermind Team.

This book was first published in 1889 and is in the public domain. The Kindle edition has 69 pages/1546 locations and can be read in one evening.The author was a unitarian minister, soldier, abolitionist and author who lived from 1823-1911. Higginson spent much of his live fighting for the rights of freed slaves, women and labourers. This collection contains 5 true accounts of insurrections by black slaves in the Americas. There is a biography at the end of this volume. This book is wellwritten, well researched and reliable. It tells about a sad and embarrasing chapter in history we must not forget. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in black history, US-history, history of slavery or in history in general.The contents of this volume is:THE MAROONS OF JAMAICA (slave revolt on the caribbean island of Jamaica)THE MAROONS OF SURINAM (slave revolt in this South-American state)GABRIEL'S DEFEAT (slave revolt in Virginia, US, 1800)DENMARK VESEY (slave revolt in South-Carolina, US, 1822)NAT TURNER'S INSURRECTION (slave revolt in Virginia, US, 1831)APPENDIX OF AUTHORITIESAs a sample I copy a few lines from the chapter on Denmark Vesey (page 36/location 738) below:[...]Denmark Vesey had come very near figuring as a revolutionist in Hayti,instead of South Carolina. Capt. Vesey, an old resident of Charleston,commanded a ship that traded between St. Thomas and Cape Franais, duringour Revolutionary War, in the slave-transportation line. In the year 1781he took on board a cargo of three hundred and ninety slaves, and sailedfor the Cape. On the passage, he and his officers were much attracted bythe beauty and intelligence of a boy of fourteen, whom they unanimouslyadopted into the cabin as a pet. They gave him new clothes, and a newname, T&eacute;l&eacute;maque, which was afterwards gradually corrupted into Telmak andDenmark. They amused themselves with him until their arrival at CapeFranais, and then, \\"having no use for the boy,\\" sold their pet as if hehad been a macaw or a monkey.[...]"},{"Title":"BLACK REBELLION: Five Slave Revolts (Cosimo Classics History)","review":"This was a very good book.

If you don't have it, get it. ...as fast as you can!The cookbook covers so much that everyone is sure to find something that satisfies within the 411 pages of recipes -- 800 recipes no less! Did you see that? 800 recipes are included in the easy to read, colorful to look at, several recipes with photos of several dishes in each photo. The photos are all in one place and I think I like that very much. The title reads &quot;800 Fast and Fabulous Recipes for the Kosher (or Not) Cook&quot;. I am not a Kosher cook but I have found so many recipes that I know I will use over and over again. But for those who ARE Kosher cooks, you will be very happy with this cookbook also. There is a whole section on holidays and celebrations that I'm sure will be helpful to you.You can tell Norene Gilletz knew what she was doing in designing this cookbook. In the beginning she acknowledges all those who have helped her with ideas or tested recipes. She credits her Mother as one of several who inspired and taught her, or encouraged and advised her. She had willing taste testers and even had a focus group to keep her apprised of what people want and &quot;need to know in today's kitchen&quot;.&quot;Healthy Helpings&quot; is a healthy cookbook so for those who look for the nutritional analysis, you will be happy to know it is included with each recipe. There is a whole page of guidelines Norene used to analyze her recipes. I personally found it very helpful to know things like &quot;4 to 6 servings&quot; was analyzed for 4 servings or &quot;optional ingredients and garnishes in unspecified amounts were not calculated&quot;. These are the questions that sometimes puzzle those who are trying hard to figure closely all the nutritional analysis.As any thorough cookbook author would include, there is a list of staples for a healthy kitchen and it includes oils/vinegars, mayonnaise/salad dressings, dried legumes, tomato products, canned vegetables/legumes/fruits/fish/soups, pastas/grains/cereals, snack foods/cookies/crackers, breads/bread crumbs, beverages/juices/miscellaneous, and dried herbs &amp; spices, baking supplies. There is also a section on perishables, frozen foods and herbs. There is so much information under each of the staple items and so much &quot;healthy&quot; information listed before you even get to the first recipe! I really like this in a cookbook!The format of &quot;Healthy Helpings&quot; recipes is done in a single list of ingredients with directions below. There are two columns on each page, which seems to afford extra room to get more recipes per page. The print is large enough to read and is a nice feature without a feeling of paper wasting as in some of the other cookbooks I've bought lately -- the kind with large fonts and only one recipe per page and an obvious waste of paper. But not &quot;Healthy Helpings&quot;! I have the feeling that there was so much information to include that Norene and her publisher, Woodland Publishing, figured out the best way to get the most print on a page without it looking too crowded, etc.Almost all of the recipes have the little friendly paragraph at the beginning of a recipe that we all love to read -- the little hint of origin or inspiration for that particular recipe. That feature means a lot to those who like to read cookbooks like they read novels (I'm one of them!).I collect cookbooks and have thousands of them, but this is one that we will use over and over. In fact, I have made several of the recipes already and some even twice and I've only had the cookbook just a few weeks! My favorites so far are:Chunky MonkeyGrilled Orange Teriyaki ChickenTeriyaki AsparagusIsraeli SaladRainbow Rice Pilaf (the first recipe I tried from Healthy Helpings)There are many other recipes I have marked to try so I already know this cookbook is going to take a prominent place on the cookbook shelves near the kitchen, probably next to Norene's &quot;Food Processor Bible&quot;, which we use a lot also. In fact, I have loaded this cookbook with bookmarks and post-it flags to help me find the next recipe I want to try.Another good thing -- the recipes call for ingredients that most of us already have in our cupboards. When I feel inspired to try a new recipe I can reach for &quot;Healthy Helpings&quot; and know I will most likely have all the ingredients on hand to make a healthy and satisfying dish.I highly recommend &quot;Healthy Helpings&quot; as an addition to your cookbook shelf. At $19.99 it's affordable and makes a nice gift for yourself or to someone you'd like to help on their way to a more healthy lifestyle. I'm including the recipe for &quot;Israeli Salad&quot; below. Not only is it delicious and healthy, but it is also a very pretty dish to have on your dinner table.Israeli Salad1 head of Romaine or iceberg lettuce4 green onions1 medium onion2 green peppers1 red pepper1 English cucumber, peeled8 firm, ripe tomatoes (preferably Israeli)4 Tablespoons olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)4 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice1 teaspoon sale (or to taste)Freshly ground pepper, optionalWash and dry vegetables well. Dice them neatly into 1/2-inch pieces and combine in a large bowl. Sprinkle with olive oil and lemon juice. Add seasonings; mix again. Adjust seasonings to taste.Yield: 8 servings. Salad tastes best eaten the same day it is made, but leftovers will keep for a day in the refrigerator. Drain off excess liquid in the bottom of the bowl before serving.Note: This recipe makes quite a lot so either halve the recipe or invite someone over to help eat it.Reviewed and posted to CookbooksEtCetera@yahoogroups and Amazon.com by Monita Olive on February 24, 2004."},{"Title":"Healthy Helpings: 800 Fast and Fabulous Recipes for the Kosher (or Not) Cook","review":"Even thought I've collected probably 100 \\"healthy eating\\" cookbooks, I'm always on the look-out for new selections (especially in the \\"healthy eating\\" category) that have certain characteristics:Captivating to read (I tend to read a cookbook as much for the margin comments, and personality, as much as for the great recipes) - Almost like reading a novelUnique recipes (not just a new twist on recipes I've already read elsewhere)Fresh ingredients, and interesting uses (that I never would have thought of) for easy-to-find ingredientsLots of tips and easy-to-follow instructionsBeautiful photosRecipes that my WHOLE family (including my children) would find appealingI was very thrilled when I found Norene Gilletz' book, Healthy Helpings. What an excellent book!! When I picked it up at the bookstore, I found myself reading it like a novel...always a good sign. Healthy Helpings is written in a nicely conversational, friendly tone.This is the first cookbook (in the healthy foods genre) that really has it all. The recipes are healthy (using lots of fresh fruits, veggies, whole grains, etc), but not too restrictive about healthy oils (using just enough to create the desired effect). I would say it offers something for just about every type of healthy eater. With 800 recipes, it's bound to!!Note that I'm not a kosher cook, but this book is quite interesting to me in that respect too. It's an education into the method of kosher preparation. I've always wanted to learn some of these things, and Norene has provided sections on holidays and celebrations that are particularly interesting reading.I believe I've found the light eating cookbook that I'll actually be using regularly. Norene has done an excellent job of researching for this book. It's full of all kinds of helpful advice for food preparation and eating well(while controlling fat and calories). A huge number of delicious sounding recipes, most of which are comfort foods with a healthy use of fresh ingredients, all of which are available at my small-town grocery. I've already made a long list of recipes I need to try.She's right up my alley with the occasional use of ingredients like quinoa, spelt and whole wheat. Don't let that scare you though! Not all her bread recipes have unusual grains. In fact, most have regular flours, or a combination of whole grain and regular. But everything I saw looked delicious and doable. The dessert section was what really got me, though. I'll have to try some of the recipes in this section first. Who was it who said, \\"Life is short...eat dessert first\\"?You really need to try some of these recipes:No-Knead Cinnamon BabkaHoney Mustard Carrot SaladSaucy Szechuan Pineapple ChickenGrilled Satay Chicken KabobsMake & Bake Pizza with Herb CrustIsraeli SaladLousiana Chicken SaladThis cookbook is definitely my new favorite. I'll be using it regularly to help me with feeding my family (of diverse appetites).

Many of the recipes have become standards in our home. They are easy and fast, the instructions are clear and the ingredients are avaliable in most large supermarkets. As a Weight Watcher the nutritional information for each recipe is very helpful. I have been cooking lighter for the last few years and this book has been a big help.

Healthy Helpings is the most extensive cookbook I have ever owned.

She also includes many health and nutrition tips and the nutritional information for each entry! There is so much extra, interesting information that I sometimes sit and read my cookbook before bed - the way most people would read a fiction book.With the number of choices and variations offered, it would be easy as a reader to miss some of Ms. Gilletz's good ideas. However, the extensive index makes sure that you can find exactly what you're looking for. I will often choose an ingredient from my fridge and the Healthy Helpings index points me to all the recipes that include that ingredient (even if it was mentioned as a variation and not included in the basic recipe). I have a great time clearing food out my fridge this way!The recipes in this book are easy to follow, tasty and are great for both family meals and for entertaining.

Can they lead the innovation revolution with a balanced scorecard as they manage &#65533; in one minute &#65533; to increase their emotional intelligence or will causal-loop diagrams help them to empower continuous-quality teams to listen appreciatively in the pursuit of excellent shareholder value? I&#65533;m sure you&#65533;ll recognize some of these &#65533;most important things&#65533; and I believe that each of these approaches &#65533; individually and in combinations &#65533; has genuine merit. One or more of them may, in fact, be part of your business&#65533;s best next strategic move. But the sheer volume of seemingly disparate advice can become overwhelming and you have to do something. You don&#65533;t have the resources or the time to investigate each and every one of these, but how do you pick and sort through them all faced with decreasing quarterly margins and increasing pressure to perform...is there a platform high enough to see how some &#65533; maybe all &#65533; of these might fit together?Is there a grand unifying theory of sorts for business?In the spring of 2000, Ken Wilber gathered an incredible group of people together as the Business branch of his newly founded Integral Institute to find out. Ken&#65533;s stated intent was to put a group of thoughtful people that he respected together in a room, give them just enough guidance to get underway and then just to see what they would do. Conversations ran the gamut from inspiring to ridiculous with all the brilliance and humility and grandstanding and depth that a roomful of remarkable and very human people can muster. It was at this gathering that I first met Daryl Paulson. Daryl had with him a copy of Ken&#65533;s magnum opus, &#65533;Sex, Ecology and Spirituality,&#65533; and the already massive tome was choked nearly double with yellow Post-it notes that he had covered with comments, questions and references. For the days and nights of meetings that followed, he contributed thoughtfully, respectfully and knowledgeably to the conversations about what an integral approach to business might mean.You&#65533;ll get to meet Daryl in the pages of this book and there you&#65533;ll meet the mind and heart that Ken respected enough to invite into the Institute. But more importantly, you&#65533;ll encounter some of the powerfully elegant and pragmatic aspects of integral theory and methodology. There&#65533;s a saying that, like a frog at the bottom of a well, we often think too small &#65533; we think the sky is only as big as the top of the well, but if we surfaced, we would have an entirely different view. This book is a groundbreaking effort to help business leaders and managers to find their way to that larger view, and like all early maps of newly explored territory, what follows will need more people to refine and recalibrate and find new paths to explore. But I think this first map will prove to be more right than wrong.What you read in this book is based on Daryl&#65533;s deep knowledge and experience with real-world, profit-and-loss business situations, informed by his rare understanding of the encompassing framework offered by Ken Wilber&#65533;s integral &#65533;Theory of Everything.&#65533; Ken&#65533;s work has earned the admiration of people ranging from Warren Bennis to Al Gore to Tony Robbins and is the most comprehensive, powerful and inclusive framework currently available for understanding human experience. This evidenced-based body of work provides the foundation for identifying and integrating the most effective combination of business actions to apply in any given situation.The integral approach that Daryl offers in \\"Competitive Business, Caring Business\\" provides a substantive first look at how to go about bringing this powerful view into practical day-to-day decisionmaking and resource allocation. It begins with an orienteer&#65533;s view of the terrain: a brief but useful introduction to the four dimensions of an individual&#65533;s reality relative to the organizations of which they are members. Business decision-makers and leaders would be well enough served simply to know how to see these dimensions, for their own organizations and the various environments in which they operate. But there&#65533;s a great deal more value available if they can also begin to see how these might manifest in the minds and cultures of the people that work in and with the organization. And then to be able to navigate these differences&#65533;Moving from the individual&#65533;s experiences and perceptions in small team situations, Competitive Business, Caring Business takes us on an integral expedition through the company, the industry and the environments in which industries, companies, teams and individuals operate. On the way, we&#65533;ll pick up insights from economics, politics, theology, psychology, medicine and physics. We reach the most exciting new territory with the discussion of an &#65533;integral business paradigm.&#65533; With the paths laid out, the last chapter presents the challenge to those explorers with the capacity, the willingness and the desire to reach within themselves to find new ways to engage in business profitably, but that also honor the people that work in and with their businesses. And all this performed with deep reverence for the world environment that supports us &#65533; our fragile island home &#65533; in our new post-9/11 context.As more explorers pick up this first map to join in the fine-tuning of its nuances and its outer regions, more business leaders will begin to see more clearly how and when to consider all the excellent work in management and business theory that has gone on before, and where to push into new thinking, new conversations, new systems and new behaviors. If enough of us can muster the courage that Daryl has exemplified in this pioneering work, we can begin to intentionally influence and co-create the next stage of our businesses&#65533; evolution with a far more compelling and fruitful vision, future and legacy.It&#65533;s a crucial next move."},{"Title":"Competitive Business, Caring Business","review":"Daryl Paulson's book is the first foray into the integration of interal theory with business theory. For those business professionals without a background in Ken Wilber's work (or without an interest in reading some rather lengthy and complex material), this book is a fine starting point for basic integral ideas (not so much for practice).Paulson presents Wilber's integral theory in an easy to understand way. Onto that Paulson builds a hierarchy of organizational levels using Wilber's AQAL matrix. Popular business theory and practice is then categorized within the four quadrants and across the organizational levels. The result is a typology of common practice within an integral framework. That's as far as it goes.For business practitioners possessing knowledge and experience with Wilber's integral model, this book has little to offer."},{"Title":"Stephen A. Douglas","review":"A five-star political narrative history of the leading statesman of the nation after the passing of Henry Clay, but a four-star biography as it barely touches the subject's domestic life. However, the author has painstakingly accounted for almost every political act of Douglas, who the reader discovers was the only possible savior of the Union in 1860. His electoral failure was the failure of the nation to understand what the disastrous consequences would be - a total civil war willingly initiated by abolition and secession extremists. Although as racist and expansionist as most of his contemporaries, his political motives were of the purest democracy (as he understood it). His constant attempts to get the nation's attention away from slavery and back on nation-building were futile was were his attempts to find a compromise on the eve of war. His anguish at seeing his beloved nation and party fall apart brought on his untimely death which left a 25-year void in the leadership of the Democratic Party. A great read for antebellum political junkies!"},{"Title":"Stephen A. Douglas","review":"Johannsen's work will stand forever, it seems, as the authoritative study of Stephen Arnold Douglas, the man who almost alone carried the Jacksonian banner of democracy and union through the decade of American disintegration leading up to the Civil War. The views of Jackson and Douglas, in broad strokes, still today inform political thought in this country and around the world as recognizable elements of their philosophy turn up in &quot;The Third Way&quot; movement of moderation and political pragmatism that is sweeping the globe. A critical figure in American history and present, Douglas receives fine treatment at the hands of Prof. Johannsen, and is seen as much more than the anti-Lincoln that so many ill-informed people believe him to be. Indeed, Lincoln was little more than a gadfly, an anomaly for much of his career. His election was a fluke. Douglas' entire life bespeaks his status as the everlasting statesman that he was and Johannsen is a master at showing this."},{"Title":"Stephen A. Douglas","review":"This is probably going to stand as the ultimate political biography of the Little Giant.It's all here. Beginnings, rise to prominence, decades of tireless work, Kansas-Nebraska in detail, the Senatorial campaign of '58 then the eventual breakup of the country in '60.I did not know until reading this book what lengths Douglas went to in order to try to keep our Union together. He was willing to stand WITH Lincoln, (his political rival!), in order to keep our Union together. Many were furious with him for aiding a Republican. But Douglas was a great man who transcended party for something much more important. He felt that party affiliations were secondary to the safety of our nation. How many politicians would have the guts to do what he did today?This is a very long book-more than 800 pages. Lots of detail."},{"Title":"Stephen A. Douglas","review":"Stephen A Douglas was the political heir to the great nationalist politicians who first became prominent during the War of 1812. He literally followed the footsteps of Clay and Webster. His leadership was vital to passing the Compromise of 1850. Douglas always took the course that he felt best kept the nation together, always supporting expansion and economic development and decrying the rise of divisive slavery politics. He was not an apologist for southern radicals however. Despite being know as Abraham Lincoln's nemesis in Illinois, Douglas ended his life as a supporter of Lincoln's war proclamation. I really gained a level of respect for Douglas after reading about his forlorn tour of the South during the election of 1860 where he tried desperately to stave off secession. Douglas though was a virulent racist and it is hard to speculate if he would have continued to support Lincoln through Emancipation.One the best biographies I have ever read."},{"Title":"Stephen A. Douglas","review":"The standard biography of Lincoln's political rival has much about Illinois politics involving both men, and of course the book treats great national issues on which they took opposite sides.

Burgmuller may not be a great composer, but he is good enough for most of us."},{"Title":"Twenty-Five Easy and Progressive Studies for the Piano, Op. 100: Piano Solo","review":"I'll start with a preface: I have been playing piano for four years, I started when I was 18, and aside from six one-unit community college classes, I've never had any formal training. That said, this book is (in my opinion) a little tougher than the first \\"First Lessons in Bach\\" book and at the end is still easier than most of the second \\"First Lessons\\" Bach book. It fits squarely in the middle, which would be a good run up towards Schumann's Album F&uuml;r Die Jugend or a book of Bach's inventions.Also it would be useful for an accomplished pianist to run through these as one would Hanon or Czerny, only these are actual songs, which helps to break up the monotony of finger exercises. Not to say Hanon or Czerny aren't important; diversity is simply a good thing to have.I'm a total amateur, and I was looking for something less intense than Bach, less repititious than Hanon, and less insane than Czerny.

After Beyer, I proceeded with this book, Burgmuller's 25 pieces. Each song has a title, and each song trains you not only technically, but how to express, how to interpret, how to use your imagination, and most of all, how to play beautifully. The pieces are easy, but they are of quality which advanced students can play them in really professional ways. That means, these pieces have depth that challenges the student's true musicality, imagination, and creativity.I have owned this book for more than 35 years now, still in very good shape despite the heavy usage. I am much more advanced now, of course, but I still use it frequently. These pieces can be played, for their beauty, grace, and integrity, at church, wedding, etc. I can't count how many of my church congregation have expressed their appreciation whenever I played any one of the pieces. They are just such precious jewels of music.Now I teach piano at home, and this book has been a delight for both my students and myself. I'd say these pieces are just as immortal as Bach's inventions. I'd recommend this book to anyone, from beginner to advanced students. It's for advanced beginners (if there are such thing), but very much enjoyable for even professional pianists, for whoever truly appreciates and loves music."},{"Title":"Twenty-Five Easy and Progressive Studies for the Piano, Op. 100: Piano Solo","review":"I use this book for all my students and they love it! The pieces are very nice. They make learning piano technique and artistry really enjoyable. This book is for the intermediate students. Better to use this book after students learn scales, chords, and arpeggios so they can learn the pieces by recognizing patterns, which make them learn the pieces faster. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Twenty-Five Easy and Progressive Studies for the Piano, Op. 100: Piano Solo","review":"I have very limited, beginning ability on the piano and with reading music. This book is a wonderful place to develop and practice. The pieces do not start out overly simple and are progressively more complex. Each piece introduces some new musical elements (accidentals, key change, triplets, etc). All exercise both left and right hands. And all are enjoyable to hear.Because the pieces are all fairly short, I began playing from memory more than from the written music. To counter that, I suggest playing three or four during a practice session.By the way, with a little googling you can find MIDI renditions of these songs on the internet to compare with your playing."},{"Title":"Twenty-Five Easy and Progressive Studies for the Piano, Op. 100: Piano Solo","review":"Beautiful short pieces that are not too complicated but provide plenty of opportunity for technical development.

Being a person who would typically answer, \\"Because someone told me so\\", or trying to end the conversation I had become a part of, I answered, \\"because I am enjoying it, its making me think about a lot of different things, and its cool (I apologize for the \`cool')\\".Sinking my head down I pretend to read but was actually thinking about the question I had already answered. How do I know this is an excellent book? The question intimidated me. I wondered if I was answering this in the presence of the author that wrote it or the artist that put it together what my answer would be.So I tried, this book (seems unfair to call it that) encompasses written and visual art, science, humor, some history, politics, ethics, and more. From the books bindings, to the artwork and the writing I find it difficult to compare to anything else I have read or seen (OK, as far as books are concerned). I looked at the drawings, layouts and fonts and typeset, I laughed, I read and I learned. I cannot think of other works that touched so many areas. If this is a new approach to literature, I feel it is \`excellent'. If this is an approach to literature that I have been missing then I apologize for myself.Please give this work a chance, while reading, looking, holding, etc you will ask \`you' a lot of questions and will be looking at a lot of different images.

Now imagine a narrative orchestrated around characters whose symbolic proportions resonate with the latter two assumptions, and you have some idea of the staggering visual sweep and poetic beauty of VAS, perhaps the first graphic novel (term used advisedly) in which both &quot;graphic&quot; and &quot;novel&quot; are given their full due as contemporary art forms, thus reinventing the genre while re-novelizing the novel of ideas.

VAS: An Opera In Flatland only confirms my best suspicions: that Tomasula is one of our most talented and innovative writers creating in this age of same-ol/same-ol. His collaboration with artist Stephen Farrell hits a high note in the field of Text + Image. This is a literal work of art, and should be approached in the same way one views a painting - by allowing the work to speak on its own terms rather than from conventional and limiting expectations. Reading VAS is like witnessing scattershot in reverse: With narrative of an impending vasectomy combined with scientific data and historical facts (to name only a few), and structure combining the media-asides that bombard us daily, the process of reading here is broadly experiential - an accumulation of often poetic, comic, and tragic information that coalesces as you reach the end.

Reaching the Resistant is a magnificent volume edited by J. Dudley Woodberry that demonstrates the reality of the barriers to the gospel, while abundantly illustrating that these can be spanned. The papers that became the chapters of this book were first presented at a joint meeting of the Evangelical Missiological Society and International Society of Frontier Missiology in November 1997. Each of the chapters' authors carries sufficient expertise to address the issue of resistance with relevance. Noteworthy are those who bring the case studies of the second part and who have had experience serving among some of the most resistant.The book is divided into four sections. The first deals with foundational issues related to ministering among the resistant and the second illustrates some of the barriers found in these contexts through the afore mentioned case studies. The final two then delve into how to alleviate resistance to the gospel, how this is happening today and how to prepare for the same in the future.Michael Pocock, Gary Corwin and Charles Van Engen handle the foundational issues. Pocock begins the analysis of reaching the resistant by raising and responding to a series of fundamental questions concerning the preaching of Christ's good news among those who resist. The most basic of these is why some refuse his offer of hope. Gary Corwin follows by championing the cause of balance, as reaching the resistant is evaluated. Too often proponents of apparently opposing views have chosen to resist the urge to work for a synthesis. He is not exhaustive. He only encourages the discussions surrounding this issue to progress toward a reconciliation between the opinions. For is not the message of the gospel one of reconciliation? Van Engen writes the longest chapter of the book. Alone, this article merits a place in the budget for Reaching the Resistant. Van Engen begins by summarizing the evolution of terminology within the church growth movement, for this is the missiological framework for this discussion. It was the church growth movement that first determined the necessity of identifying distinct people groups in order to compare the relative progress of the Church's growth among them. In the final section of his article a biblical explanation is developed concerning resistant and receptivity. This proves necessary as it helps the missionary to retain a realistic view of what can and what can't be accomplished. For all are resistant all the time, argues Van Engen from the Scriptures, but given the power of the Holy Spirit to open some, it is incumbent upon the messenger to do all to insure that he or she does not become the barrier. Biblically it becomes clear that some will thus turn from resistance to receiving, but never in a unanimous way.Having laid such a foundation, the reader is able to delve into case studies drawn from ministries among Jews, Muslims, Japanese and post-Christian Europe. Some of the greatest barriers to the gospel are found among the peoples of these groups. David Brickner, who is president of Jews for Jesus, admonishes Christians that Jews are not resistant in a monolithic way. Some do turn to Christ. He demonstrates the institutionalized resistance of the Jewish Community and helps the servants of Christ to understand the available means to alleviate some of this resistance. Kevin Higgins argues that removing resistance to the gospel among the Muslim hinges on outsiders who will look for insiders who are better able to communicate the gospel in a contextually relevant way. The issues he raises concerning contextualization of the gospel are most instructive. Stan Conrad argues in his article that Japanese resistance is in fact, fiction. To make his point, Conrad lists the historical and the cultural factors that have contributed to Japan's well-known resistance to the gospel. Because these factors can be mitigated, bridges exist so that some Japanese will turn from refusal, toward Christ. The next case that is examined comes from post-Christendom Europe and was competently composed by David Bjork. His timely challenge is to examine whether the missionary's ministry in Europe is \\"church-centered\\" or \\"Kingdom of God centered?\\" Is it \\"formal\\" or is it \\"relational?\\" Bjork offers an analytical tool to help the messenger of the gospel to make such an evaluation. However, being a missionary in France, like Bjork, I read his chapter more critically. Among other questions, I would have liked a better examination of the differences between Christendom, which encompasses the external forms of Christianity, and Christianity itself. An understanding of this question served as Bjork's foundation for finding validity in European state-churches.The third section of Reaching the Resistant presents several means by which resistance is currently being alleviated around the world. The first such agent is that of martyrdom and is the subject of the article written by Karen L. White, who has served in the Philippines. She insists that martyrdom will be the key to reaching the predominantly Muslim populations of the 10/40 window. This will be the case because barriers to the gospel are actually receding among individuals within these people groups while institutional resistance continues to intensify. The unavoidable result will be more arrests and more execution of those who refuse to turn away from Christ. Martyrdom both motivates the missionary force and offers an indisputable apologetic for the gospel. In addition to martyrdom there are two spiritual means for removing the barriers to the gospel for resistance is a spiritual state. These are through prayer and through the miraculous. John D. Robb argues that it is through the prayers of the saints that the spiritual roots of resistance will be eradicated and Sobhi Malek follows by asserting in his paper that God's miraculous interventions confirm his love for individuals, Christ's claim to be God, the truth taught by the Christian messenger and Christ's superiority over Satan. Resistance is not a thing of \\"flesh and blood,\\" as is oft quoted. It is spiritual. So the centrality of these two chapters to the discussion must not be minimized. Finally, a means for overcoming the especially political barriers is tentmaking. The \\"tentmaker,\\" Gary Ginter, helps those who serve like him to grasp the importance of how their time is used as professional Christians. For the sake of integrity, he advises that at least half their time should be spent in their vocation and for the sake of the gospel the rest of a tentmaker's time must be intentionally spent by telling others about Christ.Then the reader opens the final section of Reaching the Resistant as Timothy C. Tennent, professor at Toccoa Falls College, and Luis Bush, general director of AD 2000, examine ways that the resistant will be reached in the future. Tennent's interest is in the area of training tomorrow's missionaries. He makes six suggestions for how to best prepare the next group of Christ's messengers for the barriers they will face and how to help them understand the means necessary to alleviate future resistance to the gospel. Bush underlines the importance that networks among the world's churches, missions, and missionaries will further facilitate the taking of Christ's message to the remaining unreached peoples. Such networking will facilitate the coordination of missionary outreach and the sharing of valuable information concerning these remaining distinct groups of peoples and the progress of the gospel among them. He concludes by proposing Joshua Harvest: All Peoples All Persons, a strategy for facilitating this.More will be said on the subject. Several of the authors made suggestions about what further study should be made or lamented the limitation of space. Reaching the Resistant finds it's magnificence in this. It is thorough enough to advise Christians who are already working with those who still refuse the hope Christ offers. And it will serve as an indispensable starting point for future study and analysis. Barriers do exist to the gospel, but they are not without bridges. For were we not all at some time among the resistant?"},{"Title":"Rocky II","review":"When I recently read the book Rocky II, by Sylvester Stallone, based on the sequel to the popular movie, I had high hopes. Now that I finished reading it, I'll tell you what I think of it. In my personal opinion, I didn't enjoy the book. You would think that a book based on the movie would be just as good, but that simply is not the case here. To be fair, Sylvester Stallone is a very good actor, but he isn't a good enough writter. Stallone writes short, choppy chapters and uses the same dialogue as the movie. For example, he says: &quot;Adrian c'mere, I wanna talk honest with ya. I know the Rock-what-fifteen, sixteen years? An' him I just wouldn't expect a change.&quot; I didn't like reading the story liked that. It gets quite frustrating and a little annoying. He(Stallone) should have written it better, using regular words without writing the same accent(c'mere) and used fewer longer chapters.The plot of Rocky II is about the same as the first one. Rocky is beginning to settle down with his wife Adrian, while one day Apollo Creed starts taunting him on TV. Well they plan to fight again. Rocky trains to fight Apollo thoughout the book and he is fighting for his love, Adrian. The Main confict was mostly Rocky vs. himself. Rocky has some issues inside himself and tries(and succeeds) to work them out. One character that stands out in my mind was Micky, Rocky's trainer. He always helps Rocky thoughout the story. At the end, Rocky is getting beaten by Creed and Micky offers to get him out of the fight. Micky says, &quot;Call it off-you can't win unless you knock him out! You're getting killed out there!&quot; He's always there when Rocky need him. I wish there was more people like that. The message the writer wants to get across is to believe in yourself. The Rocky series is the ultamite underdog movie.In conclusion, I didn't enjoy reading Rocky II. The writting and the short chapters are some of the reasons. I don't recommend this book. It is a fine movie to watch, but skip reading the book."},{"Title":"Lombard street: A description of the money market,","review":"Walter Bagehot was the first editor of the now world-famous Economist magazine, which has in many ways remained faithful to the liberal philosophy (in a European sense)of its founder. Lombard Street might be difficult to read at first, but as with Charles Dickens once you get used to the style the tale is riveting. And his advice on how a central bank, as the lender of last resort, should behave in the face of a banking crisis remains valid to this day."},{"Title":"Lombard street: A description of the money market,","review":"Can a book about finance written in 1873 be helpful in a world with complex financial markets and plenty of information about how they work? The answer is yes. It is not that \\"Lombard Street\\" is a classic that one finds quoted many a time; the reader's interest should transcend historical inquiry or curiosity; \\"Lombard Street\\" should be read and revered by anyone interested in the underlying, abiding features of financial markets.But what are those characteristics? Bagehot, then editor of The Economist, writes that credit centers on trust: \\"Credit means that a certain confidence is given, a certain trust reposed.\\" And, banks always have on-demand liabilities that far exceed their readily available assets. In short, credit works on trust, and the system, in the absence of trust, can fall apart rapidly.What follows from these premises is a careful examination of how the money market came about, what its uses are, how its operations are connected to trade and country's overall welfare, and, most importantly, how central banks can deal with financial crises. Written elegantly, \\"Lombard Street\\" is, at the same time, an introductory overview of the market and a trenchant analysis of its most salient features.But what makes \\"Lombard Street\\" timeless is that it deals with finance in its human form. Bagehot talks about power, prestige and perception as much as he does about interest, discount, and credit. Trust is based on institutions and people: the human features of finance-trust, anxiety, mania, optimism-are timeless and apply to the financial markets of the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first century. That is why \\"Lombard Street\\" is an ever useful introduction and guide."},{"Title":"Lombard street: A description of the money market,","review":"Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance."},{"Title":"Lombard street: A description of the money market,","review":"This is an excellent book.

Instead it appears as a bunch of jibberish.It appears that Echo Library somehow acquired a text file of the book, perhaps as a Word document or something, and then simply output that onto paper and binder, and then shipped the books, without even glancing at the results, let alone proof reading it.Also, apparently to save paper, the publisher made the type size a bit small, and made the page column a bit wide. That saves paper alright, and makes it a thinner book, but it makes it harder to read. But it's still worth reading because Bagehot is so good.MY RECOMMENDATION: It's an excellent writing by Bagehot, first class. But buy it by another publisher."},{"Title":"Lombard street: A description of the money market,","review":"The great Victorian book about what we now call central banking really needs to introduction.

It treats the Justices as men motivated by their political beliefs and personal backgrounds. The Court has always been a political body, not disinterested seekers after &quot;Truth&quot;. Their life-time tenure often reflects obsolete beliefs and politics that were outdated when they made decisions. The Supreme Court is the most powerful and secretive branch of Government; they are not responsible to anyone or anything. There are no checks and balances on the Supreme Court. This is why past decisions can be overruled, or plain language can be interpreted contrarily. The Court is irresponsible since it can even duck a decision on any issue. They are not required to explain why they refuse a case (p.16). But an important issue does not go away if it is ignored.There is a need for autocratic power in defending the civil liberties of people from state power (p.22). But the Supreme Court has been most reluctant to do this (p.23). Most Supreme Court cases cover financial matters (p.25). The Supreme Court hides its politics behind a symbolic sacredness that the author compares to British Royalty (p.27). New Justices don't turn over a new leaf (p.30). Any attempt to evaluate the Court's activities must analyze the persons who create these decisions (p.31). The reasons for judicial decisions are often excuses for what they want to do. They are unique for making authoritarian decisions within a constitutional democracy. [Some of the examples cited became obsolete during the Warren Court: &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, the Miranda decision, etc. Did the publication of this book play a part?]Chapter 2 discusses the origins of the Supreme Court. It has been both agent and exerciser of political power from the beginning. Judicial review allows a veto of any national or state law - a tyranny unknown in any other country (p.35). Interpreting laws makes them so powerful. Page 37 tells of a Supreme Court decision so incorrect as to be absurd; the very next day Congress passed a reworded stature. &quot;Judicial Review&quot; was created by the first Supreme Court, a royal prerogative (pp.38-39). Judicial review was not wanted by the Founding Fathers (pp.40-41). [Was the Wizard of Oz a symbol for the Supreme Court?]The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the six Justices the power to decide the validity of any state or Federal law (p.43). Rodell explains this as a way to extend Federalist control way into the future (p.45). [The senility of William Cushing proved the need for a limited term from the beginning.] Judicial review was first exercised in 1792 when they declined to act in awarding pensions to Revolutionary War veterans (p.52). When the Court allowed a citizen to sue a state in federal court, the reaction was the passage of the Eleventh Amendment (p.55). Pages 57-58 discuss the lack of &quot;advisory opinions&quot;. [But it means the Court will wait to see how things work out before making a decision.] Pages 64-66 tell of the Sedition Act, when the Courts acted as enforcers for the Federalist Party. Could this happen again? The last act of the Federalists was to create new federal circuit courts and Judges, and to appoint John Marshall of Virginia as the new Chief Justice. The rest of this book covers the next 150 years in 260 pages.Judicial principles are merely words to camouflage grabs for power by one class against another (p.119). Blessing crooked land deals goes back to John Marshall (p.101). Lincoln said &quot;their power is the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to elective controls&quot; (p.134)."},{"Title":"Gardens of Riviera","review":"Gardens of the Riviera is a great work of gardening history. The gardeners of this region really invented the style we think of as Mediterranean. Vivien Russell did some great research and truly brought a whole era to light in her treatment. The photographs are, unfortunately, just at par. If it is reprinted, I should hope they could get the negatives and reprint them digitally to improve their clarity. The focus of most of the photos is on actual garden settings, and not on vistas enjoyed from large grounds, as is the case in many books of this sort. For the hobbyist, this is very helpful, and for the designer it offers more material that is useful in working with clients."},{"Title":"Reading Romantics: Texts and Contexts","review":"Professor Manning taught me in a couple of classes at USC in the late 70s, and he, along with Prof. Casson, were amazing.I haven't bought the book yet, but will.

Not only does she explain why your intuition is important but how to tune into it. She shows you step-by-step how to work with your puppy's internal nature - not against it - without any force, pressure or stress.Some of the training techniques include silent training and games using a puppy's innate nature of exploration. This results in training with \\"effortless effort.\\" This book contains a wealth of information about puppy wellness such as safety, immunization schedules, diet and even how to teach children to interact with a puppy.\\"Understand a puppy's needs, adopt them as your own, lead with loving kindness\\" explains simply how adopting lessons taught through tao brings peace and joy during what can be a hectic, trying time of puppyhood.This book is great for those who have raised several puppies to those who are just thinking about bringing a puppy into their lives."},{"Title":"Tao of Puppies: How to Raise a Good Dog Without Really Trying","review":"Cantrell covers all the basics of training your puppy, but so do several hundred other dog training books. So what's different about this book?What I liked about her approach, specifically, was how she gets the reader to look more deeply at the dog he or she has with the intent to understand who that dog is first. With that understanding, Cantrell leads the reader to learn how to make better connections with the puppy in a way that makes sense to the puppy. Hence, no force is required in this training method because you are not inadvertently pitting yourself against your dog--but rather working with your dog's natural energy and inclination.Love the silent training section. That alone is worth the price of the book. If your puppy is driving you nuts (and hopefully before your puppy is driving you nuts) read this book."},{"Title":"Tao of Puppies: How to Raise a Good Dog Without Really Trying","review":"This book helps the new puppy owner create a firm foundation of trust and \\"communication\\" with their new friend. Gives a new dog handler a good perspective in terms of how to best relate to their dog, gets positive results easily, with a very small amount of effort...finesse moves, is how I'd describe it.I give a copy of this book to my first-time puppy homes. The book shows you to identify your puppy's learning strengths, and gives you an idea as to which are the best, most effective teaching tools to use with your particular pup.Also helpful in terms of managing expectations, and understanding that raising a puppy into adulthood is a on-going process, that things take time as you are dealing with a growing, learning, living creature. Makes good sense. Talks about puppy development, and particular phases of puppyhood.You don't have to believe in Taoism in order for this book to be useful. I have read many books in this genre, and this one is my favorite so far.Many folks are naturally and instinctively good with dogs...and for those of us who could use a little help, this book puts that instinct into words and actions that we can use, both the handler and the dog."},{"Title":"Tao of Puppies: How to Raise a Good Dog Without Really Trying","review":"Since becoming a dog owner for the first time this year, I have read and purchased many puppy books.

In this book he conveys the relationship between the Barcelona football club and the people of the Catalan region of Spain. It's a history of the Catalan people written through their love of their football team. He takes you through the Spanish Civil War (when the only place the Catalan's could display their regional pride was at the stadium) all the way to present day (the rivalry with the Castillon side Real Madrid is as touchy as ever). A great read for any football fan, sports fan or someone interested in history."},{"Title":"Barca: A People's Passion","review":"This book provides a great overview of the history of the club, its stars, the machinations of its ruling junta, and the passion of the cules, all against the backdrop of Catalonia's political struggle for identity and independence within Spain. Burns provides some nice historical details and great anecdotes, but, as is to be expected considering the hundred year focus of the book and the complexity of 20th century Spain, necessarily deals with some of the political history in a less comprehensive manner.Although it at times extremely well-written, the book could have done with tighter editing (hence, 4 stars). Burns repeats his descriptions of individuals and events in subsequent pages and at time his prose is florid and unfocused. Pretty minor complaints, however. Although not uncritical, Burns clearly appreciates what Barca have achieved. He also questions how the club will adjust, or might be changed, in the new century. Overall, the book is an excellent read, and continually succeeds in portraying the people involved as just that, people with passions and short-comings. At the end, you understand why the club embodies true football, why it inspires such passion, and why it's such an important part of Catalonia. Forca Barca!"},{"Title":"Barca: A People's Passion","review":"I highly recommend this book for Barca fans and for general football fans alike. Not only does Burns write about the great players and personalities of the club, he also places them into a historical context.This was one of the great surprises of the book. He spends considerable time placing Barca's history into the context of the Spanish Civil War and resulting Franco era. Students of Spanish History would do well to read this book.Overall, I enjoyed it greatly, and hope to read more of Burns' football books."},{"Title":"Barca: A People's Passion","review":"Let me first say that I am very bias. I've been an FCB \\"soci\\" since 1981, played in their youth system for a couple of years, and by and large am one of the many fans that buys into the whole \\"Mes que un Club\\" mantra.So understanding that, let me just say that Jimmy Burns has done a fantastic job helping the reader understand how history has shaped the meaning of \\"Mes que un Club\\". Part history, part sociology, Burns discusses the club's history, both real and invented, that pushed FCB into being the opposition to Real Madrid.Keep in mind this is more than a book on the Club. Burns adeptly weaves the Club and the sport with Catalan politics and identity. Always balancing the passions of \\"Cules\\" with the machination of the member's of the board, one truly gets a sense of the depth of history and passion behind the Club.The reader learns some of the details behind some of FCB lore, from the Di Stefano controversy, the Kings Cup match against Real Madrid after the Civil War, to the famous field invasion that erupted into a pro-Catalunya demonstration toward the end of the Franco regime. Some of the myths are debunked, but in all, the Clubs history is given a fair shake.Keep in mind - On the downside, Jimmy Burns does favor the Catalan club, more times than not. He doesn't approach the topic dispassionately.As a follow up to A Peaople's Passion, another great read on Spanish football can be found in Phil Ball's excellent book, Morbo. It touches upon the unique history of Spanish football from it's roots in the mines of Huelva, through the use of the sport in identity politics, particularly in the Basque Country and Catalunya."},{"Title":"Barca: A People's Passion","review":"Jimmy Burns writes dispassionately about a football club that evokes the strongest of emotions, including the kind of tribal love that borders on the chauvenistic. Fans of the club interested in modern Spanish history will appreciate the author's intertwining of football and politics. At times, however, this well-researched book feels drained of the game's abundant color and spirit as club presidents receive far more attention than the boot room. Burns presents Barca's story chronologically, offering an absorbing account of the club's creation, but when Franco arrives on the scene, the pages become populated with conniving industrialists. While certainly part of Barca's story, the board room machinations of ambitious suits drown out the passion of the cules.The last few chapters of this history manage a comeback. Johann Cruyff swoops down on the Catalan capital and with a combination of deft moves and Dutch footballing genius restokes Barca's smoldering fires. Cruyff is the catalyst. The passages describing his obsessiveness and his successors success or failure to embrace the pulsing life of Barcelona are intriguing pictures of the cultural assimilation phenomenon. Dutchmen, who possess a paradoxical nature, both catholic and single-minded, universal and gaulingly self-possessed, obviously feel a kinship with FC Barcelona, with the Catalan spirit. The present manager of the team, Frank Rijkaard, is a perfect example of the Dutchmen that Burns describes as having an essential talismanic role at the club. Forca Barca."},{"Title":"Barca: A People's Passion","review":"Feels like more of a History book than a Soccer book. If you're looking for the X's and O's of Van Gaal's system and an in-depth analysis of past Barca greats, this isn't it. The writer is exceptional at analyzing the sociocultural makeup of the club, however. I found it interesting to an extent, however it wasn't what I was after."},{"Title":"Barca: A People's Passion","review":"I thought this was a well written, well researched book about a topic that means quite a bit to me; mainly football and Barcelona. I love the sport and I love the city. If anyone has an interest in football and history, I would recommend \\"Barca\\" to them. (Also, a funny picture of Jose Mourinho when he was assistant manager there in the 90's, during the short time Ronaldo was there). Catalunya is like no place on earth in the way its football is played and coached, followed and loved by the people of the region who live their lives in support of their football club."},{"Title":"Barca: A People's Passion","review":"Reading this book is simple amazing. I bough it because I am a truly FC BARCELONA fan, however this books goes beyond that, it explains very well the relationships between Spanish recent history and soccer, finally I am able to understand the frivolity between this winner team and others, more related to social and political issues than only sports.Very well documented, fair, balanced and a treasure for anyone who really wants to learn how important soccer is in many countries.

It seems that a young priest in the feel-good 1970s was so taken with the latest bestseller *I'm Okay, You're Okay* that he gave it a rave review in one of his sermons. Afterwards, an old parishioner acknowledged that the book was probably a good one, but added this: \\"I kept thinking of Christ on the Cross saying to those who were watching him die, 'If everybody's okay, what in blazes am I doing up here?'\\"This wonderful story sets the stage for Forest's wide-ranging reflections on confession. He isn't content merely to examine confession as a sacrament. Instead, he correctly sees confession as a magnet that pulls together such topics as human nature, sin, individual integrity, community, and spiritual wholeness. Confession is more than just whispering a few faults into a priest's ear. It's an opportunity for renewal and rebirth, because one can only begin to heal if one first acknowledges that something's broken. Defiant refusal to acknowledge individual guilt is bad enough; psycho-babbled insousiance is worse. Jim Forest does an especially good job of persuading us of the importance of honestly facing ourselves and God.Along the way, he gives a short history of confession, reflects on several scriptural stories in which confession is illuminated (my favorite is his discussion of Mark's account of the paralytic who was healed), includes a discussion of Dostoevsky on the need for reconciliation (to my mind, a gem-like essay in its own right), discusses some concrete tips for preparing for confession or self-examen and selecting a confessor, and closes with an interesting chapter of reflections on confession from clergy and laypeople. All in all, a remarkable book. It deserves to be read with Martin Smith's classic *Reconciliation*.Jim Forest has given us much to think about in his previous books on icons, the beatitudes, and Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton (one of the best short biographies of Merton I've ever read). We're once again in his debt for this little book on confession."},{"Title":"Confession: Doorway to Forgiveness","review":"This book is an easy read and gives one good thought guidelines for living your life."},{"Title":"Soldier in Paradise: A Novel","review":"This is the E-book version of a novel published in 1999. The novel won the W.Y Boyd Award for best military fiction.It is a swift, satisfying read because of Mort's trademark style--fluid, deceptively easy but in fact quite elegant. It is the story of Patrick &#34;Irish&#34; Donnelly's experience in Vietnam, juxtaposed against his current post-service life. Probably one of the more accessible Vietnam War stories you'll read. Mort limits the number the characters, allowing us to feel invested in their lives and in some cases, deaths. One reviewer of the book called it a &#34;fictionalized memoir.&#34; Maybe. But it is very much a novel in structure--the individual scenes build tension and then release--in spite of the alternating chapters (War, home).

Not a day go by that you don't hear about corporate corruption with regard to employees' savings and investment plans.One chapter that was very phophetic to me was Chapter 7 which is titled, \\"Reasons Not to Trust Man.\\" From what I can see, this book was published in 1998, but look at what is going on with a company such as ENRON. And, this is 2002.The author warned of these kinds of events years ago. As stated by Ms. Perkins, today we can no longer put our trust in the system. Our trust must be put in God and in ourselves to plan for our own financial future.A definite must read for any individual seeking direction for their life regarding their finances!!!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Skating Race: A World War II Story from the Netherlands","review":"Louise Borden has added another little known story to her collection of historical fiction. In the year 1941, Holland has been under Nazi control for a year. Ten year old Piet dreams of following in the footsteps of his hero, Piiim Mulier the skater who first achieved Elfstedentocht, the Eleven Towns Race.When a family friend is taken into German custody Piet's grandfather asks the boy to take the threatened family's children, down the frozen canals, to safety across the border to Brugge, Belguim. They are hoping three children skating down the canals will not attact the attention of the German troops. The journey becomes Piet's Elfstedentocht. The cold, the exhaustion, the fear and the natural exuberance of the children are beautifully shared in this story.Niki Daly's illustrations have an old fashioned feel. Daly has caught the feeling of the Dutch winter sky and the era with muted colors.Interesting notes on the Elfstedentocht are included along with pronounciations of the Dutch words. Another wonderful book about Holland during WWII is \\"Forging Freedom\\" by Hudson Talbott. These two titles would work well together."},{"Title":"The Greatest Skating Race: A World War II Story from the Netherlands","review":"Parents often find themselves amazed at the sheer number of WWII picture books available to kids today. Why the year 2004 alone was privy to such fabulous tomes as, \\"The Cats of Krasinski Square\\", by Karen Hesse and \\"The Greatest Skating Race\\", by Louise Borden. Usually such picture books are examinations of the Holocaust and/or Jewish oppression. Borden's book, however, takes an entirely different route. Concentrating on the German occupation in the Netherlands, the book shows how resistance and bravery can flower in children when the need is great enough. Though this book is far too lengthy and involved to seriously interest any child under the age of eight, I'd still recommend it to those tykes that can maintain their interest through a riveting race against time.Piet (pronounced \\"pete\\") has a single burning obsession that has yet to be thoroughly quenched. He loves to skate. This is not particularly peculiar in the Netherlands, of course. After all, he comes from a long line of skate artisans and often he traverses the many canals that run through his town. But Piet's real hope is to someday compete in the difficult Elfstedentocht race held in Friesland when the winters are cold enough. Piet's hero, Pim Mulier, once completed the 200 kilometer (roughly 125 mile) course in just 12 hours and 55 minutes and Piet's raring to do the same. But it's the second winter into WWII and the Netherlands are under German occupation. What's worse, a father of two kids in Piet's school was recently arrested by the Germans for passing on information to the British. This places the man's children in dire peril and their only hope is to somehow escape over the border to Belgium and then into the town of Brugge to safety. But how could two such children be able to find their way? That's where Piet comes in. With his trusty red notebook in hand, Piet and the kids must escape and elude the Germans and make it to their safehouse in the course of a single day over 12 kilometers. If they're strong enough.Though looking like a picture book, this is an in-depth read more appropriate for kids reading early chapter titles. In the course of the narrative, author Louise Borden spots the text with factual information in the form of maps, pronunciation guides (very useful when you have words like, \\"Elfstedentocht\\" to contend with), and info on the great Friesland race as well as a history of skating itself. It's enough to make your head spin. And then, to top it all off, there's the story. Borden cleverly sucks you into the action. It did strike me as a little odd that in this book the adults would place Piet in such danger when a grown-up probably could've have helped the two children instead. Then again, maybe they figured that kids would attract less attention. Whatever the reason, Piet's journey is realistic. He comes up with an ingenious way to keep the seven-year-old from tiring too much and also for keeping the children's spirits up. After reading the book, you may never want to skate yourself but you're happy watching others do it here.The illustrations by Niki Daly are nicely detailed as watercolors go but the real hero here is the text. Kids who like that classic piece of children's literature, \\"Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates\\" by Patricia Lauber will find a similar tale in \\"The Greatest Skating Race\\". Purchase only for those advanced readers that won't be turned off by a little historical fiction. A great WWII picture book for a select audience."},{"Title":"The Greatest Skating Race: A World War II Story from the Netherlands","review":"My 4-year-old son picked this book out at the library (I think he was attracted by the cover picture of children ice skating, a hobby he too enjoys). When I read it to him at home, I was surprised at how engaging it was for me, being that it is a book written for a younger audience. The author certainly researched her subject matter. My son and I both learned a great deal about the Netherlands in the early 1940s, and the history of ice skating. The Elfstedentocht, the speed skating race in the northern province of Friesland, I had never heard of before reading this book. Maybe one day my son will travel to the land of his ancestors and compete in this race! This excellent book could certainly inspire an interest in a venture of that nature.

Because I inherited the Elfstedentocht medals (\\"kruisjes\\") of my aunt's 3 tours and one from my grandmother, I find myself often explaining the uniqueness, severity and hardship (my aunt lost her front teeths; my grandmother froze her toes in 1909)of this race to my English speaking grandchildren, I ordered this book.In addition to writing a nice story to go along with facts, Louise Borden has done an outstanding job of reviewing this incredible race and explaining the Dutch obssession with speed skating. This winter (2010-2011) we almost had another Elfstentocht. It was not to be. Hopefully next winter, or, as they say in Friesland \\"It sil heve!\\" (It shall happen!).Jitske Bergman"},{"Title":"The Greatest Skating Race: A World War II Story from the Netherlands","review":"I purchased this for my 2nd grade granddaughter to read from her list of summer reading books. Turned out to be a 4th grade level, but she was definitely up to it! Wonderful book! Excellent adventure from WWII. She was enthralled and I was, too! Recommend this one highly!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Skating Race: A World War II Story from the Netherlands","review":"Lately much of my reading has been focused on what happened in the Netherlands (Holland) during World War II and the German occupation. This is another excellent addition to my growing list of titles.While this book is done in a picture book format, with a fairly easy reading style, it shows how the occupation impacted some children during a cold winter. This book is based on an actual incident where Piet had to skate with two Jewish children across the border into Belgium. It was a bit of an endurance test, just like a real race, because he had to watch out for the younger boy with him, and they had to hide on the ice under a bridge, and he had to persuade German soldiers he was just a schoolboy on his way to visit his grandmother.Since I was born in Holland after the war, and I heard many stories about the war, and about ice skating on the canals, I found that this story had the ring of truth in it.I found the two short appendixes at the back to be helpful in understanding more about the geography and the famous ice race.I recommend this book to all ages, even teens and adults, who want to know more about real life in Holland during the war."},{"Title":"The Greatest Skating Race: A World War II Story from the Netherlands","review":"This was a beautiful book. Compelling, full of history and emotion. The way the author showed how celebrities and ordinary folk alike have extraordinary strength was masterful. The young boy Piet is inspired to have great courage by stories of Pim Mulier, the famous skater of the Elfstedentocht (Eleven Towns Race). I would compare this to Lois Lowry's Number the Stars, which is for older children certainly, but also about young people being much braver than they thought they could be while caught up in the tragedy of World War II."},{"Title":"The Greatest Skating Race: A World War II Story from the Netherlands","review":"And if so, how MUCH of it is true.This is a heroic story, regardless of how real it is, of how a boy skated his friends to safety from Holland during WWII. The danger is a bit understated, so this book is suitable for more sensitive children."},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"For such a small book it is packed with information. Everything you need to know to become connected with Spirit. Awesome book!"},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"I am saddened to see this type of spirituality so misunderstood and then put down by those who refuse to open their minds. It is important to be informed about spirituality before expressing an opinion so that your opinion can be an informed one. I highly recommend books by Doreen Virtue and, most importantly, the Conversations With God series by Neale Donald Walsch to those who are openminded enough to take the time to learn more about spirituality as opposed to strict religion (and to Seeking Answers specifically). When one does this, a person can better understand their own religion and see that it is all subject to interpretation. What \\"Seeking Answers\\" does not understand is that angels are not bound by time or space. They are an extension of God because they are created from God's energy and, since God isn't limited by space and time because She/He is omnipresent (that means God can be everywhere at once, for those who don't already know), so can God's angels. And, just because the Bible doesn't go into the fact that angels are gifts to us from God and were created to help us and guide us, doesn't mean that is not the case. The Bible left a lot out and included things that are strictly interpretation and opinion so is to be taken with a grain of salt. Angels are so much more than messengers (even the Bible displays that). They are guides and helpers and they love us just as God loves us. The fact that angels (like God) are onmipresent, allows them to be channeled by more than one person at a time and can be helping more than one person at a time. Whenever you call on an Archangel or even your own personal guardian angels, NEVER fear that you are taking away help from someone else or that you are, in some way, bothering the angels. This is what they do! They WANT you to talk to them and ask them for help! Remember, angels are extensions of God, like Her arm. They are one with God and are a part of Him so when you talk to angels, you are also talking to God! Neither God nor angels are human and yet too many times people give them human limitations and attributes (like anger and jealousy). Arch Angel Michael is not at war and neither is God. To believe that we are fighting a war with evil implies that there is a chance of losing if we don't fight to win. How can God lose anything? God is all-powerful and all-knowing! To say God has to fight to win over evil implies that God is imperfect and that, my Christian friends, is blasphemy. Bad things happen because angels cannot help us directly without our direct consent. That is to say, unless we ask them to help, they cannot interfere because they would make free-will null and void if they did. There is one exception to this rule however, and that is if we are about to die before our time. They can interfere to save us from crossing over before we have completed what we were meant to do. I can hear many of you now... \\"then how come babies die and children die?\\" Well, have you ever considered these two things? One, they were only supposed to live that long so as to provide a certain experience for the people involved? Like the parents? Second, NO ONE CAN EVER DIE EVER! Einstein said that matter cannot be destroyed, it merely changes form. That is EXACTLY what happens to us when we \\"die\\". Out bodies decompose and become one with the earth and our souls and minds remain fully intact to have more experiences without the limitations of a body (like experiencing heaven, but you really need to read Conversations With God book 3 because there is A LOT more to this than I can explain here). When we are done doing that, our minds remember who we really are (creations of God from God's own energy and are therefore, one with God), and our souls go back to The Source (The Creator, God, Allah, etc.) and we can choose to live another life or stay fully aware. Yes, Earth is a learning ground and that is why both good and bad things happen (how could we know what \\"good\\" was if we didn't have \\"bad\\" to compare it to?). Everything is relative. You can't know light without also knowing dark, up/down, left/right, black/white, young/old, protons/electrons, love/hate, etc. You can't truly know and comprehend one without the other. If it was only always light out, you wouldn't be able to say, well I know this is light because it isn't dark. You can't know what something is unless you also know what it isn't. Throughout our lives, we have experiences that allow us to learn and know who we truly are based on how we view the world (I know that I am spiritual because I am not religious, that is who I am. I know I am a girl, because I am not a boy, etc. These experiences help us to grow! Having babies, getting into an accident, etc. All experiences, both good and bad, help us to grow and learn spiritually! This is also why \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" (depending on your personal definition) things happen to us! Keep in mind that things may happen to the body that we may see as being absolutely terrible, but keep in mind that the body is just a medium (like clay or a canvas is for an artist) through which we have experiences but our soul can never be damaged. Sprit Guides and angels are most certainly at our every beck and call because that is why they exist! They exist for us! They are a gift from God to us to serve that very purpose and they want nothing more than to have you ask them to help you and guide you every day to help you do what your soul was inteded to do while living this life. This is how you ask to do God's will, because God's will is your own. God loves you soooooo much, that He wants for you what you want for you. Well, I have gone on long enough. If you just read the Conversations With God series and books like Healing With the Angels by Doreen Virtue, you will get a better understanding. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I hope this helped those who are seeking deeper spirituality while still struggling with the teachings of organized religion and the many contradictions between the two. You are on a Divine path. This may not be the direction you are meant to go at this time or even in this life. So, if what I have said doesn't sit well with you, it simply means that you need to continue seeking until you find what feels right for you. No religion or spirituality is ever wrong. It might just be wrong for you. God bless you on your journey to find what is right for you!"},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"I'm 53 and returning to occult studies after decades of being in the \\"punch-a-clock, 9-to-5\\" working world; and raising a son. My feeling of Ted Andrews is that he was knowledgeable and sincere and certainly dedicated to esoteric studies. Because of his extensive studies of animals and energy, I purchased this book. It is small and an easy read. It doesn't have an abundance of foreign or non-English words. He doesn't try to explain a whole philosophy, he sticks to the point. This book is about how to approach this with ease, gentleness and confidence. Some old texts on this subject lead you to believe that if you don't sit in the exact middle of a drawn pentagram and light candles in the four directions and sit there at 2 am, you're going to get possessed by the devil or something. Ted explains connecting to your spirit guides in a way that really just opens up your confidence to understand the energies and unseen forces that are operating all the time -- TO OUR BENEFIT. The practices are taken from ancient texts but made simple and are powerful for getting in touch with your energy and exploring the energies of those who surround you or want to connect/communicate with you. It's a good book to read if you are concerned about someone you know who might be interested in this.

It is complete, written with pleasent tones.Mr. Andrews explains ways to meet with spirit guides, what they are, the types. He even explains the archangles, the wood and fairy spirits, and nature elementals. He gives easily remembered meditations. He explains lower level beings, and the highest of all. He doesn't leave many questions unanswered.Most of all, I appreciate the tone of the book. I think that is why I enjoyed it. I have the book Spirit Speaks, and it is by another author, but the tone it is written in, is not pleasent. Ted Andrews makes this very interesting, and makes one want to try to get in touch with the spirit world.

One of the exercises he suggests for raising the vibration is the Middle Pillar exercise from Qabala, based on Golden Dawn tradition. This is followed by The Mystic Marriage exercise which activators and aligned the upper four chakra centers of the body and increase the flow of energy to them, enabling greater use of intuitive and Higher Self capabilities, which in turn facilitates recognition of spirit guides. (On the other hand if you have your own favorite way of increasing your awareness of the spiritual realm according to your affinity and beliefs, you may as well do what you feel most comfortable doing). Upon this you visualize your inner sanctuary, a place where you feel comfortable, safe and protected and where you will initiate communion with spirits.This book then contains techniques that involve mediumship, inspirational and automatic writing, even ouija board (many would advise to leave ouija boards alone), scrying with the crystal ball. Among the spirit guides, the author suggest you can contact guardian angels, archangels, all kinds of angels, nature spirits. He shares the method of working with archangels using the signatures base on the Golden Dawn technique of tracing the Hebrew letters of the name on the symbol of the Rose-cross.The author then shares techniques for connecting with nature spirits, honouring spirit totems and animal spirits, this time through a combination of Golden Dawn and shamanic journeying techniques. And then we come to discarnate entities, ghosts and hauntings.Appropriately, there is a chapter on important precautions where you are advised to use discernment. When you are involved with spiritual beings who contribute to your well-being you experience increase sense of joy, vitality, creativity, inspiration, energy, and you feel a sense of inner peace. if the energy you sense unsettles you, then discontinue contact.If you prefer non-occult way for working with spirit guides, you may like better Sonia Choquette's book \\"Ask your Guides\\"."},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"I found this book interesting.I like Ted Andrews's books.

I happened to be reading Robert Anton Wilson's Cosmic Trigger Vol. 1 at the same time and found full confirmation there of at least one type of nature spirit. I found the book so engrossing that I didn't stop long enough to properly do the exercises so I cannot at this stage confirm whether they really work in establishing communication - once or twice I did get a feeling of otherwordliness though, when doing the mystic marriage. But merely reading it certainly raises one's awareness. This volume is well illustrated to explain the exercises, energy bodies plus the aforementioned symbols of the archangels. Includes a bibliography for further reading. I recommend the book strongly since it encapsulates all the necessary information in one place, whereas other self-help books carry only bits and pieces."},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"I've read this book more than once and refer to it often.

The only advice I would give is that if this the first book for someone getting into spirit contact, I would wait. Some of the discussions get a little too deep. I would not have understood a number of things in Andrews' book if I had not read other books before this one."},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"I wish people would read books like these with an open mind or not at all. Quoting the Bible to knock a book like this is pointless. If the Bible is your one and only spiritual guidebook in life, then why are you reading this book in the first place?Spirit guides aren't evil spirits. If people can't tell the difference between a spiritual being who wants to help you from a spiritual being that wants you to do bad things, then how spiritual are you in the first place? Spiritual guides are meant to help us spiritually progress towards greater unconditional love, to keep us on the path we agreed to take with God's blessing. An evil spirit wants to distract us from that goal, to have us commit sin and do things that aren't in keeping with spiritual progress. Contacting your spirit guide is not for the spiritual newbie and should be handled with care. This book is a good intro for people wanting to do that. If you aren't interested in getting to know your spiritual guide, then by all means, read your Bible and don't even buy or review a book like this. No one's forcing you to read something that goes against your beliefs."},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"HI! You'll love this book!

It deals extensively with different types of spirit guides, including angels, and how to contact them. Andrews offers tips on how to facilitate contact, such as using incense and bathing in sea salts. I haven't attempted to contact my spirit guide yet, but I plan to soon. The only drawback to the book is that it doesn't explain meditation fully and left me somewhat confused. Andrews also discussed crystal ball gazing which was very interesting. I plan to research it further."},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"When reading spiritual literature, it is important to check in with your own intuition to determine your personal beliefs as they relate to the subjects being covered. So often, people take what they read at face value without making their own interpretation. Spiritual evolution and understanding your soul are about establishing your own path and your own beliefs. How To Meet & Work With Spirit Guides by Ted Andrews, while interesting, certainly challenged my own beliefs.Many current books on spirit guides portray them all as some type of angel, and perhaps this is done strategically to reach a wider audience. Although definitely touching on angels, Andrews expounds on other types of guides including faeries, nature spirits, totems, ghosts, and hauntings. Additionally, he discusses the darker side of the spirit realm, a concept often left untouched in modern spiritual literature. From the beginning of the book, Andrews explains, \\"Nothing within the spirit realm can harm you as long as you maintain control and authority over your life.\\" This immediately left me with an ominous feeling, trying to determine whether or not I even wanted to explore the spiritual realm further.Andrews explains the purpose that guides can play in our lives, and discusses how spirit exists constantly in forms we may not expect or understand. Like many other spiritual writers, Andrews explains creativity and imagination as the keys to the spirit realm through which divine contact takes place. He describes how best to take care of the body so as to be most sensitive to the spirit realm through increasing water intake and reducing salt. He also discusses methods by which to use fragrance and acupressure to make one more sensitive.Once prepared, one can learn to access the spirit realm through relaxation, meditation, visualization, and rhythmic breathing. Andrews suggests creating a special sanctuary in the mind, a safe place where one can meet and interact with various spirit guides. Andrews discusses the concepts of mediumship and channeling and the popularity of those practices today. He warns against the dangers of channeling, explaining that those unprepared physically and spiritually for channeling could bring forth negative information and experience longer-term negative physical and emotional effects on the body.The aura is the energetic field that surrounds the body that allows for contact with the unseen. Altered states of consciousness and meditation create a bridge through the aura across which this contact is made. Andrews discusses angels, particularly the Archangels and offers guided meditations and symbols through which contact can be made. Nature spirits and animal totems are explained in detail, including elves and faeries, and Andrews describes these mythical creatures without any doubt of their existence. As previously mentioned, this is one area where the reader must complete an intuition check to determine his or her own opinion as it relates to these concepts.In the chapter on hauntings and discarnate spirits, Andrews explains how these supernatural entities came to be and how they can help those still on the physical plane. The final chapter on precautions certainly leaves the reader feeling a bit frightened as to the potential damage contact with the wrong types of spirits can bring. Particularly, he warns against false information received from those who channel and explains that helpful spirit guides will always expect you to challenge and test their information for yourself. (Hence, my advice to gut-check these concepts and determine your own beliefs.)As a deeply spiritual person interested in topics of a paranormal and spiritual nature, How To Meet & Work With Spirit Guides by Ted Andrews was still a bit \\"out there\\" for me. I will need to do further research of my own to fully understand my own beliefs regarding some of these topics, and I would encourage others to do the same. That said, this book was written and organized well, simple to understand, and presented interesting and useful exercises and advice for tapping into a natural ability to connect with the spirit realm."},{"Title":"How to Meet and Work with Spirit Guides","review":"hard to rate - some is far out - but I found the section on animal guides to be just what I was looking for.

They wouldn't.Angels are commissioned by God to obey God. They serve God by delivering his messages (Jesus birth, The Book of Revelations, .....), carrying out his punishments (Sodom & Gomorra), defending (The Arch Angel Michael is currently at war.

They'll march a little taller.The Meadowlark Sings tells a riveting story about gays and lesbians who grow up in a society in which homosexuality is the only orientation.After the Great California Earthquake of 2018, all men and women testing positive for the recently discovered gay gene are given the option of relocating from the United States to a newly formed island in the Pacific named Cali. Choosing to emigrate are seven senators, 14 members of the House of Representatives, 83 professional athletes, one justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, the wife of the attorney general, 1400 members of the entertainment industry, and millions of other citizens. The number of departing depletes the military forces and the National Football League is forced to cancel the season. The population of Cali continues to grow when the exile of infants testing positive for the gay gene is mandated in 2022. With strong social awareness and an elite group of citizens, Cali, the nation of gays and lesbians develops into an industrial and educational rival of the United States.In 2055, when Cara Romano, a member of the Cali cabinet is sent to a conference in the United States, as the first lesbian representative to visit her homeland, we journey with her. Spellbound, we watch as Cara enters a maze of mysteries that takes her to the white house and beyond.The Meadowlark Sings is a gripping story that combines sci-fi, fantasy, and gay pride as we race through 40 cliff-hanging chapters to get to the end.

This is a winner!"},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"When I started reading this book I was a little unsure of how far fetched the plot was. But I quickly fell in love with the characters and the whole idea of the book. So romantic, intense, I wanted to hurry up and finish to see what happened at the end, but at the same time was sad it was so short and would soon end. The meadowlark sings is one of my favorite books. Everyone I've lent it to has loved it, including my friend's mom; I've even given it as a gift."},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"Before I start, I LOVE the cover of this book. It is so well done.OK, well the story is an interesting one where gay people have formed their own country and live in a blissful society without discrimination. But, of course there are problems with every society and the problem with this one is that it's citizens have been forcefully taken from families in the US. (many that did not want to lose them) The story itself centers around the life of the lesbian representative who goes to America for meetings and promplty falls for a woman there (even though there are not supposed to be any more lesbians in the US.)This book was a very interesting read. Well written and sexy. My only complaint really is that it is too America oriented and does not find a way to allow for the fact that if America did kick all gays out of the country many would move overseas and not to an all-gay community. And even if they chose to move to the all-gay community they would surely strengthen their connections with other countries to supply the things that their community could not provide. Dealing with this problem would have provided an extra thread of reality that even SF books need.Having said that though, I did enjoy this book and think that it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"This book has everything. Mystery, romance, adventure, a little sci-fi/fantasy and more than a touch of possible reality. When you read the story you almost wish it could be true just for the triumph of the GLBT community. Sadly, there is some heartbreaking reality also. Well worth your time to read!!! Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"I have been singing the praises of this book since it came out. It delivers a crisply written story with twists and turns that keep you guessing. The Meadowlark Sings is a real gem."},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"This book really had a terrific plot basis, the general concept would have been really interesting, the only problem was that the writing was really terrible, the plot, characters and descriptions weren't fully fleshed out or developed and the whole thing fell flat."},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"The Meadowlark Sings is post apocalyptic book. Although in this case the apocalypse is that California broke off from the US with the ever anticipated major earthquake. I can't really remember any hot steamy sex.They've found a gene which indicates whether or not someone is straight or homosexual. The new island (old California) is opened as a new homosexuals only country. US citizens did not have to migrate, but if they chose to remain and were caught engaging in ANY homosexual activity (including just holding hands or kissing) they were arrested for an indeterminate amount of time.A new law was passed that all new born children were tested to see if they carried the gay gene. If so, by the age of 3 they had to be sent to the new gay country and were adopted into loving gay & lesbian homes. And anyone who did not carry the homosexual gene could not step foot in the new country. And there was no contact allowed between the people in the new country and the people in the US.The MC ends up traveling, as a visiting dignitary, to the US where she manages to fall in love with the President's daughter. One who doesn't have the gay gene! Yet, interestingly enough the President's daughter also falls in love with her too.While most of the story revolves around the MC, there is a second romantic love that plays out. One that doesn't detract from the main story. There are other emotional elements in this story. There is the heart-wrenching decision that had to be made, in the early days, by homosexual parents who had to choose between the person they love or remaining in the US to be with their children.There is also the heartbreak felt by parents who had to relinquish their homosexual children by the age of three to be given a new identity and sent to the new country. Parents and children who would never again know each other. Parents who have no idea whether or not their children are happy. Children who will never know who their biological parents were.While it's fantasy...it's realistically set up. I didn't see any possibility of a happy ending - for anyone. One of the very few books that made me cry real tears several times during the story. Of course...that's all I'm going to tell you. *evil laugh*Note - I only write reviews on books I loved."},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"The year is 2055. It's been almost fifty years since a new wave of conservative sentiment turned the tide of popular opinion against homosexuality in America. It's been almost forty years since the earthquake that split off a huge section of the California coast. It was over thirty years ago that the United States granted the new island to homosexuals to form a country of their own; the requirement that all babies born in the U.S. who test positive for the recently discovered gay gene be sent to Cali to live with their \\"own kind\\" keeps the population growing, and the new country has prospered. Contact between Cali and the U.S. has been limited almost exclusively to the relocation of homosexual children. When cabinet member Cara Romero is chosen to attend a conference in New York, she's excited to visit the land of her birth. She's not surprised to find how different things are in New York compared to the life she's used to back in Cali, but she never expected to fall in love on this overseas assignment. Certainly she never expected to fall in love with the daughter of the President of the United States . . .I enjoyed reading \\"The Meadowlark Sings.\\" I really did. Helen Ruth Schwartz has created a compelling, if improbable, vision of the future. I love fiction that introduces me to an imaginary society and allows me to get a feel for a different way of living, and \\"Meadowlark\\" accomplishes this very well. The plot is fast-paced and full of mystery and exciting twists. There isn't a single important character who isn't positively endearing - these are people you'll wish you could have as friends. The developing romance between Cara and Jessica is full of sensuous and tender moments.Why only two stars for a book I enjoyed? Unfortunately, the novel was fraught with so many truly regrettable flaws that I can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. For starters, the whole premise of this novel hinges upon the existence of the \\"gay gene\\" (which Schwartz has dubbed the \\"Scarpetti gene\\" after its fictitious discoverer). I don't believe sexual orientation is a choice (actually, I know for a fact that it's not). I believe it is (almost) entirely biologically determined. However, the idea that there's a single gene, or combination of genes, that makes a person gay is preposterous to anyone who understands genetics. The fact that not all identical twins share the same sexual orientation is evidence that other factors come into play. There are biological factors other than genetics that make us who we are, such as hormones and brain structure.But maybe I'm quibbling here. Maybe I'm letting my understanding of genetics and human development get in the way of a good story. More problematic to me than the oversimplification of the origins of sexual orientation in this novel was the oversimplification of sexual orientation in general. The very first sentence of the novel mentions a gay rights march, the purpose of which was \\"to demand equal rights and fair treatment for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in the United States.\\" This is the first and last time that bisexuality is mentioned outright in the novel. It's only so much as alluded to one other time, when Cara mentions in passing that a few children have been born in Cali, some of them as a result of intercourse. In this novel, all persons born with the Scarpetti gene are exclusively homosexual, and all persons born without it are exclusively heterosexual. There is no other option: no bisexuality, no asexuality, no pansexuality (in fact, the gender binary is utterly unquestioned), no crucial factors other than gender that contribute to attraction or arousal. Cara asks at one point whether it's possible for Jessica to be in love with her and yet not have the Scarpetti gene; the answer is an unequivocal no. Never mind that in the real world, sexual orientation is much more fluid. Having a \\"girl crush\\" is almost a rite of passage for young heterosexual women. I know I had a few! I've even engaged in some same-sex experimentation, as have many heterosexuals. On the other side, MOST of the homosexuals I've known have had some opposite-sex experience. People tend to experience some degree of sexual response to sexual situations, including those involving the \\"wrong\\" gender, a fact to which my existence, and the existence of other children of gay or lesbian parents, testifies as living proof.I know this novel was written with a gay audience in mind, but I couldn't help feeling that Schwartz really wasn't quite fair to heterosexuals. Surely there are a few of us who are artistic and creative - we'd miss our fabulous gay fashion designers if they were all exiled, but I don't think we're so hopeless on our own that we'd end up as frumpily dressed as the Americans in this novel. Furthermore, it's simply unfeasible that ANY group of people could take over an island full of rubble and within thirty years, despite minimal association with outsiders, establish a vital, thriving culture as advanced as any on earth. What really disturbed me, though, was the idea that heterosexual Americans would have gone along with all of this in the first place. It's clear Schwartz doesn't hate heterosexuals as a group, as there are a number of delightful and sympathetic characters in this novel who happen to be straight - but the premise just doesn't work. Some of the most ardent supporters of GLBT interests I know are 100% straight, but unwilling to see ANYONE deprived of civil rights. Where were they when the exile to Cali was going on? No matter how powerful the right-wing religious groups got to be, surely more than a few people would have stood up and protested the exile of their parents, children, siblings, and friends to an island, with any sort of travel or communication between the countries (except for government business) strictly forbidden. And with seven thousand children being sent to Cali every WEEK, is it reasonable to assume so many bereft mothers and fathers would simply accept the status quo?These flaws are so integral to the concept of this novel that I'm not entirely sure how it could have been redeemed. That's sad, because these delightful characters surely deserved better."},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"I not only received this item earlier then noted, but it was in perfect condition!

I am from California and as much as I didn't want to think that we will hit a snag in our social progress as being 'out' and that the community would once be ashamed of who they are (prior to the island development, around the year 2010 in the book) I found the book entertaining, thought provoking; coming up with a few questions of my own... like how did the inhabitants of Cali island survive those first years, where and how did they produce food from a savaged land that had been burned; what kind of industry did they develop and from what? The author mentions wood was scarce and a lot of their products were a plastic material... how did they develop the foundries to produce enough to sustain all the people; did they receive help from other peoples government from outside of the states?"},{"Title":"The Meadowlark Sings","review":"Uplifting, emotional, feel good book anytime an absolute Must read!

The set-up on this book is simple--in the first chapter, McBain tells us that two people are going die this day. From then on, character after character, and situation after situation, is introduced, and everytime you think, \\"ah-ha! here's the one that's going to die,\\" McBain pulls the rug out and disaster is averted. Or, when someone gets shot and you think, \\"no, this isn't the person to die, can't be,\\" well, you're wrong. There really isn't a mystery per se here, but there is a quite a bit of tension and surprise. Also, McBain kills off a repeating character in such an unexpected manner, showing you the difference between his series and those of other mystery writers. For other writers, the characters are king. Pick up any Nero Wolfe novel, and you know that Nero, Archie, Fritz, Saul and Inspector Cramer will be there. Not so with McBain. His character is the 87th Precinct, and no matter who the cops and villains are, it is the city and the precinct that will be there."},{"Title":"See Them Die","review":"\\"See Them Die\\" is pretty much why people read Ed McBain, a gripping, taut suspense yarn leavened by the odd moment of wit or insight to the human condition, and an array of characters, some recurring in other McBain novels, others here for only the one time.Forget mystery; as the title says we are to witness to a couple of killings. We don't know who, only that we are getting a God's-eye view of a city neighborhood one Sunday in July, as police surround a tenement building where a killer named Pepe Miranda is holed up. The usual gang of detectives from the 87th Precinct is here, less in evidence than usual except for the most bull-headed bull, bad apple Andy Parker.A big reason for McBain setting up the story so is to give us a close-up view of Isola's Hispanic community, who harbor mixed feelings about Miranda. Most see him as a killer, but many can't deny a certain sympathy for a fellow Latino up against the system. Given the novel was written in 1960, McBain demonstrates forward-thinking in addressing the problem of racism beyond the more obvious issue of blacks and whites. At times he comes off a little shrill as various Hispanic characters have assorted epiphanies about the wrongness of crime, but he individualizes the conflicts to each character and examines the difficulty of upholding community standards when you are perceived by some as part of the problem based on the color of your skin.McBain draws you long before the shootout itself, with an extended scene in a coffee shop with a group of disparate characters, including the bigoted Parker, a Hispanic detective named Frankie Hernandez, the shop's law-abiding owner, a sailor looking for a good time, a girl who might offer him considerably more, and a gang of aspiring street hoods, some of whom are more foul than others. Words always fly more excitingly than bullets in a McBain novel, and they do here:\\"This neighborhood ain't for clean-cut kids.\\"\\"Who's clean-cut?\\"\\"You're liable to be, if you don't take my advice. From ear to ear.\\"People take turns offending each other, offering opinions, and moving the novel's focus into many odd alleys that hardly help the central focus but give you that feeling, familiar to 87th Precinct readers, of being in a real city rather than turning the pages of a book.Like many early McBains, \\"See Them Die\\" has a simplistic plot, and there are odd bum notes here and there. The Hispanic characters all talk to each other in badly-accented English for some reason, and we learn that the police have come for Miranda with hand grenades and flamethrowers (!), an odd lapse for the world's leading police proceduralist to make. But like so many other of his books, you keep reading, and getting something unique on every page, an world-weary observation about society or nature or a bell-ringing insight into what makes a character tick. \\"See Them Die\\" makes for a solid addition to a terrific series."},{"Title":"See Them Die","review":"This is the thirtenth book I have read by EdMcBain and I think I have given all of them a five. He is a very good writer. This book is about so much. It is about Pepe Miranda, a hoodlum, who is holed up in a apartment and the police are trying to get him out. It is about Zip, a young man who so wants to be the leader of a gang but in the end finds that at least part of his gang is not more. It is about a very good policeman that is no longer with them. It is about a salior on leave and China, the girl he thinks is so pretty. It is about the people of that section and the hard life they live. The whole book takes place in part of one day in the lives of these people. The family of policeman of the 87th Preinct are involved, some good, some not so good. The book will hold your attention. You will feel like you are there and can related to some of these people. A good, short read."},{"Title":"See Them Die","review":"Total awesome police work book. Could not put it down.

And the important aspects of his stories are ageless --- people's ethos, motives, urges, actions. This story, while seemingly simple and brief is actually quite complex with sharp descriptions of how life in the American big city works out for different Puerto Ricans. The only somewhat odd thing about McBain's style in this particular book was how it appeared to be fashioned as a stage set --- i.e. it could be adapted easily as a play since all the action is set in just a few locations. I'm especially pleased to see that someone has realized the wisdom of re-publishing McBain's books since many of the 87th Precinct series have been difficult to find. Thank you for that.

Camille, the family matriarch, is a widow with seven children.Whether it's the disappointed Yvette, angry Raymond, righteous Anthony, naive Louis, uppity Marc, drunken Joseph or confused Grace-all of Camille's children bear the scars of Watts.As the story begins, it is 1984, nine years after the death of Camille's husband, T-Papa. Camille is fighting to maintain independence from her children and struggling with the poverty and crime she has watched engulf her neighborhood of over 30 years. Her children are busy living their lives of their own andhave all moved away from Watts except her oldest, Yvette. Camille's grandson, Nicholas, is fresh from his stay in prison for a crime that still haunts his grandmother.Camille is an excellent cook whose talents and desire to be financially secure lead her into various catering capers. She and her neighbor, Pep, a recovering alcoholic, hatch many schemes to sell Camille's home cooking.Over the course of the novel, we watch Camille struggle with her past and move past it. We see her grow more accepting of her children and herself. In return, Camille's forgiveness allows her to find love in the most unexpected places.Throughout the book, food remains a constant staple. Whether it's Camille's oyster po' boys, meat pies, red beans and rice, gumbo or pralines, by the end of the book, you will have worked up an appetite for some down home Louisianan cooking. The recipes sprinkled between chapters are an extra bonus!All of the characters in Crawfish Dreams are well written.

Reviewers"},{"Title":"Crawfish Dreams (unabridged audiocassettes)","review":"Good to the bone recipes, family ties, Louisiana folklore and the quest for elusive dreams are stirred up in this gumbo pot of a story in Nancy Rawles&#65533;s spirited sequel to Love Like Gumbo, Crawfish Dreams. In Love we saw Grace, the youngest daughter of Camille Broussard, go through her identity crises, sometimes racially and certainly gender wise. Now we have the matriarch Camille&#65533;s story, who at age sixty-seven feels her life slipping away from her. All she wants to do is to be able to get ahead just a little before she dies. Cleaning and cooking for the church was not the way she wanted to go out. Her specialty staples of meat pies and seafood gumbo are renowned and it is her desire to open a business and share with the world.The Broussards are just one of many families that migrated from Louisiana to Los Angeles pre and post WWII and brought their strait-laced Creole culture, mores, history and superstitions. Camille&#65533;s seven children are her heart and the bane of her existence. Marc, a card carrying member of the black bourgeoisie; Yvette, the sexually frustrated oldest daughter who is married to Juge, an older man in ill health; Grace, the lesbian in therapy, who has been in community college for seven years; Raymond, whose loss of his longshoreman&#65533;s job causes him to wallow in self-pity; Joseph, the Vietnam vet who is an alcoholic living on the streets and Anthony, who has inherited the cabinet making business from T-Papa Broussard, are just some of the colorful personalities. And then there is Nicolas, her nineteen-year old grandson who has just been released from prison and has brought shame to the family. But they all have the same idea, get Mama out of Watts. It is 1984 going into 1985, twenty years after the L.A. Riots. There are those who stayed and those who fled for greener pastures, including many of the Creole families that have lived there since the 30s. But Camille, a widow for nine years, hangs on to the good old days, before the Riots, when families where intact, everyone worked hard, went to Mass together and had big parties with lots of Creole food.Camille tries a number of enterprises, sells her famous meat pies to church events and festivals, bottles her famous Creole hot sauce, packages pralines, and even concocts a apricot brandy sauce with her neighbor Pep. Then she hits on an idea to open a restaurant, Camille&#65533;s Creole Kitchen, but she is not one to bother with details like licenses and zoning issues; she just knows her stuff is good. Her kids think she is taking on too much at her age and who would come to the middle of Watts to dine anyway? Meanwhile the Broussards are struggling to understand the past while painting pretty pictures of family harmony to the public but not knowing how to reach out to poor, mentally disturbed Joseph and newly-released Nicolas. Camille feels it is her place to teach her family to love unconditionally and not give up on their dreams.There are recipes sprinkled through the books such as Miss Camille&#65533;s Meat Pies and her grandmother&#65533;s dark pralines. Camille is happy when cooking and the food is a metaphor for the themes of her life. Ms. Rawles beautifully weaves symbolic language corresponding with the seasons of nature as well as the seasons of Camille&#65533;s life. She also details how the issue of class and color are played out in Creole families struggling to either assimilate or not assimilate into mainstream African American life.

If you don't like to read thick tomes, then this is for you. I was expecting a book with a cd, but the book is actually the Readiness review for 70-29. Everything is on the CD. It is a audio/video/text training kit for SQL. I really didn't know what to expect when I purchased it. It is a hands-held approach to SQL 7.0 Design. The MS Press Interactive training. It has lesson plans, little quizes for each lesson and you can read along as the pleasant voices tell you the lesson. It allows to do hands-on during the lessons. I like it.I think it is good supplement to the SQL 7.0 Design training kit that comes with the SQL 7.0 eval. You need to install and get some real hands-on still. The On-line recommends at least 1 year of relational db exp in order to fully benefit the lessons. I doubt that the people who purchase these books really have any exp (like myself) Only bad thing is the price. I don't really like the readiness review books. So, for a cd seems a bit pricey with the readiness book. And No SQL eval software. Marketing gimmick I don't like.The Online was a nice review from SQL 70-29 design training kit. I learn much better when I can see, hear, and read at the same time. However, it is an OVERVIEW of the test subjects. Not a Manual how to pass the test. I don't think any of the training kits were ever meant to be that way. I passed 70-28 sql admin using training kit, hands-on, BOL (this is the best resource for SQL) and Transcenders. 900/1000.

If you're new to databases, read a general database-design book (such as Database Design for Mere Mortals by Hernandez) before using this training kit. Hands-on practice with SQL 7 is necessary as well.The simulations on the CD are a great concept, but some are too easy. In many exercises, you are loading pre-written scripts.

Admittedly they are long, through, and have wonderful cover at. But the content is what disturbs me. Not the entire content, but just three things.The first snag is that Cannon does not like Reagan. He clearly admits this in-in his footnotes:\\"It was the only time Reagan ever complimented me on anything I write.\\" (Governor, 311n)This quote sums up the books main negative bias. This book is a history of Reagan as filtered through Cannon's philosophical grid. This makes for a tedious read. He takes Reagan on Lou Cannon's terms. Maybe that is why Cannon had a weekly column that included \\"Reaganisms,\\" (President, 102n).Cannon is, however, fascinated by him. He freely admits this in the 1991 preface to President Reagan. This provides a positive bias, which saves the book from being a multi-volume hit piece.The second snag, is the books are almost all context. It is always \\"Reagan And\\": Reagan and Unruh, Reagan and Meese, Reagan and Reagan, and Reagan and Nancy. But we never see Reagan as an individual.The Gipper's tag-line is the Great Communicator, but Cannon rarely quotes him. This sucks the life out of the Regan magic. Read Michael Reagan's quote book on his father and then read this book. It is like seeing two different men. One is a lively and deep thinker; the other is a vague buffoon. But will the real Ronald Regan please stand up?Reagan also had a gift for humor. Peggy Noonan observed that Reagan had \\"an encyclopedic memory for jokes.\\" (When Character Was King, 228). However, Cannon, in his chapter on Reagan's humor, talks about his humor in the abstract and recounts his juicier ethnic jokes (President, 101-102).The last snag is in the area of analogy. The second book is subtitled \\"The role of a Lifetime.\\" His rhetorical device is to cast Reagan merely as an actor who gets the chance to play a president. This is a combination of \\"I'm not a president, but I play one on TV\\" and the plot to the film \\"Dave.\\"Hover, this rhetorical device affects his logic. David Hackett Fischer calls this \\"the fallacy of insidious analogy\\" (\\"Historians' Fallacies,\\" 244ff). The problem is that Cannon's analogy takes over his writing. It also become contradictory at times.For example, Chapter six of the presidential book discuses what Canon calls \\"the script.\\" What he means by the script is the core philosophical ideas that Reagan had that attracted the voters. Cannon freely admits, \\"But it was the script that was compelling, and it was Reagan who wrote it.\\" (President, 66). Then in later chapters he speaks of Reagan taking direction and needing a director (President, Chapter 10, p. 25, 32, 116, ).Cannon may misunderstand the necessity of delegation. The role of the president is to be the leader. That is, he articulates the vision, and then empowers his staff and cabinet to implement the vision. That is why he said, \\"\\"Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority and don't interfere as long as the policy you've decided is carried out.\\" (President, 150). Ill timed or not, it is not only sound advice, it is the only way to run a country. A micromanager could not last three second as president.To be sure, Reagan may not have done follow-up as well as he should have, but he did understand the genius of individual people. He was not just remaking country, but truing everyone into demi-gods by empowering them.I think I have said enough, but there is one comment that just grates me. In Chapter 9 of the president book, Canon describes the rise and fall of the M/X missile. During one Cabinet meeting, Regan showed up with a cartoon of Uncle Sam playing as hell-game with Brezhnev. This clinched the issue for Reagan. (President, 138). Cannon conclude the chapter saying that Reagan was a \\"president who skimped on preparation, avoided complexities and news conferences, and depended far too heavily on anecdotes, charts, graphics, and cartoons.\\" (President, 140)Cannon forgets that Reagan had an intuitive sense of people, and was able to connect without the use of the Cabinet and Bureaucracy (President, 119). One obvious was he did that was by listening to them. Another way was attuning himself to the humor. Cannon forgets the power of humor and that George burns said, \\"Truth is the basis of all good comedy.\\"(Governor, 107). That one political cartoon illustrated a truth that would do honor to Socrates or Kierkegaard. For Cannon, the medium was the message. End of story.The gubernatorial book is the better book. Cannon does not feel the need to cover as much as he does in the Presidential book (Some of the material is redundant). The Presidential one has long chapters that sometimes get muddled. Chapter 8 covers Reagan's humor and thought patterns, and Chapter 11 covers Regan's early life-kind of late in the book for that. Also, Hinckley isn't mentioned by name in the narrative about the assassination, which is covered in half a paragraph, and then resumed in the narrative about the melt-down of Alex Haige.What would have helped this book? First of all, Cannon needs to sort out what he really thinks about Reagan. He is fascinated and even at times charmed by Reagan. But it is a love-hate relationship. Cannon disagrees with Reagan politically and philosophically. It is almost like Canon is afraid of Regan and feels the need to cut him down a notch.Canon makes the comment that Reagan may have never read E. B. White (President, 97). I suggest the same for Cannon: Remember Strunk and White's first rule of Composition: Place Yourself in the background (Strunk and White, 70).Secondly, \\"Check your premises.\\" Figure out why you have this attraction to reign, and name concretes. Both were Irish and had Alcoholic fathers (President, 174n), but there is something deeper."},{"Title":"Ronald Reagan: A Life In Politics","review":"I did read the whole book just so I could comment on it. The part about him being docile when visiting his parents home made me throw up. But I persevered and read the rest of it. I just don't understand why the President and Nancy let this book happen.

Thoroddsen. All have studied various phenomena of drop interactions: Prosperetti-sound emission on drop impact with liquids, Rein-general drop impact phenomena, Lesser-compressible impact, Oguz-numerical algorithms to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and Thoroddsen-further studies of layer impact. Some papers are in great detail such as Lesser's which is the longest of those involved and others are short notes on new studies.My interest lies in the numerical approaches for the solutions of the fluid dynamical equations of drop impact. In this regard the later papers especially those of Prosperetti and Oguz, especially, deal with new material clearing up much of the confusion in the plethora of numerical techniques available nowadays.Note that this book is not a text and is not written in this way, do not expect any such format since all are papers. In other words if you want a general introduction then a couple of papers will concern you but most are very deep analyses of the various phenomena involved, the full research of which is voluminous to say the least. My own PhD review covers most of these areas and itself feels like a book.The weakest area is still the numerical approaches which because of the various physical scales involve and the presence opf strong discontinuities provides a very challenging mathematical problem indeed, a good deal of which has not been satisfactorily resolved.A book worth getting for a researcher in the field or a PhD student."},{"Title":"Global Critical Race Feminism: An International Reader (Critical America)","review":"Although Global Critical Race Feminism is a rich reference work useful in the creation of scholarship, it is also a must for anyone interested in social justice.

Matthews is a very good reproduction by Kessinger Publishing. Most reprints like this are crap, but this particular version must have had a very good original to copy. Anyway back to the content. This book covers the full spectrum of military sabotage from operational capability as a force multiplier and manipulation of tactical to strategic outcomes; and psychological affects on the populace. As well the various sabotage methods (tactics, techniques and procedures) are discussed from arson to explosives. Obviously some of the material is dated but still relevant. One of the major themes/topics in this book is the vulnerability of the United States from saboteurs. In 1941 the U.S. military was concerned that America did not have the capability to deal with such attacks and situations. It is funny to note, close to 60-years later, the United States still can not cope with continental terrorist attacks, even with ten years under the belt fighting the Global War on Terror. Overall this is a very solid book for the layman and professional military student of special warfare and unconventional warfare.

By studying patterns in the ETS answer choices and question sequences, Princeton Review came up with what it calls the Joe Blog approach. At its core, Joe Blog says that on easy questions, go for the obvious answer that Joe Blog (a hypothetical Joe-Average) would guess; on the hard ones, avoid the \\"obvious answers, because they are \\"tricks\\" to fool Joe Blog.If you have a shot at 1350 or above this may not be the ideal approach. But for most other people, it could add some hard-fought points. Even for top scorers, the Joe Blog techniques could add points by increasing the odds of successfully making educated guesses on the toughest questions. Moreover, the Princeton Review writers do provide excellent practice beyond the Joe Blog approach. They seem to have studied the content of the test better than most authors, particularly Barrons. If there is one flaw, it is that the explanations to the practice questions need a lot of work.While not perfectfor everyone, this book is still an important and helpful resource.

Merely this plus referring back to the passage is supposed to let the test taker answer all of the questions asked. If you haven't noticed already, this is the dumbest strategy to ever use for a critical reading section and i believe that those who are faithful to this book would be misled. Much of the book is devoted to \\"educated guessing\\" and how an answer can be correctly chosen through signs given by the testmakers, even the math questions. An inane example of this was when i read about how \\"simple\\" words are usually correct in the easy portion of the sentence completions while \\"hard\\" words are usually correct in the more difficult section of the test. What about the strategy this strategy: \\"If you're completely clueless, skip it. Hard questions are worth the same amount of points as the easy ones.\\"? The book even uses \\"Joe Blogg\\", an imaginary character, devoted to teaching its readers to guess. Yet, the educated guessing strategies only work on the problems that were formed by the author of this book, and is very likely to fail in the real SAT.My recommendation is to, if you are to buy this book, question every strategy it teaches, but get the most out of the practice tests and verbal/math lessons given in this book. I believe that if i were to blindly follow this book, i would receive retrograde scores."},{"Title":"Cracking the NEW SAT with Sample Tests on CD-ROM, 2005 Edition (College Test Prep)","review":"I do not think it would be fair of me to review this as my son didn't even bother to use it."},{"Title":"Cracking the NEW SAT with Sample Tests on CD-ROM, 2005 Edition (College Test Prep)","review":"This has got to be the worst SAT prep book I have gone through.

Historical Fiction: Reading Lists for Every Taste","review":"This is a book of lists. Specifically it breaks historical fiction into five broad categories with from 8 to 18 lists within the category broken down by sub-category. Some of the categories cover subjects that are clearly indicated by their name - Greatest War Stories. Some take a bit more explanation - Brilliant Facsimile. (These are fictional biographies of historical figures that are written in the format of a real biography.)The book is published by the American Library Association and it carries an interesting copyright notice. After the standard you can't reproduce, etc. it says: 'An exception is made for nonprofit materials used for educational purposes within the organization.'But later it says that libraries 'might post [the booklists] on web sites, place in newsletters, or use in handouts to patrons.'

(He was the first one to hold her -- sitting in the rocking chair -- when she and Mommy came home from the hospital.)

The new baby shows up at the very end of this story, so admittedly, that is not the main focus of this book. (The book might be better titled, \\"The Berenstain Bears' New Bed\\".)

To those who expect more, get another book... this one was written in the early 80s, when such things were as openly discussed as they are now. Most fathers didnt go into the delivery room at the time. Besides, they're BEARS not people. Also, to the people who find the gender-role things askew, come on... again, this was not written in this decade... yes it is dated, but I personally don't WANT my kids reading a whole lot of details on the process. Last, some complain that the child would have to be stupid to not notice mama's changing shape... not necessarily. A very small child would only notice such a thing when it effects them (hence mama's lap getting too small)."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears' New Baby","review":"I bought this book for my two year old, who is about to become a big brother. I also got him \\"I'm a Big Brother\\" by Joanna Cole, which is also good and prepares the child better for what it's going to be like to be a big sibling. The reason I got him the Berenstain Bears book is that the plot of the book is that the older brother gets a new bed in order to give his old bed away to his little sibling. My son is about to move to a toddler bed in order to give the crib to the new baby. I thought this might help with the transition.I just got the book, so I haven't read it to him yet, so I can't speak to whether he likes it. I understand some of the other reviewers' concerns that the baby just appears (and seems to be about a year old) while the dad and boy are out chopping wood. I think there are books that address the reality of birth (e.g. mom going into the hospital for a couple of days) better than this book, but I also think there's value in this book. However, my primary concern is that at the end of the book, when the older brother meets the new baby, she punches him in the nose! The last page of the book says that the next day, his nose was sore. What? Why would I want to give my kid that idea about his new baby sister or brother? How is that a positive way of preparing your kid for being a big brother or sister? His whole life is about to change, which is scary enough, but now your baby sister or brother is going to punch you? I'll change the ending (his baby sister is touching his nose, or blowing him a kiss, or whatever), but I think it's a terrible way to end a book about something that you're trying to put a positive spin on (having a new baby in your house)."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears' New Baby","review":"This is my first time reviewing a book on Amazon.

One of the reviewers even asked \\"What universe is this book from?\\" Yes, this book is written in another universe: it's written in a universe where bears wear overalls and moo moos!

It's not one I would recommend to any other expectant family -- you can really tell it was written in the early 1970s, its description of the birth of a new baby is so strangely indirect (the pregnancy is discussed very little -- the focus of the story is mainly on building a new bed for the older sibling!) My son also found it upsetting that the son and father in the book go off for the day, and return home to find that, surprise, the baby has been born while they were gone -- he said, \\"Didn't the mommy go to the hospital? Didn't the daddy help her? Was she all by herself?\\" Not the best choice for your older sibling-to-be -- we recommend Joanna Cole's books I'm a Big Brother and I'm a Big Sister instead."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears' New Baby","review":"This is a spoiler, but. . .The little boy bear realizes his bed is too small.

Then one or two pages later the book is over.We were given this book to help our daughter as we prepare for a new baby. Foolishly, I read it aloud to her before I read it myself. I was horrified.

There's no discussion in the book about how a baby might affect your life, either for good or bad.This is not how most people raise children today, I think, nor is it the best way to raise children. Additionally, nowadays it's generally advised that if you're going to hand down the old crib that you dismantle it well before the baby arrives so that your older child doesn't feel directly displaced.I don't think this book is going to be very useful to anybody expecting a second child.Incidentally, how much older than Sister is Brother bear?

This is easily the most offensive kids book in print today! There are so many things wrong with it, one doesn't know where to start.1.) Presumably, the mother bear has been pregnant for some months (as anthropomorphic bears, maybe nine months?), yet this little boy bear hasn't somehow noticed his mother's growing stomach at all. He just notices that HE is now too big for his bed. Is the child stupid? This just is NOT possible. Even the dumbest child would be keenly aware of the changing shape of mommy.2.) Apparently, pregnancy, labor and even delivery are the sole responsibility of women. The father bear and the son just somehow amble off into the woods \\"when the time comes.\\" So...men are apparently useless and unwanted in such circumstances, and, birthing is strictly women's work. Hey, everyone can be offended. We're all winners!3.) Also, for today's readers/families the gender-based division of labor is a bit much. Even on the morning of the blessed event, the mother makes breakfast and the two males head off to the woods with an axe to chop things down, and then use a variety of tools to make a bed \\"just in time.\\"4.) It also sends the puzzling message that it's okay to keep children in the dark about major life events...things they need to know about well in advance.

He learns a lot about the wolves and how they live and love him.Mowatt tells in the story how the wolves communicate to each other and hunt together. Mowatt does a lot of research on the way wolves live. Mowatt explains all the details in the story, such as when the wolves leave to hunt and what they are hunting.

In this case, Canada and its rather confused manner of dealing with the problem of wolves \\"killing\\" caribou. Sending a lone naturalist out to investigate the problem without the mere suggestion of a plan and then losing him to the wilds, Mowat's tale starts as a farce, but as time goes on, the author shifts his focus to the true heart of the book, the life of a family of wolves and his eventual understanding of their place in the natural order. Working alongside local Inuits, he sees the wolves for what they are, not murderous predators, but feeling and affectionate animals. His research into how the wolves actually survive in the winter is hilarious and insightful. The book does suffer a bit from the superior attitude the author adapts at times, but NEVER CRY WOLF is another example of informative and entertaining writing about an aspect of the natural world."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is, to me, the best of Mowat's writing so far.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"\\"Never Cry Wolf\\" by Farley Mowat is touching, instructive and laugh out loud funny. The book is based on Mowat's study of wolves and caribou for two summers and a winter in Canada's subarctic regions in the late 1940s. Employed as a biologist with the federal government of Canada he was asked to confirm that the wolves were a threat to man and were decimating the caribou herds. What he found instead is that wolves do not pose a threat to other species and are neither a danger or a real competitor with man. Wolves serve a vital role in maintaining the long term well-being of a species as they eat only the sick, aged and weak. Mowat says a pack of wolves is far less destructive than a single man with a gun.Mowat enthralling accounts show that wolves are a courageous family of skillful providers and devoted protectors of their young. The people who monitor and work with the recently introduced wolf packs in Yellowstone confirmed Mowat findings and have a similar reverence and awe.My first reading of \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" in the early 80s changed the way I view wolves. They don't kill for fun, kill more than they can use and are a necessary and natural part of a healthy ecosystem.Mowat fears that the ongoing onslaught of bounty hunters and government exterminators will erase the wolf communities from the Arctic. He warns in his 1993 book preface, \\"We have doomed the wolf not for what it is, but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be - the mythologized epitome of a savage, ruthless killer - which is, in reality, no more than the reflected image of ourself.\\""},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat's 'Never Cry Wolf' is a funny book composed of descriptive, smooth storyline that details Mowat's year living among the Artic wolves and northern Inuits. I would reccommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I ordered this book so I could read it a second time. I enjoyed it almost as much as the first time. I like all of Farley Mowat's writing and stories of Eskimo life."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I gave Never Cry Wolf 5 stars beacuse it gave you an intimate relationship with wolves, not their blood thirsty myth. The wolf is not a blood thirsty kill everything in sight lone working creatures, but great parents, are wily, curios, clever,and intielligent. Another aspect I enjoyed about the book is it's portrayl with the wolves. The eskimos respect and will never harm wolves, and some may even be able to communicate with wolves. You will also enjoy Farley Mowats re-lived adventure. 'Never Cry Wolf' is a great book and you will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"NEVER CRY WOLF is Farley Mowat's first-person reminiscence of his time spent studying wolves in the Canadian arctic. NEVER CRY WOLF, first published in 1963, was one of the earliest, most widely-read, and most effective conservation narratives ever penned. It's Russian edition (the title of which, literally translated back into English, is WOLVES, PLEASE DON'T CRY) was responsible for a Soviet ban on wolf hunting that spared the animals in their natural habitat and gained Mr. Mowat a notorious reputation at the U.S. State Department, which banned his subsequent entry into the United States.NEVER CRY WOLF has been attacked as being more fable than fact, and this may be true. Mowat has often said that he prefers not to let facts get in the way of the truth, and there is no question that he wanted his readers to come to love these generally benighted creatures. If one doubts the low esteem in which wolves are held one only needs to consider representative northern European fairy tales: Peter and the Wolf, Little Red Riding Hood, and others present the wolf as a four-legged homicidal maniac. Unfortunately, this agelong prejudice has nearly exterminated the wolf in most of its range, courtesy of a certain two-legged homicidal maniac. Like our primordial fear of the dark, and the very common terror of cats, lukophobia derives from the lost years of the cave.Mowat tells a good story. As a young Game Warden he is sent to remote northermost Canada to evaluate the effect of wolf depredations on the caribou herds. What he finds is that the wolves eat only sick, aged, or weak caribou, thus contributing to natural selection (while human beings are actively destroying whole herds of caribou). He finds that the usual wolf diet is skinks, voles and mice (he claims to have tried mouse as a meal and includes a recipe for Souris a la Creme in the book). He finds that the wolves are a natural part of the ecosystem, and that a pack of wolves together is far less destructive than even a single human being with a rifle.Mowat tells us of observing a wolf family at close range, the members of which he names \\"George\\", \\"Angeline,\\" and \\"Uncle Albert.\\" Together with a litter of pups, these three become the center of Mowat's tale. He credits them with all sorts of anthropomorphisms including dramatic abilities to communicate amongst themselves and with other wolves, and gives each a strikingly distinct personality. He respects George and he likes the clownish Uncle Albert, but he is simply head-over-heels in love with Angeline, over whom he waxes almost as rhapsodic as if she were a human female.Lupinologists dismiss most of Mowat's observations as purely imaginative. Whether Mowat tosses away his credibility or makes his point more powerfully by ascribing so many fine human virtues to these creatures (they are nothing short of poster-wolves for 'family values') is dependent upon the reader and his or her mindset toward the natural world.For this reviewer, who is tired of the slow, careless and sometimes intentional destruction of our natural environment, and who is convinced that our Earth is striking back against the imbalances we've created by generating warming seas, melting icecaps, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, and all sorts of other phenomena, it does not seem at all a bad idea for us to humanize the wolf if by so humanizing him we will be more inclined to save him. And the same goes for the rest of the planet."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I picked this book up recently for the first time since high-school, some 15-plus (!) years ago. Maybe it was Steve Irwin's death, or a viewing of the documentary Grizzly Man, that got me to thinking about it- either way, I'm glad I did. I'd forgotten what a wacky character Farley Mowat was, and how much more there is to this quick read than dry scientific reporting.Mowat's communing with the wolves (circa 1950) was partially borne of pure, scientific curiosity; in his own words, he \\"took the word biology- which means the study of life- at its face value,\\" and sought to immerse himself outdoors and away from an aseptic laboratory. The other thing engendering his research was the vagary of the Canadian government, which set him to studying wolves in Ottawa with a throw of the dice (not to mention next to no itinerary, instructions, or training).Mowat dispelled major myths of wolf as bloodthirsty, marauding monsters, and showed them to be gentle, caring, and family-oriented (in fact, mostly monogamous) creatures. He never felt threatened by his lupine companions, despite keeping quarters very close to- and at one point, entering- the den. He witnessed \\"George, Angeline, and Uncle Albert\\" engage in compassionate acts like nurturing and training young pups and serving as hosts for traveling packs of non-native wolves. The chapter at the narrative's end (\\"To Kill A Wolf\\") describing the indiscriminate and government-promoted wolf hunting practices is made sadder by the way the wolves have by then won the reader's heart.What made this nature tale really shine, however, was Mowat's plucky attitude and unconventional scientific methodology. He alternately horrified Eskimo locals and won them over with alcohol. He pretty much ignored what little government protocol he had to follow until nearly the end of his trip, cramming in his duties like a high-schooler churning out a last-minute term paper. He learned to sleep via a nightly succession of 5-10 minute \\"wolf-naps\\" (and told of later ticking off a female companion understandably unused to the practice). And the- ahem- frosting on the cake was his approach to scientifically determine whether or not large mammals could sustain themselves on a diet of mice alone, after discovering over time that rodents constituted the majority of the wolves' diet: he ate nothing but the same, for months on end. God bless unorthodox scientific discoveries, and the lovable nut jobs that make them."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I can't believe all the reviewers gushing about this book. It is propaganda, propaganda for a good cause. But, like all propaganda, it is not bound by truth or even by facts.Mowat has never tried to refute the claims, well-documented claims, that he never did the research and never spent the time with the wolves that he describes in this book. He is telling people what he thinks they need to hear so as to protect the wolves. Well, I would like to see wolves protected also. But real wolves, not the wolf-clowns that he invented for this book.Real wolf researchers, see Mech among others, were never convinced that Mowat was saying anything real about wolves. They liked the impact the book had on the public consciousness but they knew nonsense when they saw it.Real-world wolves were not the cause of the caribou population decline, as the Canadian government seems to have believed. But they do hunt caribou. They tend to hunt the largest prey available. Not to the exclusion of other prey but that seems to be their preference. In Wood Buffalo National Park up in Canada, they hunt bison. Where moose are available, they don't hunt elk as much. When any of the big ungulates are available, they tend to leave whitetail deer or mule deer alone, except fot the occasional kill of opportunity. Somewhere, sometime, a wolf killed and ate mice. But they don't make a habit of it.Ths sad thing is that this book was written for a wonderful reason and helped wean people from one false picture of wolves. However, it spread a different false picture of wolves and needs to be shown for what it is. Of course, the book is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a neat fictional book to kill some time."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat is what every scientist should be; dry, sarcastic, clinical, hilarious, and not afraid to eat mice. The biologist who spent two years in the Arctic wild won me over with his warm descriptions of the wolf family he watches (George, Angelina, and Uncle Albert). Brilliantly funny and informative!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Though Mowat's experience with wolves occurred over 30 years ago, it managed to captivate my interest and provide me additional insight to a species I am very concerned about. As a short novel, I wasn't sure whether Mowat intended his narrative to be that of a scientific account or a &quot;coming to terms&quot; with the human/wolf spiritual experience. Either way, it was in parts both vastly entertaining as well as intellectually well-grounded and thoughtful. Anyone concerned about the constant perpetuation of negative myths about wolves in our or any culture should read as much as possible about wolves in order to begin to understand where society has wronged such an intelligent, special animal. Mowat's book is an excellent source of information for the conservationist seeking a view into the lives of an artic wolf family, as well as for the reader who may have no idea how unfairly ostracized this species has been--30 years ago or not, the concepts of human encroachment, unfounded hatred and unjustified blame are alive today, as is human's preoccupation with pest control in the name of profits."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"My problem with Farley Mowat's (non-autobiographical) books is that they play extremely loose with the facts and the persons described, and in some cases just lie. In the case of Never Cry Wolf, Mowat plagiarizes substantially. Mowat's misinformation undercuts the credibility of real scientists at a time scientists are routinely disregarded by our policy makers, reinforces the public misconception that researchers find only what they want to find, and misleads people badly about the true nature of wolves and our environmental issues.The basic plot of Never Cry Wolf is of Mowat as a young field biologist during summers in Canada who had to fight incompetent, unsympathetic bureaucratic supervisors whose only interest was in finding excuses to kill wolves. Mowat claims he discovered that the wolves ate mainly mice, not endangering the caribou, deer or other large prey species, but that the bureaucracy fought to suppress these findings.In fact, Mowat's field experience was nothing like what he describes in Never Cry Wolf, and far less extensive or valuable. Mowat has never published any scientific reports supporting his claims. The head of his scientific field project was Doug Pimlott, one of the top wolf scientists in North America, and a man with enormous integrity, sympathy for, and understanding of wolves. The actual facts of Mowat's very limited field experience have been described in several scientific journals. Folks interested in the true story should search out the reviews of Never Cry Wolf published by Pimlott in the Journal of Wildlife Management 30:236-37 (1966) and Banfield, A.W.F. in the Can. Field Naturalist 78:52-52 (1964).Even more troubling is Mowat's apparent plagiarism. In Never Cry Wolf, Mowat describes at considerable length play among various members of a wolf pack he observed. Except he did not observe this. This section seems to be lifted pretty intact from Adolph Murie's classic field study of wolves in Alaska - The Wolves of Mount McKinley (U.S. Natl Park Service, Fauna Ser No. 5, 1944).As to Mowat's claim that the wolves in his study ate mainly mice, this is ridiculous. The wolves in the area he allegedly studied live primarily off large prey such as deer, caribou and moose, with beaver probably being the smallest prey eaten routinely. The wolf's diet is discussed authoritatively in the recent monograph Wolves, Behavior, Ecology and Conservation (ed. L. David Mech and Luigi Boitani, Univ. of Chicago Press, 2003). The chapter on diet (p.104) begins:\\"From the best-selling book and popular movie, Never Cry Wolf?millions of people gained the impression that wolves eat mice, rarely caribou. Author Farley Mowat later admitted fabricating much of the story (Goddard 1996), originally billed as true, to gain public sympathy for the wolf. Mowat succeeded enormously, and decades later the misconception remains.\\" (Goddard = A Real Whopper, Saturday Night III:(4), 46-50, 52, 54, 64.)What saddens me is that there are so many other, better books about wolves. A superb book that explores brilliantly human's complex interaction scientifically, culturally, and historical with wolves and is exceptionally well written, I recommend Barry Lopez's Of Wolves and Men. Lopez, an extraordinarily eloquent writer, approaches his subject with both a sophisticated grasp of the science of wolves as well as a sensitive, accurate and very insightful understanding of other cultural ways of understanding wolves, their environment and their interaction with humans.Any books by L. David Mech or John Theberge would be a much better use of one's time reading about wolves."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The first time I saw,Never Cry Wolf, I thought I would not enjoy reading it. First, because it was an assigned literary book to read: secondly, it was not a book I would normally select to read. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this book, and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.Farley Mowat, the author, has an incredible vocabulary that he uses to tell the story. But, while he may use some scientific or big words it doesn't distract the reader too much. In his writing, Mowat has a lovable quality, sarcasm. This trait makes the book fun to read and easily relatable to real life and people.Mowat takes the reader to the world of the Arctic Wolves in the Canadian wilderness. The narrator, a biologist, is sent by the government to explore the life of the wolf, and, more specifically, to find out more information on how the wolf is interacting with the other species of life. What the narrator learns through his study changes his views on the wolf and on the world. He realizes that things aren't always as they seem, and facts are not always simple to understand."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and kept the reader thinking. I was continually wondering how many other things we, as a society, might have misconceptions about. I loved the style of writing. I could have read the book in one setting. It was funny, egotistical yet humble, and kept me enthralled. After reading Farley Mowat's story, I was ready to head out and live on the Alaskan tundra with wolves and eskimos. Who doesn't need a break from the world once in a while? Luckily, I was able to mentally visit the wolves and enjoy the comfort of my recliner at the same time. It was like Discovery Channel, only the narrator was hilarious.

A wonderful read if you're an animal lover, or if you simply love to read.This book was the deciding factor in my decision to choose a career in wildlife biology and conservation."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"It was a long way from the catfish-in-granny's toilet incident to observing \\"Canis Lupus\\" in the Keewatin Barrens.

A week or two later he finds himself, a mountain of gear, and half of a collapsible canvas canoe on a frozen lake about three hundred miles to the Northwest of Churchill.... and so begins Mr. Mowat's adventures with Wolf A and his family (more commonly known as George, Angeline, Uncle Albert, and the pups) in Northern Canada.To those of you who found this book boring: You have no sense of humor at all!To those of you who did not understand why the first chapter was there: It was there because it was a prologue. That means that it gives you background. In this case it's a humorous chapter about how Mowat became involved with animals.This book is hilarious, but it made me cry too!I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!

I am satisfied about my order."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf, by Farley Mowat, is the amazing true story of his encounters and lessons learned after living with arctic wolves in very close contact. In this story he studies the wolves day and night by learning to take \\"wolf naps\\". They are short, 5-15 minute naps periodically throughout the day in place of a full nights rest. He uncovers secrets about wolves that our society has long been taught incorrectly. Mowat not only tells, but carefully explains, the truth about how wolves are gentle, loving, family-oriented animals. Mowat described scenes where three of the adult wolves he was studying would nurture and care for their pups just as humans do for a child. The wolves would train the pups in safety, survival, and even to have manners with eachother. This was almost unimaginable to me as a reader because of how movies depict these animals to be. I found myself wondering what other things our society is misunderstood about.When I first began reading the story, the language and writing style really caught me off guard and I had a very difficult time trying to comprehend the scenes. As the story continued though, his journey tended to get so interesting that I had trouble putting the book down at night! I could feel the nervousness on his voice, the sweat beating down his neck, and the happiness in his heart at every moment. This book has truly changed me completely. It has changed my thoughts about my future career and influenced me to do something that I would really enjoy waking up to each day.I would most definitely recommend this book, but to ages 16+ due to the high level of writing and complicated style. It is appropriate to both males and females and anyone who enjoys nature or has a love for animals should read this book. Never Cry Wolf would be awarded a 4.5/5 stars!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I think this is the best book on wolves I have read to date (well, maybe \\"Return of the Wolf\\" was better). It brings you into both the world of these beautiful, and once misunderstood creatures, as well as reminding you of the chilly fact that at one time wolves were considered dangerous to human beings--it's more the other way around, is what the writer found. And the story told in this book is a great one: a human being discovering the enviroment is a dimension to life few of us in cities connect with outside of books and film anymore."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I had to read this book in school. I hate to read never had. Most books you read in school aren't that good but this book is different. If you like Dogs, Wolfs or any kind of animals you will love this book! Get it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"\\"Never Cry Wolf\\" by Farley Mowat is an excellent and succinct telling of the author's expedition into the barren northlands of Canada during the late 1940's. Although the book was published in the early 1960's, the writing comes off quite fresh with vivid and moving descriptions of the often misunderstood wolf population of Northern Canada.Mowat's book is at once a personal piece describing how he was moved by the observation of a particular family of wolves and a work of field research regarding the wolf-caribou relationship in Canada's wild barren lands. His book strikes a great balance between the two as he mixes elements of field biology and personal memoir to create a highly readable book.Mowat's writing is extremely sympathetic to the plight of the arctic wolf; some even claim that he ignores certain facts about the darker sides of the wolf and his book is somewhat embellished from the actual truth. Concerning the latter comment, it would seem quite difficult to say with any certainty the true nature of Mowat's experience with wolves. Only he and perhaps a few of the Eskimos who were on hand would know the intimate details of his mission. That said, it is certain that the author had profound thoughts and feelings about the nobility of the arctic wolf and the often vulgar stereotype that leads to their mass slaughter. The reader truly sees the wolf in an anthropomorphic light; the human qualities of the wolf pack are undeniable and if respected, wolves are delightful creatures to observe in the wild.There have been many nay-sayers of Mowat's work concerning conservation of natural resources for obvious reasons. The first is his willingness to take the Canadian government to task for perpetuating myths about wolves and their payoffs to hunters who brutally trap and kill the animals. Mowat made it his life's work to promote green causes in Canada, and this book is considered by many to be one of his finest works promoting understanding of the natural world rather than its callous destruction through greed and incompetence.Mowat's book concludes with the mistaken policy concerning wolves that condones and promotes their destruction, after he familiarizes the reader with wolf behavior through the analysis of a small pack of wolves. He names the parents George and Angeline, who along with Uncle Albert take care of a young litter of pups in an arctic den near Mowat's cabin. Although initially heavily armed, Mowat soon realized that these animals posed very little threat to him. I thought this transformation and learning process that the author underwent was the guiding light of the book and is meant to instruct the public on the value of the wild wolf. I did think Mowat might sugar coat his writing at times ( not stating that the wolves posed no threat mainly because they were well fed rather than having a totally sunny disposition), but the warmth that he felt towards the pack comes through very clearly and permits his subjectivity concerning their interaction.This is considered one of the author's finest book's for good reason. It is quite short and to the point, yet allows the reader to see both the inner workings of a wolf pack and man's ability to live in harmony with them and learn more about nature and ourselves."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat heads off into the Canadian wilderness in search of wolves.

Unless you're looking for a textbook, that barely matters; Mowat's style more than makes up for his lapses in scientific rigour. He writes with zest, economy and impeccable lightness of touch.

The descriptive story of Farley Mowat's scientific expedition to northern Canada, including his detailed observations of wolf pack behaviour is told clearly in chronological order. The major characters in this account: the author, a wildlife biologist on his first assignment; the Innuit, an indian tribe native to northern Canada; and the wolf pack, subject of Mowat's study; are vividly brought to life. The author uses well-selected events to describe the wolfpack, the Innuit and himself in their daily lives; his first-hand descriptions of interactions with the the natives, the animals, and their environment make for interesting and informative reading.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the life of a biologist studying wolves in the wild."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat has admitted publically that both the book and the movie are not based on fact. He is quoted as saying that he never lets the truth get in the way of a good story. The idea that wolves eat only mice and voles should give anyone reading it pause. The wolves have had to be controlled (by helicopter, trapping, etc) to protect what is left of the caribou. And then, they put them in the US, where they are making huge strides in decimating all of the ungulate population of Idaho, Montana ,and Wyoming. The man is an admitted liar, why would anyone want to read the book, or watch the movie. He is totally unrepentant about it, also."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"i have not read this book yet but if you live in georgia and are entering tenth grade...this is one of your summer reading books on the list"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I enjoyed Never Cry wolf because it gives you interesting facts about wolves. Throughout the entire book the author shows you how wolves are misunderstod and pose no threat to man. I particularaly liked the wolves reaction to the authors mishaps. The comparison between people and wolves shows you how intelligent wolves are...(smarter than some people i know...namley, whoever is reading this review) That is why I give this book 4 stars"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I just finished the book &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; by: Farley Mowat. I thought this book was very interesting, and it tought me a lot about wolves from how they sleep to how they get along with the other animals in their environment. I also thought it was extremely boring in parts, and it was hard to pay attention. I would only recommend this book to people who are fascinated by wolves and can keep their concentration for a long time."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat's wonderful account of his observations of the arctic wolf never fails to send the imagination on a soaring journey to that remote land near the top of the world. Mowat is sent north to observe the wolf in his natural habitat to determine if the wolf is responsible for the disastrous decline of the caribou population. In so doing he discovers the wolf to be far from the &quot;savage brute&quot; that he expected. In studying a family of these creatures he presents a unique and beautiful picture of natural life. He comes to love the wolves for their purity, their dedication to family, and their intelligence. In addition, there are several fascinating episodes involving the local eskimo peoples, particularly an old and wise man named Ootek.Although it reads like a novel, it is a true account of Mowat's experience. We are fortunate however that such a spirit as his shines through with such clarity in the narrative. Mowat is a writer of great power, worthy of the attention of anyone who is remotely interested in the plight of the natural world against the neverending onslaught by humanity."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"In the introduction Farley Mowat writes that his intent was to write about the bureaucracy and misinformation which Mowat felt was pushing the Canadian government in the wrong enviromental direction. Granted, there is parts of the book dedicated to that but Mowat becomes so obsessed with the wolves he is studing that they soon become the stars of his own story.Never Cry Wolf is an adventure story about a scientist relocated to the Canadian wilderness to study the effects that wolves have on the depleating numbers of carabao. Mowat not only links the decline in carabao to man but he also ends up taking some fasinating notes on wolf behavior.The only problem with the book is that it is around 40 years old. From this book today, there is no way of knowing how accurate and relevant Mowat information still is."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under \\"Comedy\\" if not \\"Fiction\\". Putting it under an \\"Ecological Essay\\" is adding insult to injury. There is nothing \\"ecological\\" about this book, nor is this book an essay. This is the same man that thinks pissing in front of a predator will keep them at bay. I dare anyone to try that. Nevermind, don't, because I don't want to be tracked down for punitive damages after the person dies."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"My first reaction to the story was it is slow paced but with lots or thrills around every cornor. This book's style is definatly slow paced but he keeps the action coming and coming. My evalution of this boook is that it is for the slow paced reader but also for someone that likes lots of thrills and adventure. Mowat was placed on the frozen ice to search for wolves. Mowat and his party were going to move to a differnt location but all of a sudden the plan did not want to start. After they got the plan in the air they were forced to jetasun dead weight out. They had to land on the ice and Mowat had to live under his canoe. The next day he sought out to find another place to live because he did not want his canoe recked. He found a man in the woods that would let him in but Marley freaked him out with all of the tools he uses to disect animals. I reccommend reading this book because it is fuled with lots of action"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"\\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is a great story, but sadly, it's a work of fiction that's been inaccurately sold as non-fiction. Mowat has never provided evidence to refute the investigations in Canada that uncovered the fictional nature of \\"Never Cry Wolf\\". For an accurate description of wolf biology, read the works of respected wolf biologists such as L. David Mech. As Mech says in his book \\"The Wolf\\", Mowat's \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is a good counterbalance to the \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" portrayal of wolves as vicious man eaters... yet neither story is grounded in fact. Among the gross errors in Mowat's book was his contention that wolf packs can subsist on a diet of small rodents. No wolf biologist has found such a wolf population. It may not be PC to say that wolves subsist primarily on large ungulates that they hunt down and kill, but it's the truth."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I personally liked this book. I thought it was well written and it managed to interest me for the most part thoroughout the whole novel. I am a Freshman in High School and I was able to find this book easily readable, you just have to get into it, then you will like it. However, I may just find this book interesting because I just read A Separate Peace by John Knowles -(Not a very exciting book). The best part about Never Cry Wolf is that it is all a true story."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I paid under two dollars for this book, it was a good deal. I paid an extra 5-7 dollars to receive the book quick so i could write a paper on it. I went with the expedited shipping which is first class. It took over 7 days to receive the book.

I didn't really get into the book until the part about the mice. Otherwise it was pretty boring. But if you like that kind of stuff go ahead and get the book.I recommend this book to anyone over 40 with a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is NOT the true story of life among arctic wolves-- Mr. Mowat spent much, much less time with wolves than he pretends he has in this book, and simply fabricates most of his observations. It takes a special sort of person to endure the frozen wilderness to study arctic wolf behavior at length, and to accept that these beautiful animals are intelligent and amazing killing machines that don't need to fulfill people's desires to view them as non-threatening mouse-eaters. Apparently Mr. Mowat just isn't that special sort of person-- but he is a liar."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I got the book hoping to learn the human experience of such an amazing challenge. An experience like that must have such a profound impact on a man's psyche, but I felt he masked all of this with shallow quips and wordsmithing. Way too much salesmanship and way too little reality."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book as a lot of bloodthirsty wolves. The young boy went camping with his father. They met up with a pack of wolves when they went deer hunting. I like this book because it talks about wolves and has some gross stuff in it. Farley Mowat has a lot of detail about this book and the writing really lets you understand it better."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Awesome, captivating, informative, interesting, very amusing, amazing... Are but a few of the adjectives I would use to describe this book. A fervent reader of Curwood-type books since a tender age of 11-12 years, I have always loved to read nature books about places and animals and this book by Mr. Mowat is very simply put one of the best; an excellent account of his trip to the Arctic to study and commute with wolves for his government-mandated research. I recommend this book for young and older adults alike. I can hardly wait to read more of his nature books.Being one of those people who has always had admiration and fear about wolves, this books sets me straight about their true nature and social abilities."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I watched the movie some time in the 90s. I loved it. I was unaware that the author of the book has nearly cult status in Canada. An amazon friend (or more than 1?) told me that I ought to read Farley Mowat ... so here I am, choosing his one book that means something to me immediately. I find that the book must have been among the front-running myth busters on wolves. Myth busting is always entertaining. I don't know enough about the subject matter to judge the full extent of truth in the matter, but as I like Mowat's attitude and writing, I give him the benefit of doubt (though I was a little disconcerted by the following line in his foreword of 1993: Never allow facts to interfere with the truth! That is of course a nicely absurd sentence and therefore fun, but is also a little precarious.)What is this? It is several things: first of all a non-fiction account of a research expedition into the wild and cold. (Or is it an inaccurate account of a biased partisan trip to damage the natural interests of the hunting industry?) It is also a shrill satire about hunters, their lobby, bureaucrats, and \`scientists'. All this is funny and it is nice to see how Mowat stretches his humor to himself. (Example: he was sunbathing naked in the wilderness, when a small group of wolves passes nearby; he has no time to collect his clothes and runs after them naked, for his scientific observations; he meets a group of local people (then still called Eskimos) and after the encounter a man says to him that the woman in the group might have liked him better with his trousers on.)The book was published in the 60s but based on events in the 40s. A young zoologist is sent to the wilderness to prove that wolves are bad and require eradication. They are competing with the large game industry, who does not like competition. The ruling theory about wolves is that they are voraciously bloodthirsty and kill for the fun. Our hero is expected to measure the problem and propose solutions.He writes in his 1993 foreword that he sees himself as one of the fathers of the theory that the wolf has been demonized unfairly, that he is not remotely the danger to Homo sapiens and other species that mythology claimed him to be. The demonization of the wolf, says Mowat, was started when man became sedentary. Wolf became the embodiment of evil to civilized man.Mowat's idyllic stories about good family life and neighborhood, plus his descriptions of wolves hunting deer reads as if it makes sense. His main theory is that wolves don't diminish deer herds, but keep them healthy. Convincing.This is all old history and probably the real world has moved on to doing irreparable damage by now. Or not?"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This classic defense of wolves never strays into preaching; it makes its points through slapstick adventure. A hapless young biologist named Farley Mowat gets shipped off into the bush by the Canadian government and instructed to conduct meticulous observations of wolves. He is to disembowel a lot of wolves and prove that the ravening beasts are decimating the caribou. Instead, the wolves disprove his assumptions at every turn. He becomes an ardent fan of their family life, sense of humor, restraint, and good nature. He decides to skip the disemboweling. An Eskimo named Ootek helps to illuminate wolf nature and plays the wise straight red man to Mowat's buffoon. Mowat hides under his canoe from wolves that turn out to be huskies; he ogles a she-wolf he has christened Angeline. Some of his antics could come right out of a Chaplin movie. Perhaps Chaplin should have done a movie in the far north not about Gold Rush prospectors who eat shoes, but about wildlife biologists who eat creamed mice to test their nutritional value. In one scene, Mowat jumps up naked from sunbathing to run off after a pack of wolves in hopes of observing a caribou hunt. When the wolves ignore the caribou, Mowat runs at the pack, swearing, in frustration. An Eskimo lad tells his mother, who never speaks to the mad white nudist again.This nature writing does not sing. It is not meant to. When Mowat mentions the tundra plains around him, he calls them dreary. Nor does he praise the wolves' appearance much. What's more, enough experts have questioned the veracity of his observations that Barry Lopez labels Never Cry Wolf a \\"fictionalized account\\" in his book Of Wolves and Men. Yet Lopez still recommends Never Cry Wolf as an introduction to the species. The truth is that the book doesn't need beauty or literal truth to draw us closer to nature. Through Mowat's stories, we come to share his affinity for wolves, and we understand the hunger for connection that propels his scientific curiosity."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The author has a unique way of keeping you captivated and he will renew your thoughts about wolves. This book was recommended, it was not something I would have read, but after reading it I could hardly put it down, I found myself clued to this book, very funny and touching at the same time. This by far was the most revealing book about wild animals I have ever read. You will not regret reading this book; I bought 3 others after reading it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I decided to read the book after watching the movie, created by Disney, of the same name. While the movie is based upon the book and generally entertaining I found the book to be so much more fulfilling.I have always had an interest in wolves and Mowat provides the right touch in his writing to entertain as well as educate the reader on their behavior. He also provides insight into the bureaucratic functions of the Canadian government which provokes laughter throughout the story.If looking for a general introduction to Wolves I thoroughly recommend this book. It provides wonderful insight into their behavior, public misconceptions, and the affects that hunters and trappers have on wildlife in the northern regions of North America."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"What a great book! Farley uses his literary gifts to take the reader beyond the page. The voice in this novel was extraordinary, and I loved the way he related wolfish sociey to our own. For me, I was sitting right there on the tundra, watching this guy chomp on mice. The way he characterizes his neighboring wolves is amazing, and the vocabulary is enough to make you dizzy. However, he describes everything so well that this never gets in the way.Now, I'm not a reader and this was a &quot;mandatory assignment&quot;, so you can just imagine how good it would be to someone who actually likes to do this kind of thing. I would suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a good time and a big chuckle!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It mixes laugh-out-loud humor with passeges that literally brought tears to my eyes. Farley Mowat is an incredible writer. I immediately went out and bought two more books by him the day after I finished Never Cry Wolf. I cannot give it a more enthusiastic recommendation."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I, although an avid wolf-lover, sometimes find myself bored by overly scientific wolf books. When that happens, I go back and read this book. Mr. Mowat has a refreshing style of writing that keeps the reader entertained while at the same proving his point that wolves are far from the savage killers the human race his condemned them for being.I have a wide array of wolf books and many fictional novels in my library collection, but this book doesn't come close to any book in any genre. The book kept me more interested than most of the mysteries I have resorted to reading and it was far more entertaining than some of my more scientific wolf books. I reccommend this book to anyone and everyone...whether they are a nature lover or not!And one more thing...I tend to like to flip through nature books before buying them to avoid the sometimes graphic pictures and stories of the wolves we set out to exterminate...and I am very happy to tell everyone that this book has a good ending, unlike many others. The only thing that will make tears form is the thought of what supposedly civilized man has done to such a beautiful, magnificent animal. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"&quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; is a true story about Farly Mowat's studies of wild wolves in Alaska. The book details his studies and observations of one particular pack of wolves. In his studies, he conducts an experiment to see if a large animal (human) can survive strictly on field mice, and he is the guinea pig. He does this because he notices that this is all the wolf family is eating in the spring, and he wanted to see if it was really possible.This book is an excellent selection for any reader interested in wolves or an Alaskan adventure. Also any reader interested in a lot of feeling and emotion would be completely satisfied."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is a good introduction to Mowat. It is one of his early books and will be appreciated by all animal lovers. It enhanced my knowledge of and respect for wolves. The movie is also excellent and I highly recommend it. Charles Martin Smith plays the part of Mowat and is perfect in the part."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The book Never Cry Wolf is an excellent book. The characters are great. I think my favorite character would have to be Angeline, she's a smart and beautiful wolf. One of my favorite parts in the book though, is when Farely drinks the wolf juice. You'll have to read the book to find out what I'm talking about, but I would definitely recomend this book for everyone. It is absolutely hilarious and once you get going, you'll never want to put it down."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The narrative was fast paced and the descriptions colorful.

People with dry humor (or enough intelligence to catch irony)will find it hilarious! Great book, changes your perspective on wolves."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I read this book because I liked the movie. Luckily this was one of those rare movies that was made pretty true to the spirit of the book.

I have gone on to read every Mowat book I can find..."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry wolf embeleshes a lost form of writing only seen by those who truly understand the outdoors. It's factual content is good, but the humor far exceeds it. I especially enjoyed the wolf juice."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Saw the movie a long time ago; never got to read the book until now, and I am glad I did.

I definitely recommend this to everyone."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is a great story and one I would definitely recommend to all ages. It made quite an impression on me as a teenager and then again as an adult. One to keep in the library and bring out on those cold winter nights.."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I didn't actually enjoy this book while I was reading it; although there were some parts that were interesting, a lot seemed very unbelievable.I was felt betrayed later, when I learned that Farley Mowat had written a HIGHLY fictionalized account of his experience, had spent very little time with the actual wolves and besides hadn't been there alone at all! I absolutely can't stand fiction being sold as \\"an absolutely true account\\" -- this crossed a line. And now that it has been revealed as fictionalized, it is truly astounding that it is still fooling people and is still being classes as nonfiction."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"To put it very simply, how can a fictional work be considered \\"Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves\\"? Very deceptive and misleading in it's title. A fictional book about wolves; yes, a true story; no. Read to enjoy a fictional world drawn up by Mowat, but if looking for a true life story stick to non-fiction writings as this is certainly not among those."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"In 1948 the Canadian government sent Farley Mowat out to the frozen tundra to study the wolves. The object of their desire was to link the wolves to the decimation of the Caribou herds and thus a reason to eradicate them. What Mowat discovered was a creature in perfect harmony with its environment, thriving on only what it needed and no more. The story is interspersed with a terrific sense of humor that kept me laughing and smiling throughout the whole story. If your interested in wolves or the outdoors I couldn't recommend a better book to read."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"At the begining of this story Mowat gets droped of in the Wilderness with all his supplies. He was all by him self. He stayed at that same exact spot for about two days. Didn't know what to do or where to go. Till he met Otek he took him to his little Bunkhouse and let him stay there for his tests with the wolf. Otek teached Mowat a lot about the Wolf. And Mowat tweached Him English. I think the way Mowat describes the differnts between the Wolf and the humans is really good. He tries a lot of things that the Wolf does. Like he eats mice, he makes mice stwee and all kinds of other things and he actually likes it. He tries to undestand the Wolf more and he really does live like the Wolf does. Anyways, this is a really good book and it's worth to read it. The bgining is kind of slow but then after the 5 chapter it gets cvery good and it's hard to lay the book down."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"\\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is one of Canadian author Farley Mowat's first works and it's a beauty. Told with humour and verve and a tongue very much in the cheek, it is nevertheless a serious inquiry into what motivates man to do the things he does. One can see Mowat sitting up there in the ice and snow of the Arctic, scratching away at what was then a healthy head of hair and the beginnings of a very respectable beard, wondering, \\"what on earth can they be thinking of,\\" as he tries to deal with the odd behaviour of government machinery thousands of miles away to the south. Further, and this is I suppose the point of the book, what is he to do about this animal he has been sent, not to study, but to convict, who simply won't behave like the awful predator he is alleged to be? Why is man disposed to decide upon things first, and then learn the truth afterwards (often when it is too late)? And having found out the truth of the matter for himself, what should Mowat do about it? Well, I think the subsequent career of this ardent defender of natural causes speaks for itself. In fact, just before you read his environmental masterpiece, \\"Sea of Slaughter,\\" you should read this. It's the tip of the iceberg, but it will perhaps soften the blow."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf purports to be the true story of the author's assignment (two summers and a winter) in the Canadian Arctic studying the wolf population and habits (especially in relation to caribou which were thought to be the wolf's main diet). His own environmentalist perspective was clearly at odds with those of his employer (Dominion Wildlife service, which wanted him gather evidence proving that wolves were bloodthirsty creatures wreaking havoc on the caribou population and in need of extermination by hunting and poison.) It was hard not to embrace Mowat's protective instincts as a lover of nature.I was about to give this short and highly readable book four stars, just for the great story, the humorous and sometimes self-deprecating tone, the exquisite descriptions of the Arctic landscape, and the sheer marvelous glimpse of a world I would never see on my own. I did NOT, however, like Mowat's insistence on ascribing human traits, characteristics and emotions to every single wolf observation he made, even though it was, at times, highly entertaining. It did not ring true.Before I wrote this review, however, I was disappointed to learn that Mowat has been criticized for fictionalizing many of his experiences, justifying it with a statement he even made in this book, \\"I never let the facts get in the way of truth.\\"From Wikipedia: \\"In 1963, Mowat wrote a possibly fictionalised account of his experiences in the Canadian Arctic with Arctic wolves entitled Never Cry Wolf, which is thought to have been instrumental in changing popular attitudes on the canids. The work and its claims has been criticised.\\"So I reduced my rating to three stars, but giving Mowat some credit, I think there was a lot of truth in his book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it while I was reading it. But now I feel a bit duped and disappointed that he may have felt the need to contrive a story to deliver his message. The end does not always justify the means."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I've been a wolf lover for all my life and I found that even to me, Mowat's book was a refreshing treat. Most of the wolf-related books, fiction or non-fiction, usually describe wolves as bloodthirsty, cruel killers. This occurrence is not always intentional, but even so, it happens. Mowat started out with these same myths, but he learns to see wolves as they truly are. It's unlikely that the average person with the stereotypical view of wolves will pick this book up, but I still hope that NEVER CRY WOLF will help change a few views. Wolves are incorrectly and unfairly branded as evil, and NEVER CRY WOLF helps dispel some of the most common myths associated with these beautiful creatures, who in reality, are more similar to us than most of us imagine.Mowat keeps the reader's attention with humor and interesting anecdotes, which makes it an enjoyable read for all. His attachment to the wolves he studies makes the read warm and inviting, and the reader may come to know the wolves as if they were there themselves.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a humor-infected, myth-dispelling, thrilling bit of non-fiction. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is very much a period piece as Mowat was trying to dispell fifty-year-old myths about wolves. The Canadian government sent him into the Arctic to study the wolf's role in killing caribous that human hunters wanted to kill instead.What makes this a great book is Mowat's understated humor in many places, his humorous sarcasm of bureaucracy, and a handful of funny set-piece situations -- such as how he ended up chasing wolves naked for several miles, inadvertently shocking Inuit women and children.Also, Mowat really did study wolves in the Arctic, but not in the way that he describes here. There's a fair amount of fiction in the book, though broadly inspired and shaped by his experiences. Don't take it all as literally true. Maybe these funny stories really happened but I wouldn't bet the farm. They are still fully, though.Mowat writes very well, though the vocabulary will be a bit advanced for some teens (and for anyone younger)."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This narrative is a blend of humor, misconceptions, and at times ineptness as Mowat fumbles through misunderstond beliefs of wolf behavior, hunting practices, social hierarchies and parenting. Mowat is befriended by two Eskimos, one named Mike and the other Ootek. It is with his relationship with Ootek that helps Mowat understand the wolf. Through his conversations and with first hand observations Mowat is able to conclude, that the wolf is anything but a carnivore that kills indiscriminately. The wolf has a higher social order; has a distinctive language and is a caring parent. I would recommend this book, it is light reading, it is humorous, it expresses ones coming of age as a young biologist, thrusted into the wilds of the Canadian frontier, learns life's lessons of what is perceive is not necessarily true.The wolf is one with its environment and it is man that is the plague of mother nature."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Mowat is not only a scientist but also a social reformer. The fact is nature has been thrown out of balance in most areas in the North American continent because preditory animals have been eliminated. This past year, wolves have been reintroduced into Yellowstone. I wonder how much Mowat had to do with this. When this was written people still feared their babies would be stolen and relished by packs of roving wolves. They feared the image of the wolf while our present day society loves images of the wolf on posters, in paintings and even t-shirts. After the movie was made into a film, more people were touched by the message that wolves are not to be feared. Mowat wasn't afraid to go live with them for awhile and document their behavior much like Jane Goodhal did with chimpanzees. He ate field mice to prove that wolves could subsist on them as a diet during lean times. He marked the path to his cabin with trails of his own urine to prove that wolves have their own social standards and respect for other's territory.Mowat is consistently a de-mystifyer in his writings. I've been enjoying his other writings on Inuit tribes, their customs and struggles. He's a boat-rocker too not finding much favor with corporate people and government bureaucrats who either ignore or exploit the area and its indigenous peoples to the point of near extinction. So to read all of the books of his I've read so far is to be educated about the arctic region, its wildlife, people and peculiarities. He fell in love with the area as a very young man and gave most of his life to it. I'm crazy about his stuff and am working my way through all of his work."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book is one of the many books on wolves that I have read. This is a wonderfull book compared to some of the best books I have read. Anyone who loves wolves or just loves reading will be thrilled with the one in a life-time experience for all ages. It brings out the human part of wolves and shows what we as humans have done to them. I would recamend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"In this excellent non-fiction book, Farley Mowat provides new insights into wolves and wolf behaviors. Using a wonderfully dry, often satirical, sense of humor, Mowat blends a tale of his real-life duties as a Canadian Wildlife Service biologist with that of a wolf family he studies and befriends. Mowat is sent to the Arctic barrens to \\"prove\\" wolves are decimating the caribou herds of northern Canada. After a year of scientific study, which he details in his narrative, Mowat finds evidence that it is \\"man\\", not the wolf, who is responsible for the decline of caribou populations. He does this through careful study of the wolf family which consists of George and Angeline (the parents), their four pups, and Uncle Albert (a single male caretaker). What makes this non-fiction story so fascinating is Mowat's ability to make scientific method and inquiry easy to understand and, oftentimes, humorous. This book would make a wonderful read for reluctant teenage readers, as well as anyone who loves wolves and/or nature. The vocabulary in the first few chapters may be difficult, but after those introductory chapters the wonderful story takes over and you can forgive Mowat's use of elevated, difficult language. The \\"found\\" poem at the end of the book leaves the reader with much to think about concerning the role of humans in the environment. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Received my book promptly with no problems and the used book was in great condition."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Farley Mowat does a wonderful job of injecting a comedic aspect into his writing of his time spent studying wolves in the arctic.

This book is a wonderfully simple read but still includes quite an amount of factoids which are likely new to you.

In spite of this, I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I found this book to be very interesting, was well written and kept me captivated.

As a newly minted biologist, he is tasked by the Canadian wild life ministry to document wolf decimation of the caribou in the arctic. Mowat is dropped off in the middle of nowhere with provisions and a several month mandate to undertake his mission and produce a field report.But he immediately rebels against the pre-conceived conclusion as well as the typical way of doing things upon finding his first wolf. Following it back to its den, Mowat begins a long observation of the wolf family's relationships and habits. He literally camps for entire days very near his quarry and begins to mimic their habits (as well as diet at one point). He quickly concludes that the wolves are not ceaseless caribou predators and instead subsist on field mice he observes them tracking and brining back to the den every day. In fact, the wolves appear only to take caribou sporadically, and the weak and sick at that. But what Mowat learns about wolf life makes the heart of the book.In Mowat's skillful telling, the wolves' deep family patterns and affections are revealed. His observations personify the canis lupus family to the point where they act and behave more like a successful and loving nuclear family in your own neighborhood than the wild predators they are thought to be.This is a very sympathetic book and makes a great case for conservation and the preservation of wild animal habitat. It is beautifully written in places and fascinating for the insights the author delivers on his subject.It was disappointing upon researching this book further to learn that many accuse Mowat of basically making large parts of the book up (including those who worked with him who have made some pretty tough accusations relating to basic facts surrounding his story). In fact, the author in interviews has not squarely denied using some license to drive to his sympathetic portrayals of wolves. This doesn't make the book any less well written or touching, but it does hurt the credibility of the conclusions the author seeks to make."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"A classic of environmental literature by one of the great early ecologists--doesn't get much better than this, and doesn't really need my endorsement!"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I can't speak to the historical and scientific truth of Farley Mowat's memoir of his time watching wild wolves, but I can speak to the sheer entertainment of his storytelling powers. The man knows how to grip a reader. He's ironic, witty, tragic, and thoughtful. Mowat shows he's not afraid to subsist on the same diet of mice as the wolves he's watching, and by assigning names to each member of the wolfpack, we all come to appreciate their unique personalities. While this book is ultimately a challenge to the Canadian government's wolf control policies, the book reads like a good wilderness survival story."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I really enjoy Mowat's stories. They are so conversational they read like novels. \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is of Mowat's personal experiences with a pair of Arctic wolves. As such, it is a pro-wolf book for pro-wolf people. I include myself in that number but, whereas not disputing Mowat's work, I like hard cold facts and realism.It is true, as Mowat discovered, that wolves eat a lot of small animals, including mice. Logically, this is more true on the denning grounds, a time when small animals are abundant and large animals--especially migratory animals like caribou--are relatively scarce. Wolves are obliged to hunt for prey within a reasonable distance of their dens i.e. they can't migrate dozens or hundreds of miles in pursuit of large animals.Predictably, when the cubs leave the den and are able to move long distances, the adult wolves do, too. They tend to pack up and hunt really large animals. Right now the island of Newfoundland is experiencing a catastrophic decline in Woodland Caribou populations...but they have no wolves. Evidence supports the thesis, however, that the decline is due to the relatively recent arrival of that wolf relative, the coyote. Coyotes don't ordinarily attack adult caribou but a newborn fawn is at real risk.Conservation practices should be realistic. Wolves are wonderful predators and a major asset to wilderness ecosystems. They aren't, however, sacrosanct. Sometimes ballooning wolf populations hurt populations of othr desireable wildlife. In these cases, it is perfectly appropriate to cull excess wolves.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"The author is a master storyteller; combined with his narrative, the information about the social lives of wolves was indeed fascinating and compelling to read.

The first quarter of it is so funny, with it's dead-pan delivery, that I was howling out loud. The couple sitting next to me had to start laughing just because I was having such fun. People were craning to see just what book I was finding so funny. Though the &quot;message&quot; of the book is a serious condemnation of how the powers-that-be would prefer to get their data from a book or talking heads instead of the people who actually know what they're talking about, the delivery of the message is total tongue-in-cheek. On my next plane ride, I'm reading his sequel."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This book by the Canadian naturalist Farley Mowat, which was made into a film in 1983, is an account, often humorous, of Mowat's study of the natural behavior of the arctic wolf in the treeless environs of northern Canada in the late 1940s. He had been sent up there to study the wolf and bring back data on how much the wolf population had been the apparent cause of the large decline in the caribou population. What he discovered was a detailed family life and the controversial observation that there no threat at all for the caribou (or to humans) from the wolves. This book is a classic in conservation literature. It shows the love man has of nature and how we should protect it. As most ranchers will tell you, coyotes are much more of a problem than wolves and wolves help keep the coyote population down."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Sent by a government agency to establish the facts against the arctic wolf, by proving that it was a resolute and unflinching killer of caribou, the youthful Mowat actually discovered (for what was not to be the only time in his life) that man was the only serious threat in the North and that the wolf was quietly feasting on mice instead of &quot;deer&quot;. A heart-rending tale, told by a true believer in all things animal and human, this is a book which should be compulsory reading for all schoolchildren. Mowat has done us a great service by pointing out that we cannot continue to treat the natural world as if its many denizens were of no importance, even to us. Finding out the truth about the wolf also helped Mowat, and us, find out something very important about ourselves; it's a lesson we need to learn and relearn and never forget. Never Cry Wolf will long remain a startling but lonely cry from a remote wilderness."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"While I can't speak to the veracity of the facts involved, I can say with certainty that I loved this story of a man in the wilderness making friends with a wolf pack. He lovingly dedicates the book to one of his wolf friends.Mowat goes alone into the Alaskan wilderness to study the wild wolves, who are being exterminated because of a belief that they are eating livestock. Mowat tries as well as humanly possible to live as he sees the wolves living. He drinks gallons of tea so he can pee around his camp to mark his territory. He eats rodents to see if he gets his full complement of dietary needs. He takes &quot;wolf naps&quot; so that he can watch them interact with one another during all hours. He even notes baby-sitting habits.Unusually, the movie that was made from this book keeps to the story pretty accurately. I would recommend that, also."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"For me this book was a real page-turner. Mowat's writing has an exquisite simplicity to it. His entire experiences in the Arctic with wolves is facinating. I must admit that I did find some of the events unbelievable, but that could just be due to my preconceptions about wolves in general (the very types he is trying to dispel). However, for me, these unbelievable moments did not detract from the narrative in any way; I still found myself wanting to know what happened next. In my own mind while reading the book, I couldn't help but consider how our negative stereotypes of wolves are very similar to the negative stereotypes people often feel about other groups of people. In both cases, when one begins to truly know the other, he finds that there is really no basis for the negative sterotype. Mowat makes it point not to rely on anecdotal evidence when studying the wolf, and instead only gives merit to the anecdotal evidence after he has observed behavior that would back it up. It would seem that this should apply when judging people as well.The only improvement I think could be made to this book is for Mowat to include whatever became of his report. I realize he is telling the story to reveal his own experiences with the Arctic Wolves, and not to reveal the post report offical government position; but it woud have been nice to have that included anyway.Overall, I think this is a great book, and well worth the few hours it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I have read many of Farley Mowat's books, yet this one gave me a different opinion about this storyteller. Before I had always thought of him as being frankly,quite a boring man. Yet when I picked up this book in my English Literature class, I was surprised when I continued to read on. His descriptons are colorful and keep you informed. He keeps it interesting and lively. He combines fact with his imagination. What the result is, is a stunning realization away from the fairytale wolf. I would recommend you read the book for he plays with your emotions as will any good author. He makes you laugh and cry and smile within almost every chapter. A fantastic example of Farley Mowats distinctive storytelling style."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf is one of the more enjoyable books that I have read, and if there is a book that best evokes the Farley Mowat style, this is it.There has been some doubt as to whether some of the experiences that Mowat writes about in this book are fudged in order to make the story more appealling. It's an accusation that Mowat of course denies, but who knows? There is really no one but the author himself in a position to know what really happened, what has been left out, what has been embellished all for the sake of making the book more readable and entertaining.Does it really matter, though? To my knowledge, Mowat never mentions that the intention of this book was to serve as an accurate and scholarly study of wolf behaviour. The intent of the book was to put forth his personal opinion concerning why wolves were supposedly slaughtering cariboo indiscriminantly.The government had sent him up there with the belief (or at least professing the belief) that there was a problem with the wolf population. What Mowat discovered, however, was that wolf behaviour was in fact very regulated, that wolves hunted selectively. These mass killings of cariboo, he found, were not the result of the wolves, but of hunters from the South, primarily from the United States, who would fly in, blast away, and take a few trophies home, leaving the rest to rot. Trappers, in turn, exploited this situation: they complained to the government that the wolves were a problem and wanted a bounty to be implemented, so that, obviously, they could then cash in on it.Whether authentic or slightly altered, Never Cry Wolf is a fascinating story and an important work of Canadian literature. Mowat's advocacy for such issues as the environment and Native rights was ground-breaking and of fundamental importance to current and future generations. I would hope, then, that people who read this book will regarded as more than just a &quot;good read&quot; and that they will make an effort to understand its deeper message."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I'm very glad I finally read this, because I've wanted to read it since I saw the movie when I was a kid and loved it so much -- and I wonder now just how much influence this movie had on me and my feelings about animals. I never saw Old Yeller or Free Willy and I barely remember Bambi; this was the one that made the impression. Maybe it's why I feel such an affinity for wolves. Interesting. But I digress.This book is great. Not only is Mowat an excellent writer, but it gave me some insight into wolves that I didn't know, about their hunting patterns and their family units and such. I would love to see (Or write, if I ever get that far with my writing career) werewolves written to match this vision of wolf life, with the inclusion of uncles in the family units, the main pair mating for life and practicing abstinence when the environment can't sustain another wolf pack, and treating humans as an object of curiosity as much as potential danger. And so on. It was incredibly depressing to read about the destruction of the Canadian caribou herds, just like the Great Plains buffalo, by a bunch of heartless bastards (I was going to say something else, uncharacteristically profane for me -- but the sentiment is there) who shot them by the hundreds for small purposes -- like killing a caribou to use as bait to trap foxes. What the heck is that? I hated reading how those same trappers blamed wolves, while the fat, stupid government backed them and allowed them to continue killing the world while blaming someone else, and then using that as an excuse to kill more. Kind of like drilling in the Alaskan Preserve: since we have destroyed the natural habitat of our country by paving over it, now we should destroy one of the last natural habitats in order to keep driving on our lovely pavement. Man, we suck.Despite the rage, I loved reading the book. Made me like wolves even more than before."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is an excellent book by and excellent author. Having traveled much in the arctic by kayak and canoe, I was thrilled to read a book capturing some of the idiosyncrasies that I've experienced myself. The joys and tragedies of the arctic come through brilliantly and only those with a hatred of wolves could fail to see the obvious conclusions Mowat makes concerning the fate of the caribou. I bicycled the Dempster highway in 2005 and found the landscape littered with caribou remains; a slaughter empowered by a gravel road. Time has proven Mowat right in his conclusions. Man, a relative newcomer, is responsible for the declines in wildlife, not the wolves who have lived on the land for countless centuries. The old saying of wolves and caribou: 'the caribou feeds the wolf and the wolf makes the caribou stronger' seems obvious now. Man on the other hand hunts the strongest in the breed, weakening the herd, kill by kill."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I have come to Farley Mowat and NEVER CRY WOLF rather belatedly, considering the author has been out there stirring things up for fifty years. I found the book absolutely enthralling and could not put it down.Essentially, as a young field biologist emerging from World War II, Mowat signed up with the government which sent him north to study wolves. The government understood from hunters that wolves were decimating caribou herds and wanted to know more in order to correct the problem. Mowat heads north to the lonely tundra for what begins with a lot of disinformation about the lupine species, bureaucratic nonsense and a slapstick exercise in transportation and establishing a base of operations. Fortunately for him, a half Eskimo dog sledder named Mike shows up and helps him get his feet on the ground. What ensues is a study both in human comedy and the beauty of a naturalist's job. The wolf family Mowat observes is a model of nature in balance. Are they responsible for the overkill of caribou? Of course not. People are.I gather that Mowat has earned some critics and enemies in his pursuit of environmental consciousness and an enthusiasm for bucking convention. I understand that there are those who discredit his research. This narrative exudes an honesty that makes this reader trust Mowat first."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This is a true story and is amazing. It also shows the corruption of governments that attempt to blame animals for human excesses."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I can't believe I never got around to reading this book until now. (I haven't seen the loosely adapted movie version, either). I snagged a used copy, though, and thoroughly enjoyed this quick but poignant read. At once joyful and heartbreaking, over three decades after it first appears it still delivers an important message amid a wonderful true story.According to the book, Mowat got dropped into the middle of the Canadian wilderness on a government mission to \\"prove\\" that wolves were responsible for the depletion of caribou (and also to \\"prove\\" the innocence of thousands upon thousands of human hunters). Over the course of the next few months, he not only discovered a small family of wolves, but was able to observe them over time as they raised pups, hunted prey of all sizes, played, and did a lot of sleeping. He also encountered local Inuits and while some of the interactions were on the awkward side, he gained a good bit of knowledge about the wolves from them.I won't give away the ending for those who haven't read it; needless to say, it was hard not to cry on the train this morning as I finished the book.Never Cry Wolf has gained a good bit of criticism; wolf biologist L. David Mech has said that he's never seen some of the behaviors Mowat described, including wolves living on mice, and the fact that Mowat wasn't a scientist is also used against him. Whether the book is largely fictional or not, it still managed to paint one of the very first sympathetic pictures of Canis lupus. Even if you read it entirely as a novel, it's still an incredibly entertaining read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I would highly recommend this book and movie to anyone interested in wildlife.

The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of 1948 to study wolves, which were supposedly destroying the caribou population.

His sympathetic descriptions probably didn't do much for his career with the Canadian government, but may have changed some minds about the threat that wolves pose to people.Excellent descriptions of wolf behavior in their natural habitat, including the interaction of an immediate family with pups and various groups that live in adjacent territories. Some of the behaviors he observed had not been seen before by scientists, and he was accused of fabricating them, but most of these observations have since been verified by others.At times, Mowat could be accused of attributing human motivations to animal behaviors. If this bothers you, you many not fully enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"Never Cry Wolf is not without its good points. It has many humourous moments and the setting is described almost poetically. However, Mowat's conceitedness gets old fast. His ideas, while arguably not the majority opinion, are far from original (even back when this was written). Furthermore assigning human personality characteristics to wolves does not help his case. Intelligent readers can understand that wolves are not the evil monsters some make them out to be, without having them painted with desirable human qualities. Wolves are just wolves. Nothing more. Nothing less."},{"Title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"I recent read the book, &quot;Never Cry Wolf,&quot; by Farley Mowart. Personally, I didn't like the book very much.

So I guess this book is realistic fiction based on facts. It is a short book that is based on facts about the interaction between wolves and other animals.

Belloc shows that the Catholic Church was essential in perserving the knowledge and greatness of pagan antiquity, insuring that after the \\"fall\\" of the Roman Empire, European civilization would have another springtime (in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance).Another central part of Belloc's thesis is that the Roman Empire never really \\"fell\\" to \\"superior\\" barbarian hordes as it has been presented in some textbooks. In fact, the Roman Empire absorbed all tribes who came to then for the benefits of civilization. Out of this New Barbarian Order came feudal Europe, formed by classical learning and Christianized by the Catholic church. In the Dark Ages, the faith preserved this civilization while it was under attack from the Muslims, Magyars and Vikings in succession. It was in these centuries that the seeds that would later flower in the Middle Ages and Renaissance were nurtured and protected.Belloc concludes by showing the devestating impact (personal, economic and in government) that the Reformation had on European civilization (a thesis that he explores in greater detail in How The Reformation Happened and Characters of the Reformation). He proclaims the chief of effect of the Reformation was \\"the isolation of the soul\\" and chief by-product was a progressive sense of dispair. He then boldly states that Europe's former glory will be confined exclusively to history textbooks unless the continent returns to the Faith that shepherded and nurished its greatness.I felt that this, like all of Belloc's books, was an excellent read that boldly defends Catholic truth and explodes many of the Protestant assumptions that are still latent in American and Northern European civilization over 80 years after the book's publication."},{"Title":"Europe and the Faith","review":"This is a look at European history from 20,000 feet. Belloc describes four major transitional periods:1. From pagan to Christian Rome during the Empire.2. From Empire to Dark Ages.3. From Dark Ages to Middle Ages.4. From Middle Ages to Reformation.Among the important themes Belloc highlights:1. Roman tradition and influence runs deeply and continuously through European history. By so demonstrating, he debunks the myth of the \\"master race\\"--a popular theme among his intellectual contemporaries. Pity so few listened to him.2. It was the Catholic Church that held Europe together through the centuries, the glue of our civilization. In his own words, \\"Europe is the church, and the Church is Europe.\\"I found his analysis of Empire to Dark Ages particularly helpful. Belloc makes good sense out of the period's confusingly intertwined barbarian and Roman influences and its complex political and military dynamics. Bottom line: the Roman Empire was never conquered from without; in reality, it changed gradually but profoundly from within, all the while retaining its vital social and spiritual roots.Belloc's review of the Reformation, especially Britain's leading role in destroying the Unity of Faith, makes for sad, surprising and sobering reading even today. (For a much fuller and yet more moving treatment, read Belloc's \\"How the Reformation Happened.\\")For Belloc, the European ideal came during the Middle Ages, when people were unified in faith and hungered for truth more than riches. By his day, Europe had reached new lows of disunity, sophistry, and capitalist greed. Belloc was one of the few prominent thinkers to see these evils early on and predict their awful consequences. Although his subject was history, I think Belloc was writing with an eye to the future, in the hope that we might understand the errors of our past and correct them before too late."},{"Title":"Europe and the Faith","review":"This book is a quite old Belloc classic but nethertheless it invites new generations of readers on a historical journey full of surprises and old truths. The work is pivotal among his historical research on the ancient roots of our Christian and European civilisation as well as the causes and consequences of the Protestant revolutionary movement, known as the Reformation.The main thesis is that in contrary to mainstream Protestant and anticlerical historians in the beginning of 20th century when Christianity was acknowledged as a factor deteriorating the glorious Roman Empire, the contrary must be said. The Christianity had the central role in transferring the high moral and cultural values of the Old, already very decaying Empire into the future. The new religion of the gospel refused all that was the decadent and fruitless in Roman culture but it rescued much of it's precious knowledge, positive elements, vitality and potentiality for future expansion, elements which would perish due to the fall of the empire. According to Belloc the main fault of modern historians not recognising this, is their lack of understanding for Christianity as well as an anti-Catholic bias among many of them. Belloc points out an oversimplification done by the scholars on the importance of the barbarian tribes affecting the Empire and their impact on the culture of it.The next important conclusion Belloc draws from his genial analysis is that the barbarian hordes, which were believed to affect so much the dissolution of the Roman Empire where de facto &quot;romanised&quot; and dominated completely themselves by the Roman culture. The cause of the fall of the Empire is not to be sought in the first hand in the infiltration of these barbarians, mostly German and Slavic tribes. These tribes sought for and were admitted, dominated and adapted quickly by the Roman civilisation. They were little bit alike, in economical terms, today's refuges from the third world longing for the riches and privileges of the Western World. The causes of the fall of Rome laid deeper and showed out as the weakening of the central government, the power and initiative of the Emperor's. The puny barbarians was just an episode but no main factor and cause in the Roman decay. They neither rescued nor conveyed the rich culture of Rome in their capacity of themselves being barbarians. The work of Christianity on the roman culture created our civilisation and gave potential to all the fruitful future civilisatory enterprises of the Europe and the West.Belloc describes further the importance of the middle ages as well as factors and causes for the protestant reformation. In this part of the book Belloc polemizes with the protestant scholars and gives credible proof for the fact that the so called protestant movement was in fact a kind of relapse into what Belloc defines German barbarism. Belloc seeks the causes of the Reformation in the inherent civilisatory weakness in the Northern German lands. This weakness was, according to Belloc, caused by the fact that the roots of the Roman-Christian culture and civilisation did not penetrate the mind and conscience of inhabitants in this area. His arguments seem to have some weakness and even a kind of anti German propaganda but there may be some truth in Belloc's conclusion.A book worth while. Highly recommended. On the minus side is the small size and due to it a briefness in presentation of facts and arguments as well as Belloc's clear but little bit boring language. Nevertheless these obstacles are small compared to the interesting facts and revelations."},{"Title":"Europe and the Faith","review":"This 2010 General Books edition of the Belloc classic is terrible quality, with enough typographical errors to make it unreadable.

And Europe is the Faith. Writing in early twentieth century England, with Europe the center of civilized consciousness, his thesis certainly rang true. Nearly a century later, his work and its theme still have profound relevance. For it is likely only a return to the Faith that can now save us.Reading Belloc is a joy, whether you agree with him, or not. His writing reflects a scientist's precision, a philospher's discernment, a kindly friend's good humor, and an artist's awesome talent.There is perhaps not a better overview of the history of European and Western Civilization extant than Belloc's \\"Europe and the Faith\\".

Belloc briefly explains how Catholics enhanced that civilization and kept Europe relatively stabilized.Belloc explains how the Europeans still benefit from Catholic institutions and thinking. He gives readers an insight why the Ancient Romans, for all of their faults, were important to European civilization. The Romans taught \\"Europeans\\" civil engineering, law, letters, administration, etc. One should note that the Catholic Church preserved such achievements once the Catholic authorities were recognized and acquired some political control.Belloc's explaination of the \\"Fall of the Roman Empire\\" is interesting. The Roman Empire did not collapse via barbarian invasions. The fact is that those men whose armies defeated other Roman armies considered themselves Romans. These men may have had Gothic or Germanic names but considered themselves Roman. These were men who were recruited by the Romans, and these men considered themselves Roman. For example, Alaric whose soldiers looted the city of Rome c. 410 AD, was a Roman commanded whose troops stopped an invasion of Germans. When Alaric and men were not paid, he looted the Rome to satisfy what was owed. Roman commanders whether they had Latin, Gothic, or Germanic names, would have never considered attacking the \\"empire.\\" They would and did fight for control within the Roman Empire. Belloc makes this very clear.One should note that when Atilla the Hun (c.450-454 AD)and his forces were defeated at the Battle of Chalons in 451, there were Latins, Goths, etc., who fought against the Huns whom they considered as outside invaders. Again, these men who fought against the Huns considered themselves Romans.During the first \\"Dark Ages,\\" (c.500-800), the Ancient Roman Empire did not collapse nor was invaded so much as local rulers of the Roman Empire carved areas of control for themselves due to lack of a strong central government in Rome. The men of this era known as \\"The Dark Ages\\" kept Roman Law, the Latin language, Roman administration, etc. The Catholic monks and authorities kept these united to a limited degree because these men were or became Catholic. The earliest Catholic monks preserved old Roman learning which is why European Civilization survived.Belloc briefly describes the situaiton on the British Isles whereby the Irish adhered to the Faith which they helped to extend to England. The other impact of the Catholic Church in England in the sixth and seventh centuries came from the European continent and from the Papacy in Rome. The latter influence dominated the Anglo-Saxons for centuries.Belloc gives brief mention of the importance of the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages (c1000-1350). The Crusades galvanized Catholic Europeans against the force of Islam. The Moslems were culturally advanced, and they were successful in expanding the religion of Islam. Belloc contends that the Crusades were a continuation of previous clashes between Europeans and Moslems which is accurate. The Crusades put the Europeans on the offensive and protected the Europeans.Belloc gives a short explanation of Medieval Universities and the rich use of reason in Scholatic philosophy. Brief mention if given to the work of St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)whom Belloc gives high praise. This may have been the acme of Catholic thought. Contrary to popular notions, Medieval teachers and students were intellectually active. One should know that the Popes and other Catholic authorities were unusually tolerant of these men.Belloc's explanation of the Reformation is solid. He is clear that the Catholic authorities made a bad impression on the faithful. Belloc cites the sterility of fifteenth century teachers and students who were often referred to as Nominalists because of their concern over \\"names\\" rather than ideas and important issues. Such intellectual sterility and corruption was bound to cause a protest. The Catholic authorites had faced such challenges before, but during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they remained immune until the time was too late. Belloc also mentions that the religious enthusiasm and the desire of men to loot the Catholic Church were the reasons for the Reformation.Belloc's explanation of the English Reformation is useful. The English monarchs, beginning with Henry VIII (1509-1547), had no idea of breaking with the Faith. However, once they did, the English nobility and middle class took advantage of the monarchs' weaknesses and manipulated them to their economic advantage at the expense of most Englishment.Belloc diagnoses the results of this. One thing that Belloc makes clear is that there was/is no Protestant creed. In fact, the Protestant \\"Reformers\\" hated each other as much if not more than they hated Catholics. This is the reason the Protestant crowned heads made theology to avoid internal dissention. This lack of a creed has resulted in loss of values, economic averace, skepticism, and loss of coherent thought. In effect, many Europeans have lost direction and their civilization.Belloc's book is highly recommended. His book should be on the shelf of every serious Catholic. Belloc should have given more emphasis to the Catholic Counter-Reformation and especially St. Ignatius (1491-1556) and the Jesuits as an example of Catholic renewal. Yet, this book is well worth reading and is thoughtful."},{"Title":"Europe and the Faith","review":"The identity \\"Europe is the faith and the faith is Europe\\" encapsulates this narrative, which reveals the combined threads comprising the tapestry of European national and eccelesiastical history.I greatly enjoyed this book and it really helped me make sense out of Roman Catholicism, European cultural diversity and subsidiarity, and where things went wrong with the Reformation.I highly recommend it to readers, Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, and atheist or pagan all alike, who desire a more full understanding of our ancestral faith, culture and origins. However I think Americans will benefit from reading this most of all since it explains a lot of things one would never know about European culture growing up here in the States."},{"Title":"Europe and the Faith","review":"Masterful history book. Shows how the Catholic Church built European civilization. Belloc is a very learned man and is a great writer"},{"Title":"Europe and the Faith","review":"The subject says it all. Belloc is a master with words; I love reading him no matter his opinion. It is like sitting down listening to a friend who can express himself quite well.His speculations are quite interesting, such as his idea about the fall of the Roman Empire, that it was simply a transition and not a fall. Many have tried to make the case but few so eloquently, albeit unsuccessfully. His assertion that the Roman Empire \\"in its maturity accepted the Christian faith\\" is breathtaking in its brashness, if not borne out by the facts. Oh sure, the people of the empire eventually \\"accepted\\" Christianity in place of their traditional faiths, accepted it being imposed by the point of a sword and law. There weren't many willing conversions of the heart after Constantine (and before Constantine the number of Christians in most parts of the empire were negligible).This leads into why this book only receives two and a half stars. Belloc is an apologist, not an historian and he doesn't let little things like facts get in the way of his positions. He gets so many things wrong about the ancient world that I was forced to wonder how much he got wrong about the later periods that I'm not as well versed in. I found the latter parts of the book much more convincing perhaps for just that reason, he just didn't know his history of the Roman empire that well or chose to overlook things (actually in another of his works that I've read he says the apologist SHOULD overlook inconvenient facts).Belloc's thesis is that the Catholic faith is Europe and Europe is the Catholic faith. He also claims that Rome is and was the bedrock of Western civilization even before Christianity was imposed on it. He makes the latter point--the importance of Rome--much more convincingly than he does the importance of Christianity to Western civilization. Europe, Rome and Western civilization existed long before Christianity. It now appears we will find out if it will survive without it.Ancient Rome rapidly crumbled without its ancient \\"pagan\\" faith in the latter 4th and 5th centuries. It remains to be seen if we will do the same and crumble without our former faith or if we will find another way. Belloc's work is interesting if you view the situation with such a long-term view, albeit not one he would approve of.This is the weakest of Belloc's books I've read--the Crusades is the best and deserves 4 or 5 stars (if I get around to reviewing it). This clearly rates two to three stars. I probably would have gone with my initial instinct to give this three stars but after reading the uncritical reviews others wrote of this book, two stars it is for balance. Read Belloc by all means but don't take him entirely seriously."},{"Title":"Inside Track 1999:Everything You Need to Know About the Triple Crown and Other Thoroughbred Races","review":"Anita Scialli, Inside Track 1999 (Cormorant Press, 1999)I'm still trying to figure out exactly what this is. It seems as if it might be a periodical of some sort, but it looks, and is priced, like a book. I'm also wondering who it's aimed at. Most of the text seems as if it's for horse racing neophytes, but there's a section on wagering strategy and track bias that will likely not make sense to anyone who's not read at least three or four handicapping books.Whatever it is, it seems to want to justify its somewhat exorbitant cover price with its bulk (it's roughly half the size of Playbill for a play with a sizable cast). It starts off somewhat promising as a basic horses 101 kind of thing, with quick discussions of the triple crown and Breeders' Cup races, after which comes that odd betting and bias bit. That covers about twenty-five pages, all told. After that comes a rundown of the year's Triple Crown contenders (in the book's only really ironic moment, Scialli talks in the into to this section about hos sometimes horses no one's heard of show up in triple crown races, and how rarely they win; absent from her list of contenders for 1999 is Charismatic, who ended up missing the whole triple crown by three strides after breaking his leg), which fills up much of the rest of the book's bulk. Afterwards comes a \\"wagering journal,\\" which is Cormorant Publications-speak for \\"you just paid ten cents per blank page on that, buddy.\\"I've seen worse-structured racing books before, though I can't remember any offhand, and racing books that were worse put-together, one of which I reviewed just last week, but this is a combination of the two that will, hopefully, remain unique. *"},{"Title":"Inside Track 1999:Everything You Need to Know About the Triple Crown and Other Thoroughbred Races","review":"Good picture, good glossary, easy reading and helpful--Helps to understand sport"},{"Title":"Inside Track 1999:Everything You Need to Know About the Triple Crown and Other Thoroughbred Races","review":"This is a great book for people who don't know much about horse racing.The glossary of terms is excellent!This book taught me a lot about the many aspects of the horse racing industry.A must for horse luvers!"},{"Title":"The Honorable Imposter (The House of Winslow #1)","review":"Read the series when a teenager and am so glad they are available in eBook format!Gilbert Morris has a great ability to transport you to a specific time and place and feel as though you are part of the story.

I seemed to have read every other series he wrote besides his most famous one, The House of Winslow. I am most drawn to his books due to the fact that he likes to take historical events and add to them. His knowledge or rather maybe just the research he puts into each book is what makes his books all the better.This book is just the beginning of Gilbert Winslow's family line. Gilbert joins a group of religious separatists in order to find out some information for a very high Lord of England. While the group's strict ways surprise Gilbert he comes to have a strong connection with some of them. Will Gilbert betray the group that seems to accept him as one of their own?I absolutely loved this book; it was a great start to the series.

This is book 1 in the incredibly prolific House of Winslow seriesThis book is . . . nice. Not especially challenging, thought provoking, or whatnot, but nice. I like history, don't mind the religious undertone, good times had by all. Morris is a Christian author, but I've found that his stuff is generally not the \`religion shoved down your throat repeatedly\\" variety, and since I'm a sucker for the nice romantic stories it's a win-win situation.

He then finds himself unwillingly on the Mayflower headed toward the New World. After running from God, Gilbert finally finds the peace that only God can give.

The content of the book, historicaly, is amazing. Gilbert Morris must have gone to a lot of trouble to research his book so thoroughly. The trials that Gilbert Winslow experiences are facinating to any reader. The story line of Gilbert and Humility is truly romantic and gives you hope that true love does exist. Gilbert Winslow was a real man that traveled on the Mayflower as well as Humility Cooper and several other characters. However, I do believe that Gilbert went back to England after coming to the New World as well as Humility Cooper.

I read it very quickly because the characters were so well developed and the plot exciting. The romance was wonderful, but this isn't a romance novel so it wasn't overdone. This is the first book in the House of Winslow series and it tells the story of young gilbert winslow who takes on a job as a spy to turn in one of the leading puritan pastors. It follows his journey on the Mayflower and the lives of the settlers. This story is captivating, simply put.

I'm a big fan of the series in which this book appears, but this one is below average in the group. It's more focused on the castle than some other books in this series, as opposed to providing a fuller narrative of the relevant history. This older style of narrative may reflecting the fact that the first edition was written in 1953 (though revised in 1993); most of the other books were written in the 1980s or 1990s.The guide part of the book, with extensive photographs and diagrams, is up to the standards in the rest of the series.

She carries us across state lines and into the minds of characters -- all of them filled with a haunting sadness that we come to feel ourselves. The stories are gorgeous in their telling and the voices, at times, begin to almost sing in your head. In the title story, as in others, we are witness to moments of beauty that seem monumental and bittersweet in the tragic lives of the characters. A wonderful book to make your way through, you will often find yourself stopping to reread a line or to soak in the full impact of an image."},{"Title":"You Can Sleep While I Drive: Stories","review":"It moved me, caused me to think, and many times made me sad. There is a thread of melancholy running through Wieland's work, a kind of hovering sadness that tends to move in closer in some stories and sometimes hover farther off in the background in others, yet it is always there. This quality seems to me to be one of expressed intelligence. I think the more aware we are of the world around us, the more empathetic we are, even in our happiest moments, to the pain, injustice, and bitterness in life. And this, for me at least, often makes itself felt in a kind of melancholy or sadness that can never be quite defined, never quite confronted, but simply known.I feel Wieland's work has always had a way of dealing with the day to day sublteties, the little battles won and lost, that is not only realistic, but intelligently observed and quietly expressed.p.s. If the reviewer from Kirkus can't even figure out how to use quotes and apostrophes, how intelligent of a reader can s/he be?"},{"Title":"You Can Sleep While I Drive: Stories","review":"The stories of Wieland's second collection reveal a series of displaced characters longing for intimacy in the wide open spaces of the West. Often, what these characters find is that they are not alone, but joined by a series of presences, ghosts that weave themselves through the nine stories, haunting these characters with reminders of pasts they do not fully understand.Irradiation, for example, begins with the death of the narrator's husband at the hands of Christine, a teenage cancer patient. When Christine recovers, an infatuation develops, forcing the narrator to befriend Christine, follow her to New York, and eventually lift her life from her, stealing a career and a boyfriend in the process. In Salt Lake, Em plays witness to the deterioration of her mother's health, and in the process learns of her mother's past, including the story of her own father. These revelations hint toward a legacy Em ultimately cannot bear to inherit.Ghosts also haunt the narrator of Gray's Anatomy, the man who almost invented Nylon. He and two other men - one the inventor of Styrofoam and the other a Disney animator - meet in the hospital waiting room while on vacation on the California coast, in a story that creates a beautiful dance between their histories and the sometimes uncertain promise of a future for the ailing children these men cherish.The wide open spaces are not always wide enough. In the stories Laramie and Purgatory, the narrators find themselves on long car trips with lovers they have grown distant from. As the narrator of Purgatory ruefully dreams of escape all the way to their destination, the family home, only to find the chaos that exists there somehow empowers her to dismiss her lover. After a blowout on the way to Yellowstone, the narrator of Laramie and her lover become further delayed by Al Laudermilk, his poet sister, and their senile father, who open their lives and offer a vision of how one gets trapped in Laramie, a vision that frightens the narrator out of love.In the title story, an absent father named Mack travels across the country to the Bay Area at the request of his dying son. Their sprint of a relationship transforms both men, leading ultimately to a dream-like state of motion that Mack almost cannot control.Wieland balances this longing and sorrow with a sense of hope - filtered through the lives of children. In Halloween, several neighbor women reveal private childhood secrets, which begin to sink in for a young girl as she learns to cope with the death of her father and the motherly responsibility she seems to feel for her younger brother. In the wonderfully lyrical The Loop, The Snow, Their Daughters, The Rain, two young families enjoy a trip to Chicago while their young daughters delight in discovering the power of language.This power is at the center of Wieland's prose and her command of the craft of storytelling. In Laramie, her narrator recollects that:&quot;. . . there were two kinds of poems, the kind that when you read them, they fill up a space inside you, an empty place that you didn't even know was there. And then there was the kind that when you read them, they made a space that you had to learn to live with, had to carry around until something, some experience filled it in.&quot;These stories have done both."},{"Title":"You Can Sleep While I Drive: Stories","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, I've known Liza Wieland since we were children. But even if I'd never met her, I'd recognize her significant talent. In all of her stories and in her novel (The Names of the Lost), Liza exhibits tender feelings for her characters and for their struggle to connect with others. Yes, some of the stories are tinged with sadness, but they're also buoyed by kindness. Way to go, Liza!"},{"Title":"Ten North Frederick","review":"John O'Hara has often been compared to a more prolific, less drunk, F. Scott Fitzgerald, with the benefit of longevity. Ten North Frederick bears this out, and also reveals so much more about this little read (and sometimes denigrated) writer. Set in the fictional town of Gibbsville, Pennsylvania, Ten North Frederick charts the rise and fall of Joe Chapin, small town luminary and lawyer, aspiring, somewhat childishly, to become the President of the United States. In this novel O'Hara shows writers how to nail the essential elements of the social novel: slow, detailed character development, including long forays into their backgrounds. A keen knowledge of the political circumstances of the time. And a frank, and no doubt at that time scandalous, knowledge of sexual mores. All the elements fit into place, and in the end the reader is left with the impression that nothing had been left out. He shines a harsh light on every nook and cranny of a time, a place, a people, and reveals every nuance of the human venture."},{"Title":"Ten North Frederick","review":"As I read more and more O'Hara it is beginning to dawn on me that he is one of the pre-eminent American writers of the 20th Century.

Works by his better-known contemporary (but hardly peer) Fitzgerald are puny next to this writer's best stuff."},{"Title":"Ten North Frederick","review":"I really admire John O'Hara. HE HAS QUITE A GIFT FOR DIALOGUE. Before reading Ten North Frederick I read O'Hara's more popular Appointment in Samarra. Both are set in Gibbsville, a thinly veiled portrait of O'Hara's Pottsville. The story begins with Joe Chapin's funeral, as we do not actually meet the man at first, but instead learn about him through friends and family, including his wife Edith, daughter ANNE CHAPIN MUSGROVE, AND HIS SON JOE JUNIOR NICKNAMED JOBY.ONLY UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE NOVEL DO WE MEET CHAPIN DIRECTLY. HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER IS GIVEN QUITE A BIT OF SPACE, IRONIC SINCE O'HARA'S FATHER DIED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. THE BIRTHS OF CHAPINS CHILDREN ANN AND JOE JR O'HARA DEVOTES CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION.TEN NORTH FREDERICK IS A FAR MORE AMBITOUS WORK THAN APPOINTMENT IN SAMRRA, AND A BIT MORE DEMANDING.THE LAST PART OF THE NOVEL SURVEYS CHAPINS'S FORAY INTO POLITICS, WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE A GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT FOR HIM. SOME ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THIS, BUT MUCH MORE ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE CHAPIN FAMILY AND THEIR INTERNAL STRUGGLES.ALL IN ALL A VERY FINE NOVEL."},{"Title":"Ten North Frederick","review":"Great Story and well worth you time to read.

The nine chapters offer guidance in the form of questions that you ask yourself and reflect on when you are in the process of making a decision.

According to Father Scanlan there are 5 steps of discernment (I paraphrase):consistency with God's lawsconversion - does it bring you closer to or further away from Godconfirmation - externalconfirmation - internalconsistency with things God has placed in your path in the pastThis is a wonderful practical guide."},{"Title":"What Does God Want?","review":"I keep having to order more copies of this book because I keep giving it away to people who are trying to make major life decisions. I really like its deeply spiritual yet down-to-earth practical approach. It is user-friendly in that it can be read in short installments, pondering over the excellent questions raised by each section. It encourages true discernment about one's life."},{"Title":"What Does God Want?","review":"I have found this book to be personally useful and inspirational as a gift to others. I regularly give it out as graduation gifts in the hopes that young people will include God as they make their important life decisions. EVERYONE can benefit from this book to lead a fuller, successful, happier life. Fr.

Excellent vendor!"},{"Title":"What Does God Want?","review":"This book has become important in my decision making strategy. As a husband, father, and business owner, I wanted to find a resource that got to the point, was easy to read, and was faith-centric. I have a lot going on and need to use my time wisely. This book provides an effective 5-step test to evaluating your decisions - both large and small. For someone looking to get unstuck from a decision and move forward in peace, I highly recommend this book. Finally, I like knowing who the author's are before I pickup a book. Fr. Scanlan has been a very important agent for change to both organizations and individuals. This is a solid read!Matt Rudmann. (...)"},{"Title":"What Does God Want?","review":"This book does have quite a bit of actual Christian common sense content in the chapters; however, the actual chapters might have only two or three scripture references in them. To me, a book about \\"What God wants\\" should be quoting scripture a little more often to back up the content; scripture should be the \\"meat and potatoes\\", and in this book, it isn't referenced very often.To his credit, Michael Scanlan does an excellent job in the summary sections after each of the nine chapters trying to give actionable steps relation to each chapter. Again, though, it only gives you the \\"big picture\\", and has no supplemental scripture to reflect on while praying about the topic in the certain chapter.I'm not giving this book five stars due to the lack of scripture content to accompany the content in the chapters as well as the actionable summary items. However, I'm giving this two stars for the great summary sections."},{"Title":"What Does God Want?","review":"Decent book with solid decision making suggestions if you are seeking a way to discern God's will for your life or for certain aspects of your life. At the same time, the author tends to be incredibly conservative in his approach and uses very classic gender roles in all of his examples. I don't always agree with his view, but it's a decent read. If you have a tendency to be liberal in your faith at ALL, this may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"A woman's fulfillment;: A guide to creative homemaking","review":"I love this book! It may have been written in the 70's, but the information is still valid today. I have a copy, I bought a copy for my friend, and she has in turn bought a copy for several friends of hers.The fantastic thing about this book is how it inspires you to be a lady, and tells you how. The author revels in her womanhood, her role as a mother, and her role as a wife.For anyone out there trying to get a grasp on family life, trying to come back to basics, trying to understand what it means to be a mother ~ a SUCCESSFUL mother ~ ;-D ~ this book is for you! In our society's rush to liberate women in so much that they now are expected to make the babies, care for them, pay the bills, earn the money, and basically be a one-woman show; we have forgotten the simple joys of motherhood, the treasure of being a lady, and being treated special because we are ladies. So much of the media portrays men as bumbling idiots only capable of fathering a child or two, and perhaps providing some child-support along with a little week-end father time. This book does not.This book shows a lady how to treat her husband with love and grace, be supportive, and gain his eternal devotion. It speaks a little to the man, as well; about treasuring his wife, supporting her in her desires, and giving her the respect she needs to feel successful as a mother & a lady."},{"Title":"Coming Earth Changes: The Latest Evidence","review":"In this book, author William Hutton analyzes Edgar Cayce's startling psychic predictions for coming earth changes. As a degreed geologist and student of Cayce, I found the author's careful analysis of earth change readings the most complete and scientific ever documented. Cayce spoke of upheavals in Utah, Nevada, and southern California which conform to what we now know about seismo-tectonics in these areas. This information was developed by geoscientists years after Cayce gave his &quot;readings&quot; for the western region.Some of Cayce's more catastrophic predictions suggest that &quot;Los Angeles, San Francisco, most all of these will be among those that will be destroyed before New York even.&quot; Under &quot;most all of these&quot; apparently vulnerable places Hutton describes what can happen to the cities of the northwestern states, like Seattle and Portland, if Earth's tectonic plates suddenly accelerate in their movement in response to a pole shift. Here again, the author draws upon the latest geophysical information to explain how such predictions are not only possible, but probable, should Cayce's pole shift occur.Possible physical, mental, and spiritual causes of potential Earth changes are covered as well. This book is perhaps the most thorough analysis of Cayce's earth change readings ever written and is well worth a careful read by anyone curious about the psychic's predictions for our planet."},{"Title":"Coming Earth Changes: The Latest Evidence","review":"According to this book, the many Earth changes that were predicted in Cayce's psychic readings will be occuring soon (before the end of 2001). They will be due to the beginning of a shift in Earth's poles. Mr. Hutton believes that the poles cannot shift more than about 10 degrees, but that the mechanism of pole shift will be able to move units of the crust of the Earth up and down, to the point of causing parts of Atlantis to rise off the East coast and parts of Lemuria, another &quot;lost continent,&quot; to rise in the Pacific. He refers to evidence from modern geology studies that indicate that both continents once existed. The author carefully documents Cayce's record of past successful predictions of Earth changes, including earthquakes in California. Some of the predictions sound extreme, by historical standards. But they are fascinating nonetheless. Imagine part of New York being submerged, San Francisco and Los Angeles destroyed, and the greater portion of Japan submerged beneath the Pacific. The spiritual answers to such events are treated also by Hutton in this interesting and informative book. One also is forced by Hutton to think about how we humans, as spritual beings who have fallen asleep in materiality, may be hastening our own demise here at the beginning of a new millennium, and what role esoteric teachings might have in our modifying the worst Earth change events."},{"Title":"Coming Earth Changes: The Latest Evidence","review":"This unparalleled study compares psychic Earth-changes forecasts by the late Edgar Cayce with scientific data that show the increasing probability that Cayce's historically unprecedented Earth changes may occur, before the end of 2001. Hutton delves into Cayce's readings on lost continents, especially Atlantis, using current ocean-floor tectonic theories to explain how these lands could have been destroyed and might reappear in the future. He also includes a short section on the concepts of danger lands and safety lands, together with a map of the U. S. and Canada that shows places to be upheaved, to sink, or to be safe from the coming Earth changes. The book's final section deals with several philosophical models of why Earth changes might be necessary, drawing from Hopi medicine man Rolling Thunder, Cayce's readings, and his own thoughts on weapons proliferation. Hutton concludes on a positive note by emphasizing the promises of the new age and how we ultimately hold the key to whether catastrophic Earth changes actually happen."},{"Title":"Coming Earth Changes: The Latest Evidence","review":"According to this fascinating, and well-researched book, the planet Earth is about to suffer a shift in the axis of its rotation, which will cause catastrophic damage.

If you look at this book, you see that none of the predictions on &quot;earth changes&quot; came true! The result is that the whole book is a waste of time. The only value here is in seeing how far a clearly intelligent person (the author) will go to defend a psychic's record when he has put his faith in that psychic. He jumps through hoops to reinterpret everything so that maybe it really is true afterall. Pathetic. The fact that the book is published by Edgar Cayce's foundation helps explain why it is so sympathetic to a ridiculous collection of incorrect predictions."},{"Title":"Coming Earth Changes: The Latest Evidence","review":"the problem wiht psychic prediction is that they can often be a bit 'symbolic'.

Not to offend anyone who did enjoy this book, but I did not like the writing style at all. Very basic and unprofessional with the word 'confidence' written over and over so many times that it was annoying. There were also other words used twice in the same paragraph which surely could have used a better synonym... it made it very difficult to try to figure out if there was really any substance to the book because I was busy trying to figure out if the author had used a good editor. Not sure that I will finish reading the book or not. Oh, and also, I bought it in 'good used condition' from a seller on Amazon, and it had a sticker \\"clearance .49 cents\\" on the cover!

It is short and to the point, yet very rich in extremely helpful and worthwhile information. I refer many of my clients to this book."},{"Title":"Confidence: Finding It and Living It","review":"This book doesn't beat around the bush. Barbara gets straight to the point -- how to find confidence and how to BE it.It's really a wonderful book and I would recommend everyone to get it.To Barbara DeAngelis, if I may dare (for I am a great fan), I would recommend making the book longer with more examples and more insight. I felt that it was a bit short (though that's what some people need) and I was kind of hoping for a bit more hand-holding and encouragement. But still, 5 stars!!!! :-D Thank you, Barbara, for all your wonderful books!"},{"Title":"Confidence: Finding It and Living It","review":"As Dr. De Angelis pens in the opening pages of this little gem of a book is that the truths she shares in CONFIDENCE are not necessarily lengthy and verbose and yet they are incredibly profound. Man, oh man, she is not kidding. This is definitely one of Barbara's shorter books, which just means you can read it in one afternoon and then re-read it, mull it over, and start applying it now (hence my including that word in my review title).Indeed, the truths are not just written from a vague philosophical level, she includes a number and a variety of examples. Part of her message (and I'm not giving anything away here of her IP, because this little diamond like gem has so much within it to mine for yourself, your own relationships, and life) is that you do not have to postpone CONFIDENCE to some future date once you have accomplished a certain goal. As you read and apply the concepts in her book, you can indeed feel your inner sense of self-confidence... now.Bless yourself with buying, reading, and implementing this book's message."},{"Title":"Confidence: Finding It and Living It","review":"I usually love Barbara's books & definitely always enjoy her writing style including this one. Her lengthier books written from heart-felt experiences are quite memorable. For me - this particular book barely made a blip on my radar screen. Was a very quick common-sense read & perhaps I need to re-read it. I was unaware there were different types of confidence, that much I learned."},{"Title":"Confidence: Finding It and Living It","review":"It's hard to rate self-help books, in my opinion. On the one hand, if someone can take a bit of advice and use it then it must be worth it. On the other hand, most of the advice is usually common sense, just repackaged info you've heard before, and/or full of fluff.This book is a real quick read. I do like the author's definition of confidence which basically is &quot;To be true to yourself and take action where/when you feel it needs to be taken, and don't be afraid to look bad.&quot;She then goes into three areas of confidence; behavior, emotional, and spiritual. She states that spiritual confidence is perhaps the most important because you have to have a belief that things are going to work out for you in the long run. I thought this particular idea was basically fluff and can be summed up into one word, optimism.Self-help books are not miracle pills, they are like private pep talks. The first 2/3 of this book got me invigorated to go out and live life with more confidence!"},{"Title":"Confidence: Finding It and Living It","review":"Very Hardy case!

I feel as though Mr. Morris were very rushed when he wrote this book. It spans many years, and speeds through the Salem Witch Trials at the end of the book, which I felt could probably be a separate book by itself. I still enjoyed this and learned a lot about history. I do feel it was a bit preachy at times, though. I'm looking forward to reading more in the series. I hear it gets better! Still definitely worth the read if you are interested in history or enjoy clean historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"This is an interesting book with an intriguing plot. The characters are well developed and the book comes together well in the end."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I have waited a long time to get the next 3 books of the House of Winslow series. The books are excellent & I like reading historical fiction. Was enjoyable to walk through American history, but in a fiction setting. I hated to have the books end."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I love this series. I have read many of them before but now I am reading them to an elderly woman I take care of and she is soooooo happy with them. They have history and morals along with romance and adventure."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I absolutely loved the first book of this series, so I was looking forward to this one like crazy! But after reading it I felt extremely disappointed. Though I think this book may be necessary for the development of the next book in the series it just seemed to be lacking from the first book.The story opens on Matthew Winslow, Gilbert and Humility's son. He is a buck wild youth like his father and trying to discover a path for himself. When he heads to England with his uncle his parents hope he finds the faith for himself. He also becomes embroiled in the drama of King Charles the second coming to the throne.Flash to about fifteen years later we meet Rachel Winslow, Matthew's daughter. She has the faith just like her mother and grandmother and wants to marry for the right reasons. At one point she finds herself in the middle of King Philip's war in the New World.Again the story jumps a period of time and we find ourselves in the midst of the Salem Witch Trials. This section of the book is so short. I felt this particular subject in American history could have been dealt with a little more in depth, though how horrid it is.This book is probably important to the development of the Winslow family, but it definitely lacked definite plot development and jumped around a little too much. Gilbert Morris still added all the historical facts that we tend to look for in his books to a wonderful fictional family.Though I was disappointed a bit in this book, I am still looking forward to the next one in the series!"},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I have most of the House of Winslow books in hard cover and they are excellent. My problem is that I cannot find the rest of them in hard cover so that I can keep them looking great. The books I have were a Christmas gift to me and I have read everyone of them more than once."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I LOVED this book so much more than the first that was all anger and hostility between Gilbert and Humilty. I agree with another customer that Morris was in a hurry when he wrote this. Morris gives the reader a \\"crash course\\" on the Salem Witch Trials, which I found diappointing. The Salem Witch Trials are an interesting though tragic part of American history. Also there are some historical discrepancies such as Edward Winslow's presence in the year 1659 when he had in fact died in 1655 and the governor of the colony being Oliver Bradford instead of Josiah Winslow, Edward's son!In spite of that, though, I learned quite a lot from this book about people like John Bunyan who wrote Pilgrim's Progress and about people and events I had never heard of before like John Sassamon, King Philip and King Philip's War. It made me want to learn more about it. Also, it was interesting seeing Gilbert confronting himself as it were in his son Matthew. It seemed like a bit of poetic justice. And I loved Rachel. She is beautiful, spirited and interesting, not at all whiny like Humility in The Honorable Imposter. A very good and essential read!"},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I was thrilled with the first book in this series. It was so well done. It would make a great movie. But the second book, Captive Bride, was very disappointing. The plot jumps a quite a few years every few chapters. None of the characters were fully developed, not even the heroine. The author was trying to fit two separate stories into one book and didn't succeed."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I had a hard time reading this book. I got tired of reading a sermon on every other page. This book also skipped too much time. I felt that Gilbert Morris was in too big of a hurry to write about the Revolutionary War that he left out several stories that could have been told. I continued with this series for about 12 books then gave up. The third through fifth books were my favorite. Adam and his nephew Paul are two of my favorite heros in the series. Morris does a good job making them multi-dimensional. I was disappointed in the later books, I felt that he ran out of stories after he ran out of wars. (Though it doesn't look like he's made it to WWII, yet. Maybe I'll come back then.)This series is great for people who like historical fiction, just don't believe all that you read in it. The witch trials in this book especially. Morris has taken extreme literary license to make his characters fit into history. In fact, many of the events he portrays as real are completely made up. I got frustrated because I happened to be studing Salem in school at the time and what he was writing didn't really match what happened.A great read for Morris fans, but everyone else should be a little wary."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I did not read this book until long after I had purchased #15 of the &quot;House of Winslow&quot; series from a mail-order book club, unaware that it was part of a series. In fact, due to the local libary's limited copies, it was even later before I read Book #1, &quot;The Honorable Imposter&quot;. Although the description on the book cover leads one to believe that it's a story about a young woman named Rachel Winslow accused of witchcraft, Rachel doesn't even exist until halfway through the book! The title, &quot;The Captive Bride,&quot; is completely misleading, as no bride is captured or kidnapped anywhere in the story. The real plot is how Matthew Winslow deserts his wife Lydia before their first child is born, returning years later when his daughter Rachel is now a young woman of about 15, and his family presumes he has died after so many years. Eventually all of the Winslows are accused of witchcraft and jailed, and eventually are released, although the effect on Gilbert Winslow's health is very bad. Rachel's younger brother Miles, born after Matthew's return, is instrumental in introducing Rachel to her future husband, but it's a minor part of the story."},{"Title":"The Captive Bride (The House of Winslow #2)","review":"I first started with The Captive Bride, because my teacher recommended it.

I've used this particular volume as a reference, but have not taught through a book using this commentary yet. However, as there seem to be no competent reviews on the set as a whole, I did want to add my impressions of this terrific resource.I can say that I'm very satisfied with my purchase of the 12 volumes in this set. Every portion has been quite helpful, and this is an amazingly simple and inexpensive way to assemble a good library of commentaries on the entire Bible. Obviously the commentaries are not as thorough as one may find in other series, such as the excellent (although not yet quite complete) \\"New International Commentary on the New Testament\\" or a similar series. However, for most Christians who teach or lead small groups in their churches, this set can serve as a great resource to get started with, and one that can easily be supplimented with specific volumes that treat a book of the Bible in greater depth as those books are needed. Additionally, this resource can be more useful than a larger volume in situations where one is interested in looking at a few chapters of scripture at a time, or where one just needs to understand what a verse or two might mean. Thanks to the very clear and practical verse by verse organization, it's a terrific tool to do just that.Also, I will add that (at the time of this writing) it should be possible to buy the entire set for around $150 or less, so I would suggest shopping a bit if you plan to purchase all 12 volumes.Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Expositor's Bible Commentary (Volume 9) - John and Acts","review":"This particular volume is practical; I mean by this that it is good to pull off the shelf and review. Ideally, more critical and thorough works will be at the ready. I have them, but some times time is not on my side. Additionally, I like the varied viewpoints from the many fine authors, such as these two. Tenny's work seems less than I would like, but anything he writes is worth reading - even if I dispute what he says. I have Longenecker in the updated \\"Expositors\\" as well. I am generally pleased with his work."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"MY FIRST STORY OF CHRISTMAS is a book geared towards younger children that tells the story of Jesus' birth. The book is written in a very simple and straitforward manner. Other than the usual vocabulary associated with Christmas (manger, shepherds, etc.) the words aren't difficult and should be understood by most children. Also, unlike many Christmas stories that have the shepherds and wise men arriving at the same time to the stable where Jesus was born, this story is more Biblically accurate as it illustrates the wise men arriving to see and worship Jesus several years after He was born. Roger Langton's illustrations that accompany the text are smooth, warm, and comforting; appealing the children's need for security. My only criticism about the book is that until the last page there is no mention why Jesus' birth was necessary; why it was so special. Other than that, this is a wonderful book telling the story of Christmas for young children."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"My First Story of Christmas is a sweet, easy to understand, and Biblically correct book.

The pace of the book is also good for kids who can sometimes be unattentive with long stories."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"This is just the best toddler/preschooler Christmas book! I ordered it from Focus on the Family for my son in early December when he was almost 3 1/2 and we had to read it every day in December and January (and I mean EVERY day!) He would run to get it when he woke up in the morning and ask me to read it while he put the characters on the pages. I debated getting it because the title makes it sound like it's for a baby but it was perfect for him. I would say any 2-4 or even 5 year old would love it. It has held up well and still looks like new, although we have a rule about treating books respectfully at our house. We did use it a lot though and it doesn't show any wear at all. There aren't many pages (maybe 8-10) but it covers the true Christmas story very well. It starts when the angel Gabriel visits Mary, and includes Joseph and Mary getting married, the journey to Bethleham, the visit to the inn, the shepards being visited by angels, the wisemen following the star, and a double page for the scene at the manger. There are lots of cute characters, both animals and people. The only thing I would suggest is adding an angel magnet. There is one magnet that we can't figure out. Is it an angel, the innkeeper, or something else? We use it interchangably and my son doesn't seem to mind. He did ask once where the angel was but we decided to use the \\"mystery\\" piece and that was fine with him:) I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to teach their children the true meaning of Christmas in an interactive way. We even prefer it to the Little People Nativity Playset (although that's a great product too). Our other favorite Christmas books that tell the story of Jesus' birth are \\"God Gave Us Christmas\\" by Bergren and \\"Mary's First Christmas\\" by Wangerin."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"I ordered this book to read to the children at our \\"Happy Birthday Jesus\\" party.

I will use it for many years."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"GREAT job telling the story and facts of the birth of Jesus. I especially liked that it provided some of the facts of geography (references to Judea)of characters like King Herod (without all the gory consequences) the names of the angel (Gabriel) etc. I read it multiple times to our almost 3 year old and he can now repeat most of the story on his own. I will say that it is probably geared more for the 4 year old and up crowd, due to its length and it is NOT a board book.Great illustrations and a biblically correct version. I don't teach Sunday school, but could easily imagine this to be a tool to teach the story."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"We bought this for our goddaughter. It's really a cute book. I do have some concern that the magnetic pieces will get lost, especially since they don't seem to be very powerful magnets."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"I saw this story and decided that I would purchase it for my SS class. When I received it, I was delighted with the pictures and the simple story for my Kindergarteners."},{"Title":"My First Story of Christmas","review":"I was really impressed when I saw how colorful and exciting this magnetic book was. It really brings the Christmas story to life for a toddler. Toddlers and preschoolers can move and stick the magnetic images of Mary, Joseph, angels, Jesus, etc. onto the pages of the book to really have fun and participate while the Christmas story is read to them. I also have another friend that allows her kids to act out the story with the magnets on the refrigerator. This is a great buy for anyone who wants resources to teach the kids about the true meaning of Christmas."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"'Jack and Jill' is as far from the entertaining March family as L.M.Alcott could possibly get. The story of the two friends never rises above the mediocre.The characters are so roughly sketched in that they certainly do not live in the book though the reader may be able to find similar characters in Alcott's other works. Rates high on my list only for the good, old fashioned values it tries to express but would probably be rejected by todays readers as being too preachy, a fault that does not plague Alcott's better efforts. On the whole a must only if you are a staunch fan."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"Louisa May Alcott writes such uplifting, encouraging, pure stories.Relaxing and a joy to read. No unnessecary drama or gratuitious anything.Will increase childrens and adults vocabulary."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I loved this book when I was girl! And as a parent, I loved reading it to my own kids. The children in the novel have exciting adventures and develop real and honestly portrayed friendships. They face hardships, difficult choices, and loss, and we watch them grow and mature with the help of loving parents and mentors.As a girl I was entranced by the descriptions of this long-ago world: taffy pulls, \\"theatrical\\" evenings organized by young people, \\"going Maying,\\" . . . And what an eye-opener to find out what a \\"Temperance Club\\" was! But the best thing about JACK AND JILL is the friendships, so lovingly and completely depicted.This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"A five star story.Jack and Jill has been one of my unsung favorites for many years. A stand alone story not one of a series. It is a good quick read with many of the time period's nuances. I am an Alcott lover and my favorites are not the Little Women series, but her other caricatures of young women. Eight Cousins, Rose in Bloom, An Old Fashioned Girl and Jack and Jill are all ones I re-read often. Simple tales of growing up many years ago. They are not the farm/wilderness tales of Laura Ingalls, but the precursors to the American Girl type books and in my opinion, much better.A one star edition.My complaint is that this particular edition is billed as a High Quality paperback edition. My original copy was my mothers many years ago and I was looking for a paperback to use as my re-read copy. This edition is in a horrid courier font with no formatting and the paragraphs are split by a return. To get to know and maybe love this story as much as I do...find a real book copy of it not this pretender that would put even those faithful to the story off. I am don't even want to give it away lest I teach someone to dislike a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I read voraciously as a child, and this book was one of my favorites. I am going to read it again on my Kindle. It is entrancing."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I love this book. Took a star off for the typical Alcott preachiness. But I read it off the Gutenberg project and loved it so much I bought it off Amazon. It's so sweet. Storyline similar to What Katy Did by Susan Coolidge, girl is stubborn, injures herself (well and jack), may be paralysed, after a bit of preaching, she decides to be good and she eventually heals but is better for the lesson. Sounds boring, but the characters are interesting and sweet. And they're believable. Loved it."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"While this is not my favorite Alcott novel, I still enjoy reading it as a portrait of the responsibilities and amusements of boys and girls in the 19th century. While Jack and Jill recuperate from their injuries sustained \\"coasting\\" on the \\"lulla,\\" they mature and change, as do their friends, whose small projects to make their life better result in, if not in unimportant monetary wealth or fame, happier times to last them the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"Alcott has the amazing knack of entertaining while educating at the same time and you don't know you've been given a good moral to digest until its too late. You've already read and thoroughly enjoyed the book! You never really feel patronized or preached to...this is perhaps second tier in her fine line of literature (for her) but absolutely first tier when looking for wholesome reads for your own children. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I have read many books by Louisa May Alcott, but this was definitely not my favorite. It was a little too childish, and was boring in some parts. It's not like I don't enjoy those type of books, I really love reading. Some parts of the book were really good. I especially liked the parts about Jill's friends Merry and Molly. It's a good book with a good moral, but not for those who enjoy exciting books."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"this book i had to read for a book report and it is the worst book ever i dont know how anyone could even read the first chapter without bieng board to death literrely!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"this is one of my favorite books.it is easy to read without being childish"},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I'm sorry to see that this book has been so poorly received by other reviewers. It is not a family book like Little Women or the Rose Duo, but this is a Louisa May Alcott classic that should not be ignored. If nothing else, the interaction between social classes in America, represented by the mothers of Jack and Jill is endlessly fascinating. Also, this book could appeal to both genders. Both boys and girls will be entranced with the train and mechanical images, and it's unusual to read a child's book and have such fresh descriptions...something perhaps owing to the newness of trains at the time. The three girls, Jill, Molly and Merry, and their plans for self-improvement can be seen in almost every young adult book marketed towards girls. What's refreshing about this one is that they're self-improvement is not for the benefit of their peers or to &quot;get a boy&quot;, but rather, Louisa May Alcott has them develop for their own personal growth. In an age when self-help books are on the best seller list, this book shows how it was done before it was a science. In addition, it's novel for it's intrerest in health fads and regiments, new school ideas, and the imporance of an American youth culture. Give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"While Jack and Jill might not rate as one of the best Alcott novels, it is not worth dismissing out of hand for that reason. As usual, she crafted a thought provoking and enlightened book that teaches as it entertains and comforts.Jack and Jill are fast childhood friends who find their lives interrupted by a terrible sledding accident which leaves both of them invalids. As they recover and heal, they and their friends learn important lessons about responsibility, giving and friendship. Jack and Jill should be an immensely satisfying read for pre-teenagers. The sure Alcott hand with character keeps even the most obvious moral lessons from feeling overly preachy.While the book is ideally suited for younger readers, grown ups will be interested in the larger issues raised here. Alcott firmly asserts the need for individual growth, gender equality, and personal responsbility. Historical discussions about temperance and higher education for women should additionally make this book a good read for history fans."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"This charming, old-fashioned children's story begins by mirroring the nursery rhyme. Two friends, Jack and Jill, go up a hill to go sledding. They come tumbling down, and Jack breaks his leg while Jill injures her back more seriously. The book tells the tale of their recuperation and also of their and their friends' journey into young adulthood. The book is slightly moralistic, in the way that Little Women is; the young people earnestly want to become &quot;good&quot; and to help their friends become &quot;good&quot;. Although this style is not in fashion now, it still makes for a sweet, hope-filled story. Very enjoyable. Also recommended: An Old-Fashioned Girl by Louisa May Alcott."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I've long been a fan of the lesser Louisa May Alcott books and now my daughter has discovered them too. I was pleased to find Jack and Jill available in this handy paperback by an on-demand publisher. My seventh-grade daughter pounced on the book first, in great excitement. It was a bit deflating that there was no book-specific cover art or back cover material--it is a standard, rather ugly cover and the back text advertises the publisher itself. But I guess there's no arguing with that part. Far worse, my daughter found a minefield of typos in the first few pages, which proved very distracting. Then she found that about 1 1/2 pages from 3-4 were repeated verbatim on pages 5-6. She showed me both problems and she was absolutely right: the printing process had gone completely haywire. There was no reason to expect these issues were confined to the first few pages, and we had lost faith in the whole edition. Regretfully, we have sent the book back."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"This book is an interesting improvement on the clasic nursery rhyme.With its twist of humor and sadness, Jack and Jill emphasises the value of friendship and the comfort that simple creativity can give.In spite of all these good qualities, I would rate this book as far from Alcott's best. It is too predictable and rather disapointing. Although less &quot;preachy&quot; than many of Alcott's books, the sermons are more direct and lack the pleasing maturity that gives such works as Little Women, An Old Fashoned Girl, and Eight Cousins their originality.All considered it is still a sweet, cuddle-up-by-the-fire book. I recommend to any of Louisa's most-devoted fans, esp those between 9 and 12."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"This has a sticky, preachy quality about it -too sweet. but although the beginning bears a resemblance to the rhyme, the story is for young adults and adults. No where as good as Little Women"},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"Take the nursery ryme \\"Jack and Jill\\" for a starting point, speculate the consequenses, and you more or less have this book. Add in alot of moral preaching, make the kids way to good to be true, and you do have this book."},{"Title":"Jack and Jill","review":"I read this as a young child but have re-read it many times. It gets better with each reading. Recommend this highly for both young readers and adults also.

This book uses well know songs as examples which makes it easier to understand the lesson being taught. The author (Terri Cox) also gives very challenging exercises so you can use the skills you are learning.You Can Write Song Lyrics covers rhyming schemes, and includes exercises how to rhyme past that basic one syllable connection. Although you may 'think' that rhyming is easy...wait until you try these exercises! They are tough and quite fun!This book also talks about how to understand music jargon, how to work with others on songwriting, and how tempo affects your song.I was disappointed to see that, You Can Write Song Lyrics offers very little information about how to market your song, once it has been written. Other than that one small dislike, this book was really good."},{"Title":"You Can Write Song Lyrics (You Can Write It!)","review":"As an aspiring lyricist, I am greatly excited to finally(hence the catchy title) to have in hand a tool that is both usefull and inspiring. Ms. Cox's book is the best instructional text I have ever read, and , believe me, I've read them all. Terry has scored big as both a song writer/lyricist and teacher of lyric writing with this book. She introduces the craft of lyric writing in a way that offers true guidence in both the mechanics of the craft and the way of the heart. She integrates intuition and wordsmithing in a way that sent me scrambling for my pen and paper. Her book blew on the embers of my lyric heart in such a way that what once was but a flicker, is becoming now a flame. From chapter one she offers advice and guidence that awakens the heart and informs the mind. This book is sure to become a text for the inspiring lyricists out there , or anyone else for that matter who has ever longed to say something original, but needed more tools to do so.

I disagree with anyone who says that there are things in life that can't be taught for a few reasons= I was deafened at 19 and am now past 55. I was headed for a career as a pro musician in my late teens. Terry Cox renewed flames that were dying inside me as I \\"forgot\\" how melodies and lyrics of many favorite songs went together. Maddening. Along comes this book and bang! I go back and reread those lyrics over and over, and more often than not, I recall beautiful music behind the lyrics. Magical.

Why? Terry (Terah cox) not only gives you a very simple easy to digest outline of writing songs but she clearly goes much farther and morphs into a teacher of how to identify inspiration and meld it into pure energy. After reading this book I could write about a frog or all my thoughts on God and make it flow beautifully if I worked diligently. Writers (at least this one) think to themselves \\"what should I write about?\\" Much like a pop song which are not volumes of words, Terry cuts through any possible fluff that muddles up many books of this nature and gets down to the nitty gritty. It's weight is light and it's knowledge is plentiful filled with complicated subjects made very easy to grasp.Although I'm just reviewing this book it's been part of my library for over a decade and have given several copy's away to anyone who's inquired about the subject. It had been a book I've read more then once over the years and every time I read it I feel like I have that same instructor student relationship that's pretty difficult to receive from a book.

A Claddagh (klada) ring can be given to friends and is the world's cherished symbol of friendship, love and loyalty.The happiest day in my life is definitely the day I received a Claddagh Ring. Not only are these rings eternal symbols of friendship, it is a poetic and beautiful representation of love that is steeped in mysterious legends and lore.The ring is named after a fishing village and Malachy McCourt does a fine job of explaining all the stories surrounding this mysterious ring. This book is filled with stories of Vikings, Algerian Pirates, Legendary Fishermen, Superstitions, Traditions and stories of Mary of the Bridges.This book is really as much a history of Claddagh as it is about the ring named after the village. It also sheds light on the inventor and how he created the ring while in captivity. Malachy McCourt weaves a fascinating tapestry of stories with humor and a deep interest the history and culture of Ireland.What amazed me most was the story of 9/11 and how so many Claddagh rings were found on that day. Not only does this ring make its appearance in romantic tales, it has more recently made its appearance in great tragedy. Perhaps it is also now the symbol of the joining of hands to heal hearts.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Claddagh Ring","review":"This story is incredibly beautiful. The story of the ring and of the town is really a tribute to the power of love and friendship which both are keys in any kind of relationship from lover to wedding partner to friends of every kind.

He wrote about the most outlandish happenings in the most whimsical style, and made them all as humorous as they could be by doing so with a totally straight face. Understatement was his forte. In this, one of his very best novels, two plucky elderly women encounter all kinds of adventures and misfortunes, but face all difficulties with courage and resourcefulness, no matter how ridiculous the situation might appear. They are shipwrecked in the Pacific Ocean and make their way to a tropical island. They set up house in a comfortable deserted home, being sure to deposit rent money in a ginger jar. Soon back in the US again, they journey from the West Coast eastward, enduring a stagecoach wreck, sliding down a mountain during a terrific snowstorm, and finally making it back to their home in Pennsylvania, none the worse for wear. These two women have the uncanny ability to look life right in the eye unblinkingly and with great humor. We laugh at and with them as they tackle one problem after another with aplomb and good common sense. And Stockton relates it all as if it was just another day, no big deal. It's a wonderful, lighthearted comical novel."},{"Title":"Mrs. Rosey-Posey and the chocolate cherry treat (On my own books)","review":"What a wonderful grade 2 level reader.

This article does not even mention Ted Hughes, who is named in the title. The review spends one paragraph on the 18th c. and makes only superficial comments about Shakesepeare.

What makes this book such a fun read is that it is written by someone who was with Tina from her days with Ike in the 70's, through the hard times after her split with him, and then right on up until she was about to become the superstar we know today - in many ways the most pivotol days of her career.The book is surprising in that it talks less of the records Tina was releasing over these years than it does of her lovers, her moods, her friends and her relationship with her family.The author met Tina when began a fan club for Ike &amp; Tina in the 60's and throughout the years cultivated a friendship and business relationship with her as her personal assistant. He portrays a Tina we have only caught glimpses of before - Tina the shopper, Tina the perfectionist, Tina the party girl - but throughout it all always also shows a woman whose feet were on the ground and loyalties were strong.One could argue that because Eddy Armani is such an admirerer of Tina's that the tone of the book paints her in the most flattering light - but it is still a juicy read chock full o' celebrities, scandal, sex and all of the trappings the you'd expect of a rock n' roll legend.I found this book really enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"I do not recomend this book to anyone, it paints a portrait of Tina Turner quite opossite of who she really is. It tries to tell you that Tina Turner is selfish and rude, while in reality she is just about the nicest person I have had the pleasure to meet. This book is also full of mistakes about Tina's life, her wigs, her tours, her temper, ect................... Don't waste your money on this title!!!"},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"I'd just like to express my extreme disgust at the majority of the content of this frivilous book. Mr. &quot;Armani&quot; paints a picture of Tina that is growingly self-centered, manipulative and cold, which is precisely the opposite of &quot;The Real T&quot;. He does a relatively good job at expressing his convictions and in trying to convince the reader of this, but, herein lies the key word &quot;Trying&quot;. He certainly has not convinced me, nor will he. Anybody with half a brain knows that this guy is out to make money off of his 'idol'. Talk about hypocracy! Not only does he share with the entire world all of her most private and personal experiences, but he adamantly states that he would never &quot;hurt or embarrass&quot; her...hmmmm...I wonder what he considers this book to be doing...."},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"Based on the amount of date and fact errors (that aren't hard to spot by even a casual Tina Turner follower), I would be inclined not to trust the rest of the information in this book. While I am certainly not an authority on TT, I was present for a portion of one of her rehearsals recently and didn't see anything other than professional behaviour. Seems to me that the author might be trying to capitalize on Turner's recent popularity. Shame, shame!!"},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"I know this guy had to be close to Tina-but you really gotta wonder with these kind of books, what is true and what isn't. Some facts don't really line up. He says he made Tina her first big wig and she wore it the night of the PRIVATE DANCER Tour that made it onto tape. Well, I had seen her well before that with the big wig. And it also says she opened for the Stones on their STEEL WHEELS tour...she didn't. That was in 1989, I believe he meant back in 80 81."},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"Fun to read even though many things are probably exagerated.

I say that b/c when reading a caption of the book, i notice that he states that Tina asked to keep her stage name during the divorce. This is something that the movie \\"What's Love...?\\" showed. In reality, Tina Turner admits that she did not ask for this. She didn't care if she kept her stage name, all she wanted was her freedom. So I think the author isn't accurate. But it's still fun to read, but I don't take it seriously."},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"Some of the facts may not be right but Eddy dishes up some stuff that would cause any Tina fan to read the book cover to cover. Its like reading the Enquirer - read it just for fun - and fun it is. Don't take it seriously. One thing is undeniable, pictures don't lie. Tina looks like she was a real party girl in her old days. But weren't we all, so what. She still survives graciously and gets better even without the protection of her fans. She didn't need her fan's protection when Ike was pounding on her, so why does she need her fan's protecting her from this piece of prose -not necessary. If she was that upset about this book, I bet her management would have filed suit to have the book removed. Truth is its just more publicity. Most of us will never know the real Tina so this is just another &quot;story&quot; which is as good as any from someone who was closer to her than any of her fans could ever hope to be. And Tina fans - relax - Tina can take care of herself. She always has. And think of this, she may not even mind if Eddy made a little money from the book - I believe she is reported to be that generous!"},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"Eddy Hampton Armani goes on and on in this book about himself, how great he is... how busy and talented. I am thinking it was written for the money as well as for revenge for his bruised ego. He gets SO many basic facts and dates wrong, as well. That alone shows where the true motivation was, this book could have easily have been fact-checked, but he was looking for a quick paycheck."},{"Title":"The Real T: My 22 Years with Tina Turner","review":"I'm a huge Tina Turner fan, and I loved this book! For those Tina fans who like to believe that she is perfect and beyond any human imperfection should not read this book. If, however, you'd like to read a behind-the-scenes story of a very talented woman who happens to make her living in the \\"business of show\\", then you can't miss reading this book!The auther obviously seems to still hold some resentment about not being in Tina's life anymore, so the reader--as with any memoir--should take his words with a grain of salt. However, there does seem to be a ring of truth in some of the stories he tells. I can't imagine that he would write this book with the intention to only to fill it with out-and-out lies from cover to cover.All in all, though, reading this was a fascinating journey.

AIR FORCE COLORS VOLUME 3 summarizes/illustrates colors and markings carried by Air Force aircraft in the Pacific, on the Home Front and on postwar aircraft. It's a visual delight and one of Squadron/Signal's best efforts ever!Given such a wide canvas, Bell breaks the subject down into five more manageable sections: \\"Pacific Colors;\\" \\"The Home Front;\\" \\"CBI Markings;\\" \\"B-29s Against Japan;\\" and \\"Postwar USAAF to USAF.\\" After giving general information on each subject Bell then goes into more specifics. The \\"CBI Markings\\" pages, for instance, include separate sections on markings carried by Fighter, Bomber, Air Commando, Transport, ATC, Recce and Misc. Units in that theater.Although the text is dry, VOLUME 3 is a visual treat with 250+ black & white and color photographs and great Don Greer artwork. The accompanying artwork really makes this book: nine pages of aircraft profiles, two pages showing group and squadron insignia along with five pages of tail markings; all in glorious color.The color profiles feature a smorgasbord of warbirds in myriad paint schemes: 5th AF Lightnings, Mustangs, Mitchells, Liberators and Black Widows; stateside AT-6s, P-29s, Catalinas and C-54s; postwar Mustangs, P-80s and B-29s; etc.While not exhaustive, VOLUME 3 - and the entire AIR FORCE COLORS set - is a first-class, well-done introduction to a complex subject. Tons of illustrations, concise text and an easy-on-the-pocketbook price-tag makes for a big thumb's up!"},{"Title":"Uncle Yeshu, Messiah","review":"Uncle Yeshu, Messiah by Dr. William Harwood deserves a read by all who can see the truth about a messiah which the Jewish faith has been seeking for thousands of years.

I did not root for them to get together, I wished there was a twist at the end where the guy dumps the woman permanently after finding out that she only finds him suitable, even tho she is very attracted to him after she finds out he used to earn big bucks and has 2 degrees.A weak link in a series that is not really about the romance and more about the town."},{"Title":"Down and Out in Flamingo Beach (Kimani Romance)","review":"I read this book without having read the others in the series. The story had enough background to stand alone. The plot was good. Two people are brought back to their hometown to care for aged and or ailing grandparents. The problem with the book was the author's lack of character development. All of the characters in the book were flat and one dimensional. The heroine was very difficult to like. She liked the guy was wouldn't date him because he was a construction worker. Without ever having any in depth conversations with him, she decided he lacked ambition. He was likeable enough but pegged her as high maintenanced, which she was, but he dated her anyway. At the end, he considered going back to a corporate culture he hated to please her...A lot of characters were sterotypes and not very plausible...Story just didn't live up to the potential of the plot."},{"Title":"Down and Out in Flamingo Beach (Kimani Romance)","review":"Joya Hamill comes back home to her hometown to help out her Granny J because she has some health problems plus she was getting a little burned out with her job.

Nabokov and the Novel is extremely complicated to understand. Pifer is attempting to answer critics' attacks on Nabokov as far as style goes. (manipulating plots and characters, etc.) Her focus throughout the book is that Nabokov had a radical sense of what &quot;real&quot; is, and that affects all his novels. Read it to find out what it is 'cause it's highly philosophical, and I won't even attempt to summarize it! What I thought it lacked was a focus on what makes people love Nabokov in the first place: his unbelievable command of the English language, and his beautiful lyrical prose. I'm not in a position to refute Pifer's claims, but to me, Nabokov seems much more interested in saying what he wants to say than in his plot (and I don't- nor anyone I've spoken to about it find that &quot;offensive&quot; at all). The ideas she introduces may not be that original, but it was very interesting to see how she ties it all up in a neat bundle using so many examples from Nabokov's English and Russian novels."},{"Title":"Che Guevara and the Fight for Socialism Today: Cuba Confronts the World Crisis of the '90s","review":"This pamphlet is very important.

However, at the bookstore where I got it, I had the opportunity to compare both editions. I eventually bought the hardcover, but I did wonder for a while which one to pick up.To be honest, I preferred the print of the paperback edition, which had higher level of contrast - it was on white paper while the hardcover is printed on cream yellow tinted paper. However, I finally got the hardcover - well, because it is hardcover :))) and has a more luxurious look which I though was worth the 4-pounds price difference.Now, several words about the edition. The title says it - it is not the Bible, it is the Dore illustrations to the Bible. Anyhow, each illustration holds an explanation of what is seen, so it is pretty fine.The point which did diasappoint me was that I expected the complete set of illustrations that Dore did, until I read it was just a selection of the finest ones.A note which might be interesting for the audience about the disputed image of Creation with the missing angel in the background (seen in older reviews) - the introduction explains it was a version that Dore did himself, and it is practically an original.I recommend this book to anyone who loves illustration, Dore and/or Biblical subjects."},{"Title":"The Dore Bible Illustrations","review":"I bought this is for reference material, to see the classic imagery of the bible.

Buy it for its classical images that have been repeated again and again and buy it for its detailed engravings that will impress. It's timeless stuff."},{"Title":"The Dore Bible Illustrations","review":"In 1865, Gustave Dore illustrated an edition of the Bible with drawings that are popular to this day. This collection of Dore's 241 Bible plates from Dover Publications sells for a very reasonable price. I think some of Dore's illustrations are wonderful. Among my favorites are a portrait of Amos, Jesus and the woman of Samaria, and the arrival of the Good Samaritan at the inn.One thing that makes Dore's illustrations engaging is the fact that he sometimes chose to illustrate stories that are not well known. Examples include the stoning of Achan (Joshua 7:12, 24, 25) and the Levite finding the corpse of the woman (Judges 19:26, 27.) I found a number of these illustrations so compelling and sad that I went to the Bible to learn the stories. If you wish to become familiar with lesser-known parts of the Bible, perusing Dore's illustrations is one way to motivate yourself.I must add a word of caution. Some of Dore's black and white engravings are very graphic and unappealing to me. His rendition of David with Goliath's severed head, for instance, is one I would never share with a child. Nonetheless, if you look at Dore's illustrations, I think you'll find them thought provoking and well done."},{"Title":"The Dore Bible Illustrations","review":"I find it odd that most have never heard of Gustave Dore. It's quite a shame, because his illustrations are simply breathtaking for this 19th century French artist. In \\"The Dore Bible Illustrations,\\" around 241 plates are represented illustrating famous Bible stories and verses, going all the way from Genesis to Revelations. Each plate is labelled with a title(EX. The Angel Appearing to Joshua or The Flight Into Egypt) and the Bible verse(in King James Version translation) to which it corresponds with the plate illustration.Many of Dore's human figures are shown in dramatic or overexxagerated pose, with strong emotional and passive looks on their faces. Several illustrations have a rather dark atmosphere, such as his \\"The Children of Isreal Crossing Jordan\\" plate. In this plate, for example, Dore uses strong dark tones, making it difficult to see anyone's faces, but rather the outlines of the figures. The figures riding upon the camels are almost zombie-like, unaware of the other people around them.However, we also get illustrations, such as \\"The Angel Appearing To Joshua\\" plate, where the light tones often overshadow the dark. In this plate(as with many others), Dore uses dramatic poses(such as of the angel pointing his hand towards heaven) to capture a type of brilliance and splendor that is associated with an omnipotent god above(in this case, God is the rays of light shining down from the clouds). His human figures are full of emotion in this plate, often seen kneeling or ducking, in full submission not only before the angel, but also before God.Dore's landscapes are usually full of dark clouds, tall mountains, unique architecture, or lush forests. Rather than seeing landscapes that would be considered historical, Dore concocts landscapes that are epic and fantastical. Many of his scenes could be considered chaotic, such as in \\"The Destruction of Leviatin\\" plate, where his portrayal of oceanic waves and dark clouds bring a sense of disorder and fear to the viewer. Dore is also apt to portray signs of tragedy, of human figures clearly suffering and dying, whether from war, God's wrath, or even self-anguish.These illustrations are for anybody, whether the religious, non-devout, art lovers, or even the curious. Also highly recommended are his Arthurian illustrations(Idylls of the King), which are even more fantastical, and his illustrations of the Crusades."},{"Title":"The Dore Bible Illustrations","review":"Gustave Dore's interpretation of biblical stories are both passionate and sublime. His critique of both human and divine behavior is vividly portrayed on the faces of his subjects. This particular publication is generous in size, resolution and completeness."},{"Title":"The Dore Bible Illustrations","review":"These illustrations are beautiful and powerful in their composition. Any of Dore's stuff is great."},{"Title":"The Dore Bible Illustrations","review":"Dover's Dore Bible Illustrations consists of a 5 page introduction, 3 pages for the list of plates, and 241 full page engravings with the title and excerpt of the biblical passage the image represents. Most images are about 8\\"x10\\". The old testament, new testament and some of the apocryphal books are represented (in all, 39 books).The reproduction quality is excellent. Upon close inspection, minute artifacts can be seen in most of the engravings. Most often they are tiny white dots in otherwise dark spaces. However, with the extraordinary density of fine lines engraved in every image, flawless pressings may have been nearly impossible. I recommend studying this book with a large magnifying glass. The naked eye doesn't do justice to the almost superhuman effort that went into the artwork. Every plate bears the monogram of both Dore and an assistant, and he clearly needed help to complete the book. Just imagining what it took to finish the book gives me carpal tunnel.Every image is easily readable. Contrast is generally in the medium-high range, and all planes are well-defined. Many plates contain hundreds, even thousands of figures, and creating such large-scale images coherently is a feat in itself. The style Dore employs in his Bible scenes is atypical of the medium. He engraves with a woodcutter's sensibility, giving this book a distinct look. With the exception of a few uses of stippling, every plate consists only of contouring lines of varying density. True white or black spaces are practically nowhere to be found in the entire set; the hand of the artist can be seen everywhere. No shortcuts were taken, and Dore seems to say with his technique that the subject matter is important enough to demand great dedication.After an avalanche of praise, I should note that the book isn't above reproach. Plate 103 shows some highly questionable-looking bears, plate 38 shows a camel that is wildly out of proportion, and plate 14 shows some awkwardly rendered figures. But there's another problem that pervades the series, and that's a lack of complexity. There's not much in the way of symbolism or imagination, and there are no close ups. This is a macroscopic, bird's-eye view of the Bible that's more about events than people, more about style than substance. Dore doesn't seem to have that spark of insight that defines the devotional masterpieces of Durer, da Vinci, Rembrandt, Bernini, Caravaggio, Michelangeo, Holbein, Rubens, Bosch, etc. That said, the book as a whole is immense and impressive, and very well-reproduced by Dover.

I cannot think of any artist who created the style for how centuries of people would imagine works like the Bible and Dante's Divine Comedy.

Iconic works with icons of such lasting impressions that still today we continue to depict such epic and notable scenes with much the same characteristics.This collection of Dore's Bible illustrations is complete. Every depiction, a full page in size, and even accompanied by a Bible verse, expels his excellence. It is perfection in its minimalism. The image is alone to be poured over and awed at.

Byron was, is, and shall forever be the master. This is poetry at its best; funny, enlightening, entertaining, beautiful. It is a work to be read and read again. It is a work to be absorbed. It is a work to be eaten."},{"Title":"Don Juan.","review":"Although I normally read and review only novels, I was intrigued by the short excerpts from Byron's \\"Epic Satire\\" DON JUAN that Stendhal used as chapter-epigraphs inTHE RED AND THE BLACK, and read both simultaneously. Published between 1819 and 1824, in sixteen cantos containing an average of 125 eight-line stanzas in each, Byron's work is essentially a vast novel in verse, a coming-of-age story, an erotic romp, and a fount of social commentary all in one. He reverses the normal characterization of Juan, turning the serial seducer into a pretty innocent who is himself seduced by woman after woman; he also changes the pronunciation, now rhyming with \\"true one.\\" It is easy to see why Stendhal wanted to quote him. Both books begin with easily-seduced heroes; both take them into many different walks of society; and both are punctuated by philosophical commentary from their respective authors. In Byron's case, though, the commentary is almost more the point than the plot; it is certainly entertaining -- he can be a very funny writer.Byron left the epic uncompleted at his death, but there is enough there already for several novels. Seduced at sixteen by a married woman, Juan is sent to Italy in the charge of a strict tutor. Surviving shipwreck (and a touch of cannibalism), he is washed up on a almost-deserted island, which becomes a second Eden in the arms of a girl of his own age, Haid&eacute;e. His further adventures see him enslaved in a Turkish harem, taking part in a bloody siege, serving in the court of Catherine the Great, then engaging in amorous and diplomatic adventures at the English court, to end on the bosom of the \\"full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk\\" of the Duchess of Fitz-Fulke.The implied rhyme here is one of the dominant characteristics of the poem, although it is seldom used so suggestively as to rhyme the Duchess' name with \\"bulk.\\" Byron writes in eight-line stanzas, the \\"ottava rima\\" of Ariosto, with the rhyme-scheme abababcc. That final couplet gives a kind of punch line to each stanza. So he ends a passage on blue-stocking women with:| But oh, ye lords of ladies intellectual,| Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?Or Juan's distress on his exile from Spain:| No doubt he would have been much more pathetic| But the sea acted as a strong emetic.And as we have seen, Byron can also be quite naughty; here he is describing the interior of a harem, into which Juan has been smuggled disguised as a woman:| 'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,| With all things ladies want, save one or two.| And even those were nearer than they knew.Every now and then, Byron resists the temptation towards comedy and writes passages of pathos with even a touch of the sublime:| Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,| And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,| And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear| Been their familiar, and now Death was here.Some of the descriptions of the feasting of Juan and Haid&eacute;e on her father's island have echoes of Homer or Virgil, and his famous elegy on departed grandeur, \\"The Isles of Greece,\\" also comes from this section. I could personally have done with more seriousness and less comedy, and these moments were welcome when they came.And Byron's commentary is always amusing. Some contemporary references may require annotation, but his views on literature are still stimulating. He had little time for the \\"glassy brooks and leafy nooks\\" of the Lake Poets, for example:| There poets find materials for their books,| And every now and then we read them through,| So that their plan and prosody are eligible,| Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.Pointing out that \\"All tragedies are finish'd by a death; all comedies are ended by a marriage,\\" he asks:| Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,| He would have written sonnets all his life?For the most part, Byron's philosophy is the comfortable one of taking life as it comes:| Well -- well, the world must turn upon its axis,| And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,| And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,| And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails.But towards the end of the epic, he reaches towards a deeper explanation of the Romantic search for wider and wilder experiences:| The new world would be nothing to the old| If some Columbus of the moral seas| Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.The soul's antipodes: those are destinations worth punching on one's ticket!"},{"Title":"Don Juan.","review":"Don Juan is recognized as Lord Byron's masterpiece and English's greatest mock epic poem but is also one of the greatest epic poems period. It has the strengths of prior Byron masterworks like Childe Harold's Pilgrimage plus a wealth of additional biting satire and other humor, fantastic poetic dexterity, and sheer imaginative abundance. Though a favorite of many poetry buffs, it is also known for appealing to those who do not normally like poetry. It is an immortal work that continues to sparkle and invigorate nearly as much as ever for those alive to its magic.The first thing one notices is its sheer length; at nearly two thousand stanzas and sixteen thousand lines, it is one of English's longest poems and its longest satirical work. That it is often printed as a standalone book - and a thick one at that - says much. Yet, like prior Byron pieces, it is thoroughly readable. Though such a thing is now almost impossible to even conceive, poetry was more popular than prose in the early nineteenth century, and Don was a stunning bestseller; people read it the way they now read Stephen King. It is easy to see why. Don practically leaps off the page; in distinct contrast to Wordsworth and other poets then popular, it can be read at near-pulp speed. This is partly due to Byron's effortless mastery of meter and other poetic facets; his ottava rima stanzas are immaculately conceived, the strict rhythm drawing us in and keeping us hooked. The audacious rhymes are also important. Byron had long had a reputation as a fearless rhymer but truly outdid himself here; time and time again, Don has the most incredible rhymes conceivable, especially in stanza-closing couplets, which are often milked for brilliant comic effect. This is so well-known that such rhymes are often called \\"Byronic.\\" Rhyme lovers want to keep reading just to see what he will chime next. All this makes a poem that not only begs to be read quickly but almost forces itself to be so; unlikely as it seems, it can be read very quickly. Readers will be astonished at how rapidly they tear through and will actually end up wanting more. If anything, it seems too short. It is indeed incomplete and even breaks off at something of a cliffhanger, though the sixteenth canto - the last finished - is complete. Byron had no end in sight and indeed wrote without a plan; he began a seventeenth canto shortly before his death and perhaps would have continued ad infinitum. That he was unable is a true shame, but there is no arguing with what is here.Content is in fact even more important than form, which is unsurprising in that the canvas is almost larger than life. Summarizing Don is not only superfluous but virtually impossible; it takes on practically every genre and contains almost every imaginable thought and feeling. This vast panorama contains everything from a war epic to several monumental love stories to various court dramas and seemingly everything between them. The poem can be appreciated on a very simple level as a picaresque adventure of the kind Byron had long specialized in but never taken anywhere near as far - literally or otherwise. Don travels through much of the world, seeing many landmarks and people and falling in and out of love many times. He is everything from a slave to a court favorite, an older woman's lover to a man disguised as a girl, a war hero to a society light. His adventures are as entertaining as any comparable novel's. Initial readers were enthralled by the virtual grand tour; today's can appreciate the fascinating historical peek.Don himself is one of the most intriguing facets. He is as thoroughly Byronic as Harold and the many subsequent Romantic heroes but very different and at least as fascinating. Even younger - indeed but a teen at the start -, he shares their good looks and lust for adventure and sex but lacks their intellect and melancholy. He starts out very nave and quite ignorant, full of potential but with little or no idea how to use it - in fact lacking a plan of any kind. We see him grow to a certain extent over the course of many escapades, making the poem a sort of bildungsroman on top of everything else. In many important ways, though, he remains unchanged; despite all he has been through - including much that went against conventional morality -, his fundamental youthful innocence is still there. His view of life and humanity changes little, and he is to a large degree still an overgrown boy at the end despite having had enough action - in both senses - to shame Casanova himself. This is of course a joke, especially in that, unlike prior Don Juan incarnations, he is consistently seduced rather than being a seducer. Like prior Byron protagonists, he to a great extent reflects how Byron saw himself. This fascinated initial readers, perpetuating an image of Byron that still subsists. Few people are as anecdotable, and the many still interested in him will find much to entice them. Byron initially chafed against such readings but came to accept them as inevitable, even reveling in them to a degree. When Byron realized the poem's popularity and saw that the image would not disappear, he began overtly using Don to advance his thoughts and ideas, most of which were quite radical, even more clearly than in prior works.There are many other interesting characters, most of them colorful and quite a few of them unforgettable. Don's numerous loves have great verve and are memorable for various reasons, while his friends and enemies are at least as compelling. The most interesting other character, though, is the narrator, who often steals the proverbial show. Indeed, he often takes over, going on long digressions that are sometimes about Juan or tangentially relevant but mostly about scarcely related topics. He may go off for several stanzas about a story element that reminds him of something, which may remind him of something else; at many points he seems to forget he is supposed to be telling a story. Much of the comedy comes from this, and it is a large part of the reason the work is so hard to summarize. The narrator says virtually nothing about himself directly, but a distinct personality shines through inadvertently - one of the most hilarious and otherwise entertaining to ever tell a tale. A sort of idealized unidealized figure, he is partly an exaggerated side of Byron's own personality as well as other poets' and narrators'. Like many other parts of Don, this has a large parodical element lending itself well to satire, but many will be at least as absorbed by his Byron affinity, however hyperbolic.Alluring as such crossovers are, they have unfortunately long overshadowed the poem's many conventional strengths. Few artists have suffered more from biographical criticism; it is all too easy to forget that Byron was a great poet on all fronts. Technical dexterity aside, Don is full of vibrant imagery; many descriptions and metaphors are superlative, even unforgettable. The lyricism often reaches sublime heights, and there is also much to provoke thought; Don challenged conventional morality and other accepted ideas as few popular works have and continues to be a touchstone. The poem is also very quotable and indeed often quoted. Perhaps above all, Byron's incredible diversity reached its peak here. Don constantly switches from ridiculous to sublime, often in close proximity; the tragedy is as grand as the comedy is hilarious, and there is a great deal of beauty and substantial material of various sorts in all the guises. Several of the love depictions are among the most vivid and memorable ever. The epic battle is so well-done that it is among the best of its kind - great enough to make Don a masterpiece in itself though it is not even the main part. It manages to convey both war's unparalleled dark side and its heroism; unlike most war stories, it is stirringly immediate and historically astute, truly seeming to bring a relatively obscure battle to life. Some of the more picaresque elements are just as good in their way, immensely entertaining and variously provocative.Satirical brilliance is probably Don's most lasting aspect. Satire had been a large part of Byron's work almost from the beginning and became more and more pronounced, climaxing here with incredible force. Nothing is safe from Don's mockery; it critiques many aspects of European society as well as Europeans themselves. Don is thus a comedy of manners in addition to everything else; nearly every cultural aspect is savagely critiqued. Byron pokes fun at many prominent practices and kicks just about every sacred cow. Not least interesting are the ubiquitous digs at rival poets and other enemies; Robert Southey is especially eviscerated - indeed from the very first line! Besides being supremely entertaining, this is of great historical interest; though avowedly anti-realist, Don ironically gives a very clear picture of Europe in nearly every sector, much of it unflattering and all the more revealing and interesting in being so.Simply put, this is essential for anyone who loves poetry, and even many who do not will be pleasantly surprised. It is that rare masterpiece with truly wide appeal; everyone from high-brow literary enthusiasts to the most casual readers can appreciate it - a truly notable accomplishment and a continuing testament to its multi-faceted vitality."},{"Title":"Don Juan.","review":"The poem is as sexy as the life of its author, who died fighting for Greek national independence and lived with joie de vivre manifested both within his distinguished career as a poet, his sexual trysts, and his eccentricities, which included party trick mug made from a human skull.

War, stormy seas, tropical islands, British high-class society, queens and slaves -- all are presented as fictions, parodies, examples, not true portraits.

However, this is a concern for me since I know a lot of instructors issue the reading, qoutes, etc. based on a certain edition.

Sadly, she has departed from us, but not before leaving tons of this stuff all over the house, and a half-finished vanity press run of 100 copies (anybody want one?).Now I know where she got the impetus for such poetry - Lord Byron! All of that generation's worst excesses of bad poetry come from Byron, I think. Embarrassingly forced rhymes, self-conscious commentary that frustratingly impedes the flow of the narrative, arch cuteness that threatens one's sanity - all there!! And he couldn't even finish it off properly.Truly, a work only an academic could love - or find any value in. If you are attracted to this book, protect yourself: Try reading it aloud and making a stop at the end of every line (sing-song-like) so you can at least get the sense of the rhymes. I found the Penguin edition serviceable (as Penguins usually are). And don't bother with the footnotes, just let it flow.

While the little details about his family life and professional persona are interesting enough, they are crammed in with little development or thought -- almost as if Vise was just proud of himself for having learned them in the first place, never bothering to put any serious thought into their places in the larger story.More troubling than that is Vise's attempt to run a parallel narrative about the career and life of former FBI director Louis Freeh. Attempts to compare and contrast the two men feel sorely out of place and poorly developed. Clearly Vise was looking for &quot;something different&quot; in framing his story to position his book in the crowded marketplace (two other new releases deal with the Hanssen case) -- a liberty that is squarely in an author's right, obviously, but a liberty that feels curiously out of place here.This is a rush job -- Hanssen hasn't even been sentenced yet. One wonders how a serious reporter like Vise could pedal a story that hasn't finished unfolding. Nevertheless, buyers should beware, the more thoughtful and readable commentary on this case has appeared elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"A fascinating read into the life of two men with very different agendas.

Unlike the book featuring John Walker, there is no new knowledge to be learned. The book reads as if the author's entire research was done by what was printed in the N.Y. Times and Washington Post. The book does not really explain how Hannsen got caught but continues to repeat over and over the same sexual fantasies Hanssen has of his wife. ..."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"One cannot read David Vise's book without wanting an answer to one central question: Why would an ordinary man who seemingly had everything - intellect, education, an adoring wife, beautiful children, and a house in the Washington D.C. suburbs - risk it all to subvert our government and place our nation in great jeopardy? Thanks to Vise's comprehensive research and reporting, The Bureau and the Mole goes a long way toward offering several plausible answers, the most obvious of which is that Robert Philip Hanssen is anything but ordinary.Exceedingly bright (perhaps even genius-level IQ), Hanssen compensates for his many perceived inadequacies and personal failings by probing for and exploiting the weaknesses in our national security apparatus. We learn from reading The Bureau and the Mole that this man derives a sort of perverse pleasure from penetrating the very system he swore an oath to protect. But it is far too easy to explain Hanssen's behavior with theories of psychopathology and self-aggrandizing behavior to which the author generously alludes - i.e., he did it because his father mistreated him as a child, etc., etc.A much better explanation is that Hanssen perpetrates serious breaches in national security mainly for revenge. Retaliating against his superiors for not recognizing his strengths and promoting him, Hanssen lashes out by providing the KGB with ever more damaging information. He steadily and in premeditated fashion ratchets up the stakes knowing full well that what he is doing is wrong. He betrays his own country, a country that handed him every opportunity.An unintended consequence of his actions, Hanssen destroys the very lives of those he supposedly so dearly loves - his compassionate and deeply religious family. Just tragic.What is perhaps most fascinating about this story is that, for all his intelligence, Hanssen appears utterly oblivious to the KGB's carefully calculated manipulation. What he views as a sort of high stakes game of chess, his KGB handlers view as a ruthlessly cold business. Recognizing, for instance, that he has a pathological need for validation, his handlers engage in an odd sort of carrot and stick machination, all the while cajoling him to bring them specific documents. (They appear to be putting together a puzzle and are using him to acquire each and every piece.) Alternately smarmy and assertive, these creeps push Hanssen's buttons over some two decades.Interestingly, though they repeatedly (and deliberately) undervalue the national security secrets he provides them, Hanssen does not seem to mind. So, after his arrest, the FBI agents view his claim that he was 'only in it for the money' with a jaundiced eye. It is this reader's opinion that while he may have netted many thousands of dollars in cash and diamonds, financial gain was not Hanssen's motive.By claiming cash as his inducement to spy, Hanssen is simply 'gaming' the system by ensuring that his case is open and shut. Incredibly, during the long interrogation process he still insists on withholding information, and it is unclear from Vise's book whether he ever does provide a full accounting of all the secrets he stole and sold. Many have speculated that Hanssen shrewdly withheld some information to ensure he would have bargaining chips down the road that he could use from prison should he need them. Now that would make for an interesting book!Without question, Hanssen's motives for spying against the U.S. were extraordinarily complex. It would have been serious enough a breach had he not been personally responsible for Soviet double agents' deaths at the hands of the KGB's counterintelligence apparatchiks back in Moscow. By fingering these operatives to his handlers, he becomes essentially an accessory to murder.Hanssen's inscrutable behavior extends to his family relationships as well. Yes, in addition to betraying his country and KGB agents working on behalf of the U.S., he repeatedly deceives his loving and devoutly Catholic wife and engages in what can only be described as bizarre sexual behavior.To say that Hanssen is a troubled man is far too generous. Evil found a resting place in this man's soul and was able to flourish there. Most poetic about this story is that Hanssen indeed found the notoriety that he so desperately craved. Though it would take the form of shame and ignominy was of perhaps little concern to him for his character defects left him unable to discern right from wrong.But what Hanssen left in his wake - physical and emotional carnage, irreparable damage to U.S. national security - is no less devastating because of his piteously tortured psyche and poor character. It is fair to say that he has finally found the peace that so often eluded him, and he will have the balance of his life (in Federal prison) to savor it.The Bureau and the Mole is a good book - not a great one. While the story of Hanssen's espionage makes for a fascinating read, there are other books available that document Hanssen's story equally well, if not better. The detailed research, particularly that related to what Hanssen actually divulged to the KGB and his unusual, if not brilliant, espionage methods make the book worthwhile. However, the many pages devoted to Hanssen's sexual behavior and fantasies were gratuitous and wholly unnecessary. More important, they add a salacious quality to what is otherwise serious reporting.Well-researched."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"A frightening look into the mind and works of a socially inadequate FBI Agent who betrayed the American people, trading their safety over cash and diamond.

When people talk about a page-turner this is definitely one.This book goes into the true workings of the FBI and its counter-espionage today, this book would be on Robert Hanson's list of books to read if he were trying to understand the state of the real spy-craft today. After you read the book you will understand how prepared the FBI and the CIA was to counter espionage in this country and some of the reasons why their work was so poor. The FBI might have never captured Hanson had not the Russians given him up because after Hanson was captured the first thing he said was,\\" why did it take you so long?&quot; J.Edgar must be turning over in his grave"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"The recently released movie \\"Breach\\" tells the \\"inside\\" story of the sting operation to capture Soviet spy Robert Hannsen. Expertly acted, wonderfully disrected, the film examines how the FBI managed to capture one of its own by planting it's own mole to work with Hannsen, and how that investigation ensued. Naturally, upon leaving the movie, my curiosity was peaked by the incident, so I purchased this book to fill in the gaps and connect the dots even more.What I ended up reading was a mere recount of Hannsen's life, the life of Louis Freeh, one-time FBI director, and a few e-mails and smutty stories Hannsen wrote about his wife. The book disappoints by mainly rehashing information already known, and failing to present much, if anything, of the FBI investigation that brought Hannsen down. Hannsen comes across neither interesting nor threatening, but moreso an angry employee looking to seek vengence on his employer, the US Government, by selling top secret documents to a country on the verge of falling apart.Okay, so we knew that. It took you 9/10 of the book to get to the investigation itself, and the pages that discussed it were minimal indeed. I learned more about this event from listening to an NPR story on the movie than reading this book.The author seemingly sets up a dichotomy between Hannsen and Freeh early on in the book, but there really is no payoff to both of those stories as Freeh ends up in an incompetent mess, leaving the FBI, and working for a credit card company. It left me asking, what in the heck was he featured so prominently in this book? Probably to fill out the pages on an initially sketchy story.Don't believe the review on the back. Pass this book up, buy a ticket at your local movie theater, and spend two hours with Ryan Phillipe, Chris Cooper, and Laura Linney. THAT will be a great use of your time!"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, especially after hearing the author on National Public Radio. I expected a much more detailed reporting of Robert Hanssen himself, with dates, times, etc. that would indicate the author had dug very deep and had gotten details from those involved with the case. It became very clear to me about 1/3 of the way into the book, that Mr. Vise really wanted to write a book about the FBI and Louis Freeh, not Robert Hanssen. Robert Hanssen was easy - just a sick, compartmentalizing person whose problems stemmed from parental abuse in childhood. The complexity of the workings of the FBI and Louis Freeh's direction of the agency were by far more intriguing to the author, and I think he was chomping at the bit to do a book on that, but instead gave in to a more provocative character.Mr. Vise lost my respect very early on when he mishandled the details of an interview with Hanssen's mother, who apparently recalled Richard J. Daley as the mayor of Chicago in 1935. This was an impossibility, as Daley was not elected mayor until 1955. It was clear to me that the author either misquoted Mrs. Hanssen, or Mrs. Hanssen's recollection was skewed. If the latter, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter ought to have caught it and made a note.I found the three appendixes redundant and pretty unnecessary, especially the one detailing his Internet postings regarding his sexual fantasies. Mr. Vise provided a rather clear description of that part of Mr. Hanssen's personality, making the appendix just more titillation. The lack of footnotes was disturbing, and nowhere could I find any discussion of how he verified the accuracy of the reports of life within Opus Dei.By far, the most intriguing person in the whole book was Mrs. Bonnie Hanssen, and I would really have liked to have read more about what makes her tick, why for more than 20 years she stayed with a man she knew she could not trust. Just citing a strong Catholic faith does not explain it fully, nor adequately."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Consider this to be a sort of consumer's guide to the three Hanssen books on the market, from one who's read them all . . .1. THE BUREAU AND THE MOLE has a good photo section but no index or bibliography, both essential in my opinion. Half of it is a bio of Louis Freeh, who should hang his head in shame rather than be credited for uncovering Hanssen. The sex revelations are here, but unless you like pornography I advise you to skip the part about Hanssen's postings on the internet. Still, the information about Bonnie Hanssen's brother--an FBI agent--who suspected him and was ignored is almost worth the price of the book. Four stars.2. THE SPY NEXT DOOR has an index but no photos and no bibliography. The writing is a little wooden and there are little mistakes like getting the the church where the Hanssen's were married wrong. They have some sex stuff too, but thankfully no internet ramblings. A workmanlike job that reads like a Time magazine cover story. Three stars.3. THE SPY WHO STAYED OUT IN THE COLD has photos, a bibliography and an index. It's also about 30 pages longer than the other two. Alas, no sex though the chapter on the stripper runs for some 12 pages and is titillating. It's the most complete with it's biggest scoop being that Hanssen told friends he wanted to be a double agent long before he joined the FBI and thus should have never been hired.

Vise's \\"The Bureau and the Mole\\" is poorly written, poorly researched, gratuitous and just not well thought out. It's a shame since a spy as good as Robert Hanssen deserves a better chronicler. The first indictation that the book was rushed include a major factual error in the very first chapter (Vise refers to the \\"Daley Machine\\" in Chicago circa the late 1930s, even though the senior Daley was not elected Mayor until 1955). The book then becomes a dual biography of Hannsen and FBI Director Loius Freeh, but because the narrative is a brief 229 pages, neither party gets more than a superficial telling of his life story. The book also contains lengthy verbatim passeges of Hannsen's letters to the Soviets and his fantasy e-mails, which shorten the already inadequate narrative even more. The e-mails are particularly offensive in that they detail Hannsen's perverted sexual fantasies about his wife to the point where the book starts to read like a degrading peep show.In documenting Freeh's story, Vise relates every major FBI success and mistake during his tenure so that each get a scant few sentences of mention. Another example of underreporting comes from the account of how Hannsen's brother-in-law reported his suspicions that Hannsen was spying in 1990 and the FBI dropped the ball. Vise reports the fact, but apparently never attempted to find out WHY nothing was done. Another poor decision was interviewing psychologists who never treated or even met Hanssen to get \\"psychological insight\\" into the man. This ploy strikes me as less than worthless. I should also mention that apperently no interviews were done with Hannsen's immediate family members for insight into how his spying impacted their lives.Overall, this book is a shoddy rush job that never should have been released in its present condition..."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I expected a book about Robert Hanssen - how he spied and what made him tick.

Although a lot of interesting details emerged on Hanssen, I still don't understand the man. Several aspects of his life appear to contradict each other, and the psychiatrist explanations left me unfulfilled.

The book reads like a classic fiction spy novel with twists and turns that keep the reader intrigued. I found the parallel story of Louis Freeh, the then FBI director, as well as deep insights into the KGB, and concurrent FBI initiatives over the 20 year story truley fasinating. The book contains actual letters, photos, and an excellent synopsis of what top secret security items were lost by the United States.

Even if you're not an espionage or counterintelligence buff, what you learn about Hannsen and his escapades as well as how the FBI is managed will absolutely blow your mind. The contents page alone will motivate you to read this book.Here are a few reasons why I rated this book a 5.1. I'm not a fast reader, but the story is so intriguing that it kept me turning the pages. The author's writing style is clear and easy to read. I appreciate books that are short, sweet and to the point. I finished the book over the weekend.2. I have followed this fascinating story of Robert Hanssen very closely since the beginning and now having read the Bureau I see that the author has obviously done his homework. The author uncovered many new and fascinating facts about Hannsen's complex life and sordid personality. While I find most of Hannsen's acts terribly disturbing, I at least have a clear picture into why he did what he did and what motivated him to do it. Believe it or not money was not his driving force. Considering the relationship between Hanssen and his father you wonder how many other Hanssen's are out there. David Vise, the author tells of one particularly amazing discovery. Hanssen's brother-in-law a FBI agent as well, attempts to turn Hannsen in more then 10 years ago but does the FBI pay any attention?3. I like the way Vise clearly lays out in the appendix the incredible secrets that were not only available to Hanssen but ones that he sold to the Russians. I also enjoyed reading all of Hanssen's emails as well as the Internet postings (albeit sexually explicit) Hanssen put out on the www for the world to see. All of this information is valuable to the reader to better understand what kind of individual or animal would and could do the things he did. It's simply amazing how any one person has the ability to 'compartmentalize' so many aspects of their lives, (actually not so different from a recent President) and for so many years to keep everyone at bay. What was Bonnie possibly thinking about?Certainly in the months and years to come new information will be uncovered, written about and scrutinized. But as far as I'm concerned to this date The Bureau and the Mole tells the real Hanssen story. I look forward to the movie!"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I think that the espionage case of Robert Hanssen is one of the most fascinating to have ever taken place. I eagerly awaited the publication of &quot;The Bureau and the Mole.&quot; Yet despite the fact that the book does add some details about how twisted Hanssen was, I am very disappointed with it for five reasons:1. It is very short for such an interesting case. It weighs in at 223 pages (setting aside several lengthy appendixes --the inclusion of one I will discuss below). Yet of these 223 pages more than 60 deal with the life and times of Louis Freeh, the former Director of the FBI. I fail to see why the author put what amounts to a miniature biography of someone who had very little to do with Hanssen's life until Hanssen was identified as being a traitor. If you subtract the Freeh material, you're left with a book about Hanssen that is less than 170 pages long. That is way too short for such a long-term and complex case.2. So far (I am still reading it), I found one factual error in the book which points to a rush job. On page 73, the author states &quot;The Bureau also arrested Edward R. Howard, on charges of selling a litancy of secrets to the Soviet Union.&quot; I read an excellent book about &quot;Edward Lee Howard&quot; called &quot;The Spy Who Got Away.&quot; If memory serves, Howard never was arrested by the FBI. He was under its surveillance but managed to escape and flee to Moscow.3. The book is peppered with statements that indicate a knowledge by the author of what Hanssen felt about this or that. Now, I know that the author consulted psychiatrists and psychologists to try to puzzle out Hanssen's complex personality, and he probably used their insights to make these statements. But he doesn't say that. Instead, one is left with the impression that Hanssen talked to the author (which he apparently did not) or that David Vise is some kind of mind-reader (see comment 4)4. The author boasts of his extensive research. Yet instead of specifying it with footnotes and a bibliography, he just summarizes his souce material in a few pages. Personally, I am a big believer in documentation even if you have to say a source for a particular fact is from an &quot;anonymous FBI agent.&quot;5. The author morally was dead wrong to include as an appendix to the book reproductions of the sexual fantasies that Robert Hanssen posted about his wife on the Internet. I fail to see how this adds to the story of Robert Hanssen and believe it can only hurt the innocent members of his family, specifically his wife. The fact that Hanssen was posting such stories on the Internet is certainly germane to his own story, but we readers do not need to read the full, sordid material to get an impression of what a twisted, hypocritical character Hanssen was. The author could have summarized the postings by including a few excerpts in the text. In my opinion, Bonnie Hanssen (Hanssen's wife and a person who strikes me as being in denial because of her decision to stick with her husband) has every right to hate the author for putting this sexually explicit material --which I refuse to read-- in the book.To sum up, I think we still are waiting for the definitive book on Hanssen and that may take some time to materialize. Unless you are a true espionage buff, I would stay away from this book."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"In the beginning I found this book interesting but in the later chapters Mr Vise began to drift away from the crux of the book.In one chapter, he devotes 16 pages to then FBI Director Louis Freeh and his clash with former President Clinton. He touches on the bombings of the Khobar Towers, Oklahoma City, the Atlantic Olympic Park in 1996, and the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, the mathematician at Los Alamos National Lab. What has this have to do with Robert P. Hanssen? I suggest that if you really want to read this book go to your local [store] and spend a few hours there to peruse it rather than purchase it. I was very dissapointed in the author to add pages of useless information in an effort to boost the price of this book."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Read THE BUREAU AND THE MOLE by David A. Vise,an engrossing true spy thriller about the unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen--the most dangerous double agent in FBI history.I was amazed to learn how Hannsen escaped detection for solong . . . also, I liked how the author unfolded his tale, along with that of FBI Director Louis J. Freeh (the man who set the trap that would expose the traitor within its mist).Spy thrillers are not typically my favorite type of reading, but I'm glad I made an exception for this one . . . the fact thatit was true made it so much more harrowing.There were many memorable passages; among them:Sex, among both numeraries and supernumeraries, is a taboosubject, and discussion of homosexuality in any form isconsidered dangerous because it can poison the soul. OpusDei itself is tightlipped about the lives and roles on numeraries. One of the Hanssens' daughters, Sue, is a numerary who, as required by Opus Dei, sleeps on a wooden board every night and without a pillow once a week. (Women are treated moreharshly than men in Opus Dei in order to quell their passions,officials say.) When Sue's sister, Jane, got married a numberof years ago, Sue turned down her invitation to be a bridesmaid.Opus Dei would not allow Sue to take a man's arm and walkdown the aisle in a wedding.At the same time, Bob's head was spinning. He thought he knewhow to handle Bonnie. According to a friend of Bob's, \\"He hasa little theory that every day you have to tell a woman a certain amount of positive things, and if you do, things will always be good. He called it his 'counter theory.\\" He said in a woman's brain there is a counter and they count up the good things you say to them and the positive strokes you give them.\\" As far as his work was concerned, Bob didn't want Bonnie to know anything. He had to do a better job of concealing things. And to make matters worse, now a priest was involved.Freeh knew that the FBI was at its best in a crisis, and hetalked tough from the start. \\"We will search you and find you,\\"he said. \\"There is no place on earth where you will be safefrom the most powerful forces of justice.\\" The director made itclear that he and other senior FBI personnel, along withthousands of agents and forensics experts working on thecase, were on a mission. Instead of regular shifts, theybegan putting in as many hours as possible each day untilthey needed a few hours of rest. It was during times likes thesethat Freeh, director of an agency with a multibillion-dollarbudget and thousands of employees, earned the nickname\\"the presidentially appointed case agent.\\" Rather than planningfor the long-term or staying abreast of developing cases andissues, Freeh became completely and totally involved in thedetails of the Oklahoma City bombing and a handful of otherhigh-profile cases on his watch."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"The Bureau and the Mole tells about the most successful and as well the most dangerous spy in FBI history. The way the story is put together and how it intertwines Robert Hanssen and his boss, Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI is incredible. Even if you are not into the whole double agent and espionage thing, it doesn't matter because it talks aobut a little of everything. It discusses all of the CIA's top secret information, the Pizza Connection which is the bringing down of some of the top New York and Italian Mafia, the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing, and the Oklahoma City bombing. It doesn't just briefly explain it, it goes into great detail about how either Freeh or Hanssen was involved in it and how it all broken down. What I enjoyed the most was how the story starts off as just Hanssen and Freeh going their separate ways and throughout the story interweaves itself to where Freeh is cracking down on Hanssen.I do not usually go out of my way to read a book in any specific ammount of time, but this one I couldn't put down. Whenever you thought that it was going to slow down or get worse, it just kept speeding up into a totally new story about another criminal that the FBI was out to capture. I look forward to the movie!"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I was excited to read this book but was very disappointed. The book attempted to juxtapose Robert Hannsen's life with that of Louis Freeh's but, in the end, didn't do justice to either one. The background provided to Hanssen's upbringing was informative, but after the onset of Hanssen's spying, the book simply seemed to bounce chronologically in no coherent fashion between Hanssen's spying and Freeh's career at the FBI. Paragraphs seemed to be independently written and then patched together in the best manner possible from the author's point of view, but the book laked flow. Moreover, numerous digressions into events like the Oklahoma City bombing and Ruby Ridge served no purpose other than to increase the number of pages in the book. Having read and really enjoyed Stuart Herrington's &quot;Traitors Among Us,&quot; another book about Cold War espionage, I thought this book fell rather flat."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I had hoped for something along the lines of the book about Aldrich Ames (Betrayal). This is nothing of the sort, but rather is a rather slim volume with comparatively little devoted to Robert Hanssen. This tome seems disjointed and even when it makes a point it seems hard to understand. e.g. pg. 93 he states \\"...only farmers climbing off a tractor are going to be more noticeable than me walking around my house.\\" Is he implying that he(Hanssen) would like to be more noticeable or less noticeable? (One would assume he would prefer less noticeable, but the implication is the opposite)There are many uncorroborated statements in the book, and there is no bibliography nor index which might possibly help to straighten things out. All in all, I get the impression that this was a hurry-up effort to strike while the percieved \\"Iron is hot\\".One good chapter is # 17, where the text is devoted to the clash between FBI Director, Louis Freeh and Bill Clinton over excesses emanating from the White House, which Freeh did not take lying down, and which some unspecified aide said Clinton \\"went nuclear\\" over when Freeh didn't \\"roll over\\", and acquiesce.The book plays somewhat to the prurient interest, in that it describes in two places how Hanssen and his wife collaborated to display her nude bod.Overall, this is a book I'd skip. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"What a fascinating story and what a dissapointing book. The book is written at the high school level at best. But aside from the authorship, most troubling was the level of pure exploitation of Hanssen's perversity. The lengthy quotation from Hanssen's pornography (including an entire appendix) can only be considered gratuitous. Why humiliate Mrs. Hanssen by offering her husband's lewd tales of their sex life? Finally, the virtually fawning descriptions of Louis Freeh's career show a very naive understanding of the way such cases are brought, and it is disrepectful of the many agents and line prosecutors who actually brought Hanssen to justice."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Should really be called \\"Freeh and Hanssen\\". I liked it better than \\"The Spy Next Door\\" because Vise bothered to insert pictures of the participants. It has about the same amount of chatroom sex as the other too. It's a more disjointed read than the other, but if you don't know a lot about the former FBI director, you kinda get his life thrown in for free (pun intended). I think there was a more wide-ranging analysis of Hanssen's motives, contrasting to the male-bashing in the other book. Vise shows more reporter's dispassion and I found this somehow more honest. Alternatively you could read the court documents free on the Web, and save money by not buying either book - you wouldn't miss much."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I preordered this book based on its advance publicity. It was a major disappointment. Written in the style of an extended &quot;People Magazine&quot; article, it would have been better titled simply &quot;Bob abd Louis.&quot;It's reasonably well written, albeit in a breezy style, but you'll learn nothing more about Bob Hanssen, his character, or his motivations than you already know if you followed the news coverage of his arrest and conviction. You'll know more about Louis Freeh than you did before but most of it is &quot;file and forget&quot; trivia.The author started out I think to write a definitive account of Hanssen's extended espionage but soon found out he didn't have enough material for a full book so he went to his word processor, dragged up his notes for a book about Freeh (a project which I suspect he had abandoned when Freeh's career went in the tank), and merged then together into a one book.I felt I wasted my money buying it and, more importantly, my time reading it."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Having had a background in a previous life, I bought this book and thought it would be interesting. On the first page of Chapter One (page 4), Mr. Vise writes, &quot; One of Bob's favorite books was The Code Breakers by David Kahn, a thick volume about secret codes and intercepts that fueled his boyhood fascination with the technical aspects of intercepting confidential communications.&quot; Thus sets the stage for future behavior. Mr. Vise reveals that Bob Hanssen was born in 1944.However, The Code Breakers, a classic updated and re-released in 1996, was originally published in 1967 (I own a copy), so Bob Hanssen was 23 years of age, at least, before he could possibly have read this - hardly boyhood. If Mr. Vise and his touted fact checkers could make such an egregious error (and possibly deliberate to make a point) on the first page, how many other &quot;factual&quot; errors are in the rest of the book as well.I stopped reading a few page later when my anger made it difficult to concentrate. Because I paid good money for it, someday I will read this as escapist fiction, for now I'm too put off to finish.Save your money and go buy a good Vince Flynn novel; he's a much better writer, and the reality level will be the same. If Mr. Vise as claimed ever &quot;won&quot; a Pulitzer Prize, there's hope for us all. Right now I just feel annoyed and cheated."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"This is a worthwhile book, obviously cobbled together in a rush to publication. This despicable yet flawed human being, Robert Hanssen, is portrayed in a jumbled, erratic portrait.Hurried as it may have been, disjointed as it is, the book tells us about the most heinous, traitorous acts in our history. The perpetrator is defined as what he is - - an amoral, obsequious, almost psychotic human being that is privy to our national secrets and blithely gives us away to the Russians.This is a tragedy in every sense of the word but the real tragedy in this book is at its end - - Appendix III. The author, in a an overt attempt at senstationalism, chose to post the entire sexual fantasies of Mr. Hanssen. For ten pages, the reader is subjected to the erotic ramblings of a traitorous, sick person. Whether it is fact or fantasy, it has no place in the book and totally demeans his innocent wife and children who are already devastated by his abhorrent behavior and total disregard for his family and his country.A reasonable effort fails in this arrogant attempt to pump up book sales."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I personally enjoyed this book. Why did I enjoy it? Here's why-1. It provides a very provacative way to look at the inside of an outsider.2. We can all relate to it one way or another (even though we are ashamed to admit it).3. You get to see to men fighting their own battles but it a similar way.The reason I docked it down a star is because the author could have gone into more in depth descriptions on somethings but at the same time not could have been as descriptive on other topics (especially the sexual related areas)In Conclusion, If you enjoy a spy/biographical account of one of the most notorious spies ever recorded, this is the way to go."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"The cover notes that the author is a Pulitzer Prize winner, but he won't get one for this book.

Focusing on the filth of the spy's life does very little but make Vise out to be a muckraker!And to hear him shamelessly and gracelessly promote himself on the radio proves that he has no shame.

The author built a psychological profile of Robert Hansesn as well as reported historical facts, to try to give us some insight into his motivation, as well as placed him in a historical context. How could someone who loved this country and was devoted to law enforcement become such a terrible traitor and cause the death of so many people? It gives an amazing account."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"This book reads like a civics lesson for 7th graders. Atmosphere, texture and character development are pushed aside by oversimplifications and cliches (Freeh is described as \\"square-jawed\\"). Juxtaposing Hanssen's story with Freeh's story is an amateurish device. Attempts at a psychological understanding of Hanssen lack depth, and ultimately collapse into pop psychology. In Hanssen's treachery there is an exciting, complex story to be told, but this book fails to do it justice."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"There are several books on this topic and I was uncertain which to read. I went with Vise based on his Pulitzer Prize. Frankly, I was disappointed. The book is not very well written. There's not much new here you couldn't get from the New York Times. Vise fills pages by writing alternating chapters about FBI director Louis Freeh. But Vise's lionized portrait of Freeh as courageous crime fighter rings hollow, particularly in light of September 11, and other FBI failures on Freeh's watch. The book gives you all the relevant information about Hansson, who was clearly a very dangerous and disturbed person. But the writing doesn't read like top rate journalism; it feels like gossip column filler. Although I haven't read the other books on this case, I'd recommend starting elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"save your money and check it out from the library if you must read it. however, i'm sure there's better, more qualified books out there on this guy. do i have to give it a star? how about negative stars? disappointing book. gratuitous sex was insulting...bedroom antics didn't have anything to do with hanssen's destructive betrayal of this country. book seemed to be thrown together. was it about hanssen, ames, clinton, freeh? who? title infers it's about hanssen, but author must have run out of resources to copy. there's nothing new! glad i didn't buy it."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I was expecting &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; (a far superior book), but I got information which was probably lifted off of the pages of the New York Times.

I am pretty dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I bought this book expecting to read about how the FBI investigated Robert Hannsen, as well as the &quot;cloak and dagger&quot; aspects like the tradecraft he used and his interactions with his KGB handlers.Instead I found that about half of the book is about Louis Freeh and his ascention to the Directorship, and his accomplishments and failures along the way.Don't waste your money, borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Surely David Vise will exclude this anemic effort from his heretofore impressive professional portfolio. I echo the sentiments of several customer reviewers who accurately observe The Bureau And The Mole is long on opinion, weakly drawn conclusions and pop psychology, and short on documented fact. No doubt to compensate for a dearth of substance as to how and why Robert Hanssen did what he did, Mr. Vise sloppily weaves in a parallel biography of former FBI Director Louis Freeh which, while mildly interesting, only serves to distract and detract from what should have been a compelling narrative on the most dastardly spy in US history. A story this big and complex warrants a far more serious effort than that put forth in this altogether disappointing book."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I think this is a nice read about the lives of two people in the F.B.I.. One is the Director Louis Freeh and the other is Robert Hanssen who sold his country away. As some of the previous reviewers state, there are some small errors in this book (the Daley machine), but much of it gives a picture of two very different people. Both were smart, had six children, and were very religious Catholics. But both were very different. Robert Hanssen did incredible damage to U.S. security by what he sold the Russians, while Louis Freeh tried to make the F.B.I. a more effective counter terrorism machine.This book has all the aspects of a good story; sex, money, spies, and a hero. I have not read the other two books, but this book satisfies my interest in the topic. I liked what the author did when comparing both Freeh and Hanssen."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"This book was unfocused and the authors' method of paralleling the careers Robert Hanssen and FBI Director Louis Freeh failed miserably. Robert Hanssen began spying for the Soviets long before Freeh became Director and the mistake is compounded by detailing the fued between Freeh and then-President Bill Clinton in excruciating detail. For a more detailed story look to other books."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Skip it, you can read better at the supermarket check-out.And, if you've heard the overzealous author on the radio or on television, you won't escape him here -- I have a feeling that some of these reviews are written by him and his friends....."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I thought the book was pretty poor. Not much in facts of what happened. I think I would have been better off to read newspaper articles written about the &quot;mole&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"This is a rather interesting story involving the most damaging known FBI mole in United States history. The book details what and who Hanssen exposed during his 25 year FBI career (20 years of which were spent divulging classified material to the Soviet Union and later Russia). His actions individually sent several men to their deathbeds and have allowed a breach in U.S. security.The book only gives a very cursory glimpse into this man - and this is unfortunate but perhaps inevitable. Part of the problem is that the book was published in 2002 only months after his capture - the other fact is that Hanssen was able to tailor a deal with the government that allowed him to escape the death penalty and skate around certain revealing questions.The book does a good job in not painting Hannsen as some evil, how-could-he monster. It reveals how ordinary this man is and how damaging his espionage was and probably continues to be for the U.S.Mr. Vise also goes into FBI director Freeh's relationship to the Hanssen case, and his own career as director of the FBI. Also, the FBI's vital role and importance of both domestic and international presence is discussed. The book raises many questions and concerns.This is an easy read and quite informative."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I expected a lot from this book and was disappointed. The book is a strong example of a great topic with a horrible delivery. Hanssen betrayed our country' secrets and the best the author can do is bore us with how Louis Freeh should be our hero. After finishing the book I was struck by the feeling that the author had not done much research, as there was little substantive information about Hanssen's spying. It would have been more aptly titled, \\"A short book in praise of Louis Freeh\\"."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"First I have to comment on the way the book was written: I thought the author kept very close contact with the facts and did not distort the reality of the situation. The book is very well researched and some of the things presented, like the letters Hanssen sent to the Russians, are totally amazing. The idea to present both lives in parallel, between Freeh and Hanssen is brilliant because it gives the book and additional angle, the way two people from similar backgrounds can play their lives in totally different ways and succeed or not in their endeavors.On the other hand, the content of the book is mind-blowing. How can someone live with himself knowing they are practically destroying a country and all to feel better about themselves, to feel in control? And his obsession with this wife and pornography is also nauseating. I do not understand how can his wife still visit him after knowing everything he did to her.This is a must read, only to learn what the extent of evil in some people and how it has consequences still years later."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Very compelling on Hanssen, but the attempt to juxtapose Freeh and Hanssen was a bit strained -- Freeh at one point late in the book is described as \\"Machivellian,\\" when the evidence for that characterization was thin. The real disappointment, however, was the lack of story about how Hanssen was caught. We were in the middle of a very compelling narrative and then, poof, the gig is over. I would have liked more detail into the (apparent) Russian agent who played such a role in finding Hanssen. My guess is that there wasn't time to develop that part of the story, since this book was published just a year after Hanssen's arrest -- so for speed we give up a significant piece of the story. Would it have been better a year later? Perhaps... Summary: a very compelling read -- a real page-turner -- that does an outstanding job of explaining Hanssen, but is disappointing in the forced comparison with Freeh and the lack of detail about Hanssen discovery."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Initial reading of the book claims that it details the spy work of Robert Hanssen and how he was captured. Totally wrong as you flip through the book. This explains both the lives of Hanssen and Freeh(FBI director) and in one chapter it details how Hanssen was captured. The rest of the pages details how Freeh went up the ladder of the law enforcement and how Hanssen wasted his life.To start with, I don't give a damn about Hanssen's childhood, all I care is how he put the entire country in danger(which has been detailed in Appendix and not in the main book!!). The author painstakingly explains his childhood which dampens the entire book. Next is Hanssen's personal life. Should we care about that when the Russians are deciphering the FBI and CIA's codes with the data Hanssen provided to them? The author explains that in 1 chapter and in one of appendix he delivers the entire porn letter Hanssen wrote about his wife, as if doing the service to his wife who is already shattered because of her husband. The author may want to read Frederick Forsyth's &quot;Icon&quot;(fiction) about how Ames damaged the secret service and how that account was on target than this book about Hanssen.The book goes through all the disasters happened in US during the time Hanssen was in FBI, including Okhlahoma city bombing. What on earth this is related to the capture of Hanssen? I couldn't believe the author is a Pulitzer Prize winner who took a very good subject of unmasking a traitor and fell flat."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"As a student of history and international espionage, I was anxious to get this book about the latest spy scandal. I mustsay I was sorely disappointed in this book. Its a thin book tobegin with, which is okay if the story is covered adequately.However, that was not the case here. If anything, this book isa biography of FBI Director Louis Freeh, not Robert Hanssen.Chapter after chapter was about Freeh, his career and exploits,and the highs and lows of his tenure as FBI Director. I was amazed at how little in this book was actually about Hanssen.After reading it in just 2 nights, I still feel I know nothingabout Hanssen, his motivations, how he actually did what hedid, etc. The book is top heavy with what I call \\"filler\\", useless material lazy authors always include to make the booklook bigger. This book has way too much of that as well, fillingthe pages with little information but lots of silly and irrelevant emails and letters that shed little light on anything.If you're interested in this major spy case, wait until somebetter writer puts out a real bio on Robert Hanssen.

He explores each individual's background and explains how they both arrive in the FBI. His writing contrasts the differences between Freech and Hanssen and shows how they come together with Freech overseeing the operation that brings Hanssen's spying days to and end.This is a great book for those that are interested in the FBI, spys, and true crime, but yet is not overly detailed to the point where it could become boring."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"The dust jacket should carry a XXX rating.

A fast read, it is nonetheless a disappointment for those of us who wanted more than pop psychology to explain what made Hanssen tick, how he got away with treason for so long, and how his wife and children are possibly surviving the destruction and disgrace he inflicted on them."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I heard the author, David Vise, being interviewed on the radio (on the PBS program &quot;Fresh Air&quot;) and found him very interesting. Unfortunately, the book is a big disappointment. It's a rush job and a pastiche, without much new information. The chapters on Louis Freeh are a complete waste. They were presumably thrown in to give the book some &quot;structure,&quot; but really have nothing to do with the Hanssen case and tell you nothing you wouldn't know from any press digest or encyclopedia yearbook. I am hooked on the Hanssen case, so I guess I would have read the book no mater what, but this book is a dud. It tells you little and is not particularly well written or researched. Plus, there's a lot of padding (e.g., chapter on Freeh)."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Having first read The Spy Who Stayed Out in the Cold by Adrian Havill I guess I've had my fill of Robert Hanssen. At times The Bureau and the Mole appears to be a dual biography of Robert Hanssen and F.B.I. Director, Louis Freeh. The reasons for Hanssen's spying appear to be a contempt for the F.B.I. after the death of J. Edgar Hoover and Hanssen's feelings of his abilities not being appreciated by the organization. Benedict Arnold's reason for treason was his belief that his efforts on behalf of the colonial army were not appreciated, also. Both Arnold and Hanssen were alike in this respect. Hanssen's complex personality is delved into, and although he received money for the classified information he provided, he appeared to enjoy the excitement his spying provided as opposed to his, in his mind, mundane work at the F.B.I. The Russians apparently understood Hanssen's need to have his ego stroked and did so in their correspondence with him. According to court documents and interviews Appendix I lists the various \\"contributions\\" Hanssen made towards his Russian colleagues. The list is quite impressive. This is a book of the downfall of two men: Louis Freeh the Director of the F.B.I. and F.B.I. agent Robert Hanssen."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"That these two things were the only sources of pleasure in what looks like a life of quiet desperation is clear from the book. Vise writes about Hanssen's professional frustration and inability to enjoy the camaraderie of his coworkers. Although Vise never states it outright, Hanssen's relationship with his wife must have been marked by the same angry ambivalence he felt about the FBI.Why else would he degrade her so? Posting his sexual fantasies is one thing; sharing his marital sexual encounters with a friend via closed circuit TV w/o her knowledge is another. It has to be due to more than the sense of inadequacy Vise claims Hanssen felt. The book included another shocker: Hanssen's brother-in-law suspected him of espionage as long ago as 1990, but nothing came of his report to his superiors. The FBI once again dropped the ball.This is a easy to read account that really pulls you along. The sections on Freeh are good too, but naturally less intriguing than those on Hanssen. One appendix lists the national secrets Hannsen gave away; another reprints his pornographic posts verbatim (which is somehow more of a kick to the stomach). Another reproduces his e-mails to colleagues where he grouses about some political or bureaucratic situations not to his liking. They all add valuable perspective on this complex personality.This book is probably about the best a writer could do at this stage of the Hanssen story. Hanssen is still in the middle of his debriefing which has been extended into spring. We haven't heard from Hanssen himself (aside from the appendices) and won't until his debriefing is over as required by his plea agreement. It's a good question if we ever will, since the FBI must approve media interviews. I have to wonder if this case is so embarrassing to the agency that it will insist on being the sole source of information on the case and silence Hanssen. In any case, a more thorough biography can only be written a few years into the future. Until that time, I'd go with this book."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"1. Biggest problem with this book. Even for a short book the book is too long. It has too much information you don't want to know, and too little you do want to know.2. Most important revelation. The Soviet Union previously and now Russia actively pursues manipulating US public opinion through our own democratic institutions such as the media and political groups.3. Biggest paradox raised by this book. During the peak period of penetration of US intelligence and counterintelligence agencies described in this book, the Soviet Union fell apart.4. Most important thing in this book. The cold war isn't over. After suffering worldwide humiliation in 1991 when Allied forces with mainly western technology easily overwhelmed Saddam Hussein and his army which possessed the most sophistication Soviet arms available for export, Russia has supplied our enemies with effective methods and technology for defeating our best weapons.5. Biggest lie in this book. The author tries to explain Hansen's behavior as the logical result of his upbringing and experiences. It is not the circumstances of our birth, but rather the choices we make which define us."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"The Bureau and The Mole is riveting and fascinating. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. The detail, writing and psychological profile of FBI agent Robert Hanssen are first-rate. From family dynamics to cloak and dagger operations, the book makes you feel like an insider. This is the best book I've read in many, many years. If you are interested in character, spying, religion or a dose of...fantasy and communication with the KGB in Hanssen's own words, this book is must reading."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Did I just spend $(...) dollars for this. This book simply fails to deliver. It spends little time exploring the life and psyche of Philip Hansen, and dwells on useless filler. It provides us with a rather detailed sycophantic account of Louis Freeh. It juxtaposes this idealized picture of Louis Freeh to the dual, hypocratical, and deceitful Hanssen. This is supposed to give this book a pseudointellectual flavor, but instead it bores the reader and falls short on delivering the biography of the worst spy in American history. Lastly the appendix describing the sexual fantasies of Philip Hansen is an egregious move on the part of the author. It does not add to the already incomplete and shallow account AND it also victimizes innocent family members."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Here we go...another attempt to get a book out in time to sell it before the general public forgets who the subject is. Problem is with that theory is that we have seveal books that are way too much a like. If only one would have covered his chilhood better and paid epecial attention to Opus Dei, both of which I believe had more effect than anyone will ever know. I'd also like to know how an FBI Agent got his hands on all this supposed NSA and CIA information. Even in these days of &quot;Homeland Security&quot;, these folks just don't share well at all. I think there is/was a middle-man (CIA?) in there somewhere. No way NSA or CIA would reveal info to the FBI, who they consider just to be the Federal police dept with no &quot;need to know&quot; anything important of an international nature. The whole thing sounds bogus to me. - Former NSA Employee"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"This is a book seriously in search of an editor. It is a sophomoric tome which could easily be condensed into a three page article for the Reader's Digest.For such a serious subject, the text is completely unsubstantiated. The book is totally absent of footnotes or bibliographic notes. The &quot;serious&quot; statements in the text are heresay or opinion.The author never achieves any purpose. Why was this book written?"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Now, how do I explain that title? I know - it's kind of confusing. Well, here goes.The story of Robert Hanssen is fairly well-known by now, in generalities. Most of the world doesn't know the specifics, and that's what David Vise attempts to do here.Vise does tell as much of the story as he could get his hands on. He lays it out in chronological order, looking at both sides of the story - Hanssen's and the man who headed up his capture, FBI Director Louis Freeh.The thing is, the story reads like a newspaper article - or, more accurately, I felt like I was reading a plot from &quot;Dragnet&quot; (remember? &quot;Just the facts, ma'am.&quot;). Being a true story, I realize that Vise can't embellish on what happened, but his writing style is extremely low-key - almost dead, which is somewhat surprising, since I read this book based on Terry Gross' interview with him on National Public Radio's &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, in which he was extremely animated and passionate about his subject.I now know as much as anyone else about the Hanssen affair - but I didn't really enjoy finding out what I learned."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"After completing this book, I would like to say it might have been the most fascinating and well written books I have ever read. The author, David Vise, did a magnificent job writing this book to teach us about Hanssen. This morning I happened to be watching the Today show where Vise was interviewed! He seems like a very nice and personable man. David Vise is a great author and I found this book unbelievable. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"One almost comical aspect of the continuing revelations concerning the network of spies and traitors operating deep within the bowels of the CIA and FBI is the way it belies our assumptions regarding security measures in this country. As is becoming clearer with recent announcements pertaining to the degree to which various had important information that might have helped to prevent the incidences occurring on September 11th, but either buried in their own files or refused to share with other agencies for a variety of self-serving purposes. We are neither well-organized nor well-disposed in regards to civil defense preparedness to guard against such terrorist acts.So too, this excellent biography of master spy Robert Philip Hanssen, a senior official within the headquarters staff of the FBI, shows how poorly we have managed and safeguarded our national secrets. Hanssen managed to hide in plain sight as a mole for the Russians, divulging sensitive and secret information gleaned from the files of the FBU, CIA, NSA, and the Executive Branch. His actions of betrayal undermined decades of work to protect such information regarding our national defense, and finally triggered one of the longest and most intense manhunts in modern history. His capture came after a long a tortuous cat and mouse game set into motion by FBI chief Louis Freeh, who quickly came to suspect a highly placed mole within the FBI soon after taking the reins of the agency.So it turns out, certain aspects of a secret life seemed to appeal to this bizarre but brilliant opportunist, who rose from relative poverty and obscurity after graduating from college. Yet, so dour and serious was his demeanor that he was nicknamed \\"Dr. Death' for his strait-laced dress style, which consisted exclusively of plain black suits, wingtips, and subdued ties. He had been questioned a number of times in connection with the suspected espionage, but was never taken seriously as a suspect until he was captured red-handed with a satchel-full of data at one of the Russian drop-spots. Author David Vise does a journeyman's job of revealing aspects of Hanssen's background, personality, and social circumstances that help the reader to better understand why and how such a man, so seemingly dedicated to the country could so handily betray it literally for decades, and all for nothing more than a fistful of money.To briefly summarize, this is an interesting book, and one that actively seeks to find some rationale for what Hanssen did and why he continued to do so for decades before being caught. While the author tends to fawn over Mr. Freeh and the FBI a bit much, the book is in fact well written and quite interesting and absorbing to experience. It is a quick and an enjoyable read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Really delved into the personalty of a dangerous double agent. The author portrays Robert Philip Hanssen as the devoted family man living a double life. From his contacts with the Soviet Union to his devout Catholic upbringing, the author really takes the reader on a trip to places that only a person with a double life would go.The author also reveals the ineffective inner workings of the FBI, as far as it pertained to keeping track of it's own agents.The author also does an excellent job in going into the background, in great detail, of FBI director Louis Freeh, and how he desperately searched out Hanssen after so many years. A great read."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"The writer describes former FBI Director Freeh's accomplishments more than Hanssen's. There were at the most 4 chapters regarding Hanssen's traitorous activities.I was very disappointed in the book."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"To say that this is a brief study of the Hanssen spy case would be similar to saying that it gets a bit warm in Death Valley. If you are looking at this book you probably know a little about the Hanssen spy case and are hoping to find a well-written book to cover the details. Well, this is a well-written book; it flows very well, which is due to the fact that the author is talented. On the other hand the details of the Hanssen spy case are few and far between. It really seamed to me that Vice just strung together all of the articles he wrote for the newspaper and called it a book.The fact that the book was light on the details was a disappointment to me because of the fact that Hanssen has been described in the press as maybe one of the best spy's to have worked for Russia. Also the author interviewed so many of Hanssen's friends, family, co-workers and FBI agents on the case, I expected a book full of details. I wanted more on how Hanssen got away with it, what were all of his procedures / trade craft, how did the Russian's work with him, what kind of damage did he do to the US. The book covers the surface on these items, but not enough depth to make it interesting. The author does spend about 40% of the book on a long description on the career of FBI Director Louis Freeh and the major FBI cases during the 90's. Although this would be an interesting book in its self, it seamed to me that the author used it here as filler to give the book some size.The author (in another attempt to increase the size of the book) tries to explain why Hanssen did it. To explain the motives of Hanssen, the author gives us an overview of Hanssen's childhood, a review of his rather conservative religious lifestyle, and some almost laughable psychological analysis on the personality reasons behind the betrayal. I also thought that the 20 pages of appendixes at the back of the book a little redundant and pretty unnecessary, especially the one detailing his Internet postings regarding his sexual fantasies. What could have been very helpful in these pages was a detailed analysis of the information given to the Russians and how it would hurt the US, not the slapdash attempt made by the author. One last gripe, why no footnotes or source / bibliography notes?Overall I came away from the book thinking it was a disappointment. It was readable and you will not have to spend a great deal of time on it, but it really is not worth the time unless you just want a light, overview with some porn thrown in for good measure. No wonder the author bought 100,000 copies of it himself to get the sales ranking up there, I do not think it would have done it on its own."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"This is, by far, one of the best books I have ever read. Vise clearly uses his excellent writing skills to reveal fascinating facts about Robert Hanssen. Although a non-fiction book, this wonderful piece of writing reads like a novel, making it enjoyable for everyone. The necessary pornography information is tastefully displayed in the book, appearing in an appendix, rather than in the main section of the well-written book. I strongly reccommend this intriguing portrayal of the greatest double agent in FBI history to all. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"After buying David Vise's book, The Bureau and the Mole, I just discovered a new and better book on the same topic: The Spy Next Door by Ann Blackman and Elaine Shannon. Vise's book does a poor job of camouflaging his mad scramble to get into print with something--anything--about Robert Hanssen, the turncoat FBI agent. It's full of dimestore psychoanalysis and sensationalist pretense. Vise wants us to believe he got inside Hanssen's head, although there is no evidence or indication he ever even met or talked to the spy himself. The author also takes a deep bow to Louis Freeh, as if the defamed FBI director were somehow responsible for catching Hanssen. In fact, Freeh was as clueless as the rest of the bureau before Hanssen was delivered to them on a platter. The Blackman/Shannon book, on the other hand, is rich in detail about Hanssen's life, his growing up and lots of examples of how he not only betrayed his country but everything dear to him, including his wife and children. It reads like the great spy book it is and shows how the FBI was so caught up in its own past that it missed Hanssen the same way it missed the Sept. 11 attackers. Don't make the same mistake I did. Get The Spy Next Door instead."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I have wanted to read one of the books about Hanssen, but kept getting conflicting reviews about which was the best book.....So I saw this in paperback, realized I had hesitated long enough, bought it, and read it. It is very illuminating as to the reasons Hanssen is the way he is--for the most part an inept jerk, though scholarly intelligent. I will read another of book on Hanssen, because there is probably much more than is reported here. Though I found the alternating chapters about Freeh interesting, I felt they were fillers and really had no place in this book. Still, the book held my attention all the way through, and so I will give it 5 stars even though it left me wanting more."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I am not well versed in the world of spies and government conspiracy (and I don't pretend to be) so my objective was to read this book to learn more about this interesting and important high profile news headline.

I'd been hoping for the inside story and lots of juicy details. And there is some inside story and there are some juicy details. But there's lots of dime-store psychoanalysis that is repetitive and not very illuminating. There's as much - if not more - about Louis Freeh to the detriment of details about the espionage aspect of the story. And the bottom line is that the writing just isn't very good. I wish I had better things to say - I'd heard big things about this book and was eager to read it. In the end, though, it was quite a letdown."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"A book to read in a couple of evenings. It provides a life summary of the life of Robert Hanssen, and a chronology of the events he precipitated as he spied for the USSR. The book also awkwardly attempts to tie the career of FBI Director Freeh to the story. The two lives converge indirectly, but there is very little to connect them until the very last when Freeh becomes convinced of Hanssen's guilt. The parallel treatment of Freeh's exploits bears little relationship to the larger story.Vise continuously speculates about Hanssen's mental state. He does provide a reasonable explanation of motive, toward the end of the book, through the testimony of a psychiatrist, but this avenue is only alluded to as the story progresses. However we are given continual statements, as if they are proven facts, that Hanssen &quot;felt&quot; things or experienced a certain emotion. But nowhere does the author indicate that he interviewed Hanssen. So, how does he really know? Here is an example:&quot;Hanssen knew there were hundreds of others present in church, but he believed McAfee to be talking to him.&quot;In another case the author states that Hanssen wished to become a different and better father to his children than his own father had been to him. Two or three lines later, the author mentions that Hanssen had little to do with the rearing of his children, preferring to to leave that to Bonnie and the church.Well, explain, please, the seeming contradiction.The book has the feel of a rushed and pieced together work, with some padding regarding Freeh's story. This is a good chronology but little more."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"This book doesn't compare with David Wise's book \\"Spy, The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed America.\\" There seems to be a lot of assumptions and conjecture's in the Vise book.

Vise really doesn't tie the story together well and he has no point to make.Finally, a minor beef -- the whole 'Because he ratted out KGB moles who were later tried and executed, he committed the equivalent of mass murder...' line is BS.

The author tends to jump back and forth a lot or go off topic even like the Oklahoma bombing which would be intereting if that was what I was reading about. You do get a clear view of what a creepy dude Hanssen was and wonder why the FBI dropped the ball when his brother in law told them Hanssen was a spy back in 1990.

I know this review sounds like the author is my brother, but I really loved this book."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"The really intereseting thing about this book is how the author paralleled the life of Hanssen and the FBI director, Louis Freeh. They both worshipped at the same church. They both had six children. They both worked at the FBI. But what separated the two men was that Hanssen was physically and psychologically abused by his father his whole life as a child and as an adult. It destroyed him as a person. He spent his life being badmouthed by his father which took a toll on the rest of his life. This portrayal of Hanssen's life makes you pitty him. Hanssen saw the FBI in his distorted view as the father figure that he wanted to punish and he took up spying as a double agent with a vengence while all the time thinking he was in the right. This book gives you an interesting insight into the FBI and the life of a double agent. This book explains what Hanssen was doing in his spying and how he hurt our country in the process. What I just couldn't believe about him is not only did he destroy his family through pornography and betrayal he caused the deaths of many others in our country and internationally. This book is a must read and was very well-written."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. What was written was, in my opinion, written well and an interesting read, but this cannot make up for the fact that the book did not deliver what it promised: the story of how the FBI caught Hanssen.While the book promises to be an &quot;unmasking of Hanssen&quot;, it really amounts to an unauthorized biography of Hanssen and Freeh. Only one chapter in the entire book actually discusses how the FBI caught on to Hanssen's spying, and that chapter pretty much glosses over most of the details. It is disappointing to find that so little attention has been paid to what the book has promised. If you come into this book expecting some amazing tale of spying and counter-spying, you'll definitely be left feeling bitter about it's coverage of the latter.A previous reviewer suggests that the book feels like it was written as a rush job, and I'd have to agree with that. But I am more frustrated by how the book has advertised something that it never really delivered. Whether that is the fault of the author for thinking there was more to his story than there really was, the publishers for wanting the book out before it was ready, or the marketing folks for misrepresenting the work, I don't know. But it doesn't really matter: in the end, it is the reader that is short-changed.Still, I think the material that is here is interesting enough on it's own, and is certainly worth a read, as long as your expectations are adjusted accordingly."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"I was pretty much disappointed. Most of the book dealt with Hanssen's psychological problems, and the immediate political impact of his capture, rather than the historical or political implications on US intelligence.Was author David Vise pressed for time? Or was there simply limited information available? I can't believe a pulitzer prize winner was just lazy, but I saw lots of high school term-paper tricks: a small book with wide margins, extra line spacing, and long block quotes and appendices.Half the book was devoted to FBI director Louis Freeh-- a man I certainly find fascinating, but not germaine to the Hanssen case. Verbatim publication of Hanssen's explicit internet posts about his wife fail to titalate, though certainly they succeed in further humiliating her and her family. They don't shed any light that paraphrasing or summarizing doesn't.Basically, I see a man who lacked either time or unclassified information, and resorted to fluffing up the page count.

If you still hold on to images of the FBI as portrayed by Effron Zimbalist, Jr. in the famous TV show, this book will obliterate those memories and leave you feeling very foolish. David Vise's presentation is clear, straightforward and loaded with detail. He does not draw conclusions or present solutions in this book. This leaves the reader to deal with his/her own emotions, not the author's. As an American, it leaves me feeling embarrassed and angry. The performance put on by members of our top law enforcement agency, took place on the world stage, in full view of the Soviets and others. While at home we failed to see what was right in front of us. Were we just too vain to look?The Bureau And The Mole is a fast read and an important book. Read it and you will understand some of the forces behind many of the major domestic and international events of the last 20+ years. The author paints a thorough picture of the two leading characters-Robert Philip Hanssen, the spy, and Louis J. Freeh, the FBI director-in this two-decade long drama. Unfortunately, Vise falls short of explaining how the FBI eventually identified and ensnared Hanssen. Perhaps it was just sheer dumb luck, be cause you sure get the impression they couldn't get out of their own way. The reader is left with the haunting question that even Hanssen asked of the FBI as he was taken into custody, \\"What took you so long?\\""},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"Forget the naysayers in other reviews posted at this site.

Would like to see John Lithgow, Donald Sutherland, or Ed Harris in starring roles!"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"There are two mysteries described in this book. One begins on October 1, 1985, the other ends on February 18, 2001. The first date marks the beginning of Robert Hanssen's career as a mole in the FBI, the second marks the end of that career. The mysteries are why Hanssen-devout Catholic, flag waver, ardent denouncer of Communists-turned to spying for the Soviets and later the Russians, and why it took so long to unearth this mole.David Vise faced a tough assignment when he attempted to resolve these mysteries, and his effort to do so is only partially successful. Ferreting out material from government sources is never an easy task. In such a sensitive matter as this one, the problems are bound to be much greater. Even so, the author should have done more with what he had. Despite interesting asides, as in the description of the Opus Dei cult, too much of the material is \\"on background,\\" and too much of what is left is inept padding-unnecessary appendices, long descriptions of William Freeh's career-which has little bearing on the core issues.For someone who knows little about the Hannsen debacle, these pages will be an eye-opener, even though the story should have been condensed into a brief New Yorker article. For those familiar with the broad outline of what happened, this will turn out to be a disappointing book about a fascinating and still unexplained subject-what made Robert Hanssen tick, and why it took the FBI fifteen years to discover the ticking."},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","review":"After reading this non-fiction account of Robert Hanssen, the high level FBI employee who divulged highly classified, top secret information to the Soviets, I again have realized how ignorant and helpless the common man really is. There is so much occuring of which the average U.S. citizen is unaware that trust continues to be the most vital yet vulnerable characteristic we possess. When that trust is violated, as it was by Robert Hanssen, I realize how important it is to have honorable men and women in positions of power.David Vise does a credible job of describing Hanssen's background and the psychological factors that contributed to Hanssen becoming a traitor. Vise describes the contradiction between Hanssen's religiosity and his proclivity for exhibitionism and aberrant sexual behavior. He also describes the way Hanssen contacted the Soviets and the spycraft he used to pass information to them.However, I didn't realize the depth and impact of Hanssen's betrayal until reading the appendix. It is there that his deeds are summarized and I realized what a dangerous and despicable man Robert Hanssen is. His arrogance and narcissism allowed him to film his wife during very private moments and then show their sexual expression of those moments to others. His deluded self-appraisal and need to feel important let him reveal Top Secret and high priority information which was potentially catastrophic to the United States.His violation of trust makes him one of the lowest forms of human. Unfortunately, I doubt Hanssen has the personal bricks and mortar necessary to self-reflect and fully realize the gravity of his misdeeds, to acknowledge and feel guilt, and seek forgiveness.I'm sure that most who read David Vise's book will be educated about a traitor and will have a strong reaction. If you are looking for something beyond pure entertainment and to shake you out of complacency, I think Bureau and the Mole will do it."},{"Title":"Rand McNally Texas Easy to Fold (Laminated)","review":"This is a standard size folding map.

It is immediately notable for covering all sides of the conflict and not just the usual emphasis on the British and French Armies.The author opens with a fairly detailed chronology of the war that notes the major military and political events in Portugal and Spain, and in Britain and France, through the abdication of Napoleon in 1814. The second major section of the book is a who's who of Portuguese, Spanish, British, and French military and political leaders directly involved in the Peninsular War. The biographies are concise but informative. The third portion of the book is a summary of the military involvement of the participants. Here, Haythornwaite includes the smaller adjunct forces from Holland, Italy, and the Kingdom of Naples, and Sicily who were represented on the battlefield.The last portion of the book includes an excellent glossary and some statistical data on the conflict. There is a nice selection of prints and paintings illustrating the period. Haythornwaite thoughtfully includes a general bibliography.\\"The Peninsular War\\" is very highly recommended to students of that conflict looking for a quick reference guide at the operational and strategic level of war. It is an excellent companion piece to the many available histories of the Peninsular War."},{"Title":"The Ivory Coast: A Novel","review":"Fascinating story in an exotic setting. Fleming takes us to the world inhabited by Blacks in 1950's Las Vegas. Here we find the entertainers forbidden to drink at the hotels where they work and the whites who follow them to their after-hours haunts. However, this no set piece of charicactures. Each denizen of Fleming's world has a purpose, and it is bound to collide with someone else. The story moves, ducks, and jives like a manic dance, all leading to a conclusion that is as interesting as it is disturbing. Fleming is a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"The Ivory Coast: A Novel","review":"I really wanted to like this book. However, I found it increasingly difficult even to keep reading it. It has a cast of such hateful, self-interested and/or depraved characters; it has so much racism and violence, that it's not even a remotely pleasurable reading experience. Add to that, many anachronisms (\\"good to go\\" and \\"gone south\\", for example, are two very modern terms not in common usage in the mid-50s) and sloppy copyediting (Spike Lee instead of Spike Jones, names misspelled, countless extra and/or misspelled words) along with famous names repeated over and over, and you have a book with a good premise that simply isn't sufficiently compelling or believable to hold one's interest. Graphically ugly sexual scenes and scenes of horrific racism further detract from what might have been an interesting examination of an era. It may well be that Las Vegas was every bit as crooked and racist as described by author Fleming but without any likeable characters, it's not possible to care much about what happens in this book--particularly with a drug-and-alcohol-addicted hero who seems always to do the wrong thing and who never becomes entirely real. That's unfortunate, because Fleming's pedigree is impressive. But a good book requires more than just a lot of research. It also requires a beating heart and The Ivory Coast's major failing is its lack of that very thing."},{"Title":"The Ivory Coast: A Novel","review":"In 1955, trumpet player Deacon rides the bus from Chicago to Las Vegas. He barely disembarks from the bus when Mo \\"the man\\" Weiner pages him. Deacon knows you always respond when someone called \\"the man\\" wants to see you and immediately does. Mo orders Deacon to drive two hours to Shipton Wells where he is to warn someone to go back to Los Angeles. Deacon does the job, but someone else shoots the man anyway. Deacon grabs the man's suitcase and asks Anita, a waitress he just met, to stash it for him.Deacon realizes everyone in Vegas tries to manipulate the odds. Mo is the front for the Chicago and Los Angeles mobs and plans to make a killing on a new casino, THE IVORY COAST, that he will open in the Black West Side of town. Worthless Worthington Jones is his front with his own contrivance for a killing. Police chief Haney has his schemes to trump everyone else. All three intersect with Deacon and that suitcase he lifted, making life dangerous for the horn player.Though Deacon trusting Anita with the booty he snatched seems strained, readers will find Charles Flemming's debut novel a fascinating look at 1950's Las Vegas. The story line is so rich with history that it makes it possible for the audience to roll with high rollers and observe the Black stars unable to eat or sleep where they performed. THE IVORY COAST is a tremendous historical intrigue that is at its finest with its fifties texture that fans of mid-twentieth century tales will enjoy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Ivory Coast: A Novel","review":"I was impressed by some of the historical detail and entertained by the setting and some of the sleazy Vegas characters but mostly I felt dissapointed.

She tells of her journey from a fulfilling but hectic urban life to one of isolation and introspection. She joins her new husband on a cattle ranch in southwest Saskatchewan and leaves behind her university teaching, her graduate studies, her support network of feminist friends, and her teenaged son. In her long, lonely hours of interaction with &quot;Nature,&quot; she encounters the mysteries and messages of the natural world and experiences the gradual healing of her own wounds. As I read Butala's book I found myself stopping to write about my own pains, my own healing, and my own mysterious encounters with Nature. It was a journey we took together, and I am stronger for the experience."},{"Title":"Perfection of the Morning: A Woman's Awakening in Nature","review":"Some books are good because they tell a good story; some are good because they are funny; some present new and intriguing ideas; some are simply well written. Sharon Butala's Perfection of the Morning is good because it is uncompromisingly honest, and that alone gives it tremendous impact. She writes about her transformation from an urban, academic feminist when she marries a rancher, moves to rural Saskatchewan, and finds herself living among rural women in the midst of nature. It would have been easy for her to have either romanticized the rural life, or to have poked fun at the men and women in whose world she had come to live. She writes about what can best be described as spiritual experiences in nature, and she could have exaggerated them and couched them in \\"feminist\\" or \\"New Age\\" terms. Instead, she writes about her perceptions and reactions simply and clearly, without fanfare.She writes of her life on a ranch in the middle of virgin prairie grassland, her frustrations and her achievements, and her insights into her relations with her new neighbors, both human and non-human, domesticated and wild, animate and inanimate. The book is wonderful because she is careful to be truthful and clear about the changes she went through, not glossing over either her difficulties or her breakthroughs of understanding. She describes the lives of rural people who spend most of their time out of doors, and in particular, the lives of ranchers who spend many hours of every day in all kinds of weather with their animals on the prairie. She talks about how living in the midst of nature affects the way people think and feel, their awareness of the world around them and their relation to it. The book describes cultural differences which are so profound that it is difficult to explain them to those of us who have grown up in suburban and urban environments. And yet she succeeds in this gem of a book to make us crave the opportunity to experience the awareness she describes. It is a pity that so few of us will be able to do so.-- Sara Shiffman, reviewer"},{"Title":"Perfection of the Morning: A Woman's Awakening in Nature","review":"The author claims that having left behind her urban comforts to live in rural Saskatchewan eventually put her closely in touch with nature. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed with her version of 'in touch with nature'. I expected to read the words of someone who respects animals and wilderness. Instead I read about her views on mice as pests, how she and her husband made their living fattening cows before the slaughter, and her twisted comments about hunters having a greater capacity for pain and suffering than the animals they cruelly kill. Exploiting animals has clearly become an inherent part of her livelihood on the farm. She thinks nothing of attending rodeos where animals are wantonly abused, and she has no trouble inflicting pain on cows through branding without anesthetics. She describes environmentalists as mostly \\"urban\\" people who are only capable of fighting the corporate world and governments by attempting to put Nature in their own terms. (Huh?) She fails to realize that if us crazy \\"urban\\" environmentalist all moved out into the wilderness, there would be no wilderness left! (I for one am proud to live in the city, leaving wild areas free for the animals to roam.) The author also totally fails to acknowledge that an animal-based diet (which she and her husband directly rely on for their livelihood) is behind much of the mass-destruction of wilderness observed in the last century. I suppose I wouldn't have been so shocked reading this book had it not been advertised as \\"an apprenticeship in nature\\". I'd sooner see it called \\"a treatise in exploiting nature\\"."},{"Title":"Base ten mathematics: Interludes for every math text","review":"This is a student workbook.

If It Die is an honest study, an insightful and delving account of Gide's early life, from childhood till his engagement to be married. I found it fascinating.Here's a writer who really mined his own life in his writing, which makes it all the more awesome to read the kernels of his deepest passions and most fervent, desperately felt works. Some of his descriptions of people are incredibly well-wrought; they spring vividly and startlingly to life.Gide is also astonishing as a writer who honestly wrote about such themes as homosexuality, masturbation and prostitution, and who struggled against society's constraints upon his very being and essence as given him by God (Gide had a puritanical upbringing). At one point he asks \\"In the name of what God or what ideal, do you forbid me to live according to my nature?...But I gradually came to wonder whether God really exacted such constraints, whether it was not impious to be in continual rebellion, whether such rebellion was not against Him.\\"But it's not all about sexuality, of course. He is a very close observer of himself and his friends, and his insights are beautiful even when difficult. Gide met Oscar Wilde and Bosy in Algiers, and shares his impressions of the man, and a sense of how Wilde was perceived and discussed by contemporaries at this point of his life. (Gide felt Wilde was often inhabiting a role, even if the role was himself--and Gide was the one who copied down Wilde's oft quoted line that he'd put his genius into his life and only his talent into his work.)The other lovely thing in reading Gide is that he reads completely naturally. I find myself forgetting from time to time that he's from a different period, or that he's a \\"great writer.\\" He seems so real, so alive, so with us...An incredible read. I'll be buying more Gide books, probably starting with Madeleine--no coincidence, Madeleine tells the story of a man who has married someone he loves but with whom he cannot be in love as he is gay. I've read the tiniest of excerpts and he cracks my heart. Fantastic, honest, courageous writer--and his makings are revealed in this autobiography, in which he goes to great lengths to show his failings, his fears and his self-delusions, as well as his inner strivings. Five stars."},{"Title":"If it die: An autobiography;","review":"Andre Gide is an author's author -- winner of the 1947 Nobel Prize in Literature; a favourite of notable scribes like Yukio Mishima and Donald Richie; one of the fathers of the modern confessional autobiography -- but outside of the academy or academia, this doesn't make him an interesting read.Concerned to the point of myopia with the triviality of life -- fleeting thoughts, snatched dreams, fears and asides -- If It Die is akin to reading several hundred pages of arbitrary notes -- a stream of consciousness journal rather than a conscious literary work.Of interest certainly in a few places -- his meetings with Oscar Wilde of particular note -- it is hard nonetheless to recommend this to a reader without a purely academic or literary interest.This is an account of the years before Gide became an accomplished author, and in all honesty, nothing much is accomplished."},{"Title":"If it die: An autobiography;","review":"I bought this book to see how this \\"literary genius\\" described his homosexual epiphany, but was disappointed to find a lot of hokum about his dull and sickly life.

I seriously doubt that he knew anything about philosophy and cared only about writing convoluted fictional narratives. In this book he confesses that his main aim was to become a famous writer. He couldn't for the life of him tell a straight story. It's all innuendo sprinkled with touching emotions. Is this honesty? Phooey!

This question has been argued in a thousand different ways. Cooper's work, in my opinion, provides the answer. He convincingly shows that Southern politics turned on the issue of slavery not just after 1850, but all the way back to 1831. Slavery and Southern safety won and lost the big elections after 1831 in every Southern state. The issues differed (states' rights, western expansion, etc.), but the heart of every issue was what it would do to slavery. It's hard to find, but if you can, read it."},{"Title":"The South and the Politics of Slavery, 1828-1856","review":"William J. Cooper goes to great lengths to reinforce the stereotype that southern politics before the War Between the States was centered around the issue of slavery and that local issues were unimportant compared to it. In The South and the Politics of Slavery, 1828-1856, Cooper is especially explicit in announcing slavery to be the &quot;fulcrum&quot; of southern politics. The book covers the period of the second American party system, from 1828 and the advent of Jacksonianism to the disintegration of the Whig party in 1856. In explaining why Whigs as well as Democrats spoke &quot;constantly&quot; about slavery-related issues, Cooper argues that only the slavery issue afforded political stability to any party position. He insists that the white South was of a unified, proslavery mind. He is not completely successful at explaining why this should be so. He does succeed in describing slavery as a national issue, pointing out that only the national government could officially recognize the peculiar institution's legitimacy in America. In the process of explication, Cooper seems to imply that the parties were utilized by southern politicians to gain national power, which could then be harnessed to protect southern rights. Since the second party system first emerged in 1828, he seems to date the birth of the southern rights crusade to a time even before the Nullification crisis.Cooper identifies four factors that animated the &quot;politics of slavery&quot;: the institution of slavery itself, southern parties and politicians, the political structure of the South, and the values of white southern society. Cooper would certainly agree that the North and South were culturally different in the antebellum era. He describes this sectional difference in political terms: local issues predominated in northern politics, whereas slavery dominated southern political discourse. Conditionally, southerners viewed parties' roles differently than did their northern counterparts--southerners relied on the national parties to work for the preservation of southern rights within the nation. Local issues were irrelevant in the South, Cooper argues repeatedly, compared to the indomitable politics of slavery. He rejects emphatically the common belief that economic matters defined party politics in the era of the second party system. Cooper dismisses the crucial significance of economic and diverse social issues at the local and state level by placing over each such issue a mask of proslavery. Specific issues emerged and faded, he argues, but slavery remained always at the core of each one. He does not seek to understand just who became Whigs or who became Democrats or the reasons why, for he sees in the South a unified system of political thought. Cooper's argument is almost circular: the drive for southern rights shaped the national party structure, but this selfsame party system fostered sectionalism within the parties and essentially destroyed the second party system. Cooper insists that the Democrats enjoyed political hegemony in the South in the late 1850s because no new party could replace the Whigs under the unspoken rules of the southern political system; the existence of anti-Democratic voters--who were a large minority of the southern population--and the existence of local issues could not subsume the slavery issue in politics. Cooper relies mainly on data from Presidential elections, ignoring nonpresidential contests at the state and local level. This approach prevents him from acknowledging the lack of unity and order in southern politics. He refuses to admit the existence of discord not only between but within parties, and he is blind to any evidence that the South was anything but unified in proslavery ideology by the 1850s."},{"Title":"Games That Teach Teams: 21 Activities to Super-Charge Your Group!","review":"Games that Teach Teams by Steve Sugar and George Takacs, is a collection of 21 well-documented, carefully detailed, copy-ready games that help teams learn about cooperation and creativity, management and goal-setting, decision-making and communication -- and secondarily fun.

Apparently he still perpetuates the extraordinary ignorance of Aristotilian/Thomistic philosophy that he has previously been so accused along with the rest of modern philosophy.For example, in Mortimer Adler's 1967 work of genius, &quot;The Difference of Man and the Difference it Makes&quot;, Adler has this to say about the mind-body argument of Aristotle and Aquinas on p.223, &quot;Because the moderate immaterialism of Aristotle and Aquinas is totally neglected or ignored in the contemporary discussion, we cannot look for criticisms of it, or objections to it, in current philosophical literature.&quot;More explicitly, Adler has this to say in the notes on p.329 about theories of Meaning - &quot;The Institute For Philosophical Research is currently engaged in the study of the whole discussion of language and thought and especially the problem of meaning. We have examined most of the major twentieth-century treatments of this subject. We have found only two contemporary writers who indicate some awareness of the correct version of the triadic theory of meaning, J.N. Findlay and R. Chisholm. Others among contemporaries who comment on the triadic theory are either unacquainted with the Aristotilian version or so misunderstand it that they treat that version and the Lockean version as if they were identical, Ogden and Richards. The rest manifest no awareness at all of the triadic theory in its correct version and, in addition, do not seem to understand the problem that it tried to solve and succeeded in solving.&quot; To my knowledge Descartes, Locke, Hobbes, Liebniz, Spinoza, Hume, Berkley, Kant and Comte are all on the list of ingorant as well.My Recommendations are Mortimer Adler's books &quot;The Difference of Man and The Difference it Makes&quot; (1967), and &quot;Some Questions About Language&quot; (1976 - without question the best book ever written on the subject), and Jacques Maritain's &quot;Degrees of Knowledge&quot; (1959), and John Deely's &quot;What Distinguishes Human Understanding?&quot; (2002). Other geniuses like Etienne Gilson are to be read by anybody interested in learning about philosophy."},{"Title":"The Punisher (Regular Series, No. 25)","review":"Frank Castle/The Punisher decided to accept ninja master Hatsu Yakamoto's invitation to home in Japan partly as a sort of vacation away from his so far fruitless search for Iris Green, the mercenary woman who had poisoned middle weight boxing champ D.J. Johnson as part of a fight-fixing scheme. Yakamoto, for his part, wants Castle to represent him in America. The Punisher gets a rather rough greeting on the foreign slopes of Yakamoto's estate, but the big surprise comes when he discovers none other than Iris Green collaborating with Yakamoto's enemies from the Eternal Sun, a dangerous group of ultra-nationalists seeking to return Japan to its imperial glory. He also meets up with some of his neighbors back home, individuals who just so happen to be Yakamoto's students. With the new gang all here, including Yakamoto's ninja daughter Katherine, a raid of the Eternal Sun headquarters is soon in order - and there's plenty of fighting for everyone in the deadly (and explosive) melee. There's an even bigger problem left to resolve, though - a certain American Congressman is selling defense secrets and conspiring with the Eternal Sun terrorists. Katherine, with revenge hot on her mind, accompanies Frank back to America, where they soon encounter none other than Iris Green once more. Katherine (whose name suddenly changes to Kathyrn in the comic's final frame) and Iris get in one heck of a catfight, but a resolution to this whole mess doesn't prove forthcoming even in this double-sized special issue of The Punisher. The action scenes are good, but the artwork on The Punisher really is right out of the boring 1970s, and that makes this comic less enjoyable than it really should be."},{"Title":"Kibbutz: venture in Utopia","review":"Spiro conducted his principal research during the year 1951. He had previously studied the Ifaluk Indians and was interested in societies in which 'cooperation' plays a large part.In the later edition of the book Spiro returned and observed the changes which had transpired in a decade. On the whole he found the kibbutz a successful social experiment. Highly motivated people who shared common values worked together to build a model of a new society. And this though many even at the time of the height of the kibbuz's influence in Israeli society resented the intrusions in their privacy, collective life required. Spiro saw the transition of a society which had openly identified with Soviet Russia to one which became more cautious in its political outlook.

You will meet some of the lesser known beings such as the Pointed People, imps, a leshy, spriggans, hobgoblins and the banshee, along with our old favorites the fairies, pixies, leprechauns and sprites. The poems come from the pens of different writers, all wonderfully talented and each gives us a light-hearted private glimpse into the lives of the wee folk. A sample: &quot;And the grayish cobweb under the oak? A scrap torn off of a banshee's cloak.&quot; You'll have fun searching the details on each page to spy out the fairies and goblins that are hiding in the nooks and crannies.

He claims that the Zoom laser provides a 26 percent improvement for in office bleaching. This is entirely untrue. Numerous studies have shown that any laser (be it zoom, sapphire etc) does not have a substantial increase in the efficacy of bleaching. It was previously thought that the light would heat up the peroxide and the heated peroxide would have increased bleaching power. However the light has the side effect of heating up your teeth and increasing the likelyhood of sensitivity. In office bleaching is harsh enough and light only increases the sensitivity. Unless someone is strapped for time, I would suggest custom trays over in office. If you choose in office, I would stay away from the laser. Most of the statements in his book are accurate, however some (including this one and more) aren't entirely true.

And the proceeds go to charity, if you are a dentist or a potential patient at all interested in cosmetic procedures then there is no reason not to buy this book.On a side note, the only negative feedback seems to come from a very embittered person.

Its mostly unrelated drivel clumped together in a pile with a price tag. First there is the just self-congratulatory drivel. It must be a dozen times that tells us \\"im not that famous\\" or \\"how can I be that famous\\" time after time. There is the just jaw dropping story about when Cindy Crawford recognized him... and there was that boy who recognized him, not the famous person he was working on...and we get to find out about what famous person wanted to date him. He tries to tell us a funny story where he made sexual jokes at Jessica simpson. (made her a badge that says \\"I was jessicas first- then in small letters \\"root canal\\") not that its creepy, its just not funny. Then he goes into his volenteer work. there isn't much room left to do any dental educaton, but what education there is in there is focused on showing you how to use the products that he sells.

Jack insists he was tonguing her as part of sex between consenting adults, but the embarrassed grandma and her granddaughter claim he tried to kill her. Jack's former lover Jill, who has an ax to grind with him, defends him. The trial goes badly as the females claim there were screams of terror while Jack insists they were screams of passion. Before he can be sentenced, the three piggy Bacon Brothers give Jack magic beans that enable him to break out of jail. Jack climbs the beanstalk through the clouds until he reaches the kingdom of giant King Titus.Jack meets the shapeshifting Margaret, who loves Titus. However, Titus desires Sugar Plum Fairy, Princess Shaylee, who he holds prisoner. Riding Meg who is in her Pegasus form, Jack meets Titus and falls in love with Shaylee at first sight. He decides to help Peg win her highness so that he can make it with Shaylee. However, love is fickle whether it is on earth, in Fairyland, or in the clouds.WHO'S AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD WOLF is a magnificent, jocular and satirical adult fairy tale that hooks the audience the moment that Jack ironically finds himself in female trouble until the final confrontation between the four wannabe lovers. The stupendous story line goofs at adult fairy tales, but does so in an affectionate tongue out of cheek manner. A fabulous second shorter tale \\"The Snowmaiden\\" is a fine romantic tale starring two lovers plus Father Frost and the Russian tundra. Marianne LaCroix entertains the troops with this one-sitting two-tale book.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Life in Egypt Under Roman Rule","review":"This is my favorite Egyptian history book. Lewis in one small volume brings Egypt during the period of Roman rule to life in the pages in front of you. The book draws from thousands of papyrus documents collected in Egypt over the years. As you might expect, these mostly deal with the minutia of daily life, contracts and prayers, polemics and taxes, and Lewis's book uses theses to tell his story. The book is highly readable, enjoyable, and I recomend it to any one with an interest in any period in Egypt (after all, how much did the Nile change between 1000 BC and 300 AD)."},{"Title":"Life in Egypt Under Roman Rule","review":"For all who are longing for the simple life of yesterday this excellent and document based book gives a first introduction how life two thousand years ago really was.Also for the non scientific reader a sketch into times long gone but nevertheless interesting in its own.

Yeats's poetry, for all its mythical, classical, and historical allusions,its occultism and arcana, values imagination over intellection, and the resonant image over the plain statement. Organic images, as distinct from descriptive or ornamental images, generate symbolic ripples. Kermode holds that Yeats's recurrent, almost obsessive images, such as tree, bird, tower, and dancer, reach a high point of Romantic imagery and organic form. The pre-eminent example of symbolic images (archetypes), is the dancer and the dance at the end of \\"Among School Children,\\" an image that reconciles body and soul, identity and action, artist and art. Kermode's study is a standard in Yeats criticism."},{"Title":"The Thanatos Syndrome","review":"The book smelled of mildew when I received it. I wish I would have known that before buying."},{"Title":"Cabin Gulch","review":"Cabin Gulch is the restored version of The Border Legion and has without a doubt the greatest of Zane Grey's villains--the blond beast, Gulden, whose way with women was a rope and a cave, the most vicious and depraved of the border bandits. And as in earlier works by Zane Grey this novel had undergone many editorial changes demanded by his publisher before they would print it. Things today which seem very tame indeed, but yet his editors felt did not belong in fiction, regardless of how historically accurate Zane Grey was being to actual events upon which this book was based. When Joan Randle decides to follow her 'boyfriend' Jim Cleve after he departs because of a quarrel she finds herself captured by this outlaw gang and held, only to find out Jim has joined them as well. (She had accused Jim of not being man enough to even be bad, so he sets out to prove her wrong.) Cabin Gulch is a fascinating look at what happens to men, I should say, mankind, when driven by their passions and left to revert to the barbaric when the environment is one of dog eat dog i.e. \\"survival of the fittest\\" a phrase used by Darwin and popularized by Zane Grey, as he subscribed to some of Darwin's theories, as seen in many of his novels as he expressed his philosophy of life, and concerns for America in his writings. But if one goes beyond any \\"hidden\\" agenda and reads this book as a novel of escapism and adventure and romance it is a good read I think you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Cabin Gulch","review":"Since I am a fan of Zane Gray, this was a really good book to me. There was a part in the book where the main female character was raped. That was the first time I had read that type of violence in one of his books but it was a really good book. I am glad I got it."},{"Title":"Flesh of the Church, Flesh of Christ: At the Source of the Ecclesiology of Communion (Pueblo Books)","review":"Jean Marie Tillard wrote this book as a companion volume to the previously published 'Church of Churches'. It provides at the same time a resource which demonstrates the foundation of the so-called communion ecclesiology which is predominant in the post-conciliar Catholic Church in both the Scriptures and the Tradition, as well as being a response to his critics who accused him of being too innovative in his theology of the Church. In referring to the Tradition of the Fathers of the 'undivided' Church, that is the Church of the first Christian Millennium, of the traditions of West and East (both Antiochene and Alexandrian), Fr Tillard demonstrates that the roots of communion ecclesiology are found equally, if with different emphases, in the common Tradition. No only is the breadth of Tillard's reading phenomenal, as evidenced by the extensive footnotes, but also his pastoral and ecumenical awareness are evident in his demonstration of the openness of communion ecclesiology to dialogue with other Christians as well as being a basis for solidarity with the poor. This book is a key work for understanding the depths of communion ecclesiology, and should be read by anyone wanting to deepen their vision of the Church by reference to the Scriptures and to the Fathers. Despite its importance and scholarliness, this work is surprisingly easy to read and concise."},{"Title":"Flesh of the Church, Flesh of Christ: At the Source of the Ecclesiology of Communion (Pueblo Books)","review":"This book provides a good introduction to Tillard'swork. It was written in response to some questions aboutthe sources for Tillard's larger work _Church of Churches_,but the English translation of that book was rathersloppy.

His challenge is entertaining as he begins to clean up this copperyhaired guttersnipe and attempt to civilize her.Thier ship is wrecked and they are isolated in a land inhabited by indians and crew members who become 'interested' in Danny once they learn 'he' is a 'she'. Adrians problems become more complex while trying to get them to safety, due to a jealous woman who hates Danny.

Fink himself was Husserls editor and a student of his phenomenology. Fink worked so closely with Husserl and with his writtings that he had mastered not only Husserls phenomenology but also the phenomenological method of epoche and reduction. The phenomenological reduction is a technique by which the subject makes a radical psychological shift in his thinking about the world, a total rejection of the cultural, scientific, and natural pressupositions and beliefs that prevent knowledge of and grasping of truth [transcendental reallity]. There are in general two kinds of phenomenologists, outsider phenomenologists (those who exclusively study the phenomenological movement and history, or believe in it's philosophical extractions), and insider phenomenologists (those who live in the reduced state of consciousness, perform the psychical act of phenomenological reduction and hence go beyond philosophy and science). History records that most likely Husserl himself was the only insider phenomenologist, however this book reveals that Fink also was an insider. In my opinion Fink not only did phenomenological science in the same manner as Husserl, I think Fink actually whent beyond Husserl.The Sixth Meditation not only lays the foundations for the idea of a transcendental theory of method, ie. methods of the \\"how to\\" performing the phenomenological reduction of human cosciousness, but also plans to endevour into a phenomenology of phenomenology. Fink was to have written the so-called \\"Seventh Metaphysic\\", from which actual metaphysical renderings were to have grounded phenomenology as a metaphysics, as ontology - and hence as a truely accepted rational science. Before this could be completed the Nazi political movement came to power and Fink was exiled from Germany.This dialectic masterpiece also has textual notations by Husserl contained in the Appendices at the end of the book where Husserl applies Finks groundings of the transcendental methodic. The Appendices discuss actual political extractions for phenomenology.......with such things as \\"the phenomenological community\\" Husserl reveals his interest for phenomenology as a globalized state of co-awakening human consciousness.Here I will sample quotes from Part One of the book:\\"Instead of inquiring into the being of the world, as does traditional \\"philosophy\\" dominated by the dogmatism of the natural attitude, or, where inquiry is not satisfied with that, instead of soaring up over the world \\"speculatively\\", we, in a truly \\"Copernican revolution\\", have broken through the confinenment of the natural attitude, as the horizon of all our human possibilities for acting and theorizing, and have thrust forward into the dimension of origin for all being, into the constituitive source of the world, into the sphere of transcendental subjectivity\\"\\"The phenomenological system itself as the architectonic of transcendental philosophy cannot be drawn up ahead of time, but is only to be obtained from the \\"matters themselves\\" by passing through concrete phenomenological work\\"\\"transforming himself through the deepest self-reflection, man transcends himself and his natural human being in the world, by producing the transcendental onlooker, who as such, does not go along with the belief in the world, with the theses on being held by the world-experiencing human\\"\\"In the phenomenological reduction there occurs the \\"awakening\\" of the transcendental constitution of the world, and the process of coming to transcendental self-consciousness is accomplished. In and by the thematizing of the phenomenological onlooker constituitive cosmogony comes to itself, steps out of darkness and \\"being-outside-itself\\" into the luminosity of transcendental \\"being-for-itself\\"\\"What is interesting to note in the development of phenomenology is the effect Heideggers ontology in Being and Time has had on Husserls writtings. For the pressence of a concern for being, and justifications for pure phenomenology, justifications for the subordination of phenomenology over hermeneutic ontology is made clear in Finks book. Both the language and the intent behind the dialectic has changed, for Husserls Cartesian Meditations and this Sixth Meditation by Fink. For me, this book is the cullmination of all phenomenological efforts, the ressolution of the phenomenological movements place in history and the foundation for future institutions of evolutionary thought-science.Bruzinas translation of Finks manuscript is courageously correct, nothing in this translation has been compromised or dummied down. Not only that but the fonting, bracketing, and italics used complement the cryptic elegance of the text. I reccomend this publication to anyone who seeks the deepest truths and has a likeing for the most advanced systems of knowledge."},{"Title":"Sixth Cartesian Meditation: The Idea of a Transcendental Theory of Method (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"The &quot;Sixth Cartesian Meditation&quot; engages with crucial issues of what we might call the place of phenomenology in the human (social, existential, etc.) world, and the place of various aspects of the human world (e.g., science, phenomenology itself...) in phenomenology. The positions stated are generally described as being only beginnings of approaches to issues each of which requires a great deal of work which is beyond the scope of the text. And it seems to me that there is ample room for questioning whether the positions sketched out (or at least translated -- I have no idea what the original is...) are always beyond dispute in all their particulars. But it is a rare book that even *tries* to raise these issues, and I think the general outline presented for phenomenology as offering the [only] way to a radical and universal transformation of human life, such that all human existence hitherto will, in retrospect, be seen to have been naive, limited, etc., is sound. This is an extremely important book (of course there are others, but this one is short, and, for the difficulty of its subject matter, accessible). The task of humanity in our time is to get on with carrying out the detailed path of thinking it outlines, and, thereby, bringing that incommensurably better world into being. At the very least, the book helps us understanding how far our present &quot;culture&quot; falls short of what phenomenology makes possible for us.

The title is misleading because one is lead to believe the authour is pro divine name in Greek Scripture as well as Hebrew Scripture. This person spends far too much time on talking about Hebrew manuscripts from 1385 AD being the only possible manuscript support. The focus should have been on obvious Scriptures in Revelation that says \\"hallelujah,' and Scriptures like in Luke 20:42 where it says NWT 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, \`Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand 43 until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.' Obviously other translations should put \\"Jehovah\\" in as well, which is not the case.On a comprehensive study on this subject for proof the divine name did exist, try reading Gerard Gertoux's book \\"The name of God Yehowah...\\" which is important to read but unfortunately difficult at times because of French syntax. This book will explain everything that Lynn does not discuss!Again, it's not completely bad because it has a glossary of terms and gives a detailed list of all the \\"J references\\" from 1385, but generally gives the reader no hope or proof of the divine name in the Greek Scriptures.

Kauaujaq greatly misses her mother, and several years pass with her dealing with her grief on her own. It is explained that the people of her village like to play soccer out on the sea ice under the moonlight, using a caribou skin ball stuffed with moss and fur. Her grandmother tells her that the thousands of thin strands of light moving about in the northern lights above them are really the souls of those that have passed on, playing soccer with a huge, frozen walrus head. This greatly consoles Kataujak as she feels her mother's presence, and no longer feels as lonely.Full of Canadian content, the text and illustrations realistically convey many aspects of life in Canada's north. Highly recommended as a read-aloud for children in grades 1-2."},{"Title":"Judicial Review in New Democracies: Constitutional Courts in Asian Cases","review":"Since the fall of communism in the late 80s and early 90s, new democracies have embraced constitutional courts exercising judicial review. Given the vicious attacks upon courts in the US, one often wonders why anyone would adopt constitutional courts with the power to attack the result of the democratic process, and push its own policy. Ginsburg presents a compelling answer: new democracies turn to constitutional courts as a source of political insurance. When creating a constitution, parties will be more willing to create a court when the political future is uncertain, where they predict that they will likely be in the minority and thus may require extra protection to ensure that the other party(s) will not be able to abuse them. Where a party believes it will be in solid control in the future, the court will likely be weaker because the dominant party would not want to limit its own powers. Ginsburg examines this theory against three case studies of Mongolia, Korea, and Taiwan; the experience of these three countries strongly supports the political insurance theory. This interesting, original work presents judicial review as an integral part of democracy especially in countries without prior democratic experience. Additionally, Ginsburg examines courts in areas that have received little attention in the US, thus, anyone interested in non-western constitutionalism should check this book out."},{"Title":"Natural history and antiquities of Selborne","review":"This book arrived in perfect order for me, excellent condition and the packaging was excellent.

However, forearmed with some background knowledge, I thoroughly enjoyed this imaginative work. It is an expertly distilled memoir by five doomed men, each of whose point of view adds body and texture to the rather dry, slogging account told by Cherry.EKW"},{"Title":"The Birthday Boys","review":"Bainbridge's book made this Alaskan feel cold.

I very much enjoyed the first chapter, narrated by Taff Evans, finding it very well writen and in character. What I liked most about this story was its sense of voice. As the author swiched between characters, the reader recieved an excellent retelling of the facts from one of five very different points of view.

Scott and his men are refugees from the Victorian era, still clinging to what were, by 1911, slightly outdated notions of heroism. We are in the dying years of the Empire, the last days of the era before telecommunications and airplanes made this sort of adventure almost impossible. Scott is a brave, loyal leader of his men, but he is a poor leader for such an expedition - he is alternately too stubborn and too indecisive. Scott is the book's most sympathetic figure, but also the most stupid as he leads four brave men to their deaths. If the expedition had been led by Oates, Bainbridge's cold, ruthless villain, one feels it might have had a happier ending - yet who would care about the men who came second if they had survived and lived to be 80? Bainbridge gets into the heads of these men and charts their mental and physical voyages from hope to their inevitable destiny in snowy graves. It is often easy to forget that we are reading the words of a woman born in the 1930s rather than the actual words of Wilson, Scott and the other men. Her feel for the extraordinary beauty and violence of the Antarctic is one of the books many strengths. As in her Titanic book Bainbridge paints a convincing picture of those few eventful years between the death of Victoria and the start of World War 1, when the world was overtaking the Empire and Britain and her citizens were struggling to assert themselves in quite the way they had in the previous century."},{"Title":"The Birthday Boys","review":"A wonderful tale of heroism and incompetence.

I have just finished her \\"Watson's Apology\\" and found it wonderful as well. But I always use a caveat with Ms. Bainbridge, as I do with Ian McEwan: she is an acquired taste. \\"The Birthday Boys\\" is no exception to the rule.To begin with, as with many of Ms. Bainbridge's novels, this is based on true events. In this case the ill-fated Robert Falcon Scott expedition to the South Pole in 1912. Scott and four of his crew died on their way back from the Pole itself which had already been reached by the intrepid Roald Amundsen two weeks prior. What Bainbriddge does is invite herself and us into the minds of the five men who died, and each of the interior glimpses and monologues takes place on the event of each one's own birthday, and reviews various aspects of his life including how he is feeling that day. Scott, who died last we must suppose, is saved for last.It is a bold and marvelous literary concoction of fact, fantasy, and intellectual probing coupled with an almost uncanny peek into the hearts and minds of the men who cannot, of course, be interviewed and what they truly thought can never be truly known. Yet I have accepted these portraits as actual \\"interviews.\\" Each of the men is given a full literary treatment, a complete characterization. It takes a lot of courage to do what Bainbridge does (she does it in \\"Watson's Apology\\" as well): she tells us things she cannot possibly know for sure and leaves it at that. Many people try to do that today, they pretend they are writing history when in fact, they are writing fantasy. Bainbridge doesn't pretend to be doing anything but writing about people and what she thinks or imagines they might have been thinking at any one time. She is the best at this conceit that I have ever read.I had the advantage of already having read Cherry-Garrard's rather lengthy tomb: The Worst Journey In The World, so I was aware of the characters, of who they really were and what their various jobs were. That may or may not be essential. I will have to let the reader figure that out. They may stand on their own as literary concoctions, fanciful imaginaries floating at the margins of consciousness, or, as in my own case, rock-solid portrayals of real people I had already read about extensively.She's a bold writer, and, I think, it might require a bold reader to take this on. But it's wonderful if you just go with it and accept what's there.Four Stars from me is the same as Five Stars. I always save that fifth star for something I have yet to see. So consider this a Big Pick from yours truly."},{"Title":"The Birthday Boys","review":"Her prose is economical and expressive to the point that other talented writers now strike me as using too many words. What's more, Bainbridge's imagination is stunning. Although I understood that I was reading a 'fictional' account of the failed Scott expedition, I kept finding myself thinking that I was there, witnessing what happened, peering over a shoulder as someone wrote in his journal...(!) She's that good. I'm a historian, and I find B's imagined re-creation of what happened on the Scott expedition (which is based on her expert command of the historical sources) completely convincing, and powerfully moving. What a genius!Bravo, Bainbridge."},{"Title":"The Birthday Boys","review":"Bainbridge's hair-raising fictionalized account of Captain Robert Scott's doomed1912 venture to the South Pole begins with the glory and giddiness of their send off and ends with disappointment and slow death. Five men reached the pole and Bainbridge chooses these five to narrate, in turn, a section of their journey - during which each has a birthday, his last.Taff Evans, the only non-officer, opens the book with his account of drunken parties and celebrity treatment. His hero-worship of Scott and glory tales of previous adventures contrasts with the bitter fears of a wife chary of being left destitute with children in a grimy slum. Taff is gritty and honest, roaring with life and humor.Too bad Bainbridge's officers didn't have a little more of that rough and ready ebullience. Subsequent narratives - of the ocean crossing, setting up advance camps, scientific side trips, the numerous setbacks, disasters, equipment failures and human endurance - are all told by men with stiff upper lips.Their idea of rousing good fun is a drunken scrimmage which ends with them all half naked. They avoid coming to terms with poor preparation and the disastrous equipment choices by blaming bad luck and admiring each other's bravery and fortitude in the face of each new disaster.Bainbridge is a marvelous writer who brings the horrifics of cold and inadequate preparation vividly to life. Her point is to show the human waste engendered by the British code of honor and this she does. Yet, because of Capt. Scott's voluminous notes, recovered after his death, this is a story that's been often told. Nothing beats the nonfiction version for sheer excitement and heart break."},{"Title":"The Birthday Boys","review":"The Scott Expedition of 1912 is documented by dozens if not hundreds of books. So why would a writer bother to take on the topic as Historical Fiction? In this case she had much more in mind that merely sharing the hypothetical viewpoints of Scott and 4 others who narrate their experiences. She uses the narrators sequentially as opposed to having them recount their opinions of the same event. There is some redundancy in opinions, but I really liked the way the narrative was a continual thread, and not a series of viewpoints on a redundant topic.Ms. Bainbridge uses this tragedy of Scott to illustrate a turning point in History, a change in the fundamental beliefs and manner of approaching problems. The Scott Expedition serves as an example of the great changes during the very early 20th Century. The fact that Scott and his men failed to be the first, and that they all died, is either tragic or negligent when the fact that this was his second time out to plant the flag at the pole is considered. Not only is he beaten to his goal, his philosophies are proved to be the reason for his failure.As with mountaineering these other attempts at, \\"firsts\\" were the domain of, \\"Class\\", and not necessarily ability. Those who lead, like Officers who had bought their Commissions were not necessarily qualified, and were often inept at that which they attempted foolishly and were risking their death and that of their men.\\"Courage\\", was what would see a task through. A leaking ship before even leaving its berth was just a preview to the lack of planning and leadership that killed them all. Scott would not use dogs it must be a march. In this he was almost Victorian in his thinking. But then he brought motorized machines that not only were useless and in total opposition to his other ideas, it was also an indicator of how indecisive he was. His men followed him blindly as millions of others would follow, leaping out of trenches in WWI and charging the enemy. Forget the machine gun, for this was how it had always, \\"been done\\".Money could get you on the ship just as a fee could get you guided up Mount Everest in 1996. The results were in some cases the same. Optimism and the willingness to risk one's life were based not on known competence in the leader and the soundness of the plan, rather whether people liked one another. The fact that a Scott team member was effectively blind did not mean he should be excluded. The climber on Everest who became blind for a time as the result of a cornea operation that reacted poorly to the low pressure of Everest was an eerie parallel.When the story is placed in its Historical context the work is very well done. If it is read without a thought to the time during which the expedition took place, I can see why some would be less than thrilled with the book. However when read in perspective it is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Birthday Boys","review":"This was our book group's selection for our March 1999 meeting.

One can't help thinking how differently things would have been in our times. The competition with the Norwegians raises questions about the &quot;ground rules&quot; for geographic and other scientific journeys of discovery. Does the best sponsored, highest technology equipped crew always win? What do you win? Today I yawn at the corporate sponsored, high tech attempts to circle the globe in a hot air balloon. Turn off that computer and that global navigation system. Now we're talking about a challenge.

Under the leadership of Captain Robert \\"Falcon\\" Scott, the individuals reveal their personal experiences and troubles as they fight against faulty equipment, insufficient rations and sub-human conditions to eventually perish in that unforgiving landscape.Beginning with the rebellious Edgar Evans who celebrates his final night ashore by getting blind drunk and nearly losing thenational flag on top of a tram, Bainbridge demonstrates to the reader just how much mastery and supremacy Scott held over hischarges. Amongst the disputes, personal doubt and hidden communal fear, each crew member set aside their grievances andallowed the inspirational leader to fill their damaged souls with new-found confidence and hope.Bainbridge specialises in creating commentaries from the minds of historical figures, whether they are tragic or comic, in peril onthe war-torn fields of Crimea (Master Georgie) or staying until the bitter end aboard a dying ship (Every Man for Himself). Herstyle and panache in creating such memoirs is a vigorous step into the future of fiction, stepping away from the creative minds of others and creating a voice for the voiceless, the displaced, the dead."},{"Title":"The Birthday Boys","review":"I have recently &quot;discovered&quot; Beryl Bainbridge, and have found her voice to be one of the most engaging in current fiction. I have very little interest in Scott's brilliant failure, but Bainbridge takes the reader inside the souls of five doomed heroes of the British Empire in a heartbreaking and mesmerizing way. I especially appreciate the lack of revisionism in her writing- these men are not judged by our standards, but by those of their own time. (I also loved Forever England.)"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Leagues : How Baseball Changed As the Rules, Ball, Franchises, Stadiums and Players Changed, 1900-1998","review":"I felt compelled to write this review in response to the author Russell O. Wright opionon that changing of the game is something we have no control over, but I feel likewise. One just has to look at the game today and wonder what it's gonna be like in another 20 years from now. But Mr. Wright does a respectable job in this work and although I feel the sport has change for the worst, fan support keeps growning, but for how much longer I'm not really sure. Baseball has come a long ways from the sport that I knew in the early 60's. I guess the bottom line is there's always gonna be somebody that's has to feel the need for change to make the sport better. But really isn't it all about money and greed? How much longer can Baseball go on with the changes it's made these last 30 years is beyond me. There have been great things happen to baseball but I feel that baseball needs to take a closer look at what has happen to the sport and wonder how much longer can it survive if it keeps going in this direction."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Overall this was a good read but the ending did not live up to the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Disapointing, but does show promise.If this book is anything to go by, Caitlin really should stick to writing 'The Dreaming' for DC."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"After reading such stellar reviews of this book, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I'm halfway through it and I just don't get it. There are some really beautiful examples of writing in the book, but I keep waiting (completely in vain) for \\"the point.\\" So far all it's done is given me the urge to shower again due to the descriptions of hoarders, cockroaches, pet tarantulas, yellowed teeth, crack houses, and an overwhelming lack of good hygiene from the characters. Not really feeling it, and I don't get the hype."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I began this novel hoping to read something new and different. I am forced to admit that I gave up after 290 pages. I know, only 60 to go, but this novel is just dreadful. Goth, angst, lesbians, homosexuals, the war in heavan ( not very well explained might I add). Who cares? I realized I didn't care about a single character. Not a very promising debue."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Mysterious monsters harass Goth kids in this first novel from the prominent New Horror writer.For me, the shiny sentence-level writing is the strongest point of this book. The plot, which uses the time-honored horror element &quot;something happened that was so horrible we can get hints of it only in flashbacks&quot;, makes reasonably good sense and incorporates some interesting ideas, though the existence of too many characters means that they shift disconcertingly in importance. Generally, the mood is successfully dark, and the horrific ideas are original, though I didn't find the story especially scary.The characters, however, are a weakness in my opinion: they're losers, people who actually care about the difference between deathrock and Goth, kids who have no apparent interests, goals or dreams beyond drugs, casual affairs and garage bands. I'd say that -- without using the criterion of literal age -- there are no adults in this book. I had a hard time sympathizing with these pathetic, soullessly conformist waifs."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I heard this book had something going for it. The friend who told me was completely wrong. The plot was never explain; the characters lacked individuality, brains and substance.I would say Kiernan is not a complete lost. She is skilled with words. I'll give her another chance."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"There is no story and the characters are boring losers, young freak street people involved in endless self-destruction, getting high, getting nowhere and screwing whom ever, living in garbage with garbage. The main char paints her bedroom windows black with spider webbing and only allows the lumination of candles. How retarded. How DEPRESSING. I've seen 20+ years of that kind of people walking the streets of The City(San Francisco), I personally do not need nor want to read about it! Especially without any point or direction. Where's the story? What's the point?I quess if you happen to be into rude and grude kool-aid red dreadlocks, dope smokers/slammers, mushroom eaters and acidheads, ....this is your book.If Caitlin R. Kiernan could only get a rolling story going she'd be dynamite, CUZ SHE CAN WRITE AND WRITE READABLE (you know what i mean)!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"The prose in this novel (and every other work by Kiernan that I have read) is magnificent. I read Kiernan because of her storytelling abilities.This novel was more or less a character study. There was a fairly interesting story in there, but the main focus of Silk was the experiences, feelings, and motivations of the main characaters - especially Spyder. I was simply left feeling lukewarm, at best, towards them. There are some creepy moments here, and Kiernan does an excellent job at making me feel the characters' fear... but that is about all I was able to feel for them."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Granted, I've only read the first chapter, but if the first chapter (prologue actually) is at all indicative of the book, as it should be, I'd rather undergo testicular surgery by a drunk orthodontist &quot;flying&quot; through his first acid trip in a white-washed prison cell with not-so-sterile equipment than read the rest of this book.As I was reading it I thought, &quot;Gosh, did Poppy get a labotomy? and take up an interest in lesbian porn? suit her better.&quot;And wasn't the war in Heaven bit done a few years ago in the Prophecy movies and in Anne Rice's Memnoch the Devil, and wasn't it done better? Ah, well, at least she picked a good writer to rip off."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin is my newest favorite author. Mostly because she writes exactly where I live: the final few degrees of Scorpio. Those late degrees where Persephone is returning from the underworld, the first rays of Sagittarius--the deep wisdom that can only be born of the living of powerlessness and loss--shining like that proverbial light at the end of the tunnel upon her innocence-lost face.Wisdom born of rape? Yes. Powerlessness is at the heart of all wisdom, and what separates it from mere knowledge. Caitlin expresses this journey better than any author I've encountered, and I simply love her for it.Nin, who plays the trine between Pisces and Scorpio, comes close in some of her prose: House of Incest comes to mind. But Caitlin wins my award for Queen of the Underworld Rising. Reborn, yet still looking back over her shoulder at what she has just learned. Ruminating on the journey, the voyage of the soul into the deep dark. The loss of innocence. The only doorway leading to the growth of consciousness into a self-awareness that finally has depth.Certainly not for everyone. Certainly for everyone who has learned to cherish this voyage."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin R. Kiernan's Silk is an amazing book. Anyone who's spend any time in the punk or goth underground will immediately recognize how well Kiernan has captured that subculture. Her characters are by turns moving, infuriating, poignant, seductive, fascinating - all those traits necessary for characterization to transcend the mere cardboard dolls that populate so many contemporary horror novels.And this is a really scary novel. Not in that hokey, Hollywood Jason-and-Freddy-and-Scream way, but in infinitely more genuine and disquieting way. Treading a fine line between the ghost story and weird tale, Kiernan explores territory all too often ignored by today's writers of the macabre. This is a rare talent and one that deserves our attention."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin R. Kiernan knows how to scare people. That much is obvious. More importantly, she knows how to write fantastic fiction with a flair and sense of understatement rarely seen in contemporary horror stories. Silk is a gritty, surreal trip down a rabbit hole filled with worse things than most of us would ever want to imagine, and the author has a knack for suggesting, rather than showing, so that we make our own mental pictures of the terrors that populate her fictional landscape. This book is just amazingly good."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"As someone who is hopelessly addicted to horror, I'm always delighted to come across a new author (or an author who's new to me, at least) who transcends the expectations and weaknesses of the genre, writers like Thomas Ligotti, Poppy Z. Brite, Clive Barker, Peter Straub, Kathe Koja, Michael Marshall Smith, and, well, you get the idea. Add Caitlin R. Kiernan to that list. Silk is a fabulous journey into darkness."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"A word or warning: if you're looking for escapist fluff, literary background noise designed for those with poor reading comprehension and short attention spans, Silk isn't the novel for you. If, on the other hand, you're after one of the richest and most powerful pieces of dark fiction in recent years, let me recommend Caitlin Kiernan. In Silk she has created a novel that is not only delightfully disturbing, but, for want of a better word, substantial. Much of the strength of Kiernan's writing rests in her superb use of the English language, and at times she approaches prose poetry (think a toned down William Faulkner crossed with Shirley Jackson and H.P. Lovecraft)and her ability to create characters that we believe in, who quickly become real people to us, is amazing. Her story is complex, weaving together such disparate material as partical physics, the Greek tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice, and apocryphal elements of Christian mythology, played out against a post-industrial backdrop. And she is surely an author who expects the reader to work, not merely passively consume the words that have been set before them. The reward is great, however, for those who are patient and inquisitive enough to follow the path that Kiernan has laid out in this magnificient novel. Silk is as much a poignant coming of age story as it is an exploration of things that go bump in the night. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I bought this book because Neil Gaiman, one of my favorite authors, had said nice things about it. I was not disappointed. SILK takes the reader on a terrifying and revealing romp through the psyches of its characters, and keeps us wondering where reality begins and sanity ends. Is the post-industrial wasteland of this novel REALLY inhabited by vengeful angels and giant spider-like things? Is Spyder Baxter a shaman? Or is the author only showing us the things that haunt the mind, that our fears might as well have the power to bring to life? Either way, this is a heck of a novel and should be read by anyone with a taste for hip and seriously creepy fiction!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Kiernan hits a homerun with this one. I finally picked up Silk after letting it sit on my shelf for a very long time. Why did I wait so long? I was blown away by Kiernan's writing style--poetic, languid, dreamlike--although it took me a few pages to warm up to the rhythm of her writing. She's very effective at slowly building the tension and supsense without once unleashing a gore-fest in order to achieve a nightmare quality.Spyder Baxter is the goth-lesbian-store owner-druggie-sometimes mental patient that is at the center of the goings-on in this novel. People who seem to have nowhere else to go are drawn to her. Daria Parker is the ambitious, creative songwriter/bassist for Stiff Kitty, a local Birmingham, Alabama punk group just shy of success. Niki, Keith, Mort, Theo, Byron, Robin, and Walter round out the two groups that become linked by bizarre nightmares and visions of skittering things that manage to avoid being seen directly.This is perhaps a portrait of the terror that can develop from being abused and outcast. Spyder is a very troubled young woman, and her past not only haunts her but reaches out to haunt those closest to her. Silk is not about blood, gore, and a high body count. Yes, the spiders (and the spider-like things) are creepy enough, but the heart of the story is the loneliness, despair, and purposelessness of many of the characters. This is a great tale of suspense, and Kiernan's writing created a sense of unease, of some creeping terror that couldn't be named. I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I'm glad I finally picked it up to read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk is the sort of book that draws you in from the very first page and never lets go, leaving you delightfully dizzy at the end of its blur of nightmares and shadows. Gritty and smart, Kiernan's ability to mold words into art is nothing short of spectacular and she may be one of the most important new authors working in any genre (or even non-genre fiction) today. Not since the appearance of Kathe Koja in the early 90s have I been so taken by an author. I also recommend her short story collection, Tales of pain and Wonder. Silk is as sexy as the title implies, though its allure is something you probably wouldn't expect."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Every once in a while I find a book waiting to be read, and I am not even sure how it got there. While I am not sure why or when I purchased 'Silk', I am very glad I did. Pickings have been slim for good modern horror lately, and this book fills the bill in very satisfying fashion. Caitlin Kiernan chooses an unusual setting and cast to tell a story that is part horror and part social history and in doing so makes the point that it is not always the creatures with claws and fangs that are the real villains of horror stories. Sometimes the real monsters never appear on the stage at all.The players in this story are drawn from urban America's children of a lesser God. The goths, punk, skinheads and other border subcultures that the mainstream world isn't quite comfortable with, but which fascinate nonetheless. This is the story of Spyder Baxter - goth, storeowner, and lesbian whose sanity is always in doubt, and who is haunted by memories of a traumatic and fatal childhood. It is also the story of Daria Parker - lead singer/writer in the punk band Stiff Kitten, a motley crew who could almost see success if they could just keep it together.Each of these women and their friends mirror completely the cultures they live in. Even if 'Silk' were not also a horror story, it would be a brilliant talk of life in a subculture, similar in style to 'North Coast Gothic,' which never set out to be a horror story. The participants seem hell bent on snatching chaos from the jaws of rationality, living in stressed out lives of their own creation, always acting in a melodrama. But something much darker lives below, haunting the basement of Spyder's cellar. Memories waiting to be brought to life again.Spiders haunt this story, black widows and brown recluses hiding just out of sight, hunter/killers waiting for the right magic spell to wake them up. And when the spell is done these eight-legged players perform almost invisibly, in dreams and on the edge of perception. But they take their toll, and people die. In the city of Birmingham, sleepless nights become the only defense.This is certainly one of the best first horror novels I have read in a while, and the writer has gone on to accumulate kudos and awards. The story develops slowly, but inexorably, but the pace is always sufficient to hold the readers interest. If you are looking for something a bit off the beaten track and easy to read, then add 'Silk' to your list."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I'm not really sure what to say about Silk. I've never read Poppy Z. Brite, so I can't compare this to her books, but Silk (in the spider passages) is similar in gory tone to American Psycho and in creepy crawly goosebumps atmosphere to early Peter Straub. It took me about a chapter to get used to the fragmented sentence structure, but eventually I didn't notice it and it didn't detract from the story.I wasn't sure if I felt sorry for Spyder or if she was a monster; at the end, I still have no idea what the connection was between Spyder, her father and the black widows, nor could I figure out if the spiders obeyed her or were fighting her. There was quite a bit of muddiness at the end, where the sentence structure practically dissolved; I'm sure the author was using the frantic pace to add to the feeling of the story, but it got a little hard to follow. The author went from following one character mostly (Daria) to following another (Niki) a little more abruptly than I thought the story called for.There are some gory scenes (I really didn't need all the pus references) but the best parts of the book are the details of the goth/drug/rave scenes (music, hair and clothing especially) and the dialogue. Kiernan writes very vividly in a sort of oblique style and while the book in particular wasn't something I'd read all the time, it was definitely interesting in a disturbing, memorable way."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"this is the best book i've read since geek love and gravity's rainbow. silk is a sad and beautiful and sometimes scary book full of sad and beautiful and sometimes scary people, which must have been written with sad and beautiful and sometimes scary people in mind. this is the sort of book that makes me remember why i'd rather be reading books than watching television or playing video games and i recommend it to all who delight in truly unique books!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in quite some time. It grabbed my attention and would not let me go. I thought the characters were amazingly developed, and I definitly felt a sense of connection with them. Caitlin uses metaphors in a way that makes me envious. And I enjoyed the fact that the novel was set in Birmingham immensely... I was familiar with many of the places and street names, which was fun to say the least. I think Caitlin is a very promising writer, and the numerous awards and recognition she has recieved gives credit where credit is due. However, this book may not be appropriate for the weak-stomached or closed-minded..."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"The description of Kiernan's writing as a mix of Bradbury and Childress is right on the mark! She manages to make even the most mundane aspects of life feel slightly askew, creepy and even threatening. Her fluid descriptions have the effect of transporting the reader to a fresh vision of the most every-day events. And the characters of SILK seem like the kids down the street (much like Boo Radley in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;). Here in the South we cherish our ghosts and crazy relatives; the past is never far from our hearts and minds. Kiernan captures that perfectly in her writing. This is a divinely spooky book in the tradition of the best gothic and southern storytelling tradition."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Traditional horror readers might be disappointed by Silk. The poetic descriptions are subtle, unwrapping too slowly to create enough thrill or tension. I was also distracted by the odd lilt of Keirnan's writing style. Her metaphors are strangely worded, and feel somewhat forced to me.The subject matter is much like Poppy Z. Brite. Goths will love the similar references to their subculture's music and attitudes. But Brite's writing is sharper and more natural. I'd recommend Silk to goth fiction fans only."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I read this book when I was twenty and loved it and thought it would be cool to reread again. It didn't hold the same magic for me as it did the first time. I think that some books are just meant to be read at certain points in your life, and that point is obviously not right now for me regarding Silk! I love Ms. Kiernan's use of the language and the cool atmosphere she creates, but I found the book really depressing. Everyone lives in garbage enhanced conditions, in what seems to be a ghetto like area. The characters are all miserable. I disliked most of them. I wanted to start highlighting every time someone yells at someone else to shut up. I didn't understand why Spyder, Walter, Robin, and Byron were even together. They obviously hate each other. I guess the main problem I had was with the characters and their motives. I also couldn't figure out the plot of the book, and I never fully grasped what exactly was going on throughout it. To me it lacked focus.So, the book is beautifully written, has a wonderful atmosphere/creepy mood, though depressing, and is definitely unique. I think younger readers may enjoy it more (teens/early twenties)."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Angelina Jolie could play Spyder Baxter and it would rock.

SILK is surprising in so many ways, from its choice of settings to Kiernan's strength as a first-time novelist.

Her characters are strikingly three-dimensional, real people, and she has a knack for getting the reader to care about them. This is an incredibly dark, haunting, and, at times, frightening story of insanity and the supernatural, but it would be misleading to label it horror (which the publisher, wisely, hasn't done).

Kiernan has an incredible voice that, I'm convinced, will get bolder and more refined as she continues down the dark corridors most tend to avoid (I have been left with a few visuals permanently burned into my retinas -GAH!).This is not straight up &quot;horror&quot;: There are no good guys. There are no bad guys. There's simply shades of grey. What you've experienced in life will surely color the characters for you...Hell, you may even see yourself in some of them.

In short, it works for me and encountering an author with a new style is nothing to complain about. I *did* have to read it twice to get the full effect. It's a very *visual* book, with very strong imagery. Nothing is prettied up or sugar-coated, but presented from the viewpoint of the book's characters. Ms. Kiernan doesn't flinch from her portrayals of the dark, dirty side of her characters' world--any more than she shies away from their moments of beauty and poetry. What stood out for me was the character of Spyder, a wonderfully complex woman, a very *human* woman. I commend Ms. Kiernan for her skill in portraying an emotionally and mentally disturbed person *wthout* taking the usual cop-outs or cliches. Spyder is a *person* with mental problems. There are no clear-cut heroes or villians, it's a very gray world inside the pages of SILK. But it's a mesmerizing world all the same."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I don't know why I naively thought that &quot;Spyder&quot; was just a nickname, that there wasn't any significance or special symbolism to it. So when the spiders started to make their presence in the novel known, I was unprepared, and as an arachnaphobe, pretty freaked out. I like being disturbed, however, so this was not a bad thing. I am particularly impressed to learn that this is Kiernan's first novel -- her prose is so polished, and her character's are for the most part well-rounded. &quot;Silk&quot; reminded me a lot of Poppy Z. Brite's &quot;Lost Souls,&quot; but Kiernan's novel seems more accomplished, more like the Poppy Brite of &quot;Exquisite Corpse.&quot; The only down-side to the novel is that some of the action isn't as clearly described as I would have liked. I won't give anything away, but I would have liked a clearer idea of exactly what happened at the novel's climax. This kept me from giving the novel a full five stars, but I would have liked to give it 4.5, rather than just four, as this lack of clarity was distracting, but the novel was otherwise well-done. I know that when I see another novel by Caitlin Kiernan, I'll have to pick it up. This woman has talent!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Well, that was refreshing! The minute I saw this book's liner notes, I knew I was going to be blown away. I hadn't expected it to be that good, though! I found Kiernan's approach very realistic, very close to what &quot;punk&quot;, &quot;junkie&quot;, &quot;gothic&quot; and &quot;f**ked-up&quot; really are. I found the whole concept of being killed by what seems to be imagination and fiction was totally cool. Textually speaking, the heavy use of metaphors and being non-descriptive at times really showed that there was more to litterature than just Tolkien or Weis &amp; Hickman. She really came through in this book, and she managed to describe an incredible world far better than I could possibly have imagined.

If its only virtue was the genius of the author's poetic voice, it would be an astoundingly written novel, but rest assured, Silk has much, much more to offer us than lyrical prose - flawless characterization, a complex and intriguing plot, frights galore, a fascinating ability to make the most mundane things wondrous - I could go on and on but I won't.To me, the marvelous thing about Kiernan's prose (and it's true of any good writer) is the fact that so much of what we see in the work comes not from anything that's readily apparent on the page, but from what we as readers bring to the novel. Reading is NOT a passive, one-sided enterprise, where the reader should expect to plop themselves down and childishly demand to be entertained. What you get out of any novel depends largely on what you bring to that novel (and this seems especially true of a novel as rich and multi-layered as Silk). I'm not just talking about basic reading comprehension or an understanding of the tradition within which a writer is working - that those things are required is a given.What you see in Silk will partly depend on what you see in yourself. I have a couple of friends who liked the book a lot but found it very bleak and sad. It's true that there's tragedy in Ms. Kiernan's story, but there's brilliant triumph, as well. The best horror fiction is always as much about light as darkness, and the world that Ms. Kiernan has created for us has equal shares of both. But there's a catch. Like one of the book's heroes, Daria, you'll never see the light if you can't face the shadows, and this is a book filled with shadows. But like all shadows, like our shadowselves (to borrow from Jung, who Ms. Kiernan mentions in an introductory author's note), they are ultimately the key to salvation. And understanding that is one of the keys to grasping the delights of this intricate and disturbing tale of the terrors and joys that creep about inside us all, looking for a way to escape.Silk is the sort of book you can throw superlatives at all day long and never truly do it justice. That can only be accomplished by reading it and opening yourself to the dark and shining jewels between its pages."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin Kiernan spins a fascinating and original tale.

The suits look down upon this urban riff raff. Daria belongs to the musical group, the Stiff Kitts. Her driving ambition is to be on top of the musical world. Spyder wants to survive in the real world as opposed to her frequent trips into a surreal arcane environment.A runaway, Niki, turns into the catalyst that brings Daria and Spyder together, though working against each other to keep her safe. They fight to save Niki's soul from dark forces that might only be the result of Spyder's imagination. However, since an arcane ritual was performed in the basement ofSpyder's weird home, a number of eerie things have occurred. No one is even certain if the demons they see are real or hallucinations.Caitlin P. Kiernan's writings seem to be a successful blending of that by Poppy Z. Brite and Dean Koontz, two writers who seem as far apart as the two protagonists of this novel. Still, SILK will appeal to audiences of both authors. The novel includes horror elements that are supernatural and man-made. Ms. Kiernan has a definite future as a writer, whether it be a cult favorite, the mistress of horror, or some hybrid between both poles.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"In Silk, Kiernan does what she does best. She takes disenfranchised, marginalized \\"freaks\\" and throws them center stage in events that make you question perception, reality, and sanity. She introduces seemingly unrelated characters and slowly draws them together in what sems like a destined act of the Fates. But then again, maybe not. If only Nikki Ky, a wandering Vietnamese girl on the run from her conscious hadn't ran away from her problems at home, if only Spyder Baxter hadn't been so terrified and weaved truth and lies to keep her friends close, if only Daria Parker had never gotten involved with Keith Barry and Stiff Kitten. If ONLY, Keith hadn't decided to play the hero and run-off to rescue Spyder from homophobic thugs hassling her one cold, winter's night. If only they all hadn't decided to follow Nikki who decided to follow Spyder back to Spyder's house the next morning, so many things would have turned out differently. There is a sad elegance in the way that tragedy befalls the characters who have no idea what's coming their way or that they've fallen into a web from which there is no real escape. None of it is really their fault, except that somewhere along the way a decision was made that led them *here*.Next thing you know ... flying monkeys. Although, Silk isn't as simple or as random or unexpected as all of that. Kiernan builds and layers until what happens in the end kinda has to happen. As events unfold and characters cross paths, a deep and terrible sense of foreboding rises to the surface and all you can do is wait to see how it all turns out.The other thing that Kiernan does so well is to conflate fantasy and reality so that you're never sure what's real, what's the drugs or mental illness and what's the lie. All four play a part in setting the stage for the novel's tragic, surreal close. It's horrific to discover that maybe all of the creepy, disconcerting corner-of-the-eye mind tricks that permeate the novel are actually real and not just the hallucinations of a woman with a mental illness and her friends, unnerved by a bad trip on peyote. Watching the novel and the characters unravel was sad and deeply affecting. You feel for them as much as you sometimes despise them. Keith for his heroin addiction, Spyder for her needy, bitchy, controlling ways, and Daria for her self-destructive attachment to a man who loves the needle more than he loves her.Be warned, however. If you're looking for an easy read, Kiernan is not the place to turn. She's challenging and you really have to pay attention. The devil's in the details, but even then, he might slip one past you, well aided by Kiernan's gorgeous nuance of writing as a craft."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Kiernan does an incredible job of pulling common experiences any of her readers might have encountered and combining them with fantastic horrors that, while unbelievable and unreal, allow us to suspend our disbelief and wonder \\"what if?\\" What if the psychological horrors of our past manifest themselves as physical horrors? Extremely well-written, and a fresh thrill without any sort of reliance on some hackneyed formula gleaned from a horror \\"great\\". She definitely has her own voice and it's extremely refreshing to read something that isn't someone trying to be King or Koontz. If you like female characters this is an added bonus, as her female characters are complex and well drawn. Over all, an excellent book."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This book is wonderful. I've read it a few times now and I still find myself attached to many of the characters, wondering what will become of them (lucky we will be able to find out when Kiernan's new book &quot;Murder of Angels,&quot; a sequel to &quot;Silk,&quot; comes out in a few months). The language is painfully beautiful, though sometimes difficult, which may be what some of the negative reviews are about (i.e. the people who &quot;just didn't get it&quot;). Kiernan has an extraordinarily talent way with words, but if you don't have the vocabulary to cut it, thats not her fault!It is difficult for me to put this book into a specific category or to give a concise synopsis of the plot, due to its many shifts and complexities. Just pick it up and give it a read! If you like intelligent, emotional fiction you won't regret it. (I'm getting ready to read it again for the third or fourth time.)"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I loved this novel. Caitlin Kiernan's writing is rich and rewarding, and she knows how to tell a good story. This isn't hack and slash horror, all gore and campy campfire cliches. Kiernan uses the English language to weave a darkly fantastic tale of insanity and mystery, set not in some moldering castle, but in the early '90s post-punk scene. This is a genuine ghost story, and compares with Stephen King's The Shining, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle, and Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. It's not a book of clear resolutions and easy answers. The narrative and characters are complex and expects the reader to think. Five stars for Kiernan!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This is the only book that's made me have to sleep with the lights on since the first time I read The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. But I think the author is trying to do a lot more than frighten us and Silk is a book filled with tragic and wonderful characters. Better than Stephen King."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This is actually my second copy of the book, as my first is held together by little more than duct tape and determination. I cannot count how many times I've read it.

I have a habit of reading too fast. This book was hard to put down. I actually got it in the sci-fi section of my fav used bookstore. It's not sci-fi, but horror apparently. I deem it more of a study in people. Very interesting, the characters are mostly well developed, you live and die with them. I was a little lost in the end, hoping for a happy ending, however it is not that type of book. Noting that the author is a graphic novel writer more that a novelist, I say this is a great book. I enjoyed it, and plan on reading it again. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This a spooky book with lots of connections to Birmingham and the south. It's not horror but it is scary. It's not crime but there is a bit of that. It is not a thriller but there are places where the action really moves.Silk is about the unnatural and it's connection everyday people with real problems. OK, some of the people are not everyday. It's a very good book but not Kiernan's best. The language and the descriptions are very smooth. You might never look at abandoned buildings and street folk again."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This unassuming little book opens simply with this: \\"Two nights before Halloween, as if it matters to anyone in the house, as if every day in this house isn't Halloween. As if every moment they live isn't the strain and the stretch, the hand reaching back, groping through bottomless candy bags down to where front porches glow with orange-flicker grins and skeletons dance hopscotch sidewalks and ring doorbells. And they are all here, here around her where they belong.\\" ... and I was hooked.Spyder Baxter and her friends, a bunch of beautiful, broken souls, each with their own demons, have found each other. Drawn to each other, sometimes united, sometimes squabbling like siblings, they find that curiosity really can kill the cat. Their toddling forays into shamanistic dream-quests serve only to bring them to the attention of the sort of dark and terrible beings it would have been better to be unmarked and unnoticed by.A dark and disturbing book. Gritty and real, I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Atfer having gone through Anne Rice books, Tolkien books, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and so on, all these books have a very definite style of writing. Kiernan clearly intends on creating a style for herself as well. As a Gen-Xer myself, I have been intrigued by the gothic scene, and this book transcends the niche very acurately. Other reviews usually state that Kiernan uses metaphors that are detached from reality in some way, and they do not necessarily follow through, sort of like a ramble. I must say that the rambles, to me, add much more texture and character to the story. The reading process is very similar to a human thought pattern, detached, rapid, the mind has trouble focusing on one particular word or vehicle for the emotion. This is a key that Caitlin Kiernan has forged for herself, and with it she could very well open the Gates of her mind and unleash Hell upon us (hopefully she will!)"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I read this book as part of a group read...and we were all confused. Many things are never explained and you have no clue what it was supposed to mean or why they did it. I'm not saying the story wasn't interesting, it was, but at the end of the story, I was left thinking \\"Huh?\\" Plus, to add to the confusion, the story time line jumps around, add in a few dream sequences and drug freak outs. Not a book I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk is splendid. The genius of this book is its careful balance - it's oblique enough that the author's intentions remain a mystery, but not so frustratingly subtle and elusive that you give up and toss it aside. It puts me in mind of the puzzle boxes in those Clive Barker (a fan of Kiernan's) movies. Keep at it long enough, and a few cut fingers aside, dark and terrible things await you!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Though on opposite sides of the spectrum in philosophy, music, and sexual orientation, Daria and Spyder share in common that they are two of society's rejects. The suits look down upon this urban riff raff. Daria belongs to the musical group, Stiff Kitten. Her driving ambition is to be on top of the musical world. Spyder wants to survive in the real world as opposed to her frequent trips into a surreal arcane environment.A runaway, Niki, turns into the catalyst that brings Daria and Spyder together, though working against each other to keep her safe. They fight to save Niki's soul from dark forces that might only be the result of Spyder's imagination. However, since an arcane ritual was performed in the basement of Spyder's weird home, a number of eerie things have occurred. No one is even certain if the demons they see are real or hallucinations.Caitlin R. Kiernan's writings seem to be a successful blending of that by Poppy Z. Brite and Dean Koontz, two writers who seem as far apart as the two protagonists of this novel. Still, SILK will appeal to audiences of both authors. The novel includes horror elements that are supernatural and man-made. Ms. Kiernan has a definite future as a writer, whether it be a cult favorite, the mistress of horror, or some hybrid between both poles."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"SILK is by turns beautifully understated and unexpectedly explicit. Fans of Clive Barker, Poppy Z. Brite, William Burroughs, and Kathe Koja will probably love this book. It's honestly one of the best things I've read in years!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I bought this book because I had read a good review of the follow-up \\"Murder of Angels\\" and thought this would be a better starting point. I am a voracious reader, and I can honestly say I rarely use the word \\"hate\\" when describing a book. I won't use it this time either, but I will say that I can never get back the time I spent (wasted?) reading this book. To be fair, maybe it just wasn't for me. If you are really into super-confusing, creepy books with self-pitying, annoying, wear-it-on-their sleeve outcast characters-- this might be just the tale for you."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"As I was reading this book I was thinking: this girl can really write great descriptions. Unfortunately, as I kept reading I found that's about all she's good at. The characters are interesting, but ultimately, unconvincing. When Spyder beasts start killing people off, the only rationale I could find is that their sender, is named Spyder, and she has a fascination with spiders. This fascination has something to do with childhood abuse, but why it led to spiders is not clear. Perhaps that's something explained at the end of the book; I never got that far. Life is too short to finish poorly conceived novels, and, if the only reason to finish a book is to find out the reason for a plot device, it's not a good reason."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk has a permanent home on my bookshelf next to Poppy Z. Brite's Lost Souls. I've read them both twice, to be fair, and don't really intend to read them again.Perhaps I just don't understand this brand of &quot;horror.&quot; Throughout the entire story, I wondered what I was intended to think of the characters. Was I supposed to like them? Was I supposed to care about them at all? If so, then I must have missed something. All I saw were a bunch of boring Gen X-ers in a small town who died in some bizarre, but ultimately inexplicably dull ways for no apparent reason. If there was a point to this book, other than &quot;Some stuff that happened to these people I once knew,&quot; I couldn't find it."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This is such an amazing book. Caitlin R. Kiernan may be the H. P. Lovecraft for the 21st century! Silk is that good. Kiernan's superb imagination is balanced by the perfectly-realized reality of her landscape. Though filled with shudders and suspense, the book is not filled with the sort of absurd gore and splatter that ruins so many scary books these days. Kiernan knows there are scarier things than blood and guts. This is an absolute must read."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"From the first page to the last, Silk is a beautiful, black pearl of a book. Caitlin Kiernan's character's will break your heart and her way with words will leave breathless - this book is that good. Smart, sexy, and scary, this is the best dark fantasy novel I've read in years."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk is a triumph of incremental suspense. Kiernan begins her novel of Southern Gothicisms with solid characters and a finely-tuned knack for describing her setting, coupled with a powerful, almost poetic flare for the English language, and slowly lures the reader into a frightening world where nothing is certain and every shadow is reason for fear. Her ability to undermine our sense of reality is awesome and she uses it to set up a novel where the things that go bump in the night might only exist in the mentally-ill or drug-altered minds of her characters as nothing more than an elaborate array of shared hallucinations....or may be very, very real indeed!Kiernan's beautiful writing and terrifying story definitely work for me! I loved this book."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Are you afraid of spiders? Well, this is one magnificently spidery book. Though the author is a master (or is that mistress?) of lyrical prose, exquisite characterization, mood, and subtext (quantum physics *and* Orpheus in one book!), Silk still manages to touch a lot of our most basic fears and takes full advantage of them. Kiernan's portrait of Birmingham, Alabama, as a brooding post-industrial wasteland is as chilling as the shadowy creatures that may (or may not) stalk its nights. The author's familiarity with the youth subcultures of the early 1990s adds another marvelous dimension to what may be the coolest spooky novel I've read since Poppy Z. Brite's Lost Souls. This novel *proves* once and for all that a book can be scary as hell *and* extremely intelligent at the same time. It certainly deserves the awards it's won and the praise its received from &quot;big name&quot; authors like Clive Barker and Neil Gaiman."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"If you aren't already familiar with Caitlin R. Kiernan from her fabulous short fiction, I strongly recommend SILK. This is definately NOT your mother's horror novel! I was completely blown away by the book. Kiernan's voice is distinct and powerful, and not for the squeamish. Five stars."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"i haven't read a lot of books that made me feel as though every single word mattered, as if the novel would be diminished by the subtraction of any of them. that's the sort of book that silk is - i hung on every beautiful, perfectly-placed word. like a delicious meal, silk leaves you satisfied, but still wanting more. so now i will go read it again."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I read SILK because a friend of mine recommended it and because I've been enjoying Caitlin Kiernan's work on THE DREAMING. I was *not* disappointed. This is one of those really rare Gothic novels that transcends the limitations of its genre (and the things we're usually willing to settle for from that genre) and delivers a stunning literary delight. The book works on many different levels. Yes, it's a very frightening novel, filled with strange goings-on and crawly things. It's also a wonderful experiment in language; it's rare to find an author who seems to take such sheer enjoyment from the act of constructing sentences. On another level, this is a fine example of the fiction of the New South, a skillfully woven Southern Gothic. It's a masterful collection of character studies, and any fledgling writer would do well to study SILK as an exercise in learning how to create *real* and believable people from words and imagination. It's hard to accept that this is a first novel, so marked is its scope and maturity. I, for one, will be eagerly awaiting this author's second!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"It's great to see one of the best contemporary Gothic novels in a snazzy new trade paperback format. I'm very glad the publisher kept the same cover art, though. SILK received both the Maiden Voyage and International Horror Guild awards for best new novel. If you haven't read it already, SILK is a truly remarkable and supremely effective novel. Caitlin Kiernan is surely one of the current masters of the form, and in this novel she has crafted a wonderfully creepy story of hauntings and insanity. Great characters who never fail to ring true and some of the most stunning prose out there. The soft-spoken ending is one of the novel's genuine triumphs. To paraphrase what Stephen King once said of Shirley Jackson, Kiernan doesn't need to raise her voice to unsettle us. Her whispers are loud and clear, and SILK is, like Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE (or classic English ghost stories and the works of Machen), a book of whispers. I loved this book when it was first released in 1998 and I still love it."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I was impressed with the originality of the central theme. The horror element of Silk is not vampires, nor ghosts, and really has nothing to do with the alleged war 'tween Heaven and Hell. From beginning to end, Silk is a vivid and sensual buffet of metaphors as dark and rich as a death-by-chocolate dessert flanked by a syrupy thick cup of (good) french roast coffee. And while you may or may not like or identify with the characters (I believe I would be tempted to backhand the affected, ungrateful, selfish Spyder Baxter in real life, long-legged thingummies or no), Ms. Kiernan has given them all the spark of life -- they are well-developed and quite believable. If you read this book and come away thinking only about its portrayal of youth and Goth subculture, then I would be so bold as to say that you're missing the point. I myself came away from this story thinking about the choices we make with respect to our inner fear, pain, and rage. If you read this novel, compare the similarities between Daria and Spyder, as well as the very different choices which they ultimately make.The one thing which caused me to give this 4 instead of 5 stars: too many questions left unanswered at the end, mostly 'what exactly was happening during such and such scene?' and 'why did it happen?'. As a writer, I like to leave some elements up to the reader's imagination and interpretation, too, but there was a little more of this than I would have liked. Other than that, Silk is a great read and an example of the kind of first novel which any talented fledgling writer in the horror/dark fantasy genre should challenge his or herself to match."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"The first book I read by Caitlin R. Kiernan was her short story collection Tales of Pain and Wonder (wonderful), and then I read her novel Threshold. Both won me over. I finally got a copy of Silk and I love it too. She manages to writer horror and fantasy and the real world all at the same time in a way that I've never found any other writer do."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Ignore the review below this one (the reader from &quot;the South&quot; who's obviously using this book as an excuse to express his or her hatred for anyone he or she deems &quot;alternative&quot;). As others have already pointed out, the award-winning SILK has been recognized as one of the most important works in dark fiction in recent years. I agree completely. Readers who are put off by interesting characters and innovative writing may not be happy with it, but those who read to experience something outside the day-to-day drone of &quot;normal&quot; life should find it a great read. SILK *is* a novel about various aspects of alternative culture, but Kiernan has crafted her characters and the world they inhabit in such a way that only the most narrow-minded reader will fail to connect with at least some of them. One of Kiernan's talents is to remind us that the function of literature is not merely to reinforce our respective prejudices and preconceptions, but to expand our view of the world and society. Beautifully written, SILK spins its tragic tale with prose that (as others have noted below) is reminiscent of such authors as William Faulkner, Ray Bradbury, and Shirley Jackson. This isn't just another &quot;horror novel,&quot; but a book that transcends genre and offers a challange to anyone who would attempt to explore elements of religion and the supernatural, as well as psychology, through novel-length fiction. I have followed Kiernan's career closely, from her stunning short fiction to this, her first novel, and can honestly say that I eagerly await her next book. Only once or twice in a decade does an author with this much promise come along who is interested in dark fiction and SILK is the herald of that promise."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"After reading Kiernan's short fiction (most of which is astounding) and the many good reviews this books has received, I was really very sorry to find Silk near impossible to take. The characters are broadly written caricatures, Goth kid cliches in a Goth cliche universe, interchangeable and utterly forgettable. The writing sways from brilliant to boring, from perfection to slash, sometimes within the same line. The story itself only begins to exist somewhere around the halfway mark, then steamrolls toward an ending neither satisfying nor believable.Kiernan has proven herself a far better writer than this novel indicates. Here, her work falls into a pit of Goth subculture cliches. By page 15, all are present--the strange obsession with hair and hair dye descriptions (each character can be told from the rest by his or her hair color and quality), Tom Waits, The Cure, Nosferatu, boring drug use, and a character named Byron. All of which would be fine had Kiernan raised even one of her characters out of the blandness and made him/her real. Unfortunately, the next two hundred pages are just more of the same. When the story does actually begin, the reader is too sick of the characters to care.Silk - a novel about hair dye, Tom Waits, and spooky posturing; a sophomoric mix of embarassingly overwrought and brilliantly poetic prose; a heartless, shapeless story crammed into a black lace costume; a story Poppy Brite would have written better; a misguided attempt by a writer who is capable of so much more.If you are new to Kiernan, read her short story collections. Their praise, I'm sure, is far more deserved than that of this book."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I recently read The Red Tree and The Drowning Girl, the author's most recent novels, and loved them. So I decided to go back to the beginning and start with her first novel, Silk. I was excited to read it, but boy was I disappointed! It was like reading a completely different author at first. And not a very good one at that. The style of writing was so awkward and dense that I'd find myself saying \\"huh?\\" after every convoluted descriptive passage. I think the worst offender in this regard was probably the first chapter, the one about Daria. That was another problem I had. Nothing much happened for the first 142 pages, and I found Daria and Keith and their \\"band\\" utterly boring and mundane. Most of the characters were melodramatic losers, except for Theo, who seemed like she was the voice of reason in it all. The plot finally picks up after that and the style of writing actually becomes much better, because the author doesn't have time to cram the text with unnecessary descriptions that add nothing to the narrative, because stuff is actually happening to these characters. If you're looking for a scary read (which I wasn't) there's not much for you here. There's stuff that's slightly creepy in places, but that's about it. When the characters start dropping like flies, there's not much suspense in it because the author goes back to vague descriptions that don't make it clear what is actually happening. I didn't have a problem with the ending, though. It actually worked for me.If this was my first novel by the author, I definitely would have put this book down after a couple of chapters and completely written her off. But I soldiered on because I knew she could do better, and the second half of the novel proved me right. So if you're new to her or this was your only exposure to her work, I highly recommed getting your hands on either The Red Tree or The Drowning Girl. She gets much much better.I'll read the rest of her novels, because they can only get better from here. The second half of Silk certainly showed glimpses of the author who wrote her last two novels."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Though Kiernan's first novel follows a group of young misfits treading the outlying borders of society it centers around Spyder Baxter, a young woman whose adolescence is littered with demons both real and imaginary creeping like shadows over her adult life. Blurring the lines between reality and the drug induced delusions of her characters Kiernan weaves an ethereal nightmare borne from Spyder's warped mind; twining like a sticky web across the lives of her friends.Kiernan's unique writing style takes descriptive imagery to a whole new level. Her lyrical prose read almost like thoughts, bordering on stream of consciousness as she stacks one description on another with captivating feats of metaphor and simile. \\"Up the crumbling stoop, five steps, and now Niki could see the swirling graffiti tangle laid thick across almost every available surface, tags and gang warnings, spray-can pasta, the universal language of urban tribes\\" (Kiernan 129). Leaving the reader enthralled simply by her mastery of language and ability to paint brilliant mystical horrors that creep and twine toward the hair-raising and thrilling conclusion Kiernan succeeds in establishing herself as a strong voice in horror fiction.As fellow horror writer, Poppy Z. Brite, noted in her praise of Silk Kiernan, \\"writes like a Gothic cathedral on fire.\\" This stunning debut novel will captivate fans of the horror and fantasy genre as well as fans of Poppy Z. Brite who writes with a similar dark flare."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"i had never read any of kiernan's books but had come across enough chatter over time to give her a try so i went to the beginning. at times i found the book to be well written, other times whiny and self-indulgent (or angst-ridden as someone more polite may state), and ultimately not quite what i thought i was getting. the initial problem was that the back of the book cover implies the book is a wall-to-wall supernatural delight. most of the book is character development and about relationships; the supernatural part really only feels like about ten percent and at least half of that leaves you wondering if this is really about drugs and/or schizophrenia. if you want to write a book about relationships than write a book about relationships; the stuff i was looking for in the book served to muddy up the whole thing. i'll admit the preconceptions the reader brings to a book can affect their experience, which is why based on the glimmers of talent in the book i'll probably try threshold but stay away from the sequel to this one."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"It's been a while since I read a horror novel that actually added something new to the genre. Caitlin Kiernan's book Silk blew in like a breath of fresh air. While there were one or two spots where I found myself getting a little bored, they didn't last for very long! I really enjoyed how real her characters seemed & how much I liked them (even as unsympathetic as some of them are).Would I recommend this to a friend? Oh heck yeah! It's a horror novel that doesn't try to out-spook the genre & could appeal to a broader audience than some of the other writers could."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk is one of those novels that takes you away from your everyday life and forces you to fall in love with the characters so much that you will actually miss them when you have finished the last page. And more than that it is a brilliant literary work that places Kiernan in the august company of Poe, Lovecraft, Rice and King. The ragtag group of twentysomethings that populate this book are not a Generation X cliche but reflections of real people with real lives. That is until they stumble into a supernatural world of rage and sorrow that change them forever. It will change you as well."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"My only complaint about this wonderful book is that it's the only novel currently available by Caitlin R. Kiernan. It left me wanting MORE! I highly reccommend this book to people who like creepy stories that are more than fluff."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"The best book I've read in a long time. And I read a LOT. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Ms. Kiernan's writing style can take some getting used to, with the way she combines certain words (used in descriptions like 'ruststreaky'), but they *do* work to create evocative images. In short, it works for me and encountering an author with a new style is nothing to complain about. I *did* have to read it twice to get the full effect. It's a very *visual* book, with very strong imagery. Nothing is prettied up or sugar-coated, but presented from the viewpoint of the book's characters. Ms. Kiernan doesn't flinch from her portrayals of the dark, dirty side of her characters' world--any more than she shies away from their moments of beauty and poetry. What stood out for me was the character of Spyder, a wonderfully complex woman, a very *human* woman. I commend Ms. Kiernan for her skill in portraying an emotionally and mentally disturbed person *wthout* taking the usual cop-outs or cliches. Spyder is a *person* with mental problems. There are no clear-cut heroes or villians, it's a very gray world inside the pages of SILK. But it's a mesmerizing world all the same."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I loved this book! It scared me *and* made me cry. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Easily the best horror novel I've read in a long time. Superbly written. Almost perfect!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Kiernan surpasses Brite in bringing her characters to life!

But after spending so much time developing her characters, setting mood, Kiernan falters into fantasy, garbled action, and typical horror schlock. She systematically does away with her characters in typical ten-little indians style, never fully exploring the threads she sows earlier-- the war of the angels and the effects of childhood abuse. Rather than a psychological exploration, it simply becomes another in a growing list of bodiless, rootless horror. She's capable of much better."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"The horrible looking cover should have warned me with the dream catcher - but I still thought this would be a great book, I'm a big fan of Poppy Z Brite and everyone said this author would be along the same vein. Well, this book was pretty bad; she can write somewhat, but she tried to jam too many references to random bands and such in. the premise was a little tired, too, why have the goth-y stereotype of spiders? Why not something decidedly un-gothy, like a rabid gerbil? Anyway, besides lack of creativity, clich&eacute;d drug use, and pretentious references (PJ Harvey? I'm enlightened, but most people would probably not realize what a complete goddess she is), it's got *some* promise."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I will keep this short, as short as Silk should have been. Kiernan's verbose novel is tolerable only to those who have little or no interest in story, who wish to spend (waste) their time swimming in the superficial, faux-Gothic,pretentious crud known as &quot;Goth.&quot; This bastardized version of Gothicism will not appeal to people who enjoy the work of true Gothic writers, such as Poe and Shelley, for more than just the &quot;spooky&quot; descriptions. Kiernan's Silk is all about the make-up, people. The most Gothic thing about this novel is the mysterious lack of plot."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Not a book to be lightly tossed aside, but one to be hurled with great force..."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. While there were definitely some well written passages in the book, but I found the oddball literary style and freakish sentence structure to be tedious and distracting. I struggled just to reach the end of the book."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I'd never heard of Caitlin R. Kiernan before I bought this book, and now I'm looking for more of her stuff, and eagerly awaiting her next novel. This is one of those very rare books that genuinely transcends &quot;genre&quot; and carves out a place for itself all its own. Call it &quot;horror&quot; or &quot;dark fantasy&quot; or whatever, but none of these labels even come close to describing this remarkable work of fiction. It's nice to see a book getting the recognition it deserves."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I thought Kiernan's charachterization was top notch. Everything was incredibly real, from the peyote to the music. For instance, I dont think there was one band in that book i dont have in my cd collection...it was just so real. Easy to ideantify with and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"'Silk' is definitely shades of Poppy Z. Brite...but I don't consider that to be a negative trait, and Caitlin obviously has her own uniqueness. This book is a contemporary southern gothic counterculture erotic psychological thriller extraordinare. I know this genre has it's critics, and people think the 'GenX Misfit Kids in Black' theme is overdone,I still love each new spin on it...and 'Silk' is a book that's very easy to relate to."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin R. Kiernan is the first new dark fantasy writer that I've really gotten excited about since Clive Barker's BOOKS OF BLOOD first appeared in the States. SILK is an absolute tour de force, a first novel that demonstrates not only a startlingly fresh talent, but a profound insight into the psychology of horror. Kiernan's skills as a storyteller and wordsmith are perfectly balanced by her grasp of the macabre. SILK is a novel of unexpected depth, working old school Lovecraftian magic in a thoroughly contemporary, urban setting. Her characters are young people who are drawn both realistically and sympathetically; Kiernan presents a sober portrait of the GenX scene, without romanticizing or passing judgment. This is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"A winner. I hate to make comparisons, but it's on par with Poppy Brite's best (another one of my fave writers). Surreal yet strong plot line, characters so real they hurt... check this novel out (and check out Caitlin's THE DREAMING Vertigo comics, and her short stories, too)!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Although the strongest aspects of Kiernan's writing are her descriptions and characters, I was impressed by her ability to pace this story. There are a multitude of subplots, yet the central storyline remains clearly defined. Sometimes, Kiernan seems to lose herself in layers of description and nuance, and like eating a sticky-sweet dessert, the words can occasionally become cloying. But far more often, the richness of her style is like a good brandy and ripe figs -- sensual, multidimensional, an experience to prolong and savor. SILK is the extraordinary beginning of an incredible journey, for both Kiernan and her lucky readers. **excerpted from Constance Lynne's review in The Alabama Forum."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Very disappointing read, and don't get me wrong, I like gothic literature and knew what I was in for. The problem with this particular gothic novel is that it's really only a short story strung out over hundreds of pages. Very slow, but I kept hoping it was going to build into a real crescendo. Unfortunately, even the ending is slow and a let-down. I love Caitlin's writing and the ins and outs of the characters like Spyder and Robin kept me going till the end, but then when it was finished, I was like, what was the point? No monsters...not even a villain to speak of! It's just words on a page. It's like my brother jumping out of a closet saying boo! Not really scary, just kind of there. I give it two stars for writing style, but if you're looking for plot, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This novel walks the lands that lie between dreams and madness, roars and whispers, wonder and horror, sacred and profane. I couldn't put it down. Perhaps some Spyder silk had glued it to my hand? The music references created a perfect soundtrack in my head. Read it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This book is the most poetic horror novel I've read in a long time ... maybe ever. Poppy Z. Brite compared it to a gothic cathedral on fire, and that's really an accurate description. Here we have a book which is dripping atmosphere. While this can annoy some readers - who prefer a fast-moving plot to a well-developed one - I think it's their loss.Kiernan's command of language is truly amazing. If you tried to simply retell the plot of this novel you'd get a rather simple story, and not much scary, too. But the author takes some elements you've read before a hundred times and somehow transforms them into vivid memorable images.The horror genre was explored by so many authors, that it's hard to find a truly original novel. But &quot;Silk&quot; clearly demonstrates, that if you take good characters and write about them with passion and grace, you can get fantastic results.Also it helps if the writer can substitute phrases like &quot;spiders covered her&quot;, for &quot;she was covered with thousands tiny lives, scratching with a billion legs&quot; - do you feel the difference?"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I admit that I've become pretty jaded about books with endorsements from famous authors, since those books rarely ever live up to the promise of the endorsements and leave me wondering why these authors said what they said. Silk, however, is a book that DOES live up to the promise of endorsements by the likes of Clive Barker, Peter Straub, Neil Gaiman, and Poppy Z. Brite - in spades!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Though on opposite sides of the spectrum in philosophy, music, and sexual orientation, Daria and Spyder share in common that they are two of society's rejects. The suits look down upon this urban riff raff. Daria belongs to the musical group, Stiff Kitten. Her driving ambition is to be on top of the musical world. Spyder wants to survive in the real world as opposed to her frequent trips into a surreal arcane environment.A runaway, Niki, turns into the catalyst that brings Daria and Spyder together, though working against each other to keep her safe. They fight to save Niki's soul from dark forces that might only be the result of Spyder's imagination. However, since an arcane ritual was performed in the basement of Spyder's weird home, a number of eerie things have occurred. No one is even certain if the demons they see are real or hallucinations.Caitlin R. Kiernan's writings seem to be a successful blending of that by Poppy Z. Brite and Dean Koontz, two writers who seem as far apart as the two protagonists of this novel. Still, SILK will appeal to audiences of both authors. The novel includes horror elements that are supernatural and man-made. Ms. Kiernan has a definite future as a writer, whether it be a cult favorite, the mistress of horror, or some hybrid between both poles.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk, while certianly showing a lot of technical promise, was a big disapointment for me. Ms. Kiernan certianly knows her way around vivid discriptions and wonderfully authentic speech, and there is really nothing wrong with her writing style that I found (I agree with the poster who thought it got a big jerky there at the end, but it *is* a first novel, as they mentioned).The thing that bothered me about it was I was so confused the whole way through. This is not a sit-down-and-read-it-all-at-once book, I had to force myself to finish the thing so I could move on to something I'd actually like (darn OCD...). Keeping track of who was on acid, who was on heroin, why no-one was talking to each other, who was sober and why, who was actually (possibly) a spider/demon/angel thing and what they were all doing being so self-absorbed sucked most of the enjoyment I might have otherwise had right out of the book. I invested just enough interest at the beginning to want to finish the story but spent the rest of it wanting to smack some sense into them all. It was exhausting.I finally finished it tonight and I have no idea what the point of the book was. I have no idea who played the bad guy, who played the good guy and if I should stab my eyeballs out with a pencil or not. If you're into horror I would say this is worth your time; but if you're new to the genre, this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"You know, I can't say that I particularly like or dislike this book. Rather, I am ambivalent about the whole experience. Caitlin Kiernan is, in my opinion, a talent to be reckoned with, but this novel fell short of meaning. The poetic language she utilizes is lovely, but should be used sparingly. It makes the entire read a bit laborous. I mean, we know that she's a well-versed woman. She doesn't need to shove it down our throats. Still, I haven't lost faith in her. I'm aware that this was her first full-length novel, and for the most part, writers improve from book to book. Unless you are Anne Rice, that is, but that is a completely different story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in myth, subculture and spiders. To those who don't...save your money for when she releases her next novel."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This book held promise, and then left it at the door. What is left is the musings of a high schooler who felt the need to include every cleverly turned phrase ever jotted down in the spiral notebook between classes. They all turn up here, and even one of the main characters pays hommage to the source by carrying a notebook of her own. If only she had lost hers like the rest of us do. Goths have taken quite a hit lately, and it's a shame that many will see this book and think it's a summary of the subculture. Not every Goth is bound by the need to be pretentious and sullen. Not every Goth writer will disappoint quite this way."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I bought the book on a whim. I love horror fiction and thought, &quot;cool, goth and horror.&quot; Sounded like a good combination.Kiernan is a fine writer. She has an intense, lyrical style. But I just couldn't get into the characters. They sounded so self-absorbed and stupid. I was pretty stupid and self-destructive in my late teens and early 20's but, man, these characters are purely implausible and I got really bored with them fast.The only reason I finished the book was because I was driving from Chicago to Denver with nothing else to read. So it was better than watching TV in motel rooms. I quickly donated the book to the local used book store. Maybe there's a teenager or two that will pick up the book for $.50 and think the book is really fabulous and intense. Yay for them."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"The writing in this book could only be more punishing if the author actually showed up with a bat and hit you as you read it.It's not bad, necessarily. But it is punishing, like driving for miles on the ridges on the side of the highway. This woman uses metaphors and similes like a boxer uses his fists--to pummel you without mercy. And not in a good way. [btw, authors, it's time we retired the following construct: \\"(noun) was a (noun), all (adjective), (adjective), (adjective) and (adjective)\\". This pattern is far too frequent in fiction. It is the author attempting to give her words weight and urgency, rather than letting the story do it for her.]Some of the characters were good, but until about halfway through the thing I honestly couldn't tell some apart. On the whole it wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it doesn't encourage me to read other things by Kiernan. To go the entire time without explaining the whole thing, without giving the reader a grasp of what was going on just seems cheap. \\"We don't know what it really is--that's why it's creepy! OOooooooohhh...\\".I'd love to have some questions answered about some of the most central areas of the story, and that doesn't seem like a good thing. When basic points of your story are unclear to someone who just finished your book, maybe something is missing.I don't regret buying or reading it (although, until about halfway through, the only thing that kept me reading was the fact that I had paid for it), but as I said, I won't be running off to snap up her other works. I know this was her first novel, and I'm sure she is much better now. But, sadly, I'm not going to find out.Oh, and there were at least a few typos in the Kindle edition. Did we outlaw editors in this country?"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin Kiernan has a beautiful voice and it resonates throughout this dark novel. Kiernan's descriptions of the South, rock music, and the young outsiders that largely make up her cast of characters are all beautifully fleshed out, and her wonderfully disturbing tale will crawl into your mind and twitch until (and even after) you finish her book.Speaking of the mind, one of the themes present throughout this novel (and many of her other works) is the question of whether the inexplicable is in one's mind or is based in reality. She eloquently teases the reader with this theme throughout this work.This book was one of the first works that I ever read of Ms. Kiernan's, but it was not the last. I highly recommend all of her novels (as well as her works of short fiction). The sequel to this novel is \\"Murder of Angels\\"."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I've been reading Caitlin Kiernan's short stories for years and was really looking forward to her first novel. I wasn't disappointed. She clearly learned a lot from Ray Bradbury. Her prose has that wonderful quality, only in a much darker, edgier setting. Two thumbs WAY up!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Just finished &quot;Silk&quot; and don't have all that much to say about it. It is written really well. Kiernan knows how to write &quot;real&quot; people and make their dead-end lives interesting, but it doesn't seem like she spent quite enough time constructing a story. &quot;Silk&quot;, if anything, reads like a series of character sketches. One has to read well over half the book before anything even remotely eerie happens. And when the eerie happenings and bumps in the night begin, there are very little explanations of the why s and hows in the end. The introduction, which sets the stage for a potentially interesting story, is actually a red herring.The book also suffers in that the culture it portrays has already grown up and moved on. I defy anyone reading this book to find a club that still plays any of the music referred to in the book. The books editor should have encouraged Kiernan to change the Goth settings to the more timely settings of the hip-hop rave scene.Still, Kiernan knows how to write and I don't want to trash her too badly. I'll definately pick up the next book."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I rarely read horror, but when I spotted a story involving spiders, I couldn't pass it up. The characters were all quite believable with their own quirks and foibles. Kiernan tells a good story and she does it well with twists and turns leading off in unexpected directions. My only gripe with the story is that the &quot;monsters&quot; are too ephemeral for my tastes, and I thought the ending did not do the rest of the story justice - it was the weakest part of the story.With that said, I recommend this author to friends and family!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I thought Kiernan's characterization was top notch. Everything was incredibly real, from the peyote to the music. For instance, I dont think there was one band in that book i dont have in my cd collection...it was just so real.

Great characters and an extremely spooky story. Read Silk with all the lights on (especially if your afraid of spiders!) This is a *very* original novel, full of beautiful language and unexpected twists!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This is really a great book. I'm so used to horror writers who seem to have learned to write watching slasher movies, so Silk was a very pleasant surprise. A novel that is both intelligent and scary! Caitlin Kiernan's characters are extremely believable and are one of the novel's many strong points. Her use of language is amazing (if you like Kathe Koja - another author who writes intelligent horror - you'll love Caitlin Kiernan). I was so sad to reach the last page of this superb book and strongly recommend it to anyone who longs for spooky literature that's both entertaining and smart."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],C={key:0},L={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",L,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",C,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const R=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-0b360d5c"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/36.md","filePath":"quotes/36.md"}'),N={name:"quotes/36.md"},q=Object.assign(N,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{D as __pageData,q as default};
