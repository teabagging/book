Oates still shows her amazing descriptive skills,but I did not believe one character in this book.I did not believe that the parents presented the way they were in the beginning of the book would ever have reacted to the plight of their beloved daughter in that way...especially the mother. Oates does not prove her point that lovable quirky people can turn into clueless monsters in the face of trauma. Thumbs down!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This story was soooooooo long that about 3/4 of the way through I was thinking &quot;enough already&quot; ~~~ I enjoyed the picturesque farm country and the image of &quot;small town life&quot; BUT all I can say is: how times have changed!! I can't believe the lack of emotional support given to the rape victim (the Mulvaney daughter) in this book. It was hard for me to imagine parents, especially the mother, feeling the &quot;shame&quot; for themselves and doing absolutely nothing to help their daughter. Although, the book semi held my interest and I did finish it, it was pretty slow going at times.. I closed the book and said &quot;so long&quot; !!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was a real chore to plow through for me. What could have been a good story was marred by a jumbled plot and unsympathetic characters. In the end I was relieved to finish this and move on to greener pastures.The plot at its simplest is similar to \\"The Lovely Bones\\" or \\"She's Come Undone\\"--at least the latter was also and Oprah book--where a girl is raped and the family goes all to pieces in the aftermath. In this case darling cheerleader and chaste Christian Marianne is raped after the prom in 1976. Until that time the Mulvaneys were a respected family. The father Michael Sr. owned a successful roofing company. The mother Corinne was active in the community and churches. The oldest son Michael Sr. was a star athlete and the other son Patrick on his way to becoming valedictorian. This all changes after the rape. In the community the Mulvaneys become pariahs. Michael Sr. becomes a raging alcoholic and loses his business. Michael Jr. joins the Marines. Patrick takes vengeance on his sister's rapist and then disappears to live off the grid. And Marianne is bundled off to live with a cousin before joining a hippie commune. And from there things get worse until they get better.The first 100 pages or so reads like \\"The Waltons\\" written in the style of \\"The Shipping News\\" with lots of run-on sentences and fragments. Oates dances around the rape for a long time, well after anyone with an iota of intelligence has figured out what's happened. Especially annoying to me was when Marianne finally tells her mother, instead of getting to the aftermath of this we're hauled back for a flashback 24 years earlier of how Michael and Corinne got together. That's worse than those soap opera cliffhangers that make you wait 3 days (or longer) to find out who shot someone.The biggest problem with the book then is after the rape. Everything from then out is told in jumbled snippets. Most of the growing and maturing the Mulvaney children do as they scatter from the nest is done outside the book so that we see only glimpses of it. It is essentially like looking at a family photo album where you see a picture of someone at 10 then 16 then 18 then 24 but you don't really know what happened between all those snapshots. Perhaps that was the author's intention, but it takes away from having a cohesive narrative.It's amazing when you go back and think about it how absent the Mulvaney children are from much of the book. Michael Jr. goes off to the Marines and is almost never heard from again until the end. After Patrick takes his vengeance he too disappears with at least a third of book left. The youngest son (and narrator) Judd was barely present to start with. Marianne gets a couple extended parts towards the end and I wish she didn't because she was so danged precious, as innocent as a small child even at the age of 29; that got on my nerves.There was no one in the book I was rooting for because I didn't like any of them. Michael Jr. and Judd are exempt because they were all but invisible so there was nothing to like. Patrick was an obnoxious know-it-all, sort of the Lisa Simpson or Stewie Griffin of the Mulvaney clan. I already went into Marianne. Michael Sr. was just a mean drunk (can you ever like someone who exiles his own daughter for being raped) and Corinne was such a spineless, overzealous doormat.The author had this annoying habit too of overusing some expressions. Especially Marianne \\"plucking\\" her hair. It's amazing she had any left by the end. In the epilogue, Corinne mica-shimmering silver hair was referenced three times at least in case you were too dense to figure it out the first time. This is the kind of stuff that annoys me because I'm a very analytical reader, but I doubt most people would care.Were there good things about the book? Sure. The descriptions that weren't overused were good. The characters mostly had different, albeit irritating, personalities. So it's got that going for it.Bottom line is if you're a fan of Oprah books like the two I mentioned earlier then this is probably right up your alley. It's not for me.That is all."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I've never said I hated a book before I read this one. It was dark, the characters stumbled through horrible lives and everything always got worse. I felt exhausted and black, and bluewhen I finally dug my way through this turgid book.I usually give books to friends for a reread and this is the only time a threw a book in the recycle bin."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I too finally made it through the book. I kept waiting for a point to it, but never found one. I could not believe that any parents would treat their daughter the way Marianne was treated. It was painful to read right up until the last page. P.S. I like almost all of Oprah's picks, but NOT this one!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did, but no matter how positive my attitude was at the beginning, the book just fell far short of my expectations. To begin with, Joyce Carol Oates is not one of my favourite authors. I respect her ability, but her writing style is simply not one I care for. There is just an in-depth quality of suspense lacking in her writing. However, having heard and read so much publicity on this book, it appeared the book might be worth reading.To the author's credit, the concept of the story and the family characters were excellent. However, the family is typically a traditional family, and in this day and age with so many divorces and blended families, the traditional family is almost the non-traditional. Anyone who has not been part of a close-knit family might find it difficult to relate to the characters and how they intermingled with each other. Much of the book revolves around a sexual assault and the inter-relationship of family members throughout the book. In my opinion the book is just too &quot;wishy-washy&quot; and leaves much to speculation and many questions unanswered. While the concept of the story was based on a good idea, the writing style simply did not hold my attention; the story and writing style became tedious and long-winded. For all its rave reviews, the book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were The Mulvaney's is a perfectly acceptable read, full of Oates' trademark rich, yet simple storytelling about what goes on just below the surface of our lives. As has been the case previously for me with Oates' books, the fact that she's so prolific somehow makes me feel like she hasn't poured everything she has into this book, leaving me less than overwhelmed. That may be an unfair analysis, but I have the highest respect for Oates and have read better, more powerful novels and short stories from her in the past. Maybe that's why I could only give this book three stars -- it just doesn't measure up to what I know she can do.What We Were The Mulvaney's does do well is paint an engrossing portrait of an American family and its own personal tragedy. Mom, Dad, Marianne, Mike Jr., Patrick and Judd become real, believable characters under Oates' care. The story unfolds in bits and pieces, never forgetting that it's not one person's story, but a family's.Although it clocks in a whopping 400-plus pages, it's a much quicker and easier read than one might anticipate, which should keep Oprah fans turning pages in anticipation of some sort of acceptable conclusions. Indeed, the reader's expectations come to fruition and one closes this book with an unsettling, yet satisfied feeling. We all know of a family like the Mulvaneys. In fact, a lot of us probably think we are the Mulvaneys. What Oates does is make us realize that especially in the dynamics of a family, we're not always what we seem to be.If this book does nothing else for Oprah fans, I hope it inspires them to read other, better Oates novels, including Black Water; Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart; and, most recently, Blonde. It is then that you'll come to better understand the shortcomings of We Were The Mulvaneys."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was completely swept away with this novel. It emphasized the hard work it takes to maintain a loving family and how fragile we all are as people. Along with a family crumbling few heros arise, a young woman whose life is thrown, a young man who watches everything fall and a family outcast who never forgets the important things. WOW... I loved it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oates writing on any subject, whether it's an essay on Mike Tyson, a short story or this book is a compelling read because she is a masterful writer. I don't read her work to obtain a feeling of overwhelming suspense, drama, happiness or sadness or to escape everyday life; I'm compelled to move along in her work because she builds a story like a master craftsman. So while the Mulvaney story captures, with outstanding detail, the breakdown of a typical average middle class family underneath the veneer that most families put in place to appear socially acceptable to other families in a tv-land kind of way, this book would be a dissapointment to anyone who is simply interested in an escapism formula of a suspenseful plot plus a dramatic ending. Read it if you like to read outstanding, masterful writing... and a tale wonderfully told."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Absolutely brilliant. Even when the book enfuriates you, you can't stop reading. The first part of the book you're enveloped in the kind of warm, affectionate, funny family everyone envies. And then one jolt of evil unravels the entire facade. Just like life. Oates shows the destructive power of a woman's unconditional love for her husband, the evil our gender roles, beliefs, and ideals cause. And yet, there is reconciliation, beauty, and triumph. I loved and hated these people. And I've known them. Every one."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am so glad I hadn't seen the not-so-good reviews before I bought this book. What happened to the Mulvaneys rings true to me. I think it would for anyone who has been through an event or events that changed their lives. Whose family isn't somewhat fragile? Who hasn't seen someone else's life unravel over an even that may not seem powerful enough to destroy. I had a hard time putting the book down."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is filled with unessasary bulk... It just goes on and on with too much description of things that are not even important to the story line. Then when things finally start to get interesting the pointless descriptions come back. I wanted to skim through most of this book. If the author took all of that extra &quot;stuff&quot; out it might not be half bad except for the fact that it is not very believable. At the beginning the author builds up the characters to be one way and by the middle they are suddenly completely different. If you can put all of this aside, the book does have its moments and you can occasionally get into it (although it can be very depressing and frustrating). Overall I would say this book is worth reading if you like books that take a while to get into and if you are willing to look past the unbelievable characters."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I personally didn't care for the book. It is a very slow read and took me forever to read it as i could not get into it. Not one of the finest books for Oprah to put in her book club.This book was about a family who was torn apart based on something tragic that happened to one of the family members. It is about betrayal, loyalty and mistrust. The story unfolds as Oates writes about what happens to the family in the years after the tragedy. The family, in my opinion, is very strange and did not react the way that a normal family would react."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Good books don't necessarily lay all the answers on the table for you, nor do they wrap everything up in a neat package to fit our 30-minute TV episode life views. We Were the Mulvaneys is a difficult book to deal with at times, and I left it still examining my feelings for the characters. Isn't that what a good book should do?"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers. This book was compelling, thought provoking and at times interesting, but it was too long and over descriptive. All the details that were described at length were boring. I skipped over much of it. Instead, more character development would have been welcome. Oates is an amazing author and sometimes can just reach right to your heart and grab it with her writing. However, it was very hard to digest much of this book, since it centered on supposedly loving parents who turn their back on their daughter during her hour of need. That just made no sense."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was SO depressing. Also,I was so upset at the way the parents treated the daughter by banishing her after SHE had been a victim. I found it especially unbeleivable thet the mother, who was portrayed as so loving and strong could turn her back on her child when she needed her most. Also,Oates style of writing in long, long run on sentences was extremely irritating."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were The Mulvaneys_New York: Penguin Putnam, 1997.**Oprah Book Club Selection, January 2001We Were The Mulvaneys is a gripping novel of family destruction. This realistic novel narrated by Judd, the youngest Mulvaney, details the lives of each family member. From the High Point Farm and Mt. Ephraim Country Club days of happiness and social climbing, we witness the elder Mulvaneys later forced into financial ruin, alcoholism, and the ultimate betrayal of their own child.The plot centers around Marianne Mulvaney, the only daughter. Marianne is a popular, outgoing, smart cheerleader, until she is raped after attending Senior Prom. This incident has drastic consequences for the entire family. The father, Michael Mulvaney, Sr., seeks to render justice through his own means. This results in his being jailed and labeled a social outcast in the community. Because he is unable to deal with the fact that Marianne will not testify against her perpetrator, and her presence is a constant reminder of the incident, he and his wife, Corrine, agree to send Marianne to live with an aunt in another state. Essentially, from this point forward Marianne is exiled from the family when she needed them most.The novel takes us through the intricacies and psychological and emotional damage caused by the rape of a family member. Ultimately, Marianne is able to cope with what happened to her and establish a family of her own. In the end, there is a semblance of reconciliation for Marianne and the Mulvaneys, but in my opinion this is a rather contrived ending. It is difficult to fathom how someone exiled for so long could reconcile so easily, but perhaps Joyce Carol Oates knows much more about family ties than I do."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Oprah book club selections are certainly getting more complex!This book will strike an immediate chord to a family 'putting on airs' yet within the house having its problems. It hithome for me and will most likely hit home for many others because we know of families that seem perfect.... and often we find out much later what was truly happening.I do not believe that the choice of Mt. Ephraim as the hometown of the Mulvaneys was by accident. Ephraim and Manasseh were sons of Joseph - and while the latter committed heinous crimes against all moral authority, Ephraim was a redeemer. A striking metaphor against which much hurt is set - and one missed by the editorial reviewers.This family functions quite well - all that we'd say is 'too good to be true' *is* actually true until Marianne, the girl so beautifully described that we actually *feel* she's the 'girl next door' to *us* is sexually assaulted. Actually, we are never told whether it was rape or consensual. And the beauty of this is that for the purposes of this story it doesn't matter.It is the *effect* of the assault on the family that begins their descent. I will not spoil the book by telling you the details as to how each of the brothers and the parents fall off their respective wagons. But the cumulative effect is devasting, as told by the narrator, a now adult youngest brother Judd.How can such a complete destruction of a classic nuclear family be a book I'd want to read? Because as someone once said, it is when a man stares into the abyss that he finds his character.Suffice it to say that when you are done with this book you will feel as though you knew the Mulvaneys, suffered with them, and wonder how you would have reacted.I believe everyone can relate to one or more of the characters in this book.I also believe that this book is a *must* read.If you want a book that will make you think realistically about life's challenges - and not give you answers, but rather present situations that make you think about how you would respond, this is the book for you.The cliche that we learn more from our mistakes than our successes never applied more.And all of us can probably stand to look at this side of life. As with 'The Dark Side of the Light Chasers', it is by looking at our human frailties and faults, shining the light on ourselves, warts and all, that we can come to true self-awareness."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that Joyce Carol Oates is a wonderfully gifted writer. However, I don't believe her writing style is for everyone. We Were the Mulvaneys, however evident of Oates's talent, is a tedious, overdescriptive work that takes patience and perseverence to get through.We Were the Mulvaneys is the story of the Mulvaney family in the mid-1970s. They are the more-than-typical family, like the ones on TV who play games together in the living room after dinner. A little on the corny side, but the love they share for each other is obvious in the beginning chapters. Then something happens to one of the family members - a tragedy atrocious and unforgettable - that threatens to tear the Mulvaneys apart.While the story itself was very good, I could not get into the book. I was hoping maybe it would be a late-bloomer, but there was never a point that I reached that inspired me to keep reading. I did finish the novel, but only after a week of exhausting myself. However, there is an audience out there for this book, and my suggestion is this: If you are the type of reader that enjoys a slow pace, highly descriptive writing, wordy sentences and a lack of dialogue, then We Were the Mulvaneys would be an excellent choice. My own personal shortcomings about this book is in no way reflective of the talent or storytelling ability of Joyce Carol Oates. Please read this and see for yourself."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This novel speaks volumes about how families fall apart and are mended again. The book is engrossing; the story spins out then out of control to a point of terrible sorrow; then it is spun into something more resilent than it was before. It takes one twist in a young woman's life to push the family to its knees. Her misstep resonated within her family to the point of destruction. The twist was a sexual assault; the girl was drinking for the first time, got in the wrong car, and was raped by a popular kid from school. The impact on the Mulvaneys- who all seemed perfect- was shattering. They try to stand together, but the town turns against them once the accusation is made public. Since the story takes place in the '60's, the rape made the girl into both the agressor and the victim. The father, who took such pride in his family, especially his only daughter, takes to drink. He also decides he can't stand to sight of Marianne and all the ruin she has thus far brought to the family. He forces his wife to choose between him and their daughter; in a moment of cowardice, the mother sides with her husband. Thus, the daughter is banished from the family to her aunt's home in another town. The family falls further into disrepair as the father loses his business, the oldest son goes to Vietnam, the second son goes to school but gets trapped in a sea of indifference. The story is told from the point of view of the youngest son. He is bewildered by the power of accusation and to some extent, sex. He is horrified by his father, misses his sister and ignored by his brothers. Only his mother stays by his side; but their relationship is complicated. He's the heart of the family so he has to watch his family falls apart. In a sense, he suffers the most, if only because his age forces him to live with parents who are no longer in love; and the rest of the family stays away as much as possible. He goes from the youngest to the only child of the Mulvaneys. As the sadness nearly overwelms the reader, the story turns again when the mother- a stronger character than portrayed earlier- pulls the family back together. But she is only able to do so after her husband dies. Any move before his death would force her to acknowledge her husband as the linchpin of most of the misery that befalls the family. He drove his beloved daughter away because the rape changed her in his eyes. Then, he loses his business, farm and the rest of the family by drinking too much. Once he is gone, she is able to mend the Mulvaneys to a point beyond their childhoods. Oates outlines a regular American family at a specific point in time and the sorrows brought upon it with grace and style. Using the youngest son as an innocent bystander to tell the Mulvaney's story works nicely; his shock, bewilderment and sorrow is ours."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book has lots of enticing parallels to Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury: three brothers in distress over the fall from innocence of a beloved sister. Mule Mulvaney the athlete is nicely parallel to Jason Compson the tough businessman, Patrick Mulvaney the scientist gone off to Cornell to Quenton Compson the sensitive son gone off to Harvard. Is it possible that our narrator Judd is also parallel to the youngest Compson son Benjy, the idiot by whom the tale of sound and fury is initially told?It's tempting to think so. Because then he would be an untrustworthy narrator and I wouldn't have to believe what he tells us about these people.When reading Joyce Carol Oates, I always have the feeling that she must have her tongue way in her cheek. She's pulling our legs but keeping a very straight face. Look at the ending here: Mom's hair has become silver glinting like mica - a crown. Patrick the bitter bookworm turned terrorist is now a perfect California boy with a great arm for slow pitch softball. Wounded and wild Marianne has been domesticated by the Horse Whisperer - who proposes while euthanizing her beloved old cat. And of course, like Christ, Daddy has died for all our sins and we can all be the perfect Mulvaneys again. Surely this can't be serious."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have to admit this is the first book I have ever read in which I felt compelled to write a review. I am an avid reader and my tastes are very eclectic so I was suprised by my emotions upon reading this book. It was the first novel of Joyce Carol Oates that I had read so I didn't really know what to expect. But I had always heard she was a very fine writer so I figured I'd give it a try. Also, I have read many of Oprah's book club selections and generally found them fine. This book is the exception. It may be the most depressing, disappointing book I have ever read. I realize its a dark subject, rape, however I didn't know it was possible to take a dark subject like this and take it to an even lower level. I found the treatment of Marianne by her parents, particularly her mother to be both unrealistic as well as borderline criminal. I realize that things like this happen in &quot;the real world&quot;. However, this is fiction. To portray this family for the first 150 pages or so as &quot;perfect&quot;, to show them with incredibly strong emotions and lovingness in one part of the book and to switch midstream as Oates did and not only do a 360 degree change was completely outside the realm of realism within this story. Of course I realize that parents might react as the Mulvaney's did upon the rape of their child. However, there was absolutely nothing in these parents character to suggest that this was remotely possible.When Corinne sent her supposed &quot;beloved&quot; daughter away, I threw the book down in disgust. Both because I felt it was a horrible betrayal by a mother but more importantly from a reviewers point of view, a betrayal by Oates of the readers. It just didn't ring true and appeared to me to be a device. I don't know how or why I finished the rest of the book, probably just to see if it could be redeemed from that point on. I shouldn't have bothered. Once the &quot;reality&quot; of the book is shattered you can't get it back. It set the tone and was downhill from there. This may just be the most depressing novel I have ever read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I find Joyce Carol Oates books difficult to read because I know when I start one I am going to be let down in some fashion.Her style is very unique, she is extremely descriptive and is one of the best authors for letting your imagination grasp what the author is describing.The main problem with this story is it flounders over the issues that are suppose to pull you in. Oates writes as though she is trying to keep you in suspense - a major buildup. She alluded to the rape for one half of the book before she gave us any idea of the actual events. When she does clue us in it is still a major dissapointment, she gives us bits and pieces. It is as though Oates wants to continue the suspense and give us the feeling that there is more to come. Only there isn't anything else. That was it. She wasn't going to tell us anymore than what she alluded to.She does this several times in the book, leaving more questions unanswered than answered. The planning of revenge by her brother many years later was another buildup that led to only dissapointment. At least Oates gave us details on what actually took place, there were still a lot of unresolved questions (ie. What happened to the rapist? Did he tell his family? Did he report the incident?).I still enjoy her writing style, it just seems as though she is missing so much potential. It is like she starts with an excellent outline for a plot - but in spite of her excellent writing skills, she is unable to pull it together to give the reader that sense of satisfaction you get when you close a very good book you have just completed."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"First of all, is this supposed to be taking place during the sexual revolution, the mid 1970's? She makes it seem as though upstate NY is some kind of primative village in the middle ages where \\"loose\\" women (or women who have been raped)are stoned to death. Give me a break! I went to high school in upstate NY in the early 1980's and believe me, this is not realistic at all. While date rape is a common reality, and many get away with it, the women's \\"reputation\\" would not be ruined and cause the downfall of her whole family! This is just absurd. Some in the community would turn against them, some would stand by them, some just wouldn't give a damn. That is human nature. The unequivocal rejection of all of them, and the destruction of the father's business is not realistic. Also, at one point she says that the father looks through the want ads \\"help wanted - male\\" Again, a throwback to the 1950's, not the late 1970's. And what's with all of the cutsey nicknames? It's like she is stuck in some kind of fake \\"Leave it to Beaver\\"/ Norman Rockwell version of upstate NY in the 1950's. This book is irritating in that ALL of the characters are totally superficial and without any backbone whatsoever. If you don't live here, take my word for it, most people that have to scrape ice and snow off of their cars daily in the winter in subzero temp. have a little more chuztpah than this. And a little more sense of perspective in what is important in life. And a better sense of humor! Many little factual errors are also annoying to me, and she could have done more research on her setting. For example: NY York state fair is usually in Syracuse, not Albany, etc. Also, there are plenty of factual errors relating to nature, wildlife, farming etc. OK, maybe petty, but if you live in upstate NY, it seems that this writer didn't bother to really find out what it is like to live here, taking away from the books credibility. Also it is insulting to those of us who do live here. Most annoying to me is the total lack of anger on Marianne's part. This does not ring true. While many scenes were heartbreaking and felt real, others were just empty and fake. She would have experienced more complex emotions, including anger at her parents for what they did to her. She just had no inner strength and I felt she remained a passive \\"victum\\" through out. Very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book had me hooked, but by the time I made to the end I was sooo depressed. It wasn't enjoyable to read, but I felt compelled to finish it to find out what happened to this tragic family. Even though the ending was supposed to be uplifting, I couldn't shake the feeling of melancholy that had pervaded the entire book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I just finished reading this book, sticking with it out of a desperate hope that there would be some kind of backbone in at least one of the characters to speak some truth. The trauma that this family goes through is compounded by selfishness and stupidity, blind faith in the flawed characters around them. Any self-aware person will come away from this book thinking, &quot;Could real people ever be this blind? This silent?&quot;The trauma that the family endures certainly was met with silence throughout history, but the family's reaction - banishing an innocent daughter, the daughter meekly submitting to this banishment, everyone's (except one son's) acceptance of this complicity - sickened me. Perhaps the point of the author was to make us wonder at this complicity, but no true answers were offered. This lack of confrontation or apology, whether an example to react against or an attempt at creating a &quot;realistic&quot; portrait of a befuddled family, leaves me supremely unsatisfied.The narrator himself is complicit in the ostracising of his sister, seems to condemn it, yet never creates closure or offers an apology to his sister. The final vision of the book, of the survivors of the family coming together in a loving exchange, is patently unreal. The capacity to forgive is an incredible human trait, but these characters have also fogotten deep traumas that cannot simply be solved by the passing of the father. It was the mother, after all, who arranged the logistics of sending their daughter away. Where is the truth in this sham? Nowhere. Don't waste your money. If you are seeking a delicate portrait of identity and forgiveness, read &quot;Remains of the Day&quot;."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This plot is one I would normally go for; high school girl raped, town and family in denial, family falls apart. Sounds good enough, but you are going to need a lot of time on your hands to get through that plot. I trudged ( and even skimmed)parts of this book. It started with a bang, I was in and feeling the charcters also, but it seems to plataue and even fall flat here and there. I was disappointed especially to see the mother, who seems to really come across as a determined women, crumple and disolve under her husband's misery. I kept waiting for something big to happen ~ revenge, scorching pain, new found triumph ~ANYTHING and it just never did. It is not a total disappointment, Joyce Carol Oates has talent, but I think this same story could be retold, minus 150 pages or so, and be much more enjoyable. If you are a fan of the author, or maybe have a special interest in the subject matter, this book will be more enjoyable. For avid readers who like a well written story to fall into (like myself) it didn't quite hit the mark."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I've just rediscovered Joyce Carol Oates after decades of reading award winning novels. And I soo Loved the Mulvaneys! I literally fell in love with this family, each charcter so beautifully developed. Oates understanding of human behavior and emotions....and how each is described and characterized. I cried at the end....which I rarely do.I feel as if I lived with this family's tragedies and triumphs...BEAUTIFUL!!!!! If you prefer a \\"fast\\" plot....don't bother. If you appreciate the minute descriptions of charcters and their environment you will love it!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Wow, I cannot sum this novel up in a paragraph...In short, it's about a prominent family with everything in the world to look forward to and how they fell from grace. What's heart wrenching is that the route of the problems (the rape of the daughter) is beyond their control, and the shameful pleasure of this boy (the rapist) was so blatantly temporary that he actually forgot about the incident. Nevertheless, his actions started a chain of events that robbed this family of their happiness. What I love about Joyce Carol Oates is that she puts the reader into the characters' shoes for better or for worse. And in her stories, it's usually for worse. She has an undeniable knack for making fiction seem real. She takes much time to develop her characters to the point where you feel you are actually part of this family. So naturally, when she brazenly rips this family apart, you truly feel their pain. I can't further describe her writing...it's unparallel, and this book clearly shows it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is my role model, my mentor, the woman who jump-started my own career as a novelist, with \\"Them.\\"\\"Mulvaneys\\" has its moments. The chapters just leading up to and around the rape are intriguing. She's always good at the \\"dark\\" side. The father's banishment of the daughter, while unpalatable and rather unbelievable, had enough drama to make me want to keep going.But the cornball stuff made me gag. Joyce: haven't you heard that saccharine is bad for your health? There are too many sentimental cliches - it's like she was trying to prove that even she, the great JCO, can be a upbeat writer. Please, leave that \\"perky\\" stuff to writers of sitcoms, Joyce. You wasted a lot of time waving the flag, apple pie, \\"moms,\\" deposed cheerleaders and fluffy kittens around. Can we get back to black now?(Seriously, the problem here was that the family was so irritatingly \\"perfect\\" to begin with. When the real tragedy entered, it just didn't register as it would have with potent, truly dysfunctional heroes. The Mulvaneys were too boring to bring down. Michael Senior's great need to be accepted at the country club just didn't cut it as a Major Tragic Flaw.)"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I think this was one of those books that you either loved or hated, and I definitely did not love it. I just found the family so despicable in their handling of such a delicate situation, and although I'm sure this kind of thing happens far more often than we'd like to believe, that doesn't make it any easier to take. In my opinion, it started off well, and then just dragged incessantly once I got halfway through it. So it wasn't just the subject matter - if the writing had been different, I would have found it much more palatable. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"You're going to read a novel that gives you the stuff that life is made of. If you cannot stand the heat, you know what to do. In this piece, the Mulvaneys are a very happy close-knit, no secrets held, type of family. There are Corinne and Michael Mulvaney the parents, and Marianne, Patrick and Judd the brothers. The trouble starts with Marianne who is date raped on a Valentine date,and who falls into despair just having to tell her perfect family about her the horendous happening. She expects sympathy, but that's when the house falls down; for she gets not an ounce of comfort or anything of that sort. Then her cowardly father send a message by his dear wife to inform the young lady that she has to leave his home. Her brothers are torn and confused by these happenings, as all personalities make deperate changes and everyone totally isolates themselves from each other. In the meanwhile Marianne drift from place to place, and life in the Mulvaney's house has come to a standstill. One cannot but help wondering why it is that the parents acting in such a unfeeling and callous way instead of being supportive of their daughter's dark fate. Readers, that's how life is, and it shows that their foundation was terribly weak as a family. A somewhat happy ending but this book takes a great deal of patience as it is quite long too, but it is very very real. That's the reason that I'm keeping mine safely in my library until I feel the need to reread it one day. Give it a go and you'll see what I mean. Joyce Carol Oates is a brilliant writer.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE)"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"To begin, I will not repeat the plot of this book as it has been summarized by other reviewers. The central issue of the book is is Marianne's removal from the family. I feel that a precedent was set in Michael Sr.'s family because of his own father's rejection, and I could understand him to some degree, but I had real problems with Corinne. What on earth would motivate a mother, so willing to send her daughter away? Could she not have become Marianne's advocate and argued with her husband that sending their daughter to some distant relative would be perceived by Marianne as blaming the VICTIM? Was she, with all her Christian beliefs, not very Christian, in a practical sense,at all? I understand her devotion to and love for her husband, but she seemed to have no mind of her own, no backbone in this affair. As a person with such religious devotion, here was her moment to practice her faith and she failed to protect her daughter. I feel that Oates cleverely exiles Marianne in one of the shortest chapters in the book, thus emphasizing the amount of time it took to make and carry out the expulsion. Further, she beautifully draws Marianne after her exile as an incomplete, childlike, and confused being, stuck emotionally at the age of her tragedy (the rape AND the removal from the family which could have supported her and help her grow more surely into a woman).Other issues which concerned me were the excrutiating detail of every aspect of the Mulvaney Family from where they sat at the dinner table to where they put their mail each day. I get the picture: They were Perfect.I also agree with another reviewer that the end was like an unrealistic return to this idealized version of a family. How did they heal so well and so quickly? They knew eachother so little, in fact not at all.All in all, WWTM is a well written, complex book, both thought and conversation-provoking. I recommend it to anyone in a book discussion group."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Being an avid reader of all types of books, I eagerly anticipated reading another of Oprah's picks. I am only half way through and have been laboring for more than a week. Oates feels the need to drone on and on, somewhat off track, while I am wanting more from each character, something redeeming to connect me to them, but it hasn't happened. So far, I haven't felt the compulsion to pick it up to see what happens like I do with others great reads. After reading some of the other reviews I realize I am not alone. Definitely lacks the &quot;page-turner&quot; status other picks have been."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was drawn into &quot;We Were The Mulvaneys&quot; by the practiced hand of Joyce Carol Oates. This is my first reading of her work and I found it frustrating, propelling, discouraging, lucid, dreamlike and cathartic all at once. Oates has a gift for pulling the rug out from under the reader by clever use of plot, language and structure. My only complaint is that some scenes approach a Mitchner-style of writing that can be tedious. The rise and fall of the Mulvaneys captures well the unspoken struggle of many American families. Our childlike minds assume so much about ourselves and about others and form beliefs, like Corinne's fireflies. But sometimes things happen that test those beliefs and we are left confused and lost. This story demonstrates over and over again that belief and reality must fight it out if we are ever to find our way. When put to the test, the idyllic Mulvaney family came undone like so many silk knots. Everything had to be questioned; the existence of God, the loyalty of family and friends, the strength of community, the responsibility to one's self in conflict with our responsibility to others. Frankly, it was a wild ride. I found the heroism of the children amazing as they struggled to find their way with poor parental models and many times without each other. The rebirth of Patrick in the swamp is the most powerful writing I've ever cried through. Hate and fear, love and betrayal, courage and devotion, I thought it was a wonderful ride."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I waited for years to find the mysterious &quot;slot&quot; in time or space where I could enter one of the Oates' worlds and read her books. I never could get started until about three years ago. They are so varied by setting and character, so compelling in detail and observation of emotions and behavior, and yes even a bit strange sometimes, that it may seem odd to some people that anyone would have trouble reading Oates. ow I'm hooked. I found We Were the Mulvaneys to be one of the best of the 12 or so Oates' books I've read, and also believe it might be -- for some reluctantly-hesitant readers -- a good one to start with. She is a national treasure, and the lives of the Mulvaneys will stick in my mind probably forever."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I found this book to be tedious to read, the story was depressing, the characters were unrealistic and had split personalities.A mother who loves her children more than life banishes her only daughter?A daughter who is raped and brutilized and avoids men, practically becomes a nun, and then ups and gets married and has children with no explanation of what changed.A middle son who is brilliant and driven, but gets consumed with revenge to the point of abandoning his educational and career goals.An oldest son who is a caricature of the oldest son - star athelete, party-boy, goes into the Marines, marries, has an \\"orderly\\" life. He is like a prop in this book.A youngest son, our narrator, who bears the brunt of the total distruction and dysfuntion of this family - yet, we know so little about him. His experiences are retold like a story in a newspaper - just the facts. Maybe because he becomes a newspaper writer? But, wouldn't it have been interesting to hear a little more about the fear and anger that this boy must have experienced.The father who has a total meltdown - a personality transplant due to this unforgivable event. Oates hints that - no let me correct that - one could infer (in a vain attempt to make sense of this) that the father could see himself perpertrating the same crime that happened against his daughter, so that his destruction comes from self-hatred, but it's a stretch. It would have been nice if Oates could have spelled this out a bit more. Sure, he had a history of young, social drinking. That doesn't make you an alcholic on the edge.This is the first book by Oates that I have read. It will probably be my last."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"It has been perhaps two years since I read this novel. Originally in hardcover when it was first published. The book STILL stays with me. It is a tragic and compelling story of a family that could be yours or mine. You will see the laundry folded and stacked on the stairs for each member to haul up to their own room. The brothers and sisters love(and hate) each other as do the mom and the dad.One event turns it all around. A gripping story. You won't be disappointed. Miss Oates weaves the tale enticingly."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read this book about a year ago and I can still remember the power that exuded from its pages. I would wake up at 4-5 am every morning and read a chapter or two, or three, depending on what part of the narrative I happened to be at. My job became secondary and, as a result, I was late a few times.To be simple, the book tells of a family in New York that falls apart after the daughter is raped by a young man who belongs to a prominent family in town. The town turns on the Mulvaneys and each Mulvaney goes his or her separate way. Sad, very sad.Joyce Oates is one of the masters of literature and she knows just how to braid your heart into taut, painful strands. I probably have ten of her books and each one is gothic and dark and full of emotionally-laden sentences, paragraphs and chapters. This book is certainly one that you will never forget."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"A powerful book with so many layers and deep storylines. It's a great work by a WONDERFUL author. I love Joyce Carol Oates and I really enjoyed this book. It's a departure from some of the other books of hers that I've read, and I really thought she tackled this story and subject matter with dignity and emotion. Her characters are deep and with many layers and faces. This book holds your attention and is a really great piece of fiction."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Denial and dysfunction tears apart an American family in Joyce Caorol Oates' We Were the Mulvaneys. Set in 1970's upstate New York, the tale centers around the Mulvaneys - a family who is living the American dream of wealth and prominence on their own little slice of heaven, High Point Farm. Using her considerable gift for visceral prose, Oates paints a painful portrait of the fall of the Mulvaneys after the rape and subsequent exile of their &quot;perfect&quot; daughter. Oates' understanding potrayal of violence and its depersonalizing effects compels the reader to stay with the Mulvaneys -to empathize with their defects and come to a place of forgiveness with the entire clan. This is Oates at her best: holding a mirror up to show our strengths and vulnerablilities."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Is it possible that such a strong, capable family could disintegrate over date rape? Yep - I guess in J.C. Oatesland it happens. In the 1990s I suppose everyone would be in intensive family therapy, but this novel is set in a time when rape did reflect on the victim. I disagree with readers who have said the family was just too perfect for the first 100 pages. Haven't we all known of families filled with high achievers?My disappointment with the book was that Judd was not as strongly characterized as his brothers and sister. In spite of that, this novel was a page-turner. Reading Oates' books makes me feel as though I've picked up a rock from the garden and looked underneath. In other words, she writes great fiction."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaneys inexplicably hold themselves up to higher standards than mere mortals--and have to pay with their lives for this arrogance. This is a compelling group of characters, mother, father, and four children, that will stamp themselves in your physce long after you put the novel down. I was mesmerized throughout but was awed by the epilogue--a truly satisfying end to a rich, complex novel."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"When I finally finished We Were the Mulvaneys -- this is a long novel -- I put the book down, closed my eyes and spent a good half-hour just processing what I had read. In my opinion this is Oates' best work; it's funny, heartbreaking, unnerving and uplifting all in one. She paints each member of this family as a vivid, multi-faceted character; I could picture each one as I followed their story, not just physically, but emotionally as well. Although the book is generally depressing, it has a certain redemptive aspect to it; I would receommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was my first Oates book, but not my last. I choose this book to read as my junior research novel, and I am satisfied with my decision to an extent. Her method of writing is very enthrolling, while at the same time you needed to have a large enough mental capacity to be able to memorize the WHOLE thing. She did so much flashback in her novel, that if you forget one event, you have to go back and search for the event to be able to continue the story! And, 8 PAGES OF HOW TO GET TO AN IMAGINARY FARM?!?!?! Geez, get a clue! I was not overly impressed with Mrs. Oates, but I am willing to give her another chance. First impressions can be misleading."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is one that I had a hard time putting down. I think I found it so engaging because its characters are people we all know well--the stereotypical &quot;perfect&quot; family (and let's face it, every community has one). It looks beyond the veneer of this perfection into some very real, imperfect situations. When things go spinning out of control, it shows how pride and reputation can override sanity and better judgement. The characters are rich, their individual plights absorbing, and their survival instincts amazing. A dark tale, I wasn't depressed by the story. I focused on Marianne's strength, and used her resiliance as the metaphor for what the other characters strived to be."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This could be called the foreshadow of some of the events that happen around us in the news today. Having lived through some of the things that Ms Oates describes in her book I was awash in a flood of emotion. It is hard to assign a level of belief or disbelief unless you have walked a mile in there shoes. Was happy to see some clousure brought the end of the family story. Very glad I read the book, but it brought to the surface many of the reasons that life is so diffcult to live sometimes."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As a teenage girl, I often go looking for love stories. Prince Charming rescues the damsel in distress and they live happily every after. Love stories are my weakness.This beautifully written novel by Joyce Carol Oates completly changed my mind about what a love story was. This book illustrates the love shared by a family, and most importantly how this tight-knit family's love is tested. It's a great story, but not quite right if you're looking for a perfectly happy ending. Hold in there though, the end is happy."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was one of the better. I've read about half, with the other half on my bookshelf (in line to read). It was a sad story though. And I almost had a hard time believing what was going on. But I guess I could imagine something like this going on...."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I found this to be an extremely sad story. Of course, none of us know how we would react but hopefully, not the way the Mulvaneys did! Although I like a happy ending, I thought that this one was too much...How can the whole family suddenly become perfect?"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I thought this book was unbelievable in the fact that the characters were so real! I loved and hated the charaters at the same time. I think that without question Joyce Carol Oates knows how to write a incredible book. Why is it incredible? I think any book is great when you honestly feel you know the character and you either want to be their friend or kill them!This story is about a very close family who are tradgically tore apart by an incedent , that was obviously to much for them to take. I highly recommend this book is you love stories of families that go through love, pain, heartach and survival. I will only say that this book will make you smile and then be so mad you can't stand it!!! Read this it's a great book!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I also got frustrated with the actions of the characters in this book but ultimately decided that the author's ability to chronicle the life of a family (warts and all) were what made it ring so true for me. I feel that some of the reviewers wanted Oates to write a novel about righting the wrongs done to this girl and have a bunch of heroes celebrating the renewal of their family at the end of the story. But is real life always like that? People are flawed, families make mistakes and have to live with them. I feel that the author was giving us a picture of a particular family caught up in a certain situation and the way they handled it. The only problem that I had with the story was that I felt that the parents motivations for doing what they did were not really clear to me. Without revealing the story, I felt that the author made some big leaps in the story without explaining the characters motivation fully. But again, I guess that kind of mimics real life too. I don't always understand my own motivations much less anyone else's! Anyway, I did like the book a lot. I have only read Oates' short stories before but hope to read another novel in the future."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"While the beginning was a bit slow, I eventually found myself glued to the pages screaming (in my head) at the characters response to the 'rape.' How very sad, to lose happiness in so many lives. How very Oates to dissect their pain to the very core. If you want a happy feel-good book, skip this one. If you want good literature and a disturbing tale, snap it up!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"If you had a hard time getting through this one or gave up after only a few pages, perhaps you should consider purchasing your future reading material from the checkout stand at your local supermarket. This is not a simple &quot;feel good&quot; kind of book. It makes you think and consider people, places and things that you normally wouldn't. I think Oates does an outstanding job of bringing the Mulvaney family as well as High Point Farm to life. If you had a hard time believing that the father would turn on his daughter you must have missed all of the references to his relationship with his father. History will repeat itself, it always has and always will."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"this is probably the saddest book I've ever read. After Marianne's date rape at the age of 16, the Mulvaney's life totally and completely unravels. I think their life must have been unstable from the beginning, personal scars hidden underneath the outward &quot;happy-family&quot; persona. This book chronicles their life from youngest son Judd's birth until middle-age..from how the father, Mike, became a raging alcoholic and separated himself from the family, the mother Corinne tried her hardest to keep everyone together but was falling apart herself, and how Marianne moved around the country to try and escape the memories that shattered her life. From a seedy college co-op in Pennsylvania to marrying a veterinarian, readers begin to crave a happy ending. This novel, breaking your heart and then healing it once again, chronicles the life and times of the Mulvaneys."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I haven't finished it yet - but it is terrific.

This one is the exception. I couldn't read beyond page 40 because she writes about an event and then gets sidetracked and goes off for pages and pages about another detail. The trick is to keep you in suspense but I felt it extremely frustrating. I never was able to find out what happens to the daughter because it probably isn't until page 200! I felt like I was talking to one of those people that will tell a story, build it up, go off on different sub-stories and then finally gets to the end and you are so happy that the story is over that you want to make a point to not carry on a conversation with that person again. This book reminds me of the John Irving style of writing and if you like his stuff you may like this."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were the Mulvaneys tells the story of the Mulvaney family: handsome, successful patriarch Michael Mulvaney Sr., who owns a thriving roofing business and enjoys the friendship and contacts of many of the movers and shakers in small Mt. Ephraim, New York; blue-eyed, lithe, religious Corinne, mother to the Mulvaney clan and avid antique collector; eldest son Mike Jr., a football star at local Mt. Ephraim High School; Patrick, the brainy, analytical son who graduates valedictorian of his high school class and goes on to study on scholarship at Cornell; beautiful Marianne, a cheerleader, devout Christian, and popular student; and little Judd, who, even at his young age, exhibits a precocious charm.The family lives with a friendly collection of animals - cats, dogs, birds, horses, cows, etc. - at gorgeous High Point Farm, a large estate with attending acreage and outbuildings. The house, painted a dreamy lavendar color (with, of course, a top-of-the-line roof) perches within vew of scenic Mt. Cataract. The family, as Judd (our narrator) will tell us, has a \\"talent for happiness.\\" They are loved and respected in their community. Everyone knows the Mulvaneys.But then something horrible happens to one of the Mulvaney clan. And the reader continues in horror as this awful event ripples outward, changing the lives of the happy family forever. Judd, recalling the events as an adult, tries to accurately document the story of the Mulvaneys' fall, their eventual re-discovery of one another, and their \\"special gift for happiness.\\"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The characters are real. They leap off the page. The story is utterly compelling. The book is much about family, and memory, and the evolution of who you are and who you will become. The book is about God and those who believe in him and those who don't. The book is about doing what's expected of you and what is not expected. The book is about shame and public opinion, how others see you and how you see yourself. The book is about claiming your identity, recovering, moving on from tragedy. Though the book only covers a brief span of years, it feels like an epic.It's long-ish (about 450 pages), but it's worth every minute it takes to read, in my opinion. Read this book. Amazing stuff."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was the first novel I've read by Joyce Carol Oates, and if We Were the Mulvaneys is reflective of her other work in terms of craftmanship, I can certainly understand the accolades she's received; This was a great novel. Oates's characterization is brilliant--I feel as if I actually know these characters. She ably conveys the dynamics of the family in such a way that, when tragedy arrives, real emotions are evoked. I felt something like genuine nostalgia for what was lost, and in a sense, I think Oates is aiming for that, arguing that not only have the Mulvaneys moved on, but that perhaps a certain American lifestyle has as well. However, this is just one arguable point of discussion in a work that generates several, a sure sign of quality in any artform. The biggest mystery to me is why many Amazon reviewers categorize this book as a slow read. In contrast, my wife and I both rocketed through this book; I couldn't put it down, and this is another aspect that I found admirable about the book: it's fast paced, yet it is also constructed like literature as well, with layers of symbolism to dissect beyond the basic story. Simply stated, We Were the Mulvaneys is the best novel I've read in some time. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I haven't been this inspired by a book in a long time. Oates creates such a complete world for her characters, one into which I feel I could easily step. There was a lot to learn from how she lay all of this out for the reader and then placed these intricate and individual people into this scene. It might be, though, that I am hypercritical of novels right now because I'm aiming at composing my own. So many I've read recently seem to fall into trouble in the end. Oates sets things up beautifully and then besets trouble on the Mulvaneys. Things certainly fall apart for them and there doesn't seem much of a way out for them. Indeed, Oates lets them each fall about as far as possible. This nadir happens with only fifty pages left to read. An event reunites the family, and an epilogue shows us them together many years later. The problem: there is no reconciliation. No recounting of the lessons learned. They somehow come out of this darkness with little effort and stumble right into the daylight as the novel closes. I really did enjoy this book, and that's what made the ending so unsatisfying."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Every summer, I try to read at least one book of Joyce Carol Oates. This summer, it was the Mulvaneys. This books lets you dwell on certain thoughts - for instance, What is normal? People in life seem so normal at times, but most people are hurting or damaged in one way or another. Life is also precarious - how do different people react to difficult circumstances? We Were The Mulvaneys is really a case study of how people react in a normal, or on the surface \\"normal\\" family when a tragedy occurs. There are many twists and turns, and not the gore that I associate with some other Joyce Carol Oates novels. It's fascinating, she covers a time period that I remember well, as will anyone coming of age in the late 1970's. Oates also does a great job describing the economic slump of 1980, and how this affected upstate NY, which has yet to recover from the hard times. This is a book you easily picture in your head, these are thoughts and characters that you recognize, perhaps even in your own family. I think this is a great book and I'd recommend it. It's very hard to put down once you are reading."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I had always been a bit intimidated by Joyce Carol Oates, but someone had recommended this to me so I plunged right in. I had read some of the unfavorable reviews on this site, so I had low expectations. Boy, was I surprised. I absolutely loved this book, and read it quickly. I especially appreciated the animals in this story; reminds me of how my family treats animals as part of the family unit. I didn't think the ending was saccharine at all...it was a real story composed of a real family who had the ability to heal despite terrible circumstances. I never thought this book had a Lifetime televisionesque-plot as some people have complained...the characters were incredibly well developed and there's a real sense of wholeness at the end. I highly recommend this book, especially if you appreciate the complexities of family, the outdoors, good food, and have a love for animals."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaneys were living the American dream . . . until their perfect daughter, Marianne, was brutally raped while drunk on Prom night. No one in the family is able to deal with the reality, and their inability to cope drives a splintering wedge into the family and into each of their lives. You can see the collapse coming, like the inevitable deflation of a large balloon after a tiny hole develops, but Ms. Oates wants to take you through every last possible humiliation before allowing healing and reconciliation to occur.Interestingly, Ms. Oates chose to date this novel into a time when rape was still not spoken about much in public . . . and premarital loss of female virginity was viewed as a moral lapse (even when caused by rape). The events would have different consequences today. She also doesn't focus that much on the rape, so this isn't a book about how a family can recover from such a trauma. Rather, she appears to have chosen as her theme that we need to be more open and communicative with one another. The family's collapse is due to their inability to face facts, help one another and move on. In that sense, the theme of this book is very much like the theme of Ms. Oates's more recent book, The Tattooed Girl.We Were the Mulvaneys will appeal most to those who enjoy reading about the intimate details of family life, fun with pets and the pleasures of hobbies, gardening and outdoor life. Ms. Oates brings much enthusiasm to her portrayals of everyday events and thoughts that will ring true in their details.This book needed a strong editorial hand, but didn't get it. It's about three times longer than it needs to be to capture the story that Ms. Oates tells. She makes a big point of having the youngest child, Judd, narrate the story . . . but everyone else narrates parts of the story that are larger than Judd's narration. The Judd narration seems tacked on rather than helpful. She would have done better to have had someone further removed be the narrator and play a bigger role. Ms. Oates also telegraphs her story . . . and you just have to keep reading page after page as she plays it out in constantly repeating detail around the same themes.To me, Marianne is by far the most interesting and sympathetic character. I would have enjoyed reading a book that developed her story much more than this one did. She struggles with the normal feelings of guilt associated with being a victim while trying to follow the right Christian path of forgiving those who sin against her. Her path is a long and hard one, and Ms. Oates decides to skip the essential moments when she is healed.At a time when many families are living economically fragile existences, this story will resonate with some as Mike Senior's reactions to the rape cause him to destroy his business. Other than that, there is little reason to read this book. If you want to learn more about how a person and a family should recover from rape, try a nonfiction book on that subject.As I finished this book, I realized that we cannot tell and show others too often how much we love them."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was thought provoking. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has had an event that made a &quot;before and after&quot; period in their life. It made me reflect on my own family history and how I have come to accept that people react to the same event in very different ways. The narrator of this book describes quite clearly how families can be changed by a single event- one that occurs all too frequently- but that single event makes all the difference.The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it was too much &quot;before&quot; and I thought the book went on too long in the beginning. Also, I had a hard time with the authors wandering thoughts. The narrator would start off with a comment that would make me think &quot;Aha! Now we're getting to it!&quot; Then they would go off in acompletely different direction, only to come back to it briefly at the end of the chapter. Very annoying! Still, if I skimmed the parts that didn't interest me, about 1/2 way through the book I was hooked!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were the Mulvaneys will strike a chord with anyone who has experienced catastrophe in their own family. Once a proud, loving family, one terrible event takes them spiraling down the path to destruction. Up to the point of the tragic rape, I was thoroughly enjoying the book. It is well written with enjoyable characters. After the rape took place, the book became very slow and it was difficult to focus on the plot. The characters became very weak and disappointing."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oats does such a wonderful job taking us through the complex lives of the people in this family. The story moved me to tears at times and inspired me at times. This was the first novel by this author that i read. Since reading this one, I've gone on to read several more of her books, and enjoyed every one of them. I would recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaneys seemed to me a very disfunctional family in crisis. The optimism in me hopes that most families would handle a similar tragedy by coming together, rather than falling apart.I found the plot a bit slow - mainly because I kept waiting for the silver lining. I truly sympathized for the characters that Joyce Carol Oates created, but I just can't call this book one of my favorites."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I couldn't put this book down and I also couldn't wait for the end. I keep flipping the pages to the end to find out what was going to happen. Doing so I had to go back and continue from where I left off. I felt I had to know how that ending had came about. I actually felt like &quot;why is this book so long I wish I could already get to the end.&quot; Despite my impatience and unconventional reading style I felt this was one of the best books I had come across in a long while (months, at least). It is so....melodramatic, so human, so real. Very much like a drama anthology, whose stories are commonly enjoyed in the Philippines and Latin America."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates has motivated me to seek out more of her work through &quot;. . . The Mulvaneys.&quot; She has somehow caused me to run the gamut of feelings from admiration to disgust to compassion for the entire Mulvaney family . I was in turn, intriqued, depressed and hopeful for these tragic individuals!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Like most of Oates' work, her latest novel is not so much hard to understand as it is hard to read. Her writing is often powerfully beautiful, but the subjects she chooses to describe are painful. Roughly three hundred out of four hundred and fifty pages are devoted to the consequences of a rape that tears apart a perfect family. It is easy to criticize the characters for the way they deal with their daughter and sister's trauma; perhaps because their reactions are not constructive, it is also easy to get frustrated with the characters and even the novel itself. However, the novel ultimately redeems itself by proving that a loving family can indeed overcome just about anything. A good read with a meaningful moral, but it hits difficult spots along the way."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I loved this book. Joyce Carol Oates writes like she is in the room with you telling a story. This once perfect, untouched family is slowley torn apart by a savage and unspeakable act agaist it's beloved daughter and sister. It happens so gradually that it seems a surprise to the family itself, when one day they realize that all that they were, they are no longer. Once so close and loving they find themselves strangers. Once so on top of the world and capable they find themselves destroyed, and all of it happens in such a beleivable way, it makes you wonder how immune anyone is, regardless of the appearance of indestructability."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was the first time I read a book by this author; Joyce Carol Oates, and I wasn't very impressed.I (as well as other readers) find it hard to believe that a tragedy can tear a family apart, especially in the way that this tragedy did. I kept reading on, in hopes that I would find some sense in the story, but unfortunately that never happened.I am an avid reader of a lot of Oprah's selections, but this one just didn't stand out in my opinion. I will give this author one more chance, and hope that the next book is a better choice."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I could not believe how wonderful this book was. When I had a day off, I began reading it in the morning, and finished it in the evening. It was that good!!!Ms. Oates's portayal of a hardworking family in upstate New York may not sound very exciting in the beginning. It's after the first few chapters the book all of a sudden takes a dark turn, following the events of Marianne's unfortunate situation at her prom (by telling, I'd be giving the story away, and why should I ruin it for you?). This is the type of work one could expect from Joyce Carol Oates.It is this unthinkable event that takes the Mulvaney family from a once respected family to a shame-ridden clan seen in the eyes of Mt. Ephraim, New York. From there, the family tries to regain themselves not to their original status, but to a level where they can cope with the circumstances.The story is told by Judd, the youngest member of the family who also appears to be the most neglected during this crisis. In his attempt to take a retrospect to his youth, he is able to show his family was able to overcome the obsticles that tried to tear them apart.Though this story is on Oprah's Book List, don't read it simply for that. Read it for the story, because only then you will appreciate the awesome writing style of Joyce Carol Oates."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Well, this novel will not change your perspective on family, nor will it make you understand what it is like to be part of a blessed family and to lose those blessings one by one. However, it will teach you how to live within a character's perspective. The details of High Point Farm are exquisite. The messy steps where lost belongings eventually appear, the animals that link the people to one another, the house itself all resonate of truth. Is this a great book? Probably not. For four hundred pages each of the character's becomes and stays traumatized by a crime that none of them deserved but all served to amplify. Then, in the last fifty pages or so they are all healed (except for those who die). We are all weak. However, few of us are as weak as Mike Mulvaney the elder. He visits upon his own family the violent separation of parent and child which haunted his youth. His wife Corrinne gives Christians,wives and moms a bad name so that's a pretty powerful trifecta. The children are vivid at times and then relegated to secondary status as adults. It is as if they cease to be interesting to Oates when they become adults. Maybe that's because adults eventually have to stop worrying about the sins of their parents and must then focus on their own impact on the world. Still, I liked the book and would recommend it to budding writers as an example of several elements of the craft. However, for those of us who were not the Mulvaneys, it may be a bit tedious in its relentless adolescence."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"&quot;Mulvaneys&quot; is a book that sticks with you for days after you've finished it. You ask yourself, &quot;Why didn't Corinne, the mother, ever get a job to help out when things got bad at the roofing company? Why didn't the kids?&quot; Was it denial, stupidity or am I missing something? Mom seemed borderline delusional at times, which is what I am sure Oates intended us to think. After pondering on the book when I finished it, I realized that the Mulvaneys were no different than a lot of other American families. Although I'm not so sure I would cave to my husband's demands and exile one of my children after they suffered a trauma. I really liked the ending. It left me content to know how things worked out for them."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book kept me enthralled.It really reitterated the fact that our lives really do hang in the balance...and how one choice can impact ourselves &amp; our families forever...changing the course of history in unimaginable ways. Powerful writing."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"A long time Oates fan, I was thrilled to see Oprah had chosen &quot;We Were The Mulvaneys&quot; for February. This is the most accessible of Oates books to date, lacking the amorality of &quot;Zombie&quot;, and the feminist power of books of like &quot;Solstice&quot; and &quot;Foxfire&quot; yet emerging as a more commercial book, a more kind book, a book for everyone. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The Mulvaneys were a family which seemed at once farmiliar to me, possibly because I lived in the region the book takes place in. We see the story of the family's decline through the eyes of all the members except Mike &quot;Mule&quot; Mulvaney the oldest. I found Marianne to be one of the most magical literary characters I have encountered for a long time. She is simply saintlike and beautiful and giving. The tragic portrait of humanity of the citizens of Mt Ephraim is both believable and tragic. The character of Patrick is endearingly complex and never predictable. The story moves at a fast gallop, sending your emotions searing.I think that this book is very telling in how easy it is for families to disintegrate in the modern era. It is heartwrenching to witness how a lack of understanding and miscommunication can split a family up, and splinter them permanently.I found the book moving, true to life, and a triumph. Not to be missed. If you like it try reading Oates's &quot;Because it is bitter, and because it is my heart&quot; and the marvelous &quot;Foxfire&quot;."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"you will like this one. I liked the book for the most part but it was too real life and depressing for me to say I enjoyed it. I was extremely excited when I bought the book but mid way through I decided it wasnt going to be a favorite of mine. If you arent prone to depression or if you feel like a good cry by all means read this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As soon as this book became available, I wanted to get it. I am so suprised at how disappointed I am in the novel. We were the Mulvaneys was a long, dragged out story about a disfunctional family that never sees closure. Sure, that I how life is sometimes, but each character develops into a complete pile of nothing. I found myself avoiding the book, not wanting to drudge through the pages for another day. This is usually not the case with me. I wanted to complete the story and found it an incredible effort. I shared it with my book-buddy, and she had the same reaction.Sorry Ms. Oates, it's just a matter of taste I think. See you in your next novel."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I loved this book! Not often does a book so disturb me that I feel it in my guts. The only other instance of that is John Kennedy Toole's &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. I couldn't finish that book because Ignatius was so well written that I found him completely disgusting and couldn't bear to read another word. That's good writing. And so is Oates' writing in depicting the Mulvaneys. I was so frustrated by the characters' reactions to the rape that I found myself telling them to get over their individual hurts and deal with it as a family before everything goes wrong! But it is fiction, so they don't get over themselves and everything does go wrong, for a while.I love the use of animals to parallel the lives of the characters. &quot;High Point&quot; is the name of the farm, and of course they have to leave a place called high point to hit the lows. A previous review said that Eprhaim is a son of Joseph who symbolizes redemption. They live in Mt. Eprhaim! These wonderful symbols added great depth to a disturbing story.Some reviewers were complaining this book was too wordy. That complaint calls to mind Mozart in the movie &quot;Amadeus&quot; when he was accused of using too many notes in his music. He said there were exactly as many notes as he required. That is true with any artist, and so it is true with the artist Joyce Carol Oates. She painted a picture of the power and frailty of family, and a potent picture it is."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I began reading Oprah books just for the need of a recommendation - and this one is certainly fitting to her selections. If you're looking for a dark, insightful, depressing and yet hopeful story, We Were the Mulvaney's is a novel for you.A coming of age story, for all the characters, We Were the Mulvaney's is a tribute to the fact that life goes on - whether we'd like it to or not, and certainly not in the way we'd expect it to. A family struck by tradgedy deals with it in the only way they know how, and destroys itself in the process.My only dislike in the book is the glossing over of a few of the characters. We really only get a glimpse of the parents, their daughter, and one of their sons. The other two boys seem to be inconsequential and I wish Oates would have expounded further on their lives after their sister is raped.Overall, this was a wonderful book - definantly worth reading. Oates draws us in and then crushes us, never quite regaining our trust, leaving us as exposed as her characters."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates has departed from her usual style with &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot;. Unlike many of the readers who reviewed this book, I loved it. Oprah Winfrey said that the story still haunts her though she read it over a year ago, and I can see why. The characters are real. You can almost feel and smell the texture of their lives. I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. Great work Ms. Oates."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is absolutely beautiful and touching. It shows the dark side of humans but it has so much redemption and beauty in it, it lifts you up in the end. To me the most unforgettable character is Muffin, Marianne's cat. He survived and survived and stayed with Marianne until it was safe for him to move on and leave her behind. It moved my to tears."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I'm an avid reader and English major and I love to read mostly 18th c. novels... so I feel I have a lot of pateince when reading overly descriptive or slower storylines. My friend reccomended this book to me and so I bought it.I had a hard time following the narrator. At the beginning he declares himself to be the youngest son in this family. But then the narrator seems omniprecent and able to read other peoples thoughts. It was so confusing to me. One minute you can tell it is the youngest son and the next it's a daughter or mother who tells the story with their insights or ideas.The characterization was also difficult for me to get into. I feel that Ms. Oates really wants us to love her characters from the start, but I never felt that she gave me any reason to love her characters. They seemed to be apart of this tight knit family fabric and yet their nicknames for each other, or all of the many quirks and habits they have didn't establish this bond believably for me. I wanted to like them, but didn't feel I was given sufficient substance.One stumbling block I found was that there are many inconsistancies about what the character supposedly believes, but their actions or language showed otherwise. Maybe I'm missing the point and what the author truly intended, but I found this destructive to her characters instead of the reverse.I found the novel slow paced and the texture or the sentence structure choppy and sometimes difficult to follow. It seems at time you are tracing an individual's thoughts, but the next minute the style changes.I'm sure there are many who loved this novel and could identify with the issues of unraveling families, but I really struggled to get a good grasp of the Mulvaney's."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was one of the worst novels I have ever read. Oates goes on and on with so much detail and jumps around so much that it is hard to stay interested. I gave up after Part I."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"There are two things I don't like about this book--the first &quot;idyllic&quot; 100 pages (what could be more boring than a &quot;perfect&quot; family?), and the implausible devotion of Marianne to all of her family members despite their absolute and unforgiveable abandonment of her after &quot;the event.&quot; Her mother allows Michael to banish Marianne from the house, and we're supposed to look at her as tender and sensitive? Sure, parents make mistakes. But there are mistakes and there are MISTAKES.Those two complaints aside, I think there are many excellent passages in this JCO novel. The section about Michael Sr.'s demise, for example, is vividly imagined and convincingly portrayed. Some memorable writing here--if only that beginning were different."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Her worst book in years. Full of stereo-types and unpleasantcharacters who deserve what they get. And what they get isn't much.Angst: been there, done that. The characters are completelyunsympathetic in that their absolute selfishness andnarrow-minded values make caring about them not possible. IfI met these people I wouldn't like them so reading about themis not at all interesting.It seems JCO has burnt herself out. When she's not writingabout people dismembering eachother she is writing aboutboring, obnoxious people. Maybe she needs a break..."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Another one I read because it made Oprah's list.The story of a tragic event affecting this family is terrible. The poor daughter's life is changed by a rape and the father falls apart. I felt bad for the daughter's character and wanted to smack the father and hug him all at the same time.Although long... this is a great story."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Truly I am surprised that this book averages three stars among 400+ people. Granted, there isn't a lot of action and it is not always happy, but I think Oates does an astonishing job with what I consider to be perhaps one of the most complete character studies of an American family I have ever seen. When you finish the story, you will know the Mulvaneys in and out. The tale of the Mulvaneys is sprawling and I felt as though I was saying goodbye to friends when I finished the last page.Many reviewers claimed that the characters were unbelievable and that some were something akin to schizophrenic...Sorry, but I heartily disagree. We all have our quirks, and all families have ways of dealing with things that others might find unorthodox. That is simply the way of the world.Nonetheless, without summarizing the story (which I find defeats the purpose of an encouraging review) I will say that this work is truly ambitious and worthy of a perusal only by serious readers. In other words, if you want Danielle Steele or Nora Roberts, forget it. I have always heard mixed reviews about Joyce Carol Oates, but after having read this beautiful, and yes, realistic novel, I will look forward to reading further works. I couldn't more highly recommend this work. I would put it in a category with Ann-Marie MacDonald's \\"Fall On Your Knees,\\" and that my friends, is saying something BIG!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oates is brilliant for the most part but this book made me wonder! The Muvaneys are about as unrealistic as they can get! Oates' elaborate descriptions of Marianne's mother baking pies, pies and more pies in such detail emphasizing the &quot;perfect&quot; family is less than perfect and borders on obnoxious hyperbole!It is true the storyline is one of the devastation of date rape; she overemphasizes the &quot;cutesiness&quot; and later the unraveling of this upstate New York family as the book progresses. The ultimate ending is nearly laughable! I threw it across the room!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Super book! Funny, sad, brought me to tears and made me reflect on my family. Writing style reminded me of Pat Conroy. The beginning of the book is slow, but when it gets going it is a page turner! After finishing the book, I had to go back and read the first couple of chapters. A winner! Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I found this book very disappointing. I normally like Oprah's books, but I found this one felt like it was just going on and on. I never &quot;bonded&quot; with any of the characters and by the end I really didnt care what happened to any of them. I felt each person was terribly weak and self-centered."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I absolutely hated this book! I could not believe that the father in this story completely ruins his entire life and the life of his family just because his daughter got raped. I hated all the wimpy characters in this book also. None of them were believable and they never redeem themselves. I honestly wanted to just put this depressing book down a million times, but once I start something, I finish it. I am so sorry I wasted my precious time on,as another reviewer said, &quot;a total waste of paper.&quot; I have enjoyed so many Oprah picks. She really let me down on this one!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Too much going on with no direction. The writing is needlessly detailed. The character development and story line are not believable. And none of the family members are likeable. Ms. Oates tries to explore themes of familial alienation, religion, evolution, rape and redemption, yet does so only superficially. The result is a self indulgent 450 + page disconnected writing exercise.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The downfall of the Mulvaneys, after Oates' careful, exacting, boring description of them up to this point, was implausible, unbelievable. The parents she had described would just simply not treat their children, especially Marianne, the way they end up treating them. Seemed very naive. Has Oates had children of her own? The way she writes of the parents turning away from their children one by one makes it seem that she knows little of this bond. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and will be choosier henceforth and not as willing to read an Oprah selection just because it is an Oprah selection."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Even if you didn't like this book, and it was an emotionally draining story, how anyone can belittle Oates' writing is beyond me. She is the best. Someone noted that these characters had no depth. Are you kidding?? They had so much depth that it was sometimes difficult to take in. For anyone who is not afraid of serious fiction and doesn't insist on happily-ever-after, this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates once again brings dreams crashing into reality with the Mulvaney family. This perfect family that could have been an &quot;advertisement for the American dream&quot; ruins itself because of its own imperfections. This book is a brilliant irony of life; the very things we try to hide about ourselves are the very things we can't hide from others. Beautiful."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As an obsessive Joyce Carol Oates fan I am always conscious of the recent press highlighting (or should I say creating) the struggle between quality and quantity with her writing. I always take these criticisms to heart each time I pick up one of her novels. I think with this book, Joyce Carol Oates has captured a grotesque, yet painfully real piece of Americana again. At the beginning, I found the characters to be too idealistic. I thought a borderline scientific genius and an almost too Christian daughter could never develop from the same household. But as I read on, I thought maybe they were too real rather than idealistic. I realized the novel is through the voice of Judd, the youngest and often times forgotten Mulvaney. Oates captures his personal thoughts and his depictions of his family perfectly. Like always, Oates masters a voice so vividly and accurately, almost making the reader forget who is speaking. Often times in life, we pass others that are almost walking hyperboles because we view them through our own distorted lens. Oates proves to me once again she is a master at depicting the painfully real grotesque that envelopes all of our lives. This is a must read!!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"But I loved it anyway. I am not a big follower of Joyce Carol Oates, but plan to become one. I worked for a woman years ago and as a young married woman living in a new and strange city, she gave me unsolicited advice--when a woman has children she has to decide whom she will favor--her children or her husband. In &quot;We were the Mulvaneys&quot;, Corinne chooses the latter, and the results are devistating to her children and all concerned.I have read other comments about this novel, begrudging Ms. Oates the first 100 pages of the idealistic lives of the Mulvaneys before &quot;it&quot; happened. I disagree. She had to show how perfect their lives were before, so we could see how low they became after.I was very impressed with all the ends tied up at the end. I came to care about members of this family. They could be anyone. Or everyone."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"With We Were the Mulvaneys, Oates has captured the essence of life... it's struggles as well as its joys.

I felt the love and the pain of a family as it reaches to cope with a single damaging event."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I loved this book....Once again, Oates draws the reader helplessly into the lives, secrets, dreams and nightmares of her characters. While reading &quot;We Were The Mulvaneys&quot;, (in 2 days!) I felt as if these were people I knew...or could know. Oates' descriptions paint stellar portraits of these Mulvaneys...the reader comes to know each intimately, feel for them, and with them. The reader turns the page, even when there is supper to cook, or laundry to be hung, wondering, &quot;What will happen to these people?&quot;The din of this family's life rings true, as does their decline in the face of tradgedy. The reader looks on, like by-standers at a fire, grateful for not being burned, but feeling the intense heat from the flames.In the end, the book closes on a happier note, unlike much of Oates' work in the past. This is one story, one set of characters that I wll remember, long after the book is placed on a shelf."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Not having read a book by this author since high-school, I was startled by how much I was enthralled by this strory of the breakup of one family. Oates paints such a vivid picture of the torment and dissociation each family member feels while all around them their lives are being destroyed. Even more overwhelming is what doesn't get said and how this contributes to the family's demise.We are given an intimate look into the psyche of each member of this family and though we may not always like whom we meet, we feel compelled to find some goodness in all. I recommend this book to all, especially those who believe that &quot;it&quot; can't happen to them"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This well written ( no loose ends, common threads, well developedcharacters, and plausible plot) story should be sold in formal wearstores next Spring, before the proms.I am not a retailer or a shopper!

I thought it was so wrong what happened to the daughter and how they shipped her away and ended almost all communication. What mother that truly loves her daughter that much, would just send her off because her father can't stand to look at her. Maryann never got mad or hated her parent's for treating her that way? Very unrealistic. MaryAnn was a very weak character and apparentley very stupid for letting her family basically disown her."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates must be one of the most prolific contemporary novelists writing today. Her &quot;Black Waters&quot; was a slim book but it was powerful, full of resonance and simply unforgettable. &quot;We Were The Mulvaneys (WWTM)&quot; is a different sort of book. It is a family drama, thrice as long but sadly lacking in qualities I would consider essential in good narrative fiction.The basic storyline pans out like bad afternoon TV soap opera. That this picture perfect upwardly mobile all-Americam family should crumble and fall apart so quickly after &quot;the incident&quot; is hard enough to believe. Straining credibility even further is the suddeness of decline in the Mulvaneys' economic fortunes. Worse, the poor Mulvaneys and the members of the community in which they live behave like they're in a time warp, like 50s characters resurrected for the post-Woodstock 70s.After all that, how can we like or even feel sympathy for a family who behave like creeps to one another when the chips are down ? Mike Senior, the father, is easily the family's prize creep. His banishment of poor Marianne simply because she won't testify makes him easily the most selfish, self-loving and unsympathetic member of the clan. But sadly, his action doesn't ring true and that bothers me. Corinne, the loving wife and mother, is also ultimately a poorly drawn character. How can she be the novel's Mother Earth figure when she condones her husband's decision and yet carries on like she cares. Mike Junior - the hothead - is written out of the story early. Patrick, the angry intellectual and Mum's favourite, is unfortunately too introverted to stop the rot. He too flies the coop. Judd, the baby of the family, is such a feeble narrator we almost forget he's there. He flits in and out but never makes any impression on the reader. Marianne, the victim, is also a pale cardboard like character, a defiled Desdemona figure, if you like, but completely bloodless and uninteresting. How could she even stand to be with her parents after what they did to her ?Oates clearly has problems with characterisation. But that's not all. Her less than steady hand at plot development is also manifest in the final 100 pages or so when she decides to bring this overlong and tiresome novel to a hasty close by orchestrating an instant family reunion that has an air of falseness about it. A quick but shoddy wrap-up that like feels like an after thought.I also found Oates' prose suffocatingly longwinded and manic (in parts), especially the irritating asides in italics. Sorry, WWTM isn't an Oates novel I would recommend to anyone. She has written some wonderful thing before but this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaneys are a family worth reading about. The question is, how much of this book is actually about the Mulvaneys? The beginning draws us a terrific picture of how wonderful things were before &quot;it&quot; happened. The end tells of how great everything is after everything. The middle groans loud and long...slow and dreary. I walk away from this book thinking that I don't know the Mulvaneys at all. I can picture their farm and I have a crude map of their town, but the people are a little vague.The book was well written but the story was weak.I gave it three stars because it caused me to think, it fired some emotions, and I didn't stop reading it (if it's a 1 or a 2 you really should put it down).What makes a great book? A terrific tale. This one was not it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Having given up on several of Oates' books in the past because of the relentless gloom of the stories she was telling and/or the endless narration, I was dubious about &quot;Mulvaney's.&quot; But it was an Oprah Book Club selection and generally Oprah's picks are easy reads, quirky and usually uplifting. Yet I read negative review after negative review from Amazon readers. There was much complaint about how depressing the book was, how it rambled on and on with no obvious purpose. The reviews seemed to confirm my earlier impressions of Oates' books. However, I finally couldn't resist buying it. It wasn't quite as ponderous as some of Oates' books I had attempted earlier and the first few paragraphs were intriguing.Imagine my surprise when I found that I could hardly wait to get back to it every night. The criticisms of the family being too good to be true and then becoming too dysfunctional to be true seem to come from readers who missed the many clues that the Mulvaney's were not such a perfect family. That golden depiction of the early period was how the family seemed through the eyes of a child, a child who sees everything through the prism of innocence and wonder.The reaction of the parents and siblings to the family tragedy was not what we would like to see or idealistically what we think we should or would do. It very much parallels the end of childhood when innocence is lost. Life is not a warm and fuzzy, cute and quirky TV sitcom with predictable twists and turns.I found the evolution of the various members of the Mulvaney family to have the authority of what real life is like. We don't always -- heck, we don't usually choose the noble or sensible path. We are driven by strengths and weaknesses we are hardly aware of. Life is messy and confounding. Even the last chapter is believable because I have seen similar evolutions in my sixty-plus years of living in a family and being intimately involved with other families.Will life for the Mulvaneys after the reunion continue the happy promise of that 4th of July? Probably not. Life IS messy and unpredictable. In the world of grown-ups things do not always come out with the ends all neatly tied in a bow.&quot;We Were The Mulvaneys&quot; is one Joyce Carol Oates book I really enjoyed. Maybe I'll go back and take another look at the ones I didn't finish years ago."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is the first book I have read by this much-acclaimed author, and I was disappointed. I felt the book was padded with quite a lot of unnecessary exposition that slowed the story down considerably (how many times and in how much detail do I have to hear about the lavender color of the house?) I also felt that most, if not all, of the characters, pulled abrubt about-faces in the book with no plausible explanation whatsoever, most notably an apparently devoted mother and father banishing their own child for an act committed against him/her. Certainly I understood the stigma the author tried to attach to the incident, but I had a hard time believing that these two people, in the 1970's, (not the Victorian era, for goodness sake)would have rather never seen their child again than face the disapproval of their neighbors. Why the heck didn't they just move the whole family? And once the whole thing became irrelevant in their lives, why did they make no effort to patch things up with the child? Just didn't make sense to me, that two supposedly wonderful parents would turn into such monsters in the face of their child's pain. Also didn't believe in the saintliness of said child in never questioning or being angry at their actions. All three brothers seemed to go completely against their established character traits as well. Oates's point was obvious-that an incident such as what occured in the book changes the family and the individual dynamics forever, but she made her point, in my opinion, with all the sublety of a sledgehammer."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"At first I enjoyed the book a lot. It took me into a world of a beautiful farm and a beautiful farm family, far from suburban southern California where I live. However, after sticking through to the end, I felt I had wasted my time. Without giving away the ending too much, I have to say that I felt that the book was written in a formulaic Oprah-book style-- mean abusive men, women who are innocent and wronged greatly by the men. While great fiction gives us a view into the lives and struggles of others, this book failed in that I didn't feel that some of the characters and their reactions in the book were realistic-- would the mother really remain that clueless? Would the father have really been that heartless? Would a family in the late 70's in the United States really deal that badly with a rape in the family. I hated having my emotions drug through the mud over something that I felt was not very realistic. It was overall a very depressing book. I woke up the next morning after I finished feeling very, very depressed, and then realized that I had sort of a hangover from the book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I'm a medium-sized fan of Oates&#8212;American Appetites and Because it is Bitter, Because it is My Heart are favorites. But this saga misses the boat a bit. It never seems logical, or even probable that the father would exile his daughter for being raped. Though this book is set in the 1970s, it feels more like a 1950s morality tale. It takes that \\"things fall apart, the center cannot hold\\" thing too far, making a seemingly ideal family go from Leave it to Beaver perfection to the mean, wacked out folks they become due to one incident...terrible as it may have been. ... I kept reading and reading and was left dissapointed by the end. Like some romance novelist, Oates sews everything neatly up. If the Mulvaneys got that messed up by the earlier rape, they probably won't keep their stuff together either."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As an intelligent, successful and proud graduate of a New York State university, I was thoroughly insulted by Ms. Oates repeated and ignorant slams on New York State universities and colleges (and, indeed, state universities in general). Her only references to state universities were made in derogatory terms and applied only to characters who weren't all that bright or who admitted their attendance in an embarrassed manner. Her bright characters, of course, attended Ivy League schools. A writer of her stature should not have had to bow to such ignorant cliches. I was very disappointed and have discouraged many a person from honoring her degradation by reading her book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I just finished this book and it was a chore getting through. It took at least 100 pages for me to get interested in it and get used to Oates' writing style. The story itself was interesting and heartbreaking the way Marianne was treated by her parents. But I found Oates to be too wordy. She went into detail about every little thing and I found myself skipping paragraph after paragraph. I was not interested in what each clock in their house looked like or any of the other millions of details of objects that had little to do with the story.I also found it tedious reading a book with very little dialogue. And when there was dialogue, at times it was all contained in one huge paragraph. It was an accomplishment getting through a page due to her style of writing, even though I found the story itself to be interesting. At times it was hard to follow since she constantly went back and forth in time. I do not have any desire to read another book by Joyce Carol Oates. It's not the subject matter that I object to, it's her writing style."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oates is one my of my favorite authors; her talents for storytelling and in-depth characterization are irrefutable. But something is missing here. It wasn't very difficult to convince me that this family could have some serious flaws beneath the surface of the perfect family image; we all know people like this (maybe ourselves!). As I followed the deterioration of the Mulvaneys I knew that Michael Mulvaney would die a lonely death. Although it is uplifting for a story to have a happy ending, I was not prepared for the &quot;happily ever after&quot; reunion in the final pages of this novel. Marianne suffered from serious depression - how could the reader believe that she married, had children (uh,oh - SEX!)without aggressive pyschological help? Or are we just to assume she received treatment in the short pages between her meeting Whit West and the family reunion? Corinne was an emotional wreck whose deep faith failed her; Patrick and &quot;Mule&quot; and especially Judd were shallow characters at best. The only &quot;real&quot; character was Michael, seriously flawed, with a &quot;real&quot; illness, alcoholism, who met his demise sadly but realistically.It seems Oates ran out of steam at the end, but I enjoyed the book anyway."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"If you think this book will improve as you turn the pages, do yourself a favor and PUT IT DOWN NOW! I've read many, many books in my life and I have NEVER read such a dreary story; not dramatic, or tragic, or compelling, simply dreary. None of the characters seem to have any inner strength, you will wish you could go straight to High Point Farm and shake them all up! The prose is LENGTHY, to put it kindly, and trails off into unknown territory just when you think you might be getting somewhere! UGH. Unfortunately, it took me almost 300 pages to realize that the plot would not EVER take a turn for the better, and I felt compelled to stick it out. A complete waste of time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Ms. Oates has a deep seated contempt for the middle American family. With this story Oates expresses her contempt by concocting a family that for all their initial outward success cannot connect with, much less help, each other. The author believes that families cannot overcome obstacles and heal from their wounds. She depicts middle American families as jealous, competitive, and especially from a Mother to daughter, unloving."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"You need the stamina of a long-distance runner to get through this family saga. It never reveals too much about its members (excepting Patrick the middle son, the necessary black sheep) and wavers annoyingly from first person narration by youngest son Judd (who opens the story) to third person. The plot hinges on the rape of the Mulvaney's only daughter/sister and the murderous plot to avenge her, which keeps the reader interested (out of morbid curiosity in the lack of any higher motives) but even these are improbable. Why would a girl with two older brothers who grew up on a farm be so naive? Why would Patrick take so long to execute revenge? Patrick is the character we get closest to and he saves the story. What's missing here though are description, dialog and depth of character. We are left with the impression that the Mulvaney family isn't the smartest on the hill. I just read a playwright's lament that today \\"We need more drama that unpeels society, that roots through the cubbyholes to fetch us nuggets of human behaviour that opens our eyes a bit ... Not just the dark stuff - but wondrous fragments of ordinary people that can take our breath away.\\" We Were the Mulvaneys is yet another tale that falls short of the mark."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book crawled along at a snail's pace.

That was a first for me as I am an avid reader and usually enjoy Oprah's Book Club selections. This one, though, was really off the mark and very disappointing. The characters were never fully developed, the story line was way too draggy, tedious, and predictable and Ms. Oates' use of punctuation, especially her constant overuse of hyphenated adjectives, drove me NUTS! This is the first work of Joyce Carol Oates that I have read, and I must say I was quite surprised at her lack of ability to write a crisp, compelling story and her writing style in general seemed amateurish.

The first book that I read by Oates was FOXFIRE: Confessions of a Girl Gang. Tremendous book there, and I was impressed at the range of Oates's writing. I suppose that is why she is one of my favorite authors; she has such a range of style that is really quite unparalled today. Read this book and discover why she is one of the two greatest living writers on the planet. Nicholson Baker is the other. This book certainly did deserve the National Book Award.

It may have made some sense if it had taken place in the 20's or 30's but in the 70's women were no longer to be blamed!

The author gives no background or reason why the characters would act in such ridiculously stupid ways. Why would parents who loved their daughter treat her the way they did? Why did the incident with Marianne change her family so dramatically, and alter their personality? Is this book saying that all of us can become thoroughly despicable characters if a tragedy occurs in our lives? Or is it saying that these people were thoroughly dispicable from the beginning and we just didn't know it until the tragedy occurred? I kept reading the book hoping there would be some reason given for the actions of the family, but in the end there was none. There was just a sweet little family reunion where everyone was so, so happy again, like at the beginning of the book.

It is a classical tragedy in that the disintegration is largely due to the pride of the father; pride causes him to have undue satisfaction in his country club membership, and pride causes his subsequent failure to come to terms with his daughter's misfortune, or to adapt to a less successful role in the world, so that he falls farther than he should have. Fittingly, all the other family members achieve redemption, although one could argue that the happy ending is artificially grafted onto the body of the novel. I accept the happy ending, but I think Oates went overboard: did Mike Jr. have to somehow have earned a college degree, for example, and becoming a physical therapist, as Patrick does, also requires years of training. Oates draws significance out of the little details of everyday life, and vividly portrays several member of the family. Portraying Marianne, with her spirituality and reactions to hurt, was a special challenge, one Oates successfully meets; Marianne very slowly heals, until she is capable of marriage. I did not feel as comfortable with Patrick, but I do find him plausible. Oates' prose style is forceful, but sometimes borders on the overdone, and while I enjoyed the book, I could understand a reader who felt differently. Example of a sentence which works despite itself: \\"With that strange fated compulsion with which swirling water is drawn down a drain, each discrete molecule and atom seeming pressed for extinction, Marianne felt a wildness come over her\\"."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book should be listed as a modern American classic and Ms Oates as one of the finest contemporary writers of fiction. It is a superbly written piece that it going to keep me pondering and thinking for weeks to come.

I often had difficulty with the subject matter and frequently found myself responding in a negative , unrewarding way and that is not why I read novels. Ms. Oates is a consummate artist, a writer of very great skill, and a wonderful story-teller. &quot;The Mulvaneys&quot; is moving, warm, real, troubling and a pleasure to read. You can not read this book or any of her work if all you want to know is &quot;what happens next&quot;. Her prose is flawless and chock full of those things which make great prose. It is not realistic to expect every reader to like her work, she IS a challenge, but well worth the effort(if that's what it takes.) This would be a great first Oates to read, if you need an introduction. I am baffled, though, that Oprah took so many years to find this book. It was published 5 years ago. That is when I read it, and have been reading others by Ms Oates since. I do not like everything she writes, but you very well might. A whole lot of people do!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was held in thrall for most of this story but found the ending deeply unsatisfying and implausible. Innocent, lovely Marianne is twice a victim: once at the hands of her brutal attacker and again more devastatingly by her own parents, who send her into virtual exile following &quot;the incident&quot; of which no one in the family dares speak. After a period of twelve years Marianne is inexplicably welcomed back into the family fold; the reader is expected to accept not only this, but more unimaginably - that she would still want anything to do with these heartless, self-absorbed people. There is never any real attempt to explain the stunningly cruel behavior of Marianne's parents; instead Oates writes: &quot;In families, things just happen.&quot; It's almost as though the author lost interest and decided to wrap up a complex and riveting story with a few quick &quot;feel good&quot; chapters at the end and a ridiculous family reunion in which everything turns out hunky-dory.At times Oates displays an almost preternatural insight into the human psyche, particularly with her characterization of Patrick, Marianne's brilliant, rage-filled brother.

I lost interest in the characters and just didn't care much what happened because I was too bored by the time anything actually did. The writting was flat and did not hold my interest while waiting for something to happen. The family's behavior was just strange and unexplainable. It did not make sense why they would send their cherished daughter into exile in such a way as not to even seem to care of her exhistence or well being again. In fairness, if you enjoy very descriptive writing with a soft story of a family gone wrong, you might enjoy it. If you are looking for wit, something that can bring emotion (laughter and sadness-which I think could/should have been done here, it's a family after all meaning there are many facets to their lives, not just the boring, tragic and strange), then I would keep looking."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is definitely the worst Oprah book I've ever read.

I read the whole book because I hate not to finish something I've started, but it was dreadful and I hated every minute of it.

WE WERE THE MULVANEYS by Joyce Carol Oates is a story of a once-happy family that seemed to have it all, but slowly falls apart after a tumultuous incident occurs to one of the members of the family.The Mulvaneys are comprised of six persons: Michael Sr. is the head of the household, proud father and wonderful husband. He runs a roofing business in town, Mulvaney Roofing, which he is highly successful at. His wife, Corinne, holds down the fort, spreading love to all her children and to the love of her life. Her obsession over antiques adds to her other eccentric qualities, making her even more loveable. Mike Jr. is the oldest child, the all-around athlete and is very popular in school. Patrick is son number two, the one with the brains. He of all the children seems to be the one that likes to be alone the most and seems happiest with his thoughts and his books. Marianne is the only daughter of the family, the cheerleader type and all-around popular girl in school. Like her mother, she is a very devout Christian girl, and believes in the ideal of \\"turn the other cheek\\". Last but not least is Judd. He's the baby of the family and also the narrator of this long intense drama that tells the tragic story of their family.Life is grand for the Mulvaneys. Home life is one busy event after another, as they live on a farm where they each handle various chores. It's busy work from morning until night but it's rewarding. Everyone seems to be happy, and there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong. But, on Marianne's prom night, something does go wrong. And as much as she tries to hide this tragic incident that scars her for life, her family eventually finds out as well as the entire town.From this point on, life changes for the Mulvaneys. The disintegration of the family is slow but sure, and it is hard to believe how far they get from that happy family they used to be. Judd chronicles the story of their family in detail, focusing on various members at a time. The book can be difficult to read, as I found Oates' writing tedious at times. However, by the time I reached the last page, I saw where she was going with this story, and I am glad I read it. I don't recommend this book to everyone. It's not an easy book to read, but for those with the patience to get through it, they will be rewarded."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was torture to read and one of the worst I've endured in a while. This is because the book was well written but the story was just plain improbable. What happened to the daughter, Marianne, and how the family handled it was ridiculous. I mean, maybe if the story had been set in the Victorian Age--or even the 1950s. But by the late 1970s people understood rape. This was not a Puritanical time--far from it as I recall from my high school days. In fact, in the pre-AIDs late 1970s, early 1980s, sex was hardly taboo. Marianne's fate after the rape was discovered was completely unbelievable. No family who loved a child as much as they did her would have done that. The family was kooky but they seemed, in the beginning, to have a strong bond. Patrick's reaction was also annoying. Instead of throwing the rapist boyfriend into the bog, he should have gone home and thrown in his parents for being such idiots. I am sorry I wasted my time and money on this book that had so much potential but didn't even begin to deliver."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have never read anything by Joyce Carol Oates and was given this book as a gift. I admit to being impressed by Oates' dexterity with the scope and sprawl of the narrative and her capability to fully portray her character's lives and emotions. Oates has a peculiarly simplistic writing style that only serves to emphasize whatever emotion or situation she's trying to describe - her style makes the catastrophic events of the story seem evem more momentous when they finally occur.She is also one of a few authors that I've read that are capable of evoking palpable pity from the reader. Her characters are truly and fully formed in the sense that the reader is able to understand their great loves as well as their failures, and peer into their lives to see the course of their own destruction. This book is not easily dismissed as a family chronicle - it is a compelling investigation into the tenuous bonds that keep a family together, the complex relationships between family members, and, ultimately, the reasons behind the personal choices that each individual makes in the name of survival."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I had trouble figuring out where the story was going. Even up until the end I wasn't sure. It felt like the author couldn't decide which character to focus on, so she jumped around from one to another in abrupt transitions. I found the character of Marianne rather annoying. She came across as fragile and naive, a flighty and delicate thing who doesn't really understand the world and who carries the blame for everything that goes wrong in her life, including her rape. Overall, this was an okay story, but it seemed to lack direction and focus."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read this for a book group - and that's the only reason I managed to finish it. I was so annoyed by the parents in this story that I could hardly stand it! I understand that during this time period rape was more of an embarrassment to your family and that people were ashamed of it, but come on! I guess I just find it hard to believe that a mother would ship her daughter off without a word to anyone just to make her husband feel better because he doesn't have to see his daughter anymore. Honestly, Marianne was the only character I could relate to and the only character I wanted to come out of the whole mess intact. I think Judd was an inconsistent and unreliable narrator and, quite frankly, got a little annoying with all the \\"I just want to be part of the family\\" business at the beginning of the story. The ending was also a little too neat with an \\"everyone's okay and happy\\" scenario that was a little unbelieveable after seeing how these people treated each other through the rest of their lives together.I've always enjoyed reading Oates' writing, but this is one I would recommend not spending your time on."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Did you ever wonder how your family would cope with a personal disaster, like the death of a child or a serious disability of a parent? Or did you ever wonder what was actually happening within your neighbor's house, to the family that lived across the street, a family that seemed to the world to be doing just peachy? In &quot;We Were The Mulvaneys&quot; these issues and others are explored in the setting of a &quot;normal&quot; American family in small town upstate New York. We meet a blue-collar father eager to make the leap to country club respectability, a boisterous mother running a cameo antiques business and basking in the reflected light of her children's accomplishments. The children include the recently graduated high school football star, the intellectual science student and the popular and outgoing cheerleader. In material science you stress a metal in a measured fashion until it breaks; it is only in the breaking that you learn its strength and mallability. Joyce Carol Oates chooses the daughter's rape as the stressing event and the fourth son, a verbal boy in junior high, as the narrator. The plot unfolds slowly, sometimes too slowly, with interspersing &quot;family stories&quot; to absorb some of the shock of the events. The anecdotes give color, humor and realistic detail to the book, but render it harder to follow. We watch each character's respond to the event. The father's brawls with the high school rapist boy and his father, never gaining the satisfaction that he defended his daughter but instead being overwelmed by the feeling that the townspeople are withdrawing from and mocking him. The mother is at first clueless to her daughter's anguish and ultimately sends her away, blaming this poor victim for her father's delusions. The oldest brother leaves home to join the Msrines, the middle brother fixates on bringing justice to the family by punishing the rapist and the youngest brother is there to passively record all of this. These people, in their so-called family, are so self-centered that they can't communicate their feelings and are powerless to comfort the girl. There are several levels of tragedy in this book, as these people play out their characters, some growing to adapt to the events, others being destroyed, or worse yet not changing at all to them. One reeal tragedy is that the raped girl must wonder why her parents have withdrawn their love from her. There is an optimistic ending, but I was left wondering if the next generation of Mulvaneys will do any better when they are stressed by their life's catastrophies."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was shocked to see all the negative reviews of this book.

It will enrich your life."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"...because I really did enjoy the writing style of the author. But, my word, I was so irritated with the characters! I wanted to slap that mother and father silly for not supporting their daughter!!!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is indeed a wonderful writer - but even wonderful writers have their flaws.I found 'We Were the Mulvaneys' infuriating at times, especially the endless descriptions of the farm and the countless animals. (I wouldn't have minded picking Muffin up by the tail and flinging him out the window.) The sentimental details of life on High Point Farm were lovely, but would have been better in moderation.The male characters were very well drawn and they developed quite well as the book progressed, but Corrine and Marianne stayed exactly the same throughout the whole book. A rape victim who has been shunned by her family would not sail sweetly through life without bitterness or anger. Marianne is too much of a saint and should have had to learn a few lessons about being assertive before she found true happiness.Why was Patrick's girlfriend Katya featured so heavily during the last pages? Katya is a very minor character, and I wanted to know more about Marianne's resolutions with the family.Saying this, I still think that the book is worth reading, if only to learn a bit more about human nature."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Ms. Oates sets up a perfect American family--a slightly ditzy but loving and beloved mother, successful, robust, salesman-type father, an athletic son, a brainy son, a popular cheerleader daughter, and Judd, the baby of the family, who acts as narrator. The Mulvaneys live an idyllic life at High Point Farm in upstate New York. They are filled with love for each other, and blessedly sure that life will be good forever. Alas, it is not to be. Marianne, the much loved daughter, is the victim of a date rape. The family soon feels the whispers and scorn of the town. At this point her father feels he cannot bear the ostracization by his former friends, and the shame he feels his daughter has brought upon the family. He banishes her, sending her to live with a relative. His wife makes the decision to sacrifice her daughter, believing she will save her husband by doing so. The fortunes of the family change dramatically. The father descends into bankruptcy and drink, and the family is shattered beyond repair.I liked this book immensely, but the action of the mother in condoning the exile of her daughter in the belief that it would salvage her marriage really disturbed me. I had to stop reading for a while to calm down. Ms. Oates is a wonderful writer with a lot of insight into human emotions, but the dissolution of this ideal family is hard to accept. From the tenor of the reviews I have read on this site, people either loved or hated this book. All of Ms. Oates's irritating mannerisms are present. The exclamations!!! (The parentheses). &quot;The quotation marks&quot;. The italics (can't do those here!). That aside, I did truly admire this book. My one objection would be that the ending was too pat. It felt as if it was wrapped up too neatly. But it is well worth your time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is hauntingly familiar to Dreiser's &quot;An American Tragedy.&quot; Four children, their parents and a marriage are all sacrificed on the pyre of the parents' self-perceived image in the community and Joyce Carol Oates is an author who is powerful enough to make us feel their initial disbelief and subsequent pain following &quot;the incident.&quot; I found Michael Sr. to be the most dislikable character because he used the rape of his daughter to justify his own very despicable behavior when he was needed the most and the daughter to be the character most deserving of our compassion. This is a book that will make its readers take a good, hard look at the depth of their own meaningful relationships to see if they would survive a devestation of the magnitude suffered by the Mulvaneys. This book is about people who prefer to maintain appearances at all cost and the cost is, indeed, very dear."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am glad Oprah chose this book even after it was published in 1996. So many people give this book bad reviews because of what the mother does and how she behaves. I think this book is great because it is more realistic then people think. When something like rape happens to one person the entire family is affected. And no one knows how they would react unless it happens to you! This book takes the reader inside the minds of every family member and reveals the hurt and pain of real life. It isn't a novel where everything works out like a fairy tale. It reminds us that there is no perfect family--we all have trials and everyone will have something so devastating happen to them --something that will knock you to your knees. Do we not? This book is especially moving for those who have had an assault occur to someone in their family. The author is descriptive of the landscape and there are some strong words used at times. Don't let others reviews about the author being long winded turn you off to this book--I think many people today want quick and easy page turners That is what televsion has done--be patient with the author--you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Yes, this book deals with tough topics. Yes, it is at times sad, depressing and traumatic. And yes, not every character deals with these issues in an heroic manner. But that is life. Not everyone deals with life's challenges with the grit and stamina we want from our heros. What makes Joyce Carol Oates' work outstanding are her characters and how she invites us into their lives. We were with the Mulvaneys during their good times and their bad. As we read the book, we became a part of their lives as they became a part of ours. Just as if they were a part of our real family, we may not like the choices they make. When finishing a novel by JCO, we miss the characters; we miss having them around, engaging with them. That is her true gift. She writes a story with which we may agree or not. But she introduces us to people we will simply never forget. It has been a good year since I read &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; and I miss them very much."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As soon as I began reading this book I already knew it was going to be too &quot;wordy&quot;. The beginning described in minute detail the landscape surrounding the Mulvaney home. In my humble opinion only a very few authors can get away with such detail without completely boring their reader.Despite that, I kept reading the book and have to say that I finished it. The fact that I finished it was a miracle because I couldn't wait for it to end since at every reading session I became exhausted of the re-iteration of storyline. However, having finished the book despite my frustrations with it says much about the story at hand. If you want a family story that portrays the good stuff as well as shows the bad stuff, this is the book for you. Plus, this is a book we can all relate to. However, as I've said, it dragged on a bit too much for me.In short, it is a great story of a very interesting and familiar-like family, but much too drawn out. I would have LOVED it if it were 200 pages shorter."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As an author with my debut novel in initial release, I genuinely admire the works of Joyce Carol Oates in general and her novel WE WERE THE MULVANEYS in particular. In this novel, Ms. Oates takes an seemingly ideal American family and forces them to confront disaster. When WE WERE THE MULVANEYS opens, all is well in this Garden of Eden. After decades of marriage, the elder Mulvaneys are still deeply in love. They have three children--an admired valedictorian, a star athlete, and a popular cheerleader. Then a date rape occurs, and disaster begins to spiral out of control. Ms. Oates paces her plot well. Her characters are perfectly rendered. Her fiction seems real. A great book, exactly what we have grown to expect from Joyce Carol Oates."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I had great expectations for this book. And perhaps my strong reaction to it it the result of Oates excellent writing skills. The book is well written, the story interesting, as well as the prose. However, I became very frustrated with some of the characters. Especially the mother, who in my opinion, is only a strong, loving woman, when all things are wonderful with her man. When the going got tough, she simply got rid of the evidence-in this case a human being, her own daughter (who needed her mother to help her through a crisis in her life but was sent away).I don't often read books more than once, but I will read this one again - now aware of what I am getting into, perhaps I will get more than frustration out of it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were the Mulvaneys takes the reader from one extreme to another starting with an unrealistically happy family environment and unfolding into a mystifiying series of dysfunction. The ride might have been enjoyable if the characters motivaitons were clear and there was connectedness between their thoughts and actions. Too many of the character's responses were unbelievable and unsound. More than one character possessed a perfect, God-like disposition that after misfortune turned into a violent, uncapable, dispictable person.Oates has a fascinating ability to create warmth in her book. The characters and their relationships were initially provoking. Her descriptions the environment felt like a cozy, warm fire. The plot however was unsettling in topic and disjointed in outcome."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Completely enjoyed this book. Compelling &amp; tragic. Gets you from the beginning and you just want to know all about the Mulvaneys."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Although I found the story to be heavily (almost overly) detailed and full of flashbacks, I appreciated the way that Oates allowed the reader to get to know each character intimately. How sad that a family so close and seemingly unbreakable could let tragedy stand in the way of strength and healing. Any book that makes me want to jump inside the pages and react to a character or situation -- have my say, punch them out, hug them, tell them they are wrong -- is a book that has heart. Throughout the book I felt a closeness to Judd -- the baby of the family -- as I am. His eagerness for information and acceptance touched me. I felt sympathy for Marianne, although she certainly didn't ask for it. Corrine and Michael Sr. were a mixed bag -- if only they could have be realistic in their expectations of child-rearing and life in general! Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a story -- but not to anyone looking for immediate fictional gratification."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As a member of the graduating class of 1976 (like Patrick Mulvaney) I feel that this story brilliantly portrays characters of that &quot;era&quot;, as well as prevalent attitudes of society in general during the 70's and 80's. The Mulvaney's inability to cope with the tragedies which befall them, and their tendency to &quot;sweep it under the rug&quot; was so typical then. I am grateful that our society now is much more open and supportive of those whose lives are touched by such grievous problems as rape and alcoholism. I loved this book, and recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was very touching. It captivated me throughout and it kept me at the edge of my seat wanting vendication for &quot;Button&quot; Mulvaney the victim in this story. However, the whole family was victimized by cruelty and shame. This book is about how easily a single event can have catastrophic effects on a family even one that is seemingly close. You will cry, laugh and cry again in this book and the ending will offer some comfort but will leave you with a lasting awe for the strength and fragility of family."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"What a tragic story this was. . . not to say I didn't enjoy it, I did very much. I do wish though, that Ms Oates had enlightened us a bit more on what Mike Sr. was truly feeling, I would've enjoyed some of his internal dialogue to maybe give me a better idea on what he was feeling. For a father to completely shut down like that and refuse to see his daughter, I wanted to delve into his mind. I've read several books by this author and have tremendous respect &amp; admiration for her talent. Here she explores family relations with a keen eye for the mundane trials and tribulations of family life. All in all I would recommend this book, it was an enjoyable read and the characters were well developed."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"First of all I like JCO's writing, but this book stunned me with its characters, all of whom seem to make the most horrible decisions in life. I was frustrated and angry with every single one of them all through the book. I cannot believe that people would respond in this manner to the ordeal of the daughter. I am sad to finish many books because I know that I will miss the characters that I have just spent hours with. When I finished this book I had a different feeling. I said good riddance to all of them."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates, one of the most prolific authors to date, has painted the picture of a storybook world gone terribly wrong. Her devotion to the true feeling and emotion of each of the Mulvaneys lends an aire of authenticity and truth to this story that would otherwise not be present. Marianne Mulvaney's struggle into womanhood and her heartwrenching emotion over a family lost depict a tale of so many young girls - of so many families - and provide the book with the ability to resonate with so many people today.READ It! This is one of the best books I have ever read! Emotional, endearing, and unique. Joyce Carol Oates has outdone herself this time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This story says a lot about the unfairness and cruelty that one can come across in life. It also shows how bravery and love can pull one through and allow us to come through these difficult times stronger and better than ever.When we first meet the Mulvaney's, the patriarch of the family, Mike, seems bigger than life and capable of great love for his family. When the going gets tough, however, we discover that he is a true coward and that his love for his family only lasts as long as their perfect image reflects well on himself. Once that image is shattered he quickly abandons them, first emotionally then physically.It is Corinne, the mother of this broken clan, that emerges as the hero of the story. Through all of the struggles her faith and her love for her family (including her now worthless husband) remains true. As each of the children emerges into adulthood, they begin to realize this and it is this realization that allows the survivors to meet at the end and accept each other."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"A big, sprawling book that could've used the services of a good editor (Are there any left? Should Oates join a writing group?). There were redundancies (rather than the lit technique of repetition) and so much \\"extra\\" prose that could've been cut away, tightened, replaced w/ something stronger, more effective.The Mulvaney's themselves were a largely humorless, self-absorbed lot that could've been on a dull Jerry Springer episode. & the mother & father (Michael, Sr. & Connie) lacked depth--1 dimensional or \\"flat\\" characters, to use Forster's term (Connie approached 2 dimensions at times; maybe 1 & a half . . .). Which arguably, might've been the author's choice, but it was such a long book & they were seemingly central characters, why not take the time to develop them?All in all, the novel suffered from a common trait in today's \\"literary\\" fiction--a decided lack of any humor w/ the resultant tendency for the story to take itself too damned seriously; which is probably meant to be taken as earnest, introspective & \\"deep.\\" In the end, the only thing that separates it from a Springer episode is that it's less carnivalesque: the characters far too literary to suffer from common people's banal defects. Which ultimately equates to boring (there were a few interesting characters but all peripheral--the vet, Wit, & the poetess, Halstrom, are 2 that come to mind).

They were the envy of all that knew them. The sucessful busines-man Father, the doting Mother, three sons and a beautiful daughter. There would be a single event that would blow the family apart. It's a study of how a snowball turned into an avalanche, one secret led to another, and another, and how each family member dealt with the incident that changed their family for ever. This book was long but worth the endeavor."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. After reading Blonde, also by Joyce Carol Oates, I had expected this book to be like Blonde--racier, more risque I suppose. However, We Were the Mulvaneys was more of a family saga that really dove into what made the members of the Mulvaney family tick. What had appeared to be a perfect family was not strong enough to withstand the rape of Marianne, which leads us to discover all the things that really go on inside the heads of the Mulvaneys. An enjoyable read that you don't have to think too hard for, but a lot above cheap romance novels!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I just finished \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" tonight and I have to say it was a truly amazing piece of work. Joyce Carol Oates weaves so many different aspects into the story of the perfect family that falls to ruin after their daughter is raped at a party. This is a very, very detailed book. You learn about each and every family member in a very distinctive way. I think this is necessary to make you understand how such a family could be changed forever. It gives you the image of High Gate farm and the Mulvaney's to make you understand how and why they acted the way they did.Mr. Mulvaney behaved atrociously in his complete dissociation from his daughter. Marianne had been the perfect daughter - a cheerleader, a Christian and a good girl who makes the mistake of drinking too much one night. There is a part in the book where it describes how Corinne and Mike (the parents) met. This to me was a clue to how he felt about his daughter after the rape. It was where he had said women were supposed to be morally superior to men. I think Mike not only couldn't deal with his daughter's pain and his inability to protect her but at the same time, he looked down on her too.The rest of the characters are detailed well except for Mike Jr who I thought was kind of put in the background and not developed as well. I thought this book to be believable. Even the bad reactions didn't surprise as Marianne Mulvaney seemed to be prized on her good qualities but not seen fully by her family as anything other than a perfect daughter and sister. It also shows how one incident can change our lives forever.It has a happy ending in a way. However, this book really broke my heart when I read it. I felt so much sadness for Marianne that it depressed me as well as lifted me up at the end. Even though it ends good, it doesn't detract from the years lost in separation. However, it shows that life does go on.A brilliant novel and a difficult read. It brings out all the emotions. Beautiful!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is a very good book about how deeply a family can be hurt by the actions of one bad person. We all know that rape hurts a victim and can scar them for a very long time (if not all their life) but not many think beyond that. What that sort of horrible thing can do to an entire family (brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents) is beyond most peoples comprehension. And then there was WE WERE THE MULVANEYS.The Good: You become attatched to the characters, especially Mary Ann. When the book was over, I wanted to know about what happened to her later on in her life. The characters really come to life. I also like the fact that the bad guy pays, even though I would have liked to seen more done (brutal, I know, but he deserves it!)The Bad: I wanted to hear more about Mary Anns marriage in the end.The Ugly: There are some very off the wall comments made every so often that are in italics that really interupt the flow of the book. That part just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"When I read the back cover of this book, It sounded like it was going to one I could not put down. While the story line is good, every little detail is described, did I really need directions to the farm?! Also I wish I could have gotten to know the characters better, they were not described very well, except for the father, he seemed to be obsessed with what other people thought about him, and We never really found out why this was.I wish the kids lives were better explained. How deeply hurt and terrorized the daughter was after the crime was committed on her, and more about how the brothers felt. An OK read if you can get by all the fluff."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book has all of the tools it needs, yet somehow it doesn't quite get there in the end. The Mulvaneys are a lovely family that descends into madness when the only Mulvaney daughter is raped. The narrative and explanation about this descent is compelling and gripping, and the characters invoke sympathy and affection. Through this narrative, Ms. Oates effectively weaves themes of evolution and religion as reflective of humanity's moral failures and successes. After thoroughly explaining the family's descent with an excruciating attention detail and development of characters though 350 pages,Ms. Oates takes the family from complete destruction to total reconicilliation in the remaining 20 pages of the book. The theme, the direction and the author's message are lost in this simplistic conclusion, so that the reader is left with nothing to show for 400 pages worth of reading.

This story is partially told from the view of the youngest son and partially from the third person which can be confusing at times and I felt I never gained any compelling insight from the sons view so why bother? I'm sure there was major symbolism going on here but this book was so boring I didn't even bother to think about it.The characters were never fully developed so I found it hard to really like any of them and it seemed when the author did start to go into some character depth she'd go off into some small inconsequential detail that had nothing what so ever to do with the rest of the story. I have to admit this book was taking me so long to read and it was so horrible that I skimmed the last hundred or so pages just to be done with it.

Within an hour of reading, I had made it to the middle of the book. I hate overused descriptions so I skim through them. I skimmed so much that I almost had the book done when I couldn't tolerate it anymore. The story has been done better by more and has come to the point it is overdone. I sold it in our garage sale for 50 cents. I lost an hour of time but I didn't lose any money. I will not be reading this author again."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I got to the third chapter and gave up. This was way to lenghty with detail of things that I could understand wher the author was going with this. I was recommended this novel with a warning that it was a tradgic story. Since I enjoy reading heavy conflict, and coupled with it being an Oprah pick, I thought for sure this would grab me. But it didn't. I would recommend this to those who don't mind reading multiple pages on dear, etc. Otherwise, skip it for a more enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was so ridiculous and uninteresting, I couldn't even believe it. All of the characters were greatly underdeveloped, and while Oates attempted to tell this &quot;story&quot; from the perspective of the youngest Mulvaney, she failed terribly. This book is supposed to be the youngest boy's attempt at writing the history of his family. However, within the first twenty pages the one and only conflict for the Mulvaneys begins, yet Oates totally underdevelops everything and makes everything just plain uninteresting. There was truly nothing tragic about this book except for the fact that it was published and hyped up by Oprah to make it worse. Take my advice and do not waste any money on this book -- if you're that curious, go to the library, I'm sure they'll have a ton available."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Even more importantly, why did someone make a tv movie off it? This family appears to be close-knit, loving, and rich in faith but a catastrophe - when the daughter is brutally raped - tears it all apart. The father becomes hateful, abusive, and cold, the mother wrings her hands and cries but stands by and lets her daughter be victimized yet again. How can any reader have sympathy for \\"parents\\" like this who are anything but loving? This \\"loving\\" family punishes the victim. I had no sympathy whatsoever for these characters and found myself hoping the dad would get offed and mom too for her spineless lack of mothering when her child needed it most. The author's purple prose detracts from the story as well. Can't recommend this one at all."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I started this book with high hopes, which were dashed all too soon due to impenetrable prose, thin images, and sloppy meandering.

I will concede she may be a gifted story-teller. There is a big difference.For many years, I had promised myself to read a Joyce Carol Oates book. Finally, with great anticipation, I purchased We Were The Mulvaneys. I was immediately shocked by the writing itself. Some reviewers have described this book as a \\"tedious read\\". It is easy to understand why. Ms Oates seems to prefer fragments to complete sentences. Her punctuation or lack thereof is atrocious. She switches readily between third and first person and, even once in the same paragraph, to second person. I wondered, \\"where did this narrator come from?\\" There is too much narrative that is inane and pointless. There is much that is redundant. She does not segregate dialogue; I read a one-page-long paragraph where three people spoke back and forth to each other, often within the same sentence with no separation of characters for the reader.This novel is a drawn-out saga of the Mulvaney family, husband, wife, three sons and a daughter. I found the father despicable (with no redeeming qualities - a fatal flaw in developing your villians). The wife, Corinne, behaves shockingly when her daughter is \\"hurt\\". The children seemed to be the only normal people, and two of them are slightly questionable in my mind. The story was engaging, but the writing came close to delivering a death blow. I did finish the book, determined to see if it would improve. It did not. I won't be reading Joyce Carol Oates again. As always, I continue to be astonished by such authors who become famous while other really good writers languish.Gore Vidal was often quoted saying the three saddest words in the English language are Joyce Carol Oates.

This one begins with a \\"happy\\" family, drops into a deep chasm, and for those who survive, ends in an epilogue that is over-the-top happy. A celebration on the Fourth of July has all the giddiness that comes with too much sugar, excitement, and fireworks.Still, it's a troubling book. I can't forgive the Mulvaney parents (I'm a parent and a grandparent) for, instead of supporting Marianne, their raped daughter, sending her away, and having little to do with her for years. The scene at her father's bedside when he is dying and wants to see Marianne, so she drives madly there to see him, seems a bit contrived. She's still saying, \\"I'm sorry.\\" For what? Has she never learned that she isn't to blame for anything that happened and that her parents basically abandoned her at her time of greatest need?Decisions have their consequences. The father of the clan loses his business, his home, and finally his life while the rest of the family eventually nurse themselves into reasonably healthy, well-adjusted people.

For whatever reason, I put off reading anything that she had written. Then one day, in a used bookstore in Murphys CA, I decided to give her a try. I read over the dust jackets of many of her novels and this seemed to be the most interesting and one of the best received by her fans. However, in reading it, I never found myself much invested in the characters, the plot was sort of meandering and the setting not all that exciting.

It shows how societal expectations, coupled with status, play a factor in the disunity and eventual demise of a family, hence the word 'were' in the title. It is a tragic injustice to a young rape victim who has only one person, a brother who stands with her, though silently except for one action."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"So many people want a happy ending. But, unfortunately, life doesn't always give us what we want; many times what we deserve, but not want. This book is a prime example of just that. A too good to be true type of family is hit with a megadose of reality when their perfect world is shattered by their daughter's assault after her prom. Their inability to deal with the circumstances and choice to keep their pain within themselves, individually and collectively, ultimately destroys their world.The characters are well developed and I felt the book clipped along at a decent pace. The bouncing back and forth between characters and their thoughts, feelings, and actions were indicative of the scattered thoughts we all feel when bombarded with family tragedy. Persons who aren't afraid of pain, of passion, or circumstances less than ideal will enjoy this book. It drives home the notion that your world can change within a heartbeat. If you can't adjust and adapt, you can destroy yourself and everything you've come to know and understand."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Although this story deserves to be told, it could have been told just as well with half the words.

We were the Mulvaneys.In this book, an all American family has to deal with tragedy when their daughter is raped. The book centers around them trying to come back together, after falling apart. For me, the book seemed a bit long and drawn out. The story line was great, but there were times when I found myself bored and uninterested in the dialogue that got away from the storyline. The characters were well developed and the book certainly meets the criteria of &quot;families in crisis.&quot; Some of the actions of the parents seemed unreasonable to me, and I could not imagine a parent reacting the way these parents did, but then I have never been in their situation. I would hope that my husband and I would have a very different reaction to this situation in our family. I can't imagine parents being able to send their child away, have no contact with them, and go on with life. Although their life was certainly effected, they did not try to deal with the situation, but rather simply tried to forget it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Very enjoyable read.

It is about the nature of humanity. It is about coping and forgiving. It clearly illustrates that a happy ending is a matter of perspective; that our perception of LIFE itself is totally a matter of perspective.If you like to get *into* the characters in the books you read, you'll love this book. Character development is very deep and each character becomes real during the reading and long after."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was so disappointed in this book! Reading generally brings me great relaxation, but not with this book. I could not believe how the case of rape was handled and how the rapist was dealt with. This book is 450 pages long and could be 200. The author went on and on about trivial things. I continued to read the book thinking it would get better, but it never did.

I can't put my finger on what I didn't like about it. I was always interested, but not passionate about it. Does that make any sense at all? I'd still suggest that people read it, but be prepared for a bumpy ride."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I've never been a fan of the author's writing style, and since I've enjoyed most of the books on Oprah's list so I decided to read this book. I like a story that gets to the point, but Oates tangles the story up in needless details on every page. When a character enters the barn, you have to wade through three pages about when the barn was built and what the mother has stored in it since she got into antiques and how a child got to bid on a termite-infested rocking horse in an auction. Details are important to a story. There have to be enough to visualize the place and people and to believe the plot. I found none of these in this story.The Mulvaneys own beautiful acreage called High Point Farm. The father has a prosperous business, the parents are well respected, members of the Country Club and solid citizens. Their four children are nothing short of perfect. The oldest is the star football player, the next excels in academics, and the daughter is popular enough to be a prom princess and a cheerleader. The youngest child is Judd, the primary voice in the story. It is through 14-year-old Judd's eyes that we most clearly see the family blown apart when his sister, Marianne, is raped the night of the school prom. From that moment forward, the Mulvaneys seem to be caught in a whirlpool of pain, exile, and misery that ends only after a tragedy occurs.Michael Mulvaney senior is unable to cope with the rape of his daughter and unable to control his rage and depression over her unwillingness to press charges. She is sent away to live with a relative because he can't stand to look at her. One by one the other children move out or on to college, all internalizing the anger their father felt.The story is a moving one. The characters are interesting and three dimensional if somewhat off balance and in serious need of counseling. If Oates could just control the need to provide so much unnecessary detail, the story would flow better and the reader be more willing to read to the end."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"A powerful book with so many layers and deep storylines. It's a great work by a WONDERFUL author. I love Joyce Carol Oates and I really enjoyed this book. It's a departure from some of the other books of hers that I've read, and I really thought she tackled this story and subject matter with dignity and emotion. Her characters are deep and with many layers and faces. This book holds your attention and is a really great piece of fiction."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Although the story is captivating, it just takes forever for Ms. Oates to tell it. The reader ends up knowing more detail about the characters than they probably know about themselves. After wading through it all, the ending is rather rushed and disappointing."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was probably one of the worst books I've read, ever. I picked up this book on a thrift store shelf for 2 bucks and I'd like my two bucks back. In fact I never finished the book because I've just got only so much time in my life and I don't need to waste it reading overly sensitive, moralistic, white bread drivel.It was on the Oprah's list! So what does this say about Oprah?The book opens up on a scene set in Michigan in the seventies, a large white family whose papa works as a roofer and mama stays home to be the fulltime mom to a gaggle of kids. On a roofer's wages in a small podunk town, somehow they manage to hold onto a farm with all the nostalgic accoutrements; horses, chickens and the big old victorian house. Welcome to the Waltons in print.The characters are developed like cardboard cut-outs, with apparently no more thought to developing them into believable, full-fledged things representing humans than say, someone writing ad copy for a grocery store circular. Based on stereotypes that could choke a hard-boiled wingnut, one reads every page anticipating that possibly, we'll get rewarded on the turn of the next, for our hard work plowing through the flat, boring constructions to find something real on the other side. But that never occurs. Mom is ever-self effacing, fragile and foolish, so is the only daughter, whose loss of innocence destroys the family.Oates worries incessantly about the males in her story, attempting to show us how the moral soiling of a female ruins to the poor menfolk too. The women take a backseat and unbelievably, in Oates' world, this doesn't bother them a bit. Instead they stand in the background and allow their menfolks to shine while they flitter in the light of the moon. Often I had to put the book down lest I scream for reading one more passage about the delicate paper thin white skin of the mother or the daughter; their skinny appearance showing self sacrifice. She even had repeated references to both women denying themselves food! Good God! Did anyone tell this woman we already have a ton of middle class white girls starving themselves to death to meet this foolish ideal of angelity? Take this for instance, \\"her hair cut cruelly short, face waxy-pale and mouth slack, so without experession, in the daze of sleep, he hadn't recognized her. She looked so young, so-- childlike.\\"So all you big girls, loud mouthed girls, dark colored girls, strong girls, look out because you are not getting any empathy from Ms. Oates, in fact in her world you don't even exist, lest possibly you trample her flailing, delicate female fairies.Then of course, if you've lived your life anywhere outside Cornell university, you might not be so bought into the idea that a roofing contractor in a small town could make enough money to join a local country club -- or more accurately, that if he did, he would be able to make that class transference so easily. Only in the lala land of the conservative white middle class brain does such a mythology still achieve any serious consideration. I'm sure Oates sold well by stoking the fertile fantasies of the striving middle class with that theme.Oh and the dialogue! The descriptors. I grew up in the seventies, I grew up in the Midwest. I'll tell you right now that no teenager in their right mind that didn't grow up in a closet talked like this, \\"I shan't...\\" Shan't? Of course whatever she shan't do or say usually is followed with a long descriptor of her feminine duty to sacrifice without complaint, such as numerous scenes where either women jump up to serve immediately, always self deprecating and always fragile, with hollowed out, sunken eyes we're told, (again) paper thin white skin and fluttering fingers through thin, frazzled hair apparently reflecting over-wrought fragile minds of these martyrs to the feminine cause.The males, the father and the three brothers of course are the doers. They represent the rescuers, the strong ones, the ones given to flights of anger or self serving hedonistic pleasure; but they are men and the women not only tolerate such but in the world of the Mulvaneys, the women seem completely oblivious to what they are missing.Couple all the Hallmark card sentimentality with its glitter coated one dimensionality for popular consumption, with horrendously long, drawn out and uninteresting descriptors. I don't give a damn if a character wore \\"a silk polka-dot dress that fitted her loosely, marble-sized red dots on a white background; the bodice was a mass of buttons...\\" So what? The descriptors of what people wore were like reading a Sears catalog and what relevance this ever had on the plot, one can never know. Is it more relevant that the protagonist wore red pumps with a 5\\" heel or blue open toed sandals with a 3\\" heel? A nubby, chunky sweater or a tight cowl-neck green one? Smooth slacks with an elastic waist or rumpled jeans?In addition, the moralizing. Mom sang hymns while she worked, daughter quoted the bible endlessly, one son quotes the bible as well and listens to classical music, finding the popular band Plaistica, nauseating and the hoaorish behavior of his college chums equally nauseating. And he fits in a university atmosphere and peerage? Really? Maybe I'm just sheltered in this, but I thought college kids demand as much or more conformity of eachother than even junior high schoolers.But the moralizing, the religion, the assumption of the author that Christian values permeate through every decent family and thus are assumed. This is given strength by the college attending boy (because the women don't have or acquire or value education and nor does the author apparently wish to give them chance to get one) who gets all tied up in a moral knot about questions of evolution when studying biology. This is taken seriously and the doubting professor is the one described as the cruel, clueless, rigid restriction against the free thinking pro-creationist.I could go on, but I'll quit here only with the thought that if I had known such low quality writing could make one a good living, I'd have gotten started on this track years ago. Oates apparently churns out the popular white bread for an audience to believe in weak women, strong men and a big man flying in the sky to protect them all and everything that is right pretty regularly. Hell, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? We can see Oates isn't working for the Pulitzer but is paying the bills. I guess we're not all out to save the world.Now I admit, I didn't finish the book. Like I said at the beginning of this screed, I just couldn't. I've got better things to do. Sorry, its not my job to make an author's creation justify my time, its the other way around; the author has an obligation to keep me wanting to read that book, to keep me enthralled enough to find out what's going on next. But when it takes two pages for a character to answer a ringing phone, or trudging through insufferably simplistic and moralistic scenarios, enough is enough.A person can only wade through a swamp so long before realizing, there's really nothing to see on the other side to make the effort worth it. As a lover and collector of books, I must say that my conscience is clear about my plan to consign the volume I purchased to the recycling bin, in the hope that its pages will be reincarnated into something more useful to human kind, like say toilet paper."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaney family is deeply admired. Wife and mother, Corrine, is viewed as the ideal wife of Michael, Sr., successful owner of a roofing business. Corrine is a loving mother to their 4 nearly grown children, 3 boys and a girl. Suddenly a very disturbing event strikes the Mulvaney family: the cheerleader daughter, Marianne, is raped at a school dance by the son of another prominent family. Marianne is branded a liar and trouble maker by the perpetrator's family and Michael, Sr., embarrassed by the stigma of the incident, has Marianne sent away, exiled. The Mulvaneys are vitually ripped apart; they take sides for and against Marianne...one of the Mulvaney boys seeks revenge against the perpetrator. Some of the most terrifying parts of the book concerns the brother's steadfast search for justice for the unfortunate sister.I developed a deep admiration for Marianne's efforts to deal with her suffering and get along with her life. Marianne sacrifices her education and dedicates herself to her work, and eventually, in her efforts to care for sick and neglected pets at an animal hospital.Ms. Oates is an excellent writer; she fastidiously delves into the personalities of each of the Mulvaneys. I get to know them as people. Michael, Sr., for example, is a deeply flawed as the result of alcoholism and other psychological and physical problems. However, I never found the book boring or tedious to read. My only problem with the book is the author's attempt to tie everything together too nicely and too neatly by its end. Also, Ms. Oates's tends to mire the plot in sentimentality. She also lets the father get off the hook too easily regarding his horrible attitude toward his daughter. I just could not buy that \\"it was just something that happened...and \\"no one knows how to fix it.\\""},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I picked up a copy of this book at a library sale before I knew it was an Oprah book. I tend to avoid the Oprah books because I find them preachy (though I admittedly read and enjoyed several of them before they were Oprah books.) Though this wasn't preachy, it seemed to me a less interesting and far less funny version of David James Duncan's brilliant study of family (in pretty much the same time period) 'The Brothers K.' It wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't really that good. It was often disengaging, which made it tedious. There are far better works to spend 450 pages reading."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed We Were the Mulvaneys.

Disfunctional families, etc. And how it can all come back together. I cried at times reading this book. The sadness carried over until Oates brought everyone together in the end. I saw the Movie, which was not too bad as movies go. JC Oates is a great writer, and I think this is one of her best for the masses.

I typically do not like heavy description in fiction, but I actually found myself enthralled with the scenery and characterization because it was just so enjoyable to hear the words Oates put together.If you are the type of person who gets excited over well-written sentences (a fellow former English Major or language-loving dork, like me), this is a great book for you."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"In the very fist line of Joyce Carol Oates's \\"We were the Mulvaneys\\" a statement and a question are made. What is stated is something that will be dealt with throughout the whole novel, but the question cannot be answered right away. However the answer will be a huge \`yes' once you have finished the novel.The first line of the novel reads \\"We were the Mulvaneys, remember us?\\" By beginning with such device, Oates, skilled as she is, immediately immerses he reader in the in that family's universe. The voice of her narrator is so powerful, that from the beginning one may be afraid of saying no. This narrator is the youngest Mulvaney, Judd, who sees his family falling apart after the so-called rape of his sister. However young he is, he has such a sense of persuasion that we almost take for granted what he says.However, as the plot unfolds, one notices that he is still a child and is trying to cope with the destruction of the institution in which he trusted, which is his family. As lost as he is, he seeks for help from every member, but everyone is so immersed in his/her own problems that the boy finds no comfort.In her faulkneresk novel, Oates shows the importance of the ties that bound us together with our parents and siblings. Her plots resonates one of the best novels written in English, \\"The Sound and the Fury\\", and, although she may have been inspired by Faulkner, she still has her own talent and approach. And these qualities are what make this novel so strong and unique.There is no doubt that Oates is one of the best writers of her generation. She has a special eye for society --and what backs it up, i.e. family-- that is changing. And with \\"We were the Mulvaneys\\" she discusses pertinent subjects. Society is changing because of families --or the other way round? This is not an easy question to answer, and the novel doesn't try to. What Oates does with her powerful writing is to point out that things are changing and we can only accept it --or not."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Think you have the perfect American family? Honestly, how strong is it and where does it unravel? Joyce Carol Oates answers that question in this riveting book about the impact of a violent crime on what was thought to be the perfect family.First off, I should explain that this isn't a light read that will put a smile on your face. While the ending provides a little ray of positive hope, you are dealing with a story that spends a lot of time on how people hurt each other. The physical victim of crime is only the first person to feel pain. The impacts can then cascade to others and as a reader of this book, you will feel some of that pain.Recently there have been a few other books that have explored this topic in different ways. The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is one example and Donna Tartt's new book, The Little Friend reminds me of this book too.What makes this book memorable is Oates'writing. I've found that people either love her work or hate it with a passion. Count me as a fan. I'll admit that she could be more concise and she rarely writes anything too light and refreshing, but she never fails to elicit my emotions. In many cases, they are feelings that don't make me all that comfortable but they do make me think.This book is worth reading although it will upset and sadden you. It's worth reading because you will react and you will examine a number of very important issues."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"While the actions of the father in this novel may seem bizarre by today's standards, the time in which the story takes place was one in which very different attitudes prevailed. Generally, I appreciate vivid and detailed description in literature, but in this case, I do feel Oates takes it to an extreme for many readers. On the other hand, it is up to the reader to decide whether or not to read every single word or to pass by the descriptive pages that are not immediately essential to the understanding of the story and the motivations of the characters. The value of this book is totally in the eyes of the reader and his or her ability to identify with the characters on any level. My response to this novel was mixed. I found much of it too predictable. The author gave some things away that could have been foreshadowed more subtly."},{"Title":"Rhythms of Peace","review":"The decision to purchase this CD was promted by my having had the opportunity to experience this artist live one evening during the time of H.H. the Dalai Lama's recent visit to Los Angeles, June 2000.

This is especially useful to the uninitiated in that it gives an excellent overview of 3d in general independant of the any particular software.There's good stuff here for anyone from the merely curious to the professional."},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"Computer graphics and animation expert Mark Giambruno draws upon the experiences of working professionals about the technology shared through insightful interviews in 3D Graphics &amp; Animation. Offering the novice strong and &quot;user friendly&quot; presentation of information needed by those just learning the 3D area and those who are trying to enter the 3D market, this updated and expanded second edition of 3D Graphics &amp; Animation builds on the well-received segments of the first edition to cover the basics of 3D in general terms. 3D Graphics &amp; Animation also offers excellent and comprehenstive coverage of such related topics as developing a story concept, storyboarding, and putting together a demo real and portfolio. New elements showcased in this second edition include interviews from industry leaders as well as application specific tutorials for 3ds max 4, Maya 4, and LightWave 7 that are included on the CD. If you have a project involving graphics and animation, then give a careful reading to Mark Giambruno's 3D Graphics &amp; Animation!"},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"Let me guess: You're completely new to 3D graphics and you're desperately struggling to find that one book that's going to have you mass producing Square Games quality FMVs, but you're finding titles that are confusing you even more, right?Well, I've got some good, and some bad news. A more positive approach would be to offer you the bad news first: There's no book on store shelves that can teach talent, or your inherent ability to adapt proficiently with applications such as Maya and 3D Studio Max.After some months of studying 3D, last year, I finally came to this conclusion and had to face the facts. I read all I could read, learned how to get around and operate the programs and even give instructions and tutorials to others, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the imagery in my head to appear in my scenes. This is something that is inside you and is triggered through hands-on experience. Just like not everyone can draw, not everyone can model.Now for the good news.Aside from discovering your talent and how well it applies to 3D CG, there are quite a lot of other questions that CAN be answered through text. Generalization of how to work your application of choice, what is 3D, how it's been applied, and how you can apply it.Mark Giambruno's new book: 3D Graphics and Animation is the most thorough text, that I've come across, answering newbie questions with in depth explanations and even contributing more than expected. What has been summed up in it's 500 + pages, is what took me most of last year to find out on my own through extensive research and many unwanted, beginner questions in forums. If only this book had been out during my many trips to Borders last year, I could've covered 7 to 8 months of really bad road in a manner of two weeks.What impressed me most was how thoroughly Mark walks you through common and necessary features of 3D software and concepts. As example, there are six pages alone, explaining the rhyme and reason behind the oh-so-confusing X,Y, Z Axis, where as other titles I've read had only invested two paragraphs at most.Included are some tutorials for 3DS Max, Maya and Lightwave, however the overall theme of this book appears to have remained non-application specific, which is a blessing to the many of us who are using some of the still-yet-to-be-covered programs such as Cinema 4D and Animation Master.In the end, what a lot of you have is beginner questions, and as some of you have found, it can get quite frustrating trying to answer all of them from random trips to the local bookstore and haunting relevant sites and forums. Once these questions are answered, the doors will open and you'll have the opportunity to find out if you've actually been gifted with the talent of getting your dreams and stories on screen, or if, like me, it's back to the old pencil and paper.3D Graphics and Animation is a time saver, a survival guide that should've been available so long ago. If you're just starting to get your feet wet in the world of 3D I highly suggest picking this title up along with an In-Depth and Bible title relevant to your application of choice.As with the old saying: \\"If I only knew then what I know now.\\", 3D Graphics and Animation gives you the info you need to get started right on the spot. Kudos to Mr. Giambruno!"},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"The book \\"3D Graphics and Animation\\" is like some one way ticket to the world of 3D graphics. Since I've bought the russian version of it - my life has changed. Finally I desided to connect my future life with CG.Whether you are experienced graphist or you're beginner this book is for you. Here you can find all concepts of 3D modelling(polygonal-, spline-, patch-, NURBS-modelling, etc); although it contains chapters about different types of animation, texturing, lighting and special effects.This book does not refer to some specific software and, I think, this is it's advantage(for better understanding). And what is more - the book builds on lessons, during which you're studying how to deal with 3D.The most peculiarity of this book is chapter \\"Finding the Job in 3D Industry \\"-which I haven't yet found in other books. It was really cool to find it, when I have not any idea about the job in 3D. The other big surprise was to find in detail notices about software and hardware used in 3D.I think this book is perfect for the peoples who has some experience in working with 3D and doesn't know how to \\"convent it into cash\\". Book comes with a lot of helpful information (advicements, internet links, lessons on applied CD)Thanks to Mark Giambruno - the book is realy nice."},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"Capably captaining readers through every major facet of the 3D computer-graphics genre in a single text is a monumental endeavor, but that's precisely what veteran 3D guru Mark Giambruno has done with his 588-page (excluding electronic content) sequel to \\"3D Graphics & Animation: From Starting Up to Standing Out\\" (1997).Nearly pulsing with an exponential quantity of pertinent industry facts, this title virtually threatens to explode--like a \\"bomb\\" object in 3ds max--into innumerable chunks of invaluable insider information, technical terms, key tips and techniques. Nevertheless, Giambruno's straightforward, concise and conversational writing style eases the burden of what otherwise might prove an overwhelming exercise in information overload for readers relatively inexperienced in 3D.The text thoroughly explores the fundamental components of 3D work, and in fine detail: modeling; texturing; lighting; animation; rendering; cinematography; post effects. But it delves infinitely deeper than this, including interesting and revealing interviews with significant industry talents, addressing trade applications, the work environment, demo reel development, art direction and project planning, employment issues and more. Authored as a text targeting beginners and intermediate-level talents in 3D computer graphics, \\"3D Graphics & Animation (Second Edition)\\" also equips readers with a fairly comprehensive list and explanation of key field terms, including some with which many experienced users possibly aren't familiar. All the nuts and bolts of 3D development are here, but it's Giambruno's passionate dedication--as alluded to in his foreword--to inspiring and educating novices and other genre enthusiasts that really sets this title apart as a complete, general industry reference. The author's interviews with former coworkers and continuing associates illuminate the ingredients helpful or essential to a successful career in 3D graphics.Aside from some occasional, cumbersome and overly technical explanations of such factors as lighting temperature scales and binary math, the author squarely and applicably strikes the mark in every respect. An industry professional with 12 years of 3D experience as an artist and art/project director on both conventional and contractual employment bases, Giambruno discusses the types of jobs available in 3D, the production processes and learning methods. He tackles all essential modeling methods and techniques, interface elements, perspective, texture acquisition/creation/tiling, mapping details, illumination types and methods, low-polygon creation wares, material shaders, digital imaging, photography, character choreography and animation.An invaluable topic in the text is the intricacies of lighting: basic photographic arrangements; lighting characteristics; lighting mood; methodologies; volumetricity and more. These are critical details of 3D that often are neglected not only in how-to texts, but also--embarrassingly so, to the perpetrators--by renowned digital visual effects studios in the development of feature-entertainment material. Giambruno also deeply explores cinematography, including camera focal length, focus and aperture, movement and viewpoints.In addition, \\"3D Graphics & Animation (Second Edition)\\" embraces important rendering and output issues, including media resolutions, palettes, alpha channels, atmospherics and post FX. Of key interest to broadcast enthusiasts, too, is detailed information about video standards and caveats, render settings, safe zones and aspect ratio. Furthermore, both the printed tutorials and those archived on the companion CD are well-structured and easy-to-follow. Carefully progressing through these instructional sessions certainly will leave beginners achieving a substantial sense of accomplishment and early competence--something that all too often cannot rightfully be said about published tuts.A non-product-specific printed guide to \\"everything 3D,\\" the softcover text is supplemented by 48 CD-archived tutorials whose versions are tailored to 3ds max (release 4 or above), LightWave 3D (v. 7 or higher) and Maya (4 or higher), and numbered steps, crisp screenshots and finished visuals accompany these exercises. Also included on the CD are some stellar finished sequences produced by former Giambruno employer Mondo Media. Rounding out the CD-based material are the 3D Graphics & Animation Web List (HTML), five PDF appendices and Chapter 12: Getting the Job. The Web List includes references to CG-specific sites, organizations, schools, 3D software-producer contact information, image and mesh library publishers and interviewee contact data. An extensive terms glossary and a useful index appear at the publication's aft.As for the book's visuals, project and software screenshots are illustrative, the \\"Notes\\" informative, and the occasional \\"Definition\\" entrees enlightening. The full-color \\"Image Gallery\\" is interesting, inspiring and fairly extensive.This book does slant somewhat toward the game-development market and, although this arena is burgeoning at present, some 3D enthusiasts may not be inclined in this direction. (But then, the author's expertise, to a large degree, comprises game-creation efforts, so it's difficult to avoid this emphasis.) Some slightly annoying manifestations appear, such as a two-page-plus \\"Acknowledgements\\" section at the outset and the illustrative mini-dramas that precede the chapters. The former is difficult to avoid, though, as artists often easily form \\"mutual admiration societies.\\" (The author very well might respond: \\"Touch&eacute;.\\") As for the latter, well, each brief dialogue is only a page in length. These asides probably serve more to gratify the author's affinity for storytelling than anything else, but they also may be his method for taking the edge off what, for some, may be intimidating material. No harm done. And one final thing: For those 3D folk who aren't enamored with Discreet's 3ds max, the frequent references to this product might miff a bit. Some camps are very possessive of their software, and these do include ones that much-prefer another or other products. (But it's difficult--if not impossible--to deny max's saturation and prowess in the game genre.)The bottom line: If you're interested in exploring a career in 3D or just in dabbling in the medium as a hobbyist, this text is nearly a must-have. For intermediate-level 3D types, much of the technically specific material may be quite useful. And again, even some genuine pros--particularly if untrained in filmmaking and/or color theory--may at least learn a few terms previously unknown to them. Regardless of user experience level, \\"3D Graphics & Animation (Second Edition)\\" serves--at least to some extent--as a valuable reference of industry terminology."},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"For the beginner bent on creating a viable 3D animation beginning to end, this book is for you. The text may overwhelm you in places, but that is not the author's fault. 3D modeling/animation is an overwhelming subject. It takes time to digest its many aspects, and this book introduces you to them all -- not only modeling and animation, but the whole process from concept to script to storyboard/animatics to scene editing to post-production effects. The end result is a demo reel. Not that any beginner will reach this point soon. It is a monstrous undertaking, and anything of length and complexity will require a team and considerable resources. If you are intermediate to advanced, this still makes a wonderful reference tome, a careful perusal of which will likely turn up some of your blind spots. Several very carefully thought out tutorials are woven through the text, of which a blimp with blinking lights, moving propeller and video screen is central (you animate it when done). While the book does not kowtow to any particular software package, the CD contains detailed steps for these tutorials in 3D Studio, Maya, and Lightwave (I have not tried all of these and cannot vouch for their accuracy, but Mr. Giambruno does instill me with trust). Lots of supplementary material is provided, from interviews with leading 3D artists to hardware considerations to 3D markets to job types to getting in the door, etc."},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"If you're new to the world of 3D, you've got a long (but fun!) journey ahead of you. Why not spend some time with this friendly, comprehensive introduction?Unlike many 3D books, this one is relatively program-agnostic (although biased a bit towards Max and game developers). In addition to generic tutorials that can be completed in any 3D program that supports the features being utilized, it also includes very helpful, program-specific tutorial instructions on the CD for those using Lightwave 7, Max 4.2, or Maya 4.The book introduces you to basic 3D concepts that will most likely be relevant regardless of the 3D program you ultimately choose to work with (and if you're like me you'll ultimately wind up playing with as many of them as you can get your hands on!). I think this approach may be easier to swallow for newbies than having to learn 3D concepts *and* master their program of choice all at once (sometimes the program-specific books get so focused on which menu item to choose that they fail to clearly explain the concepts behind what they're asking you to do). Plus if you work your way through the book's tutorials you will have completed a fairly complex scene (a Blade Runner-style advertising blimp). The book is also sprinkled with informative interviews with people making their living doing 3D.I wish this book had been available when I started learning Lightwave a while back. Combined with the Lightwave-specific tutorial on the CD, this book is a great intro to both 3D and Lightwave (and quite welcome since many of the books out on Lightwave are fairly advanced).It would have been great to see a program-specific tutorial for Cinema 4D (my current favorite) and perhaps even for Caligari trueSpace and Eovia Carrara (either of which might be a better fit for newbies than Lightwave, Max, or Maya) and some of the material (while still surprisingly relevant) appears to be from the mid-90s. All in all, though, an excellent effort.NOTE: New Riders kindly provided me with a preview copy of the book to review."},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"It amazes me how Mark aims sooo wide but hits so precise! He treats every aspect within 3D art without missing a step. I couldn't imagine a better guide for climbing the sometimes steep and treacherous paths of &quot;Mount 3D&quot;.It's hard to specify who this book is &quot;for&quot;. In such cases it might be easier to define the negation: This book is NOT for those who DON'T want to LEARN 3D, because they inevitably will :)Apart from being a superb 3D artist Mark Giambruno is an excellent writer as well. As if that wasn't enough he's also a great teacher!What's really cool is that the book has a generic approach. It's not specific for any software but applicable to all. So instead of just learning to master 3DS Max or Maya or any other 3D package, you'll learn to master the art of 3D modelling! Isn't that great? I mean, software are just tools (pretty fancy friggin' tools if you ask me, but still tools) the real stuff is what you got inside you're head, right? On the other hand one can't dismiss tools just like that, it's not like you can blow 3D models out your nose (or acctually... nah I won't go there) so you're still depending on them. Mr. Giambruno is well aware of this and includes versions of the tutorials in the book for 3 different packages on the companion CD.I use Softimage XSI myself which has no corresponding version on the CD. I have no problems following the tutorials, and I'm a newbie to both 3D modelling and Softimage XSI.This book won't spend to much time on the shelf if any. If you want to learn 3D you will waste valuable time by not buying this book. If it's not the standard for teaching 3D in schools it sure as heck should be! There's no point that I tell you what areas the book cover since it's better specified elsewhere but I'll do it anyway: EVERYTHING :)BUY IT!"},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"A great book that not only gives general info about the industry but offers an extensive multi-platform tutorial to get you on your way.

All the basic concepts are discussed in a rudimentary fashion but in-depth enough for any beginner to get a handle on all the basic concepts one needs to start. For example, textures, wireframing, splines, camera angles, lighting , surfaces and rendering are all discussed in a few pages but enough for the beginner to get an intro to the topic. There is also a pretty good intro to hard and software (much of software author discusses is still in use albeit in later editions) although this is dated - no suprise considering the rapid technological movement in the field and the fact this book was published in 2002. There is also a DVD that illustrates the concepts the author discusses in numerous chapters. All and all a very good intro for the beginner. For intermediary or advanced readers, however, this book would be too basic."},{"Title":"3D Graphics & Animation (2nd Edition)","review":"Great reading and reference to animation concepts.

Do not buy this edition, search for a used copy of a previous edition."},{"Title":"Destiny Bay Limited Edition","review":"The editorial review is not truly descriptive of or fair to this remarkable book.It is actually a collection of short stories dealing with the various members of the MacFarlane family, told by Kerry MacFarlane, the nephew of Sir Valentine MacFarlane (who does not marry a gypsy - that must be Hollywood influence in the film based on the book.) The family has good relations with the local Romany folk, and many of the stories in the book involve them in one way or another, but that is only one aspect of the adventures of the MacFarlane family.The stories are firmly rooted in the rural life of Northern Ireland in the late 19th or early 20th century, and Byrne has a good ear for the speech of the time and place. But the stories also involve the wanderings of family members and friends to and from New York, the American South, and Monte Carlo - a Spanish nobleman and his supposed grandson looking for the lost treasure of the Armada - a kidnapped Chinese woman - a horse race - a boxing match - a trial for murder - a duel - and an apparent visitation of the Devil to Destiny Bay. (A possible touch of the supernatural is a regular feature of this book.)Sir Valentine MacFarlane is an irascible old gentleman and eminently quotable. I would give the book 4 and one half stars because - as one might expect in a collection of short stories -not all are of the same quality.

This is a good book for such a purpose, it covers much. (This review is on the third edition).Unit I has 5 chapters covering the fundamentals of musical theory. Sound, time, pitch, structure, form and style. Unit II is a 4-chapter overview of early music, starting with the Middle Ages. Unit III covers the 18th century in 6 chapters, starting with Late Baroque. Unit IV focuses on the 19th century, starting with Beethoven and finishing with the Late Romantics in 5 chapters.Unit V: The Twentieth Century, was my favourite section. The prelude chapter discusses the concepts of music and modernism. The next chapter covers the early 20th century, then there is a chapter on alternatives to modernism, and the fourth chapter covers the late 20the century. Chapter 24 focuses on music in America: Jazz.The book is organised around listening samples. These are available on a set of a 6 accompanying CDs. I liked the samples chosen. The late 20th century chapter, for example, discussed works by Ligeti, Berio, Varese, Cage, Crumb, Leon, Gubaidulina and Reich.An alternative to \\"Listen\\" is Music: An appreciation\\" by Roger Kamien. It seems to me to have a bit more on artistic context, whilst at the same time covering more topics at slightly more depth.However, \\"Listen\\" is well organised (always a good sign), and richly illustrated. Historical events are touched upon, and there is some reference to other art forms in context with the music of the time.

If you want a book that is clear as regards both plot and time and belongs in our world, then this book is not for you. I didn't know what to expect when I picked it up, I just saw the Pulitzer prize medal on the cover and assigned it to myself. I definitely couldn't read the book in one night. You have to read it slowly, savor the language and the imagery, sometimes re-read the paragraphs in order to better understand. This book straddles 2 (or more?) worlds. My major question at the end of the book was what was that other world. One sequence of chapters at the end seemed to indicate that these characters are at once the same and different people; what exactly was it saying? But maybe if I ask the author would laugh at me and say, &quot;If you don't intuitively know by reading the book, then you will never understand.&quot; Maybe some of the themes will make themselves clear in some Jungian way to a section of the population. But even though I didn't get the particulars of time and space and distinction between one person and another, that held sort of an other-worldly charm for me.

I have never been the type to read older books set in day. As it just so happens this book was very good. Beloved by Toni Morrison is a great book.

I would suggest this book to anyone because there are a lot of good points that are told and that are resolved.

I plan to read more of Toni Morrison's books."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is the first book that I have ever read by Toni Morrison and to my surprise, I really enjoyed her style of writing. Many people that I have talked to about the writing of Toni Morrison were less then thrilled with it, so I approached this novel expecting not to enjoy it.Boy, was I ever wrong!! After reading this novel I believe that this is a great piece of literature to experience and judging from this single piece of work alone, Toni Morrison is an excellent writer for today\`s readers.I absolutely loved this novel! I read the entire book in less then four days because I simply could not put it down. At first the novel is quit slow. The beginning seems to drag a little and I found it very hard to want to continue to reading. However, once I got past the first 6 pages or so, I found myself unable to put this book down.This novel is a very enticing read, that deals with many vary interesting and somewhat gut wrenching ideas. For example, the idea of slavery and running for freedom or the unlawful deed of murder that is found within the story line. Or what about the idea of ghosts and spirits of the dead, coming back to haunt those who are still alive and thriving in the human world.This is a book that is immensely hard to follow and takes a lot of concentration to understand where the plot of the story is coming from and where it is going. Morrison uses a style of writing that is very hard to follow because of its constant movement. For example, one moment, the character is physically in one place doing one thing and the reader can see this happening, then the next minute the character is having a flashback and is mentally somewhere else, in another time, doing some other kind of action. Morrison allows this type of movement to happen within her writing without giving any type of warning. These kind of occurrences that happen throughout the novel are liable to cause some confusion for the reader, forcing he or she to stay on their toes at all times while reading this particular book. This presents a real challenge, even for the most experienced critical reader.This is a great book and I highly recommend that you give it a chance. Granite, it'll be a huge commitment and challenge, but it is definitely worth all of the time and the struggle. Pick it up, read through the first couple of chapters, and then go back and re-read them again, get a feel for the story and begin to understand it. This is definitely a time consuming book, however it is well worth every single minute that you as a critical reader give it.This book dares you to test your commitment skills, your ability to read critically and most of all your patience. However, in the end you will be rewarded by this extraordinary, well-written piece of contemporary art.Start reading today...you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I have never read a book like this before, but then again, I haven't read a whole lot of fiction.. I found Morrison's style very unique and refreshing.. Some of the passages were dreamlike, like listening to a beautiful song or reading a beautiful poem.. Terrific imagery.. Sometimes, however, I felt lost in her verbeage, a similar feeling that occurs in me when I read Joyce. Some of this can be attributed to her technique of jumping around in time, pieceing together the lives of the characterics and their relationships with one another.. Aside from her style, I found the concept of killing your own children in order to save them very compelling.. A disturbing, animal-like act, yet at the same time I was convinced of the act's incredibly human compassion.. Something I believe Morrison accomplished with her unique gifts. Although I find the topic of race generally boring, I found the story line to be legitimate and tender.. I felt great compassion for the characters in the novel.. I felt Morrison did a great job in revealing to the reader little intricacies about the character's lives and their importance.. i.e. The use of butter on one's mouth to help take away the slave's physical pain after having their mouths locked up with steel traps.. I realize that Beloved's spirit physically coming back should probably be interpreted as metaphor, but I had a hard time taking the story very seriously once I realized who the girl they met on the way home from the carnival actually was.. (I remember a scene near the end of the book where a group of women from the neighborhood had decided to confront Beloved's spirit in the flesh..) But that's just a personal thing, for I will never claim to be a critic.. Overall, an excellent and important work, very refreshing.. I recommend it highly.."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"You can get the summary of this book elsewhere. Suffice it to say that &quot;Beloved&quot; is the literary masterpiece of the late 20th century. It didn't win the Pulitzer and Morrison didn't win the Nobel for nothing. Beloved must be read several times, use the cliff notes if you have to. It is worth it. The magical lyricism that Morrison uses to create Sethe's story is amazing. How can she write like this?, you wonder. Simply astounding."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"BELOVEDThe story Beloved by Toni Morrison is a story of black life after living a life of slavery. Taking the life of her two-year-old child, Sethe the main character, is forced to live with regret and doubt of her actions. Fearing the thought of her own children being taken into slavery, she takes control of both her own and her children's fates sealing it with unthinkable actions. \\"Love\\" is what Sethe uses to justify her actions, and she goes on with life thinking she did the right thing. As the story begins, Paul D., a former slave from Sethe's past enters her life. He and Sethe's relationship grows during the story which lets us see into the past of their two lives. His presence to Sethe is one of her former husband Halle. With him in the picture we are able to get a vivid look on their past history at Sweet Home, the place where Sethe endured pain and suffering and also life. Morrison adds Paul D. to the story to open up past history which Sethe would not be willing to do herself. 124 blue stone road is the house where the lives of Sethe, Denver, Beloved, and Paul D. take place. Although originally owned by Sethe's mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, it becomes Sethe's after her death. On the verge of Sethe's rehappiness, Beloved, the ghost of her first child, comes back to see that happiness never reach Sethe again. Although Sethe tries to justify her actions of killing her child, I feel that she was wrong to do that. Saying that she feared of what might come to her children in slavery was just a way to make her feel at ease. The truth is that in the years of civil rights and racial understanding, blacks had a real chance at life. Beloved should have had the right to a chance to live, but instead her own mother took it from her. The way Morrison writes this book is almost guaranteed to cause the normal reader some confusion. Using many metaphors and terms such as memories and rememories, her style sometimes just makes you say,&quot; what's going on here?\\" But the writing style she uses is so unique because you are forced to come to your own conclusions about many situations in the story. Morrison doesn't come out and tell you what is happening but instead just leads you on and then weaves more of the story in causing you to read more to find out what is really happening. Another confusing aspect of Morrison's style is combining both the past and present together, sometimes in the same scene. Often times she includes little flashback, which is often confusing or goes into the mind of the characters to show why they act the way they do. Overall Morrison's style is one to be conquered. Slavery is the main topic Morrison tries to point out in this novel. By going into the past of Sethe and the people around her, we are able to see a general idea of what slavery was like. Sweet Home shown the black view of slavery, while we were also introduced to many views of whites thought of it. Trying not to seem racist, Morrison gives the reader a clear-cut view of a black slave's life during and after slavery. Although Beloved is a very hard book to read it was overall a pretty good book. At times I was confused because of Morrison's style and the way it seemed like a huge puzzle that I would never be able to put together, but in the end I felt rewarded in seeing a new view on slavery and black life. I thought this book was satisfying and I would recommend it to the experienced reader."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"When I was first assigned \\"Beloved\\" for my English class I didn't know what to expect. I had never read one of Morrion's works before and was unfamiliar with her style; what I read surprised me. Morrison jumps right into the story without introducing the reader to any of the characters first. Because of this unique style the first few pages were a whirlwind of names and events I knew nothing about. I had to pause after the first chapter to try and make sense of everything. However, the more I read the more the book, and its characters, pulled me in; and the characters are what make this book good. Each character has many sides to his or her personality; Sethe, strong yet haunted by the past, Paul D, nurturing yet wanting to leave, and Denver, jealous and alone. Each character is believable and anybody can relate to them on some level. The book, however, is not perfect. Although Morrison's unorthodox style is beautiful, it's also confusing. Morrison is like a juggler tossing all these balls into the air, yet never telling the reader which ball to focus on. It's frustrating to be reading only to have to backtrack three chapters to catch an allusion you missed the first time. Constantly having to go back and forth really made the book seem a chore to read. \\"Beloved\\" is definitely a book that has to be read more than once. Overall, I feel \\"Beloved\\" is a very good book with an excellent story and cast of characters with a somewhat irritating style. It is something I believe everyone should read at least once. It's worth the time you'll invest in it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison has the knack for making peole think.

I've since heard on NPR that the story is based on a true story which gives it an even more haunting appeal. My only gripe with this book has been mentioned before by other reviewers. Morrison is such an excellent writer that at times it actually gets in the way of the simple horror of this story. Her description of things become TOO eloquent at times and lead me out of the trance of doom and sorry that she originally wants the reader to feel. Sometimes a simple sentence is more effective and powerful than a paragraph which is the case with this book.For example,Sethe's straight forward dialog in the book always left me breathless while the flowery descriptions in between the dialogs seemed to be out of place, especially for a supernatural period novel about slavery.With that said, the story alone holds the book together and keeps you glued to the pages, especially towards the end."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The way this book paints the picture of slavery is magnificent, and it really makes you think of what kind of animals some people were. But the way it is painted is the only good thing. This book is quite disturbing and almost terrifying. The character of Beloved is a stupid side plot. What she represents is good but keep it that way. I don't need all the sidebars about her beating Sethe and screaming in the nude, and having relations with Paul D. If you like that kind of stuff then its perfect for you, but maybe you should settle for Roots."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Slavery, sexuality, and the supernatural are all elements with strong presence in Toni Morrison's novel Beloved. Morrison writes with vigor and careful attention to detail, leaving the reader with vivid images of the various scenes as they unfold. Unfortunately, I didn't really ever get involved in the plot; Beloved isn't one of those books that you can't put down, and though I occasionally found myself mildly entertained, I was mostly reading because I had to, not because I wanted to.Beloved revolves around Sethe, her daughter Denver, and Paul D, a former slave who worked on the same plantation as Sethe. It centers around the scars-both literally and figuratively-Sethe and Paul D received while they suffered at the cruel hands of their &quot;owners&quot;, and on their inability to be exorcised of the ghosts that haunt them.The main characters live in a house known as 124. The house is haunted by a malevolent spirit called Beloved, the ghost of Sethe's dead baby. Over the course of nearly 30 chapters, Paul D and Sethe have flashbacks that give the reader small doses of life as a slave, while struggling to overcome life's challenges in the present.The story takes many unexpected twists and turns, and at times it becomes quite confusing. I might have actually enjoyed the book if Morrison hadn't constantly recycled the same flashbacks and repetitive information. Also, she failed to capitalize on moments that should have been dramatic and enthralling, while rambling on about more trivial happenings. For these reasons, I can't for the life of me figure out how or why such a dry, boring, and downright mediocre book received the honor of winning both the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for Literature. At best, this novel should have made Book of the Month at some women's reading class, but maybe I've read a different version than the book's proponents. If you want to read something that is actually interesting, try Slaughterhouse Five, Lord of the Rings, To Kill a Mockingbird, or Of Mice and Men, and pass over this lethargic selection."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In certain circles, I have been silently (or not) awarded the status of spoiled literary ignoramus for expressing my opinion of this book. That said, literature is one of my passions, and I'm willing to risk ridicule again to warn those of you who may appreciate the heads-up.I first read BELOVED as part of a literature class, and I was at first excited because I had never read anything by Toni Morrison before and had heard her books widely praised. Then I started reading it, and I thought it would never end.I admit, it was the writing style that turned me off. There are many who laud Ms. Morrison's &quot;ingenious&quot; and &quot;lyrical&quot; prose, but I tend to find stream-of-conciousness writing confusing, annoying, and in many cases, as in this one, unnecessary. I find that it disrupts the story, and I like my stories to make sense. The effort involved in piecing together Morrison's story from the fragmented, dislocated chapters in which it is written is monumental. I usually don't stick around with books like that to find out if the end result was worth the effort, but with this one, I had no choice. Expecting nothing more, still I was sorely disappointed when I found that it was not. The story line has the potential for great power, but somewhere along the line it was mishandled and mangled beyond recognition."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I know the very great reputation this book has. It was chosen as the best novel of the past twenty- five years in a survey done by the NY Times. So my own impressions about the book are obviously not those of a great number of readers.Nonetheless for me the book was a disappointment. The idea of presenting the story through a series of non- chronlogical fragments somehow made the successive cruelties presented in the work appear as part of a violent demonstration. I could not sympathize with the characters as I had no coherent sense of who they were. They seemed unreal constructions whose principal purpose was the demonstrating of certain historical and political points, which however valid ( anti- slavery) were not here made into a humane document."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"A tale of trauma, spiritualism, and reconciliation. This complex and troubling novel has a unique story to tell. However, Toni Morrison's unorthodox, and sometimes lewd writing style has made this story appropriate only for the most mature readers. But, for those who are mature enough to delve into this book, the writing style proves quite effective. She quickly sets the reader in the culture and emotional mindset of the characters.Though the writing is powerful, it loses its effectiveness as the story progresses from moderate believability to complete fantasy; I'm mainly referring to the concept of ghosts and reincarnation in the story. Morrison also causes the reader to miss some of the novel's symbolism due to her subtlety, while her blunt and obscene descriptions of some events stick in their mind. But, those who can grasp the unorthodox writing style and the implausible story will find that the overall themes conveyed in this novel are fairly intriguing, and provide a fresh and original perspective in this stereotypic genre. Younger readers, however, may find this novel tedious, as the story line alone will not supply quite enough action and engagement to hold their interest.Even if the novel becomes tedious, you will still need to apply intense concentration in order to avoid re-reading sections. Flashbacks usually come without warning, and the point of view shifts from character to character and from present-tense to past-tense at unusual times. As the reader, you must first get used to the style, and then you will come to know the order in which the events occur. After that, the novel becomes much less vexing. At first, it's extremely hard to put together the pieces of the puzzle.Many of the scattered events in this story leave the reader longing for more explanation. Reasons for some of the character's decisions are never thoroughly explained, and the strange supernatural occurrences are simply thrown into the story as if they are normal, everyday occurrences. These all prompt questions of \\"How?\\" and \\"Why?\\" These ruminations play an important role in making this novel what it is, but they also create an incomplete and unconvincing story line.Not everyone will enjoy reading Beloved. If you are looking to read a story about slavery with an unconventional and provoking plot, you might enjoy this novel. On the other hand, if you just want a typical, generic story of a struggling slave oppressed by whites, you probably won't find what you're looking for in this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was a wonderful piece of literature to engage. After reading this novel, I become in love with the concept of Magical Realism. This novel takes one to a level untraveled. I highly recommend this novel to ALL."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was skeptical about Toni Morrison's greatness before I read any of her books. Beloved is a beautiful book. The lyrical narrative flows well with the story, which draws you in. The horrors of slavery and the prints it leaves on the human spirit are explored through recollection and memory. After you have heard everyone's story, it is hard to judge anyone in the book and to choose heroes and villains. This is what bondage does. Can we retain our humanity when everyone and everything in our lives treats us like animals? Think about Sethe and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"You can get the summary of this book elsewhere.

How can she write like this?, you wonder. Simple astounding."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The author of this slammin novel weaves a complex circular narrative that unconventionally does not relay events linearly or chronologically. Instead, its readers are compelled to read proactively, for Morrison invites us to participate in the unfolding of the drama.Beset with convolution, the novel's form resembles that of a circle or a spiral ellipse, in that Sethe collects, omits, and repeats fragments of -herstory- . While in some instances, circular imagery conventionally represents wholeness and continuity, other times they signify stagnation and vacuity, which are inescapable and oppressive.Its more subtle themes draw upon the nature of nostalgia and the phenomenon of rememory, which may be defined as the condition of recalling, reviving, reliving, reinterpreting, reshaping, re-evaluating again and again past experiences, impressions, thoughts, feelings, and facts.Love, loss, revenge, misery, and redemption all make their presence known, and because we too must deal with these issues ad nauseam, in my opinion, Beloved is a fulfilling read, and something worth a second, even third, run-through."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's novel \\"Beloved\\" is set in a time when slavery was supposed to be finished and over with after the Civil War. The newly freed slaves were depending on the Constitution to give them the rights that every man is born with, but daily life for the ex-slaves continued to be a struggle. This is the case for the main character of the story, Sethe, who had to confront the demons of her past. In 124 Bluestone Road Sethe and Denver are haunted by the ghost of her baby daughter whom she killed in an act of love and mercy. Sethe, unwilling to take abuse from School Teacher, decides to runaway from Sweet Home with the rest of her family. When confronted with the reality that they may be caught, she takes the life of her two-year-old daughter to prevent a life of slavery and injustice for her child. The baby ghost prevents Sethe and Denver to have any friends but the ghost itself. This changes when an acquaintance of Sethe's comes to 124. Morrison uses Paul D. as a tool to get a feel of Sethe's emotions. Within a little while of his visit, Paul D. rids the house of the ghost. This creates tension with Denver because the baby ghost was her only playmate. He becomes a major factor in forcing Sethe to talk about events of her past. Paul D. is the person that provokes emotions from other characters: happiness with Sethe, anger with Denver, and resentment with Beloved. A touch of the supernatural is evident with the flesh and blood reincarnation of the baby ghost in Beloved. The characters in the story don't question whether the ghost is real or not because they all believe in ghosts. Beloved comes as a young runaway slave and is offered shelter with Sethe. She then dominates the household so forcefully that Sethe and Denver are at the verge of starvation. Sethe, without even trying, lets Beloved take charge in the household. Sethe loves Beloved so much and maybe feels guilt for her actions so Beloved is able to dictate her mother's life. It appeared to look like Beloved would literally kill them but that all changed when Denver decides to get out of the isolation that she has lived with all her life and do something to help her with her family's situation. She goes out and tries to find a job and is now forced to be the financial supporter. As Denver comes out of her sheltered life, she is able to acquire the help of the black community to chase Beloved back to her grave. Slavery is the main topic behind this novel. Morrison is careful to not stereotype all the white people as bad people. Throughout out the novel, readers are introduced to different sides of how white people felt about slavery. There were the ones who were ruthless to blacks like School Teacher, but we cannot forget about those who respected blacks like Mr. Garner. The images of slavery at its most brutal height are hard to comprehend because we live in a time where injustice is not that obvious. Morrison is able to describe the physical and emotional horror that many endured during that time. Her words have an incredible effect on readers. \\"Beloved\\" has a unified plot but its events don't necessarily go in chronological order. We learn of past events by flashbacks of the main characters and this sometimes creates confusion for the reader. During these flashbacks, Morrison never lets the reader know too much. It isn't until towards the end of the novel where some of the questions start to get answered. Other questions also begin to surface towards the ending because the ending doesn't seem to be definite. We are forced to wonder what will happen to the people who live in 124 Bluestone Road, especially Denver because she surprisingly changed her attitude and swallowed any pride she had to ask others for help."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What has not yet been said about this work? I keep recommending it to friends as one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Slavery and its devastating aftermath are such important subjects, and for some reason, there are virtually no great novels on this topic. In my opinion, this book received the Nobel Prize more for its subject matter than for the actual quality of the book.The characters of Sethe and the ex-slave, Paul D., are wonderfully written, and when the book stayed with the story of how they endured, and escaped from, slavery, it was gripping.However, every time the story shifted to the ghost of Sethe's dead daughter haunting her, and the mother-sister-daughter squabbling, it lost me.The book left me hungry to read a long, well-written, historical novel about slavery and its aftermath, sort of the African-American equivalent of a Herman Wouk or James Michener novel. Until that is written, I recommend Beloved because of its historical importance, but I found the book disappointing after reading so many rave reviews."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot; was first published in 1987. This novel was set after the Civil War in Cincinnati, Ohio. This is the story about Sethe, an escaped slave, and her family. She survives so much, but when her &quot;dead&quot; child appears into her life, and then disappears just as quickly, she just cannot manage that. Paul D., a friend and former slave, might be her only salvation. This unique novel combines imagination and truths of history and still remains a popular novel through the millenium, speaking to the past of some terrible and so great circumstances. &quot;Beloved&quot; won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. - Doreen Baumgartner"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As a first year college student, I found Beloved to be a very difficult book to read under time restrictions. To fully appreciate this novel one must be willing to read it numerous times. The content itself was excellent and I found the plot of the story to be very interesting. The story forces the reader to ask theirself many questions with no concete answers. Make sure to pay close attention for the flashbacks, they can really come out of left field."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is obviously a very good novel. One of the more stylistically written books in a long time. Morrison's prose, while different, is what gives the book its very vibrant life and soul. The story line, while quite good, evolves slowly so the reader should be sure to relax and allow the book to unfold. The writing is at such a high level of beauty that the waiting is hardly noticable. Beloved will be enjoyed by all who can allow a different style of writing into their lives. It is a style that seems to come from deep within the author - in essence it defines \\"visceral\\". Simply a great contemporary writer and book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's Beloved is a beautifully gripping novel that depicts the life of a an ex-slave. Sethe, a bold young black slave escapes a plantation that is aesthetically pleasing, but beneath the superficial beauty, there is a terrible and devastating history. This history haunts Sethe as she runs from the plantation and attempts to start afresh, but can't seem to escape the heavy burden of memory.This novel, if read critically, contains a powerful and innovative message. If a reader is to further explore this novel, he or she may discover an underlying theme often missed by the casual reader. The first thing a critical reader views upon opening the novel is the dedication. Morrison writes, \\"Sixty million and more\\". Her wording is interesting. It is as though she is not attempting to be sentimental or overly romantic. She does not implicitly state, \\"In memory of\\", or even \\"Dedicated to\\", but she simply states the number. One can assume that this is a dedication but question who the sixty million or more are? As one familiarizes themselves with Morrison it is possible that she dedicates the book to the sixty million or more that die in the middle passage, or perhaps all slaves that died. But what does this number mean to a reader. Critics have thought that she is competing with other horrible acts against humanity. Perhaps Morrison is trying to find a seat among the sufferers of the Holocaust or those the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Wouldn't one assume that slavery is among the atrocities listed before? I don't believe so because this is the first encounter I have ever had with a death toll. By presenting a number, Morrison validates slavery as legitimately among the others. Usually one associates the level of \\"horrible\\" by the number of people that suffered. By never stating a number for those that died or suffered in slavery, the inhumanity can never be included among the \\"greatest acts against humanity\\". Morrison smartly eases the issue into the museum of \\"fantastic and horrible events in humanity\\" and creates the story of the suffering of one slave.If a reader is looking for another sad story of slavery, this book will do the job. It is complete with eerie haunting, flashbacks of the life on the plantation, love, and a younger generation that doesn't seem to understand, which are all components of a successful \\"slave rememberence novel\\". However, if a reader desires a fresh idea, or a stronger more thoughtful depiction and understanding of the sufferings of slavery, a critical reader will find this to be powerful and unsettling. This is the pioneer novel that allows slavery to be placed next to those atrocities deemed genuinely ghastly."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book is kind of confusing at first. I myself rented the movie after a few pages because I was sort of lost. But, then I After seeing the movie I really understood the book more. The Story really was sad because of what Sethe a character in the story did. She killed her own daughter to prevent the caucasian men from taking her. This was because what she had went threw with slavery. She left sweet home to escape all that and there was no way she was going to put her child threw it. Some people might think what she did was crazy but,I think if I or anyone in her shoes might have done the same. I believe probably if anyone was suffering in life so bad they would want to die rather than suffer. If you were in a coma with wires all around you and no chance of ever becoming normal again would you want someone to pull the plug for you? Or if you know that your child will never be free and will be under someones power for the rest of his/her life would you try to do something about it? Well sethe had her reasons and so she did what she thought was best for her child. She rather let her daughter R.I.P then work for the caucasian men for the rest of her life. So this book was very touching and it showed the struggle and sacrafices Sethe had to go threw. She did what was best for her family. I recommend you read the book after if you watch the movie first because it will make alittle more sense and it'll be more worth it then just watching the movie only. BYE BYE NOW"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The key to understanding &quot;Beloved&quot; lies in the ability to apply the self-awareness of nurtured spirit and mind of a XXcentury woman to the life of ex-slave in post Civil War Ohio. The colored community and the realia of slavery are portrayed with genuine realistic mastery, but the manner of rendering of spiritual struggle and inner lives of the main characters left me with a sense of underaccomplishment. I rated the novel 4 stars because I am convinced it is an involving and provoking reading. Just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book certainly doesn't live up to expectations. I read this as a junior in high school, after already reading Morrison's The Bluest Eye. The Bluest Eye turned me off because of excessive sexual content that seemed gratuitous at times, and because it did not make a very powerful point. Beloved seems to follow a similar trend. The sexual content is again excessive and unnecessary at times. Very soon we get the point that slavery was dehumanizing and included a large amount of sexual abuse. Yet, Morrison feels the need to drive the point further, mentioning sex over and over again and going out of her way to make a sexual connection with almost every event. It's just not necessary! Furthermore, the entire concept of Beloved does not make a very valuable point. She returns as a memory of the infant Sethe killed to save from slavery. But as a memory, all she does is gnaw away at Sethe's consciousness, slowly siphoning off her resources, independence, and desire to live. Then, she disappears. She really doesn't accomplish anything or evoke any change in the characters. So what is the point? To let us know that slavery was horrendous? Clearly that doesn't warrant a 200 page novel chock full of symbolism and attempts at deep hidden meaning. Morrison's words are smooth-flowing, and her story is interesting, but in the end it's just a little too graphic and sexually explicit, and not enough substance."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Just not my cup of tea. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As a graduate student of the School of Education in University of Connecticut, I had pleasure to read and invastigate many great novels and poems. Morrisons &quot;Beloved&quot; or other works, are not great novels. When one reads the book, one maight get the impression that s/he is reading through somebodys notes. I had the plesure to read the book before the movie was made. In my opinion Morrison just writes spontaneus books which are overated. Before &quot;Beloved&quot; came out on the screen nobody was excited about it. The book is hard to read, it makes no sanse, many things are never explained and are just used once without any reason. After reading &quot;Sula&quot; I got the same impression; Morrison was too much into her imagination to write a book. Perhaps she should step away and let real writers take over. Her books are neither interesting nor developed."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"i liked the book because it was were weied to me u would have to read or watch it twice to understand the book"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I thought this book was the weirdest think I had ever set my eyes on. I was confused in the beginning and then I became bored with the whole story."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After reading Beloved, I came to the conclusion that this book was about a woman suffering back when there were slavery. The sins Sethe committed, to her, was okay but to others however, people would disagree. Sethe knew the hardships of slavery and that's why she did not want her children to live in that type of lifestyle or environment. Sethe suffered many experiences that left her to be alone for a long time. When Paul D came, she realized on what she missed out on. But then when Paul D found out what Sethe had done to her children, he discovered that he could not live with that type of life. The baby Sethe killed came back to her in the form of Beloved. After a while Sethe finds out Beloved is her daughter. This book was of good length. I say that it was perfect to an extent where I could understand everything. When I read this book, I really had a hard time. Most of the time I had to re-read everything which left me getting frustrated a lot because Toni Morrison wrote it in a way where getting lost is part of it and you would have to put the pieces together to understand and get the symbolism. I don't think I would want to read anymore of her books unless I was obligated to because her style of writing is just too complicated for me. Well in the book, a lot of stupid things occur. I don't get how Sethe could have killed her child. It's like she was not educated enough to know that children is our basis of life. Children are our next generation. I also think all the lovemaking in this book is kind of weird. To me, making love is special and should be kept within and not for anyone else to see."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is an award winning book, but I would hate to see what the losing books were like.

A definite must-not-read for any Christian."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"For those of who who have not read BELOVED and want to know if you should order it, you need read no further in reviews- simply obtain the book by whatever means necessary and read it. Everyone gleans something from this book. Be forewarned that it is not for the faint of heart. There's your answer.For those of you who have read BELOVED, you're aware that it's an excellent piece of literature. You're also aware that it's a somewhat difficult book to read, as it makes the reader think about things most people would rather not consider. It really forces a person to confront issues in the world that are ugly, hard, and painful to the point of being poetic. An active reader considers (at least) the obvious issues- issues such as a person having less freedom than a rooster and what could lead to such constraints today, what exactly love means (and does a mother who kills her own children love them? is she simply short sighted? is life worth living without freedom? does a mother have the right to decide between life and death for her child/ren?) and what a person should do for/with love, how people could have ever treated each other this way (and for those aware of modern day slavery, how it's possible that people continue to do this/ let it continue), etc. etc. etc.The list of difficult questions and even harder answers never ends when you read a book like this. In fact, each time I read it, I come away with more. The first time I read it, I recognized it instantly as a book that would change me forever.I read BELOVED for the first time in an AP English 12 class in high school. My teacher taught in several countries before returning to the states and had come back with the idea that the comfort zones of young people needed to be challenged and questioned to the extreme. As a seventeen year old child, the book shocked me, shook me up, and shook new parts out of me.That is the point of reading: expanded horizons, increased awareness of our human family, and, perhaps most importantly, increased awareness of who we are as individual people.She constantly put difficult questions to us, urging us to speak already, and answer as brutally honestly as possible. She even occasionally screamed at us \\"C'mon, people, WHAT DO YOU THINK?! FEEL SOMETHING!\\"Let me tell you, it led to a lot of interesting classroom \\"discussion\\" (*cough* arguments *cough*).Later, I became a teacher myself. My teaching style is a little (read: insanely, ridiculously, black-to-white) different, and I am MUCH more selective. I'm the sort of teacher that would rather guide constructive discussion in the classroom rather than a bar brawl.I still do not believe this book is wrong for the classroom.The question lies in what sort of class it is. If you are considering including this book in your curriculum (or having your child read it over the summer), I strongly suggest it be with upper-level high school (preferably students you've had before and know) or lower-university level students. The real question is not whether your students are ready to(or even capable of) reading and understanding this horror-film-history novel. Most people would agree that the mind censors out what it is not willing to accept.The question really has to do with whether the students are mature enough to handle what this book will teach them about themselves. It's a book that should be supplemented with deep thought (read: self-searching essays and tons of classroom discussion).Are your students (or your children) ready to recognize their beliefs and develop their understanding of slavery? freedom? love? murder (maybe versus mercy killing)? etc.The other question is whether you, as a teacher and guide for them, are ready to include such topics in the classroom.My high school teacher was in to making her students play god (a practice I disagree with to this day) and assigned us the task of writing a modern court scene for the various characters in the book. We had to judge their actions, and then defend/accuse them accordingly as if we were lawyers. Since we had just finished Dante's INFERNO, those who thought dear mommy was a horrible Medea had the option of forgoing that assignment and putting her in hell. We had to decide her punishment, and explain why she deserved that punishment.As I suggested, I truly have a problem with any assignment that forces students to judge another person's soul. There's a big dude upstairs for that. So I'm even harsher.I give my students this assignment:After discussing the topics mentioned, as well as some others, I ask my students to take a moment to think about the person they love the most.Then I ask them to make the same life-of-torture or death decision for that person.I ask them to go home and spend some time really thinking and (perhaps more importantly) figuring out what they feel about it. I then ask them to write an essay on what they've learned. I give them the question \\"What would you do?\\"I've gotten every sort of response to this. I've gotten essays about the sanctity of life an evil of ANY sort of murder. I've gotten surprisingly well-thought out essays about the meaning of life vs. death (which the student tied in to her views of the death penalty). Once I even read a 'letter' of a student who wrote from the perspective of being in a modern prison cell the night before her execution for murdering her own children.Oh, yes, did I mention those were all from only one class of 30-ish average sixteen-year-old students?In summary,If you want to know if you should read it, the answer is yes, but make sure you're ready for it.If you want to know whether your kid should read it, the answer is yes, as long as they're ready for it and you're ready to help.If you're thinking of teaching this book the answer isonly if you're a strong enough teacher to handle itand you're teaching the right class for it.I hope this review has helped you.

Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. The characters seem clueless and lifeless... from the start its so obvious what will happen in the rest of the novel that its almost pointless reading it. I mean, without any spoilers, its literally like reading a mystery while already knowing the ending. So basically, the only reason to read it is to admire her writing style. Oh, by the way, the entire book is filled with grotesque imagery not even remotely relevant to anything in anybody's life minus those dwelling on the past. Seriously, the book starts off with slaves having sex with cattle and continues to digress from there. Nobody in the world understands what being a slave was like, INCLUDING Ms-almost-unbearably-pretentious-Morrison (seriously who puts a picture of themselves on the cover of their book.)We can never understand how horrible slavery is, I understand. Reading 324 pages about people getting tortured and subsequent consequences sincerely will not help you be any happier, gain any form of important insight on life, or become a better person. In fact, the idea that some people actually put this book in the same ballpark as \\"All the King's Men,\\" \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" or any other classic masterpieces just gives me a more negative look on humanity.

Sethe's mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs's death, Sethe's two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.As I continue to read more un expecting things continues to happen. From these assorted memories, the following story begins to emerge Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her.

The civil rights laws commence to cleanse the outer left brain realm. This book works on the right brain. Racism also bleaches the children of masters, who never rest rationalizing the hurting. Racist reflexes root and dye through the generations, into the scalp, the brain, down to the brainstem, heart, and reflexes--mental, physical, emotional. Right brain truths aren't self-evident, except to poets. Those who would deny the past are mental amputees or hijackers. Shock, denial, anger, hurt, acceptance--there's no circumventing the process. This book appears to work at the hurt level. Morrison picks at a scab, but freshly healed skin reveals itself beneath."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I choose audiobooks for long car trips, but this choice was a mistake -- many times it almost put me to sleep at the wheel. The plot moves as slow as sorghum, and the characters never come to life. Ms. Morrison is a talented writer and a decent narrator, and occasional passages in Beloved sizzle, but mostly this book falls flat. It is not helped by the fact that the narrative can come to a halt while Ms. Morrison ticks off lists of things or events, nor is it helped by verbal tics such as the use of phrases with an adjective preceding \\"thing,\\" as in \\"a beautiful thing,\\" \\"a precious thing,\\" or \\"a best thing.\\" The clunky writing and uninteresting characters are a strange contrast to the overheated, sensationalistic plot. Perhaps the characters are so flat because Mr. Morrison sacrifices their humanity for the sake of the symbolism she wants to guide the novel.Despite the novel's obvious pretensions, it is a middlebrow affair, with some passages (as in Baby Suggs's speech in the forrest opening) coming across like the monolog of an earthy... guest...Also disappointing for a ghost story is that there is nothing creepy or suspenseful about this tale. Some critics might respond that this is meant to capture the fact that many antebellum blacks took for granted that there were ghosts all over the place, so from the perspective of the main characters in Beloved the ghost is not terrifying. But even if that is so, does the ghost have to be so darn boring?Slavery is a blight on American history that weighs heavily upon the present, and Ms. Morrison is right to sympathize with slavery's victims, but it does not follow that a novel about an important subject is itself important. Like many Nobel Prize-winning novels, Beloved probably will be forgotten within a few decades."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is written on a higher level than most people can onderstand.

That book is Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved.&quot; This may seem like a lofty placement for a novel written less than 20 years ago, but people were calling &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; the greatest movie ever made only 20 years after its release, and we think that's okay too. Put simply, &quot;Beloved&quot; explores a theme that many books hardly dare to touch (maybe because of how much it scares their authors...) - the notion that our past is something that is completely inexcapable. Morrison could have easily expounded upon this idea in a thoughtful essay or short story, but instead she brings us the sprawling, complex, and beautifully rendered &quot;Beloved.&quot; That theme that runs through her wonderful novel is the main thing that stays with you after reading it, but for me the things about &quot;Beloved&quot; that still haunt me are the little moments: Paul D caressing his hands gently over Sethe's mangled back, Whitegirl massaging Sethe's feet back to life, the shadows holding hands on the way to the carnival. In a magnificent stroke, Morrison brings the emotional truth and point of her novel not through vast lines that stretch through the narrative, but through little &quot;smashed mirror&quot;-type moments and flashbacks that combine to form the final product. &quot;Beloved&quot; is fantastic as a collective experience, but reading the novel entails not just the psychological and emotional journey of its characters, but of the reader. Few books out there have such a devastating emotional impact as this one, and that lies within certain sentences, words, and moments that Morrison expertly crafts. You don't have to be African-American or a woman to enjoy this book - I'm an 18 year old white male and felt it meant as much to me as it would to an African American grown woman. That's the great thing about &quot;Beloved&quot; and all of Morrison's works (read them all- she hasn't written a bad one yet) - one needs not to match the characteristics of their protagonists, but simply be a member of the human race. That's what &quot;Beloved&quot; applies to, everyone on earth - we all have a past and moments within it that we'd rather have not exist. &quot;Beloved&quot; is a reminder to us all that those dark moments of our past will haunt our present AND future."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I orginally watched Beloved on video. While watching I had this feeling that parts were missing. Usually a movie based on a novel can not include every single detail because of time limitations. However, even with this mind and numerous rewinds I still couldn't get into the movie. So I tried reading Beloved and while many reviewers thought the story was powerful, moving, ect...I respectfully disagree. I found the story of Sethe to be dark, depressing and unsettling. Slavery was a horrible crime against African Americans it is an important part of American history and should never be sugar coated. With that said I think that Ms. Morrison wanted to paint a picture that showed to true horrors of slavery; the worse form of human suffing imaginalbe. especially the psychological aspects. Which she did but with less than inspiring or uplifting results. I am a competent reader and I thought the book was a difficult read. It wasn't the language that was hard or difficult it was Ms. Morrisons habit of jumping from one flashback to another and her over use of metaphors.I also simply could not relate to Sethe. I took an African American women history class in college and I know that there are factual accounts of slave women commiting infantcide but Ms. Morrisons horrible description of Sethe murdering her daughter as an alternative to having her taken back by the slavers that had abused her was too much. What Sethe indured was horrible but what she did to her daughter no matter what the reason was shocking and horrible. No wonder her spirit haunted Sethe."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Thats all I have to say about this book.

Ok, lets get this strait, Sethe killed her baby so her baby wouldn't go through being a slave. The ghost in the house is the baby, which is Beloved...is she back from the dead or what? Geez, maybe im stupid or something, but if you want a book that confuses you read this one. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved was unbelievable and drawn out.

I read a lot of Oprah Winfrey's book club materials and I was disapointed that she selected this one. I had a lot of empathy for the characters tragedies. After I finished the book the characters ordeals stayed in my mind, but overall I was left with a bad feeling. I refuse to even see the movie. This book did not deserve the recognization it received. It was an ok story, but nothing great. Toni Morrison appears to be very prejudiced and biased and it certainly comes out in her writing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read Beloved as an assignment for school and I was left completely confused. The novel, in its entirety, is overpowering and at times I found myself afraid to turn the page for fear of what I may read next. At other times, I had to flip back 5 pages and start sections over again because I was lost. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After reading the very first paragraph of the book, I immediately became intimidated, as well as confused. Who or what was 124? And what baby? And why was the child spiteful? I simply did not understand. Unfortunately, I never did truly &quot;catch on&quot; to the plot, and I feel that I still have missed a lot of concepts, symbols and relationships concerning the book. First of all, I would like to comment on Tony Morrison's style of writing. It seemed to me that she wrote down whatever came to he at the moment and never went back and arranged the chapter so that they made sense. Do not get me wrong, I love the imagery that she uses in subtlety but that is the very thing that is wrong with it, everything is too subtle! Morrison never goes into detail in this book and detail is the one thing that I need to comprehend a story. I did, however, enjoy the characters of the story. Their actions and dialogue seemed very life-like, as if Morrison had listened to real life conversations and written them down. The raw emotions that the characters emitted caused me, more that once, to ponder if they were indeed fictional. Paul D's character especially called to me. He was admirable yet I did not want to be like him. Morrison has created a one-of-a-kind ensemble that shines more and more with each page. Each character, though, has his or her own story and I felt that many of theose stories were not important to enough to be added to the collective plot. Morrison, for example, could have completely omitted the character of Stamp Paid. He had no real part in the plot and, if anything, he just added to my confusion. Instead, Morrison should have concentrated on developing another realationship, such as the one between Paul D and Denver. There was one small plot, though, that I did like: the story of Amy Denver of Boston. It was hard to decide which story to follow. It took me many times to figure out which was the correct &quot;path&quot; to take. Tony Morrison has written a very unique and puzzling book. It may take the reader more that one time to get all those little &quot;quirks&quot; that Morrison has added. I give one piece of advice to those who want to read the book: Read between the lines. It will save you a lot of time if you read the chapter again if you do not understand it. If anything, I have learned that you have to dig deep down into yourself and into the words of the book, to receive the full experience of this uncustomary book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"&quot;Beloved&quot; is not an easy read. Morrison's use of language was at first difficult to get used to, but I soon found myself slipping into the characters and really losing myself in the poetic flow of the story. Re-reading certain sections was not only necessary, but a joy to discover some little nuance that escaped me the first time.The subject of slavery, although not an original theme, is presented from such a personal perspective, and in such an intriguing plot line, that it hits home full force. Several times I found myself crying, yet unable to put down the book. It is incredibly moving and heartwrenching.I find the character of Sethe one of the most memorable and intriguing women I have encountered in fiction. Her wisdom, naivite, strengths and weaknesses all combine to form a contradiction in a believable and sympathetic heroine.I haven't seen the movie, but I'm sure it can't measure up to this excellent piece of original story-telling."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison was committed to describing and analyzing the black experience in the South. In here novels, she celebrates black women's strength and vitality and reveals their struggles. Regarded by many as Morrison's most successful novel, Beloved is the story of Sethe, a mother who kills her daughter Beloved rather than have her grow up as a slave. The book explores many complex themes, including black Americans' relationship to slavery. Morrison's use of multiple time frames such as, &quot;by 1873&quot; and &quot;for years,&quot; and wonderful occurrences (such as the reapprearance of Beloved) demonstrate her lyric storytelling abilities. Sethe, Paul D, Denver, and Baby Suggs were characters who experienced similar feelings as I. Throughout the novel these three-dimensional characters struggled to discover their true identities and purpose in life. From the outset of the story, I also struggled to understand what directive Morrison was communicating. Morrison's portrait of her characters and events is difficult to grasp. It is entirely up to the reader to conclude the meaning of an action, exposition, or dialogue. Because of this, it is arduous to remember chapters that were covered. Countless instances I consulted with my fellow classmates and instructor for their understanding of Morrison's intention through her diction. For example, I did not comprehend what was the &quot;tree&quot; on Sethe's back or what was &quot;a hot thing (p.212).&quot; This novel could not be left unfinished. For myself, I needed a closure to the story and an understanding of how Sethe conquered her heartbreaking challenges. At certain moments in the novel I question its merit for winning the 1988 Pulitzer Prize. Most times while reading the novel, it offered me no pleasure as a so-called &quot;masterwork of American literature,&quot; by John Leonard, Los Angeles Times. Instead, lewd situations caused me great discomfort. The school teacher's insolent comparision of Sethe to an animal is very disturbing. Furthermore, its salacious language is for mature audiences only. In your attempt to pursue Beloved, consider the views of your peers and other reviewers of the novel. Reading it alone or with no background on the story, is to your disadvantage. To achieve a total understanding and appreciation, it is important to share your opinions with others who have undertaken Beloved. Its readers must be patient, open-minded, and conscious of the intermittent course of events. This novel is recommended for readers who enjoy suspense and using their intellect."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After I seen Bloved and Read the Book, I never though that African American were treated very badly and neasty. This Movie made me remind of something that I never heard of it. Besicly this movie was about a dead child and her two run away sons."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What a sorry book to read right after I read Cold Mountain. I'm sorry, but this book does not agree with me!!! It does not make SENSE. The whole ghost concept was simply too unrealistic for me to swallow. It did have moments, like when the book talks about the tree on Sethe's back. Good! Great!!! But honestly, the book was very hard to follow at times. The ending, to me, was more than a little dissapointing. I suppose the overall explanation for the rating is I JUST DIDN'T like it!!! Like I said, Beloved can't even compare with Cold Mountain, which happens to be the best piece of literature on the planet. And if what they say is true, that films never measure up to the novel, oh, gosh... You couldn't PAY me to see that movie."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"It is may be considered vain for a high school student to disagree with the Noble Prize for literature, but in this case I'll risk it. Belved by Toni Morrison was hard to follow and even harder to like. Toni Morrison accomplishes her objective of showing the reader the horrors of slavery but the rest of the story is often silly. The book takes place in Post Civil War rural Cincinnati. It deals with such themes as isotion, guilt, remorse, and the supernatural. Another defect to this book is that the superatural seems out of place in this book. The book starts ordinarily and then a ghost appers. In Beloved, Toni Morrison overdoes her story making her book slow and unenjoyable. But diffrent strokes, some may love this novel but Ill stick by my negative criticism."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What will a mother do for her child? Will she die for it? Will she kill it herself to keep it from dying at the hands of others? At some point or time we all say we'll do whatever it takes for the health and happiness of our children and then the day arrives when either we eat these words or live up to them. Sethe lives and in a sense dies by them. This story is so full of metaphor and symbolism that a reader must bring something to the book in order to get something out of it. Toni Morrison has asked us a question and after reading this book some who thought they had the answer may want to re-think it. This tale, though gruesome and horrific is one of Ms Morrison's most fascinating and intriguing stories to date. We often ask what will love do for us, what does love have to give to us, when we should ask, what will we do for love?Toni Morrison gives us a glimpse into the world of a mother pushed to the ultimate limit. The reader is given an inside seat in this fascinating drama that was based on historical events. Morrison has given us a text that will challenge you all the way. After reading this book, you feel as if you were part of the story; one that should not be forgotten. This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone. The painful memories of Sethe will make you want to reach out and touch her. Paul D will bring tears to your eyes. Denver is the true heroine whose innocence will steal your heart away.This book engages you from the start. You cannot help but be swept up into the turmoil and pain of the characters. One of the best books I have read! It doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I am a fan of Orson Scott Card, who believes that if a writer has something to present, he should present it and quit hinting and beating around the bush. And I agree. But the entire time I read &lt;i&gt;Beloved,&lt;/i&gt; I felt as if there were a plethora of ideas that Toni Morrison wanted to get across, but she just WOULDN'T DO IT. And it drove me crazy. The story itself is actually very short, but it is told upwards of six times in flashback, each time with minutely more detail, which I guess would be fine had I been able to CARE about the story anymore by the time I got to the point where it was all explained. Basically this is a boring meaningless story about a woman who kills her daughter, but really ISN'T about a woman who kills her daughter say many critics; I think they're making it up. If it were possible to give this book ZERO stars I would do so."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I didn't think this book made much sense. It was hard to follow, kind of boring, and lacked depth. I feel bad saying that since it's on such a serious subject, but I believe it is critically acclaimed just because it is about slavery, not because it is well-written. Anything Oprah touches turns to gold, and she really tookd this one under her magic wings."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I have a very difficult time understanding Toni Morrison's style of writing. Since I could't understand her style I couldn't enjoy the content.I ended up returning it to the library without finishing it because it was horribly over due. I just couldn't bring myself to finish reading it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I HATE this book. Although technically well-written, in a lush imagistic style, its main character Sethe utterly disgusts me. She goes on and on, telling the reader irrelevant and sickening detail about her brutal life as a slave, while focusing on the most meaningless, useless, STUPID details in the present. Some of the supporting characters are no better. Do I really want to read about sex crimes on cows? NO!! This novel has all the finesse of a blind brachiosaur ramapaging through a china market; I threw it down in utter disgust by chapter. Its characters fail to gain any sympathy whatsoever from I, the reader, simply because their motivations are so petty, inconsequential, their observation so niggling and obsessive, their whole beings and selves STUPID and IGNORANT. This novel deserves to have a rating of -3 but unfortunately the scale doesn't go that low. As for the writer, she should have her prize taken away. Make that all her prizes!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"For my English class, I needed a specific edition of the book \\"Beloved.\\" Instead of the edition depicted, I got the WRONG edition."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Book came sooner then ever in great reading condition as mentioned.

Beloved looks beneath the surface of the plantation life. Morrison lets everyone see the horrors of life for African-American people as chattel slaves. She also exposes the horrors for African-American people living in reconstruction. Beloved could easily extend out to Jim Crow living or 21st century living of African-American people in the United States. Beyond the social statements that beloved makes, there is the quality of the literature.

Antebellum slavery is a subject that reveals terriying events true enough. The culture of the movie reveals a delusion of a dead child coming back in the spirit. A dead grandmother coming back in the spirit, a delusion of a dead child being revealed in a spirit and being able to speak, eat, talk, and grow into adulthood and have sexual pleasure and then was able to conceive a child is very delusional. But myserious. I'm not even so sure that the culture of this part in the movie Beloved is all ancesor worship but surely this movie revealed that when you die you come back in the spirit and are able to make known your presence in the world. That the spirit is able to create a delusion and can communicate with the living. Makes you wonder if when all die, the wolrd will be a world of spirits living under strong delusions. The counscious coninues to live on and can create a delusion for self and for others?This movie reveals a practice that not all races practice but is focused on the black race as practicing this type of Religon during antebellum slavery. I do not agree that all of the black ancestors practice this religion. But every culture religous practice is pasted on to each generation.

THE WRITER'S USE OF STREAM OF CONSCIENCE AS A WRITING STYLE IS PUT TO PERFECT USE."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was an awful book for any number of reasons. Which to choose? The graphic sexual descriptions that are so overwhelmingly uncalled for? The outrageous imagery--I read books because I want to read a story with gripping characters, not so an author can try to be clever and symbolic. The ridiculous characters, whether it's Sethe who, despite being described as strong, manages to make every illogical choice possible (and doesn't realize her relation to Beloved...it's not that common a name), Denver, who stayed inside and was friends exclusively with a ghost for 10 years, or Beloved herself, who appears to be a fat uncaring selfish girl that's stalking Sethe. You were dead for 18 years, accept it already!Paul D and Stamp Paid were the only two characters I didn't hate. And that's not to say I liked them. They somehow managed to seem like unimportant characters in the book, and had some serious, ridiculous, mental issues.I'm also tired of reading about slavery. Slavery was awful. I'm glad we all understand that. Exactly what I don't need is a black woman writing a book in which black people make bad decisions and who, combined, don't appear to have the sense of a four year old to make a case against blacks. I interpret this as yet another person saying \\"Feel bad for black people\\", which I do, the ones that were slaves. But no one alive played a part in either enslaving or being a slave, so it's time to move on. And even if it weren't for that, what is being accomplished by depicting these blacks as animal-like, unrefined, unintelligent individuals?The time period jumped around too much, the imagery and symbolism was absurd....Overall, I found nothing whatsoever in this book that was at all redeeming. My theory: The good literary devices, the ones that aren't obnoxious, but that still do their job, the author didn't put those in on purpose. People analyzed the book and found those accidents. I think crap is being given too much credit.I should mention that this is not Toni Morrison's only failure. Every book she writes involves crude, explicit sexuality that is completely unnecessary, and is focused on black people. If racism is going to end, it needs to go both ways. A black woman writing about blacks being abused by whites isn't exactly progress."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book epitomizes undeserved recognition for something that is for shock factor. I had to read this in college in a Modern novel course, and out of all the great reads, this was by far the worst!

It's amazing to me how much people talk about this book (or Song of Solomon which i had to read an hated) b/c there is nothing valuable in here. Go read something good like \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" \\"Sister Carrie,\\" anything else, please!!!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book is really disturbing and filled with emotional persuassion which has no basis in fact. It is very hard to understand and is not worth the read. If a child wrote a book like this - they would probably get hauled off to iron bars for being psychotic. The book is not interesting. If you really want to find out about it - watch the movie. This book is a political sham of fictitious events &amp; emotions."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I believe that Toni Morrison made this book to see how people are stupid.There is no verisimilitude. Some sentences are void of meaning.I am not impressed at all and I regret if she is the best author the U.S. can produce (Nobel Prize.)This is not even fantastic.She has the quality of a journalist, and knowledge, and technics from her experiences, but she has no talent as a writer.Overuse of punctuation -- a writer doesn't use punctuation for a meaning like the ';' for the rupture between Sethe and her kids. This is overuse of technics and some sentences mean nothing at all.I think it is a mock-novel ! (to see how people can like something evily done)"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I must admit I was a little bored with this book. Of course it properly has some litteray qualities, which the litteraty people dig, but my god, some of the books these people like, especially the contemporary ones, I just sometimes find absolutely and utterly endless boring! Well apparently Beloved is a ghost. The setting is some black guys who are slaves in the middle of the 19th. century. What I also found boring about this book is that these black guys don't really seem to be going anywhere. Admittedly, it's properly hard to live an inspired life if you are a slave, but anyway... So in this book, this ghost Beloved appear from time to time and otherwise the book descripe the everyday life of the black people. As said they don't really appear to go anywhere, so the book is much about what they do in their daily life, like having dinner. I think it is something like 10 times during the book that their meals are described. A somewhat surprising reference coming to mind concerning this book is the Japanese writer Yasunari Kawabata. Belowed has some of the same indirectness in the language as Yasunari Kawabata employ in his book Snow Country. I think the greatest strength of Beloved is the poetic and rhythmic language. I guess the author has a musical talent, so perhaps I would have enjoyed her more if she had employed her talent in music rather than litterature."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is an extremely frustrating book. Too many flashbacks, too much illogic, and too little cohesion. Beloved never decides what it wants to be: Is it a ghost story? Is it a study of the afteraffects of slavery?

Shows how far american lit still needs to go."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved was written by Toni Morrison a world renowned author who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Morrison has an uncanny ability to bring her characters to life. You may feel as if you know a character because their emotions, actions, and responses to events are similar to the people around us everyday. Sethe, a hard working mother, portrays mothers today with a strong love for her children. The children she loves so much are Denver and Beloved, with Beloved being the spirit of her dead baby. Sethe and Denver live in 124, a house in rural Ohio. At the start of the book \\"124 was spiteful\\", but then it became loud and in the ending it was quiet. When \\"124 was spiteful\\" Sethe and Denver lived alone in the house, except for the presence of Beloved who was Sethe's dead baby. Beloved comes back and makes life difficult for the family. In the end she mysteriously leaves and Sethe along with Denver feel as if Beloved hadn't actually been there. Beloved is a very difficult book to read, time changes, symbols and dialogue make comprehending a not so easy task.Time changes occur throughout the book and at times you may not know what is going on because it is so abrupt. The first time change you see is in chapter one when Sethe is talking to Denver about the spirit. It then jumps to when Sethe was having a man engrave the name of her baby on the headstone which was a past memory. From chapter 14 to 15 there was a major time change. It starts with Beloved crying to Denver, then goes to Baby Suggs taking care of Sethe's beat up body when she came to 124 with newborn Denver. The gap between those two events was about 18 years. Time changes make it confusing as to when the events actually happened, because some time shifts are short and in the middle of an event going on in the story.Symbols contribute greatly to the difficulty of the reading, because not knowing what they mean can lead you to different conclusions about an event. When you hear \\"tin can\\" you think of a metal can not a persons heart. The old rusted tin can referred to Paul D's heart and how he thought it would never be opened to reveal his past memories and inner feelings. Another symbol was \\"men without skin\\", you can imagine just what it says, a man without any skin. It is actually Morrison's choice of words to say, white men. \\"Men without skin\\" comes about because Beloved thinks African-Americans are people with skin and the whites were people without skin due to their color.Dialogue like \\"men without skin\\" makes comprehending the story even harder than it already is. \\"Rememory\\", and \\"thought picture\\" are words Morrison uses to mean simple things. \\"Rememory\\" is Sethe's word for remembering the past and \\"thought picture\\" is the image Sethe has of certain past events or maybe even dreams. The word choice in Morrison's work is crucial to the tone of the story, but it also brings confusion.Time changes, symbols, and dialogue all contribute to the difficulty of reading Beloved. It is hard to understand if you don't know the meaning of the symbols and get lost in a multitude of time changes. Morrison definitely has a unique style of writing which brings out the life in the story. If anybody else wrote the story it wouldn't have the same effect Morrison has on her readers. Would I recommend this book to people? Well if you are the type of person who gets frustrated easily with a play on words, and you don't catch on to symbols, this book is not for you. If you are the type of person who enjoys reading a story with twists, and a much deeper meaning, this book is definitely for you. Overall Beloved is an interesting story with twists and turns which could take you on an unforgettable journey."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a deceptively small book in heft and size. Even the story, on the surface, covers a short span of time - from that day Paul D walks in the door at 124 and chases the ghost away to the day, less than a year later, of his return. But the novel is anything but small. It's dense with imagery, rich and twisting language, and Magical Realism. It casts a spell, engaging the reader as only Morrison can do, inviting her to follow the labyrinth of memory, storytelling, and repetition to the center and out again.Beloved has been called many things -- a ghost story, a story about slavery in America, a love story. It is all these. Its central figure, Sethe, an ex-slave living in Cincinnati, had a short taste of freedom and happiness before binding herself in guilt and grief. The reason for her grief is the reason for the ghost that haunts her home and for the solitary life she lives with her daughter, Denver. And it is this mystery that unfolds in a winding trail of \\"rememory\\" and storytelling that begins with the entrance of Paul D, a man Sethe knew from a plantation called Sweet Home, and Beloved, a young woman who appears one day leaning on a stump in the yard.If you like linear - beginning, middle, ending - novels, don't read this one unless you relish something different. This is a story \\"shaped and decorated\\" over and over by different voices, different characters, even the same character retelling it. Through all the circling narrative, we come to know the characters deeply and, because of this, the emotional power of the novel is tremendous. The subject of slavery alone is disturbing, and by presenting it through Sethe's eyes and the eyes, ears and thoughts of her community, Morrison demonstrates its brutality and far-reaching devastation, as well as the soaring and crippling power of human love.Some parts of the novel, particularly the chapters written entirely from Beloved's point of view, are challenging. She seems to embody more than Sethe's dead child with her broken narrative of \\"crouching\\" and \\"men without skin\\" and the dead man on her face. The poetic language and the images evoke the horrors of slave holds in ships at sea. Later, the poetry of the entwined voices of the three women - Beloved, Sethe, Denver - is startling and uncomfortable. The swallowing has begun. The question at first is who is swallowing whom?A few reviewers found Beloved to be too difficult, or worse -- a waste of time. It is definitely a thinking person's book. Morrison requires you to engage in the story, to become part of it. It is this capacity for participation that I find so amazing about her writing, as well as her incredible use of language. If you want to read a novel that will invite you to think, feel and be changed, read this one. It will walk you through its neighborhoods and ask you to engage open-heartedly with its characters, to hear their stories long before you ever understand the one story you set out to read. Beloved deserves all the acclaim it has received."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison explores the depths of maternal love in 'Beloved', and in doing so creates a stunning and unique literary work, fully deserving of the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes it won. After escaping slavery and reestablishing herself in Ohio with her children, Sethe is thrown into a murderous rage when attempts at recapture are made, and kills her eldest child--the only way to ensure her daughter's freedom. The child then returns--as spirit and as full grown woman--to reclaim her mother's love. More than a ghost story, Beloved is a novel about unconditional love, family ties, the enduring scars of slavery, and the strength of a people, when joined as a community, to abolish any form of evil. But it is the writing that makes this novel so special, evoking another time, reading like poetry, and allowing the story to unfold almost like a mystery. Sure, it's no easy read, but it's highly enjoyable and definitely worth it in the end."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"It's taken me over a year to formulate my reaction to Beloved. I've browsed the reviews of this book and noticed that most readers either loved it or were left somewhat confused by it. Although it took me a while to be able to articulate my thoughts and feelings on this experience; it wasn't confusion that bound by tongue, its just that it took my brain a while to understand intellectually what my soul spewed forth emotionally. Intellectually, Beloved is challenging and thought-provoking. To be able to follow the characters cognitive processes through, flash backs, recollection and prophesizing is an intellectual accomplishment in itself. Emotionally, the book is invigorating, stimulating feelings that can't be verbalized, only integrated into the spirit of my being making me that much more compassionate, empathic, and free. I return to Beloved to read Baby Suggs, woodland service whenever I need to replenish my reservoir of hope, and strength.It is a complex book, but so is the subject matter. To be able to explore the experience of the enslaved, the mentality of the enslaver, is no simple matter. I saw the movie prior to reading the book. The movie left me speechless. The book returned my voice. Beloved is enriching, captivating. It's certainly a prize novel and I'm pleased that the Nobel Committee was able to recognize it. Kudos to Morrision for delivering this experience to the world."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved. Well what can I say. I'd have to begin by saying it is an incredibly difficult and confusing book. To enjoy this book you have to want to read it, and to be a good reader. It is about Sethe, an escaped slave, who is haunted by her dead baby daughter Beloved. It is a very disturbing book which really effected me as the reader. It is almost unbelievable simply because you don't want to believe the horror of what the black slaves went through, but also because of the haunting. It is filled with many spiritual ideas, symbolism and hidden meanings which make it a challenging but delightful read. It took me quite a long time to read but it kept me really intruiged and amazed. It is very sad, not depressing as some have said, but really plays with the emotions. It is full of dispair and a thread of hoplessness runs throughout the book, however it is eventually uplifting. It made me think, long and hard, which is what a good book does. It is important for such things, such as the horror of slavery to be remembered, and it is great that it can be remembered in such an incredibl book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"When I first read 'Beloved,' I found it complex &amp; uninvolving, yet through careful reading &amp; attention to Morrison's beautiful style, the rewards of this story are immense. A contemporary classic which sheds personal light on a horrible part of American history."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As an adult college undergrad, I was embarrassed that I hadn't read Morrison before being introduced to Beloved in a Literature class. I was unprepared for the power of the novel. Morrison wastes no sentence or word, and uses them to express pure emotion. It is not her intention to &quot;tell a story&quot;. As a parent who has lost a child, I was riveted by Morrison's on-target depiction of the soul-searing experience of such a loss, and the way the grief consumes you until you can come to terms with it (the &quot;ghost&quot; of Beloved). This also was the first time I really understood and began to &quot;feel&quot; the horror of slavery. I am not uneducated on the facts, but never before knew the depth of the horror. For those who found the book too difficult or unclear, Morrison describes her story-telling as if you had come to a town and learn about it by meeting people along the way. No one will sit you down and tell the town's narrative in historical sequence. You gather the story as people recall the bits and pieces. Give the book another chance - reread it. When you begin again you already know the story and the words will not be so mysterious."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"Beloved\\" is a powerful, and I will admit, pretentious book. Morrison has taken the overdone theme of American slavery, and given it a unique and eloquent new resonance. However, at the same time the book reads as if it were designed as \\"great or significant literature\\" and that detracts from the novel's accessibility and possible audience.This is not a text that one can read and not be fully committed to. It is also a text that gets richer on rereading, and I only hope that more people give it that chance.Oddly, the book's power transcends most of its characters. Although they are interesting, and at times painfully real, it is the almost poetical manner in which Morrison renders their views and thoughts that leaves the reader breathless. Too often slavery has been glossed over with the focus on its physical marks and manifestations. Morrison makes the emotional scars and the lack of human dignity the real abuse, and it is in taking that approach that Morrison transcends the historical or generational limitations that this subject could impose on readers. Anyone who has felt the sting of indignity or the lack of companionship will find relevance in this novel. Morrison's former slaves are forced into these situations by their former and current circumstances, but we can all connect to the emotional content of most of their story. It is the oldest story around. People needing other people, and a sense of self worth. We all get that. The novel's hopeful ending nicely ties up the horror that preceded it.The strength of \\"Beloved\\" is its amazing use of figurative language. Yet, the ambiguity and ethereal nature of certain sections may leave some readers scratching their heads. If that happens, put it down, come back to it later, and read it again."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Dave Eggers, semi-tongue in cheek, titled his autobiography A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. That phrase fits Beloved perfectly. Toni Morrison brilliantly tells a devastating but ultimately uplifting story. Her ability to imagine the psychological consequences of living in a society where you're not seen as human, and to take us inside the selves of those who have been so treated, is truly heartbreaking. The writing and storytelling are stellar. The characters and their choices are unforgettable.This book can be difficult to read, not just emotionally but also stylistically. We shift between different characters' viewpoints, and between past and present. It takes some effort to \\"get\\" what's happening, and that may account for some of the hostility of some Amazon user reviewers. But this is not an \\"emperor's new clothes\\" book, as some here have charged. Morrison well deserves her Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes, and Beloved has earned its place at the top of the New York Times list of the best American novels of the past 25 years.Read Beloved to admire Morrison's artistry, to grow as a person, and to face more deeply our nation's history. It's a great choice for courageous book groups that welcome a challenge."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"When coming across Morrison's novel \\"Beloved,\\" the reader encounters a similar narration to that of Faulkner in \\"The Sound of the Fury. Morrison's choice of a circular structure makes her characters more memorable as they lead fragmented lives. Like Faulkner, Morrison utilizes the technique referred to as stream of conciousness which often confuse the reader. However, I found this technique effective and more captivating than a straighforward read. With Morrison I had to piece together the fragmented information to arrive to a conclusion.While Morison's structure kept me interested, her narration of the consequences of slavery remained effective. Morrison utilized imagery throughout the novel to form an image of the horror of slavery. For example, Morrison compares Sethe's wounds to a chokecherry tree. Rather than simply stating the oozing wounds on Sethe's back in a straighforward manner the author uses this powerful imagery to form a vivid picture of that disturbing event in the reader's mind.Furthermore, the reader encounters the issue of racism when the schoolteacher refers to slaves as animals. The schoolteacher considers slaves creatures to be handled similar to dogs and cattle. Slaves were told they were subhuman and were traded as commodities whose worth could be expressed in dollars.Morrison utilizes other techniques and literary devices througout the novel. Her narrative unlike other works is not the typical slavery book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"There are enough rehashes of plot in the other 400+ reviews that I won't go over it again. Instead, I'd like to share why I think this novel works. As a white person, my ideas about slavery have come from the same sources I would suspect most others have visited: history books, television, and movies. In my experience, these options have diluted the concept of slavery to &quot;it was terrible&quot; and &quot;it's over.&quot; Even Roots, groundbreaking for its time, did not for me get to the heart of what slavery might really have been about.Beloved reached me. It changed me. Why so effective? Because it starts out with a story about slavery that is very Gone With the Wind in tone, very comfortable for white folks to read. And, little by little, the real horrors of slavery are revealed, so incrementally that when you get to the worst of it, you find you are drowning in sorrow without realizing you'd waded in. An immediate in-your-face depiction of the tragedy that is slavery could have been literally shocking - causing the reader to withdraw into a more psychologically secure place, a place where one could say &quot;this is just a book&quot; without truly absorbing the tragedy. Morrison wisely opts for a more subtle, gradual approach that drags you in and reveals exactly why slavery will simply not go away because it has died, but must be actively confronted to be put to rest. For me, that is the metaphor of this more-than-a-ghost story.After reading this book, I will never again be able to say &quot;slavery is over and we all need to move on.&quot; This book has put the cyclical and hereditary tragedy of slavery into the same light as child abuse; how many generations does it take to stamp out the repercussions of abuse? and how many will it take to stamp out the repercussions of the systematic abuse of an entire race?Morrison doesn't provide the answer, but she finally got me asking the right questions. At the risk of sounding fatally P.C., I really believe all white people should read this book to get an understanding of why we, as a nation, have not &quot;gotten over it and moved on,&quot; and will not until we confront what actually happened, instead of what we're comfortable remembering."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison has saved my life. Her novels are not only beautiful and compelling, they are life-changing if you let them be. Every novel works on a number of levels; historical, emotional, interpersonal. Their meanings can also be highly personal and moralistic.I first read the novel at the age of 15 and I have read beloved three or four times as an adult. Each time I read I uncover more. I have never been dissapointed by Morrison,but this is the best of her works."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Set right in the midst of slavery, Beloved is a peek of exactly how slavery was then. Toni Morrison shows us the realistic and horrific life of a slave in the 1870's. She gives the story a romantic twist in the middle of the novel by introducing the most important character, Beloved. Sethe, the \\"mother\\" of Beloved, gives the perspective of a strong willed woman (most of the time); other times we see her weaknesses. Baby Suggs is also this way. Baby Suggs is a very powerful, independent woman, who happens to be the greatest mother-in-law ever. Denver is the daughter of Sethe, who is very much like her mother. She creates a special bond with Beloved that no one else understands. All of the main characters are female, except for Paul D, who isn't even around as much as the women. This creates a feministic point of view on everything. We see the women grow and overcome challenges throughout the novel. It seems that the females are the only ones who escape for freedom. They all got away from Sweet Home, while the majority of the males didn't. When they had lived in 124, Sethe's two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. This may have been because of the \\"ghost\\" that haunted the house they lived in. Paul D, also leaves when things get tough. He discovers what Sethe did, and he leaves the house. Halle, who was Sethe's husband, just never made it to the 124. We see the female power here in many ways. Just from the way Sethe made it all the way to 124, walking and very pregnant. These strong women make an important statement on how freedom changed their lives.The past, the future, regrets, memories, dreams play a huge role in the life of a free slave. Toni Morrison bounces back and forth between the past, present and future. This style shows just how important memories and dreams are for a freed slave. Sethe is especially sensitive to this. She has a difficult time recollecting the past. Beloved comes into the story to help her remember. It is easy for Sethe to tell stories to Beloved about the past. Beloved is truly important. Is she really the ghost of Sethes baby, who she murdered? How can it be proven? Whether she is or is not, she still changes Sethe as if she were practicing her revenge. A combination of the realistic horrors of slavery to the mythical side of ghosts creates a balance of genres. This romantic, feminist, hysterical realism creates a memorable novel to read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I finished reading Beloved by Toni Morrison. I must say that it is one of the best books I have ever read. The emotions are so raw, and the descriptions very realistic. It doesn't try to sugarcoat slavery. It doesn't just give you facts like a history book - it gives you the ugly truth about how many slaves were treated, and the struggles that they had emotionally, physically, and socially even after they became free. I cannot express how this book affected me. It centers around the story of Sethe, an escaped, and later free, slave. The book is partially told through her eyes and \\"rememories\\" as she calls them, and partially by those around her - her mother-in-law Baby Suggs, her daughter Denver, and Paul D., another ex-slave who escaped from Sweet Home (the farm she escaped from.) Then there is the mysterious Beloved, a woman who appears at Sethe's house with few memories of where she came from or how she got there. This book is, in many ways, a very disturbing account of the lives of slaves and ex-slaves. But it is also a story of overcoming the scars and fears left by the characters' experiences, and the coming together of a community to help some of their own. A winner of the Pulitzer Prize (Ms. Morrison has also been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature,) this novel is definitely an important, and relevant work of historical fiction. It is also a controversial novel which has been banned or contested in many places due to its depictions of violence, sex, language, and, surprisingly, racism. Rather than banning it, I think all high school students should be required to read it. It gives the very ugly depiction of slavery and the aftermath of having been a slave. I think school history books gloss over this part in their glorious re-telling of the Civil War (or, as many Southerners call it, The War of Northern Aggression.) That is one of my biggest problems with school history - they give you facts and dates, and nice little descriptions of what people wore and ate, but they never get into the real lives of people. I guess that is why literature is so important. I think history and literature should be taught together. If you are learning about the Civil War, you should be reading literature from and about that time period. If you are learning about 18th Century England, you should be reading Jane Austen and her contemporaries. Literature brings history to life, and Beloved is a prime example of that."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I must say that Toni Morrison is indeed one of my top three favorite authors. When I first saw this movie at the time of its release, I must admit, I didn't really enjoy it. I thought it was hard to follow in that format and the recollections disjointed. The novel, however, especially Ms Morrison's reading of it is totally the opposite. I am thoroughly enjoying it, soaking up the experiences presented, and recommending to anyone who will listen (no pun intended). I will watch the movie again when I'm finished the the audio book, and I've already pre-ordered her upcoming novel. She is an inspirational author!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"One of the chief virtues of Beloved is that it bestows interior lives to its characters born into slavery, and poses the difficult question of a mother's responsibility to her slave-born child. Based on the story of Margaret Garner, an escaped slave who killed her child rather than have her captured and raised within that \\"peculiar institution,\\" Morrison imagines a sort of historical ghost story in which the title character reemerges from a watery death, complicating the riven lives of her mother Sethe, the daughter Denver, and Paul D, a fellow slave who returns to live with Sethe.The author describes the inhumane practices under slavery--the horse bit placed in Paul D's mouth, a literal voicelessness, and the scars on Sethe's back that form a \\"chokecherry tree\\"--slavery as a form of commerce (Stamp Paid is the name of another character), but, as with her other novels, Morrison is intent, too, on showing the manifest varieties of love: in this case, how love can be limited and circumscribed by oppressive circumstances. \\"The best thing . . . was to love just a little bit,\\" thinks Paul D.[...]"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Morrison has the remarkable ability to describe terrible and horrific events in a poetically beautiful way. I think this book might have been unpalatable in the hands of a less skilled writer. As it is, most of it is completely heartbreaking, but ultimately hopeful. This is an important book and I'm glad I've read it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This Pulitzer Prize winning novel is certainly not the kind of book I would ordinarily take on. Written by Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, it can be a chore at times, but nevertheless was surprisingly able to keep my attention throughout.The setting is immediate post Civil War Ohio, with numerous flashbacks and remembrances from the period preceding the War. Sethe, the main character, was a slave at the Kentucky Sweet Home plantation. She escaped with her children (three, with one in the oven) in a harrowing adventure, giving birth along the way. She is ultimately tracked down and due to the Dred Scott decision faces repatriation with her family. In response, she murders her oldest daughter rather than see her subjected to slavery, but is stopped before she can complete her plan to kill herself and all her children.After the war, she lives in an old two story home that is actively haunted by the spirit of her dead daughter, Beloved. The haunting has led her two sons to flee, but her daughter Denver remains. She is joined by one of the men from Sweet Home; then a mysterious, young stranger appears, named Beloved. It is clearly the physical manifestation of her long dead daughter.As you would expect from a novel written by a Nobel Laureate, the prose is florid and rich with imagery and symbolism. There are brief periods of stream of consciousness narrative that were incomprehensible to me. Nevertheless, the story is intriguing and much of the history is very powerful and compelling. I took on the novel with somewhat low expectations (not of the book, but for my capacity to appreciate it) but emerged very pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"It's difficult to write a review of Beloved without issuing spoiler warnings. The plot does not really have unexpected twists but rather things are slowly revealed. It leads you places and finally confirms your suspicions.This is a story of slavery but is very originally structured and adds a lot more. The main character is Sethe, a very strong woman who has conviction in her opinions despite being shunned by others for something that she does. Others see her actions as deranged but for her, they are the ultimate expression of a mother's love. She is a very powerful and complex character.This novel is not straightforward and adds magical details as if they are quite normal. It's like One Hundred Years of Solitude or Midnight's Children in that sense.There are a couple of passages that are very simple but made me feel some of the pain of the characters. The scene where Paul D is bound with a bit in his mouth and is looking at a rooster and realizes that the rooster believes itself to superior to him causes him shame. It is a simple scene and I found it to be heartbreaking.Moreso than just describe the cruelty of slavery, Beloved describes how it made human beings feel. This is far more powerful than just descriptions of inhumanity.This was a very powerful novel thematically and had wonderful moments. I didn't really love some of the scenes with the character Beloved.In 2006, the NY Times book review asked several critics, pundits, experts etc. what the best American novel of the last 25 years was. Beloved was the most mentioned novel. I can certainly see it in the running but my opinion of it is just short of that.I definitely recommend it though for its emotional power and originality."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was my first Toni Morrison book. I got it based on her reputation and a newspaper review I read (in my local newspaper) and while I didn't expect it to he written in this style (which I understand is why some people leave negative reviews for this or Toni's other works)It was a bit hard for me at first because like I said, this was my first Toni Morrison book, so I was unused to the style. But the plot itself was coherent enough for me, and some of the scenes and characterizations are very vivid - this book is NOT for the weak of heart as it describes some of the horrible things done to slaves in a raw manner. The ending was just a bit confusing, I wish there had been more of a real resolution, after all Denver and Sethe had been through at the hands of the dead baby. I also saw the movie, which was very good....Oddly enough, I noticed right after I posted this review that my review is number 666 for this book. That's so weird..."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Having read and enjoyed Sula by Toni Morrison, I was excited to finally pick up a copy of Beloved. In this book Sethe and her daughter Denver live alone in a house in Ohio shortly after the Civil War. Sethe's two sons, run away from home by the time they are thirteen.The house is haunted by the ghost of Sethe's 2 year old unnamed baby, simply known as Beloved. The haunting is severe and poltergeist-like, Beloved throws things, the house rattles and shakes, yet Sethe refuses to leave. No one visits Sethe and Denver, they don't want to go near the house, everyone knows it is haunted.One day, an old acquaintance of Sethe's, a man named Paul D, shows up at her doorstep. The two become involved right away. Paul D knew Sethe years ago when she was first married and lived on a plantation before they were freed. He is happy to reconnect with her all these years later.Not shortly after, a woman shows up in front of Sethe's home. Something about her is different, she can't talk much, is very sleepy and her skin is baby soft. When asked her name, she simply spells out the word, 'Beloved'.Sethe lets Beloved into her home, gives her a place to sleep and takes her in for the time being. The family just figures she is a wanderer with no place to go. Beloved soon becomes obsessed with Sethe, and Sethe herself thinks of Beloved as her own child.So many scenes stood out for me. One part in particular is when Denver walks in on her mother kneeling by her bed, praying, and sees a baby's white dress next to her, hugging Sethe around her waist. Just the thought of how this baby ghost still clings to her mother, and how even in death, mother and child are forever connected, gave me chills while reading.Several scenes in this book also shocked me. If you've read this one, you know what I mean. As shocking as it was, I did enjoy this read. The characters are well written, the plot was excellent, the writing was fantastic and I found myself not wanting to put this book down. This is the kind of book that once you are done reading, you kind of just sit back and think about it. It's the kind of read you want to discuss."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"Beloved\\" is full of unexpected, eccentric events that revolve around the black community and 124, a house haunted by the spirit of a spiteful baby. Throughout the novel, haunting memories of slavery's inhumanity torment the four main characters, Sethe, Paul D., Denver, and Beloved. The aftermath of slavery, as this suspenseful novel reveals, is extremely brutal and destructive to each character's life. As the story transit from past to present in an unordered pattern, the true desires and values of the characters are slowly unmasked.This novel requires deep understanding and reflection upon each ideas and events. An excessive amount of symbolic and metaphoric images are included within this novel, causing the reader to think beyond the surface of logical meaning. The supernatural aspects of the story, such as Beloved being a reincarnation of the dead baby's spirit, push the limit of readers' ordinary understanding. Morrison's use of poetic, vivid, and intense words help to create the tone of fear, anguish, and admiration.Love, slavery, and motherhood are joined in \\"Beloved\\" to create emotional inspiration. Set in the years following Civil War in rural Ohio, the destruction of relationships, motherly love, and self-identity is clarified to be caused by the brutality of slavery. Sethe, escaping from slavery, struggles to break free from the cruel memories of her past as an owned property. Despite her freedom, she has difficulties leaving behind her past including the child whom she had killed, physical and mental scars that she finds impossible to heal, and the stories of Paul D. and Sweet Home.I believe that through this novel, Toni Morrison attempts to prevent the extreme sufferings of the slaves from being forgotten due to forced silence. I strongly recommend this passionate and deep novel to everyone, especially for those interested in mystery and suspense."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"One of America's greatest modern writers hits a homerun with this novel. Those who have heard of Toni Morrison but perhaps been a bit intimidated by her literary reputation can be advised that this book is as good a read as any and just as accessible on various levels. On the most basic level, this book is a ghost story.It begins with Sethe, an ex-slave who has found her way to Ohio. Behind her she left Sweet Home, as close a utopia as one can get for a slave-master relationship. Sweet Home contains a past that begins positively, (Sethe is able to choose her husband and is left alone by the other men on the plantation). Yet as the novel continues the reader learns the darker side of Sweet Home which developed after the master passed away and the mistress became too ill to take care of the plantation. Ahead of her in Ohio Sethe has several children who eventually leave and a one Baby Suggs, her husband's mother, who evolves from a type of minister to a dying woman who has denounced the white world completely. Left in the house is Denver, her young daughter and Sethe. It is implied that her boys have left home because they couldn't stand it anymore. \\"It\\" is the spirit that has inhabited their home for several years. It takes many shapes and forms, and has become a sort of companion for the lonely Denver. Its presence is short lived once Paul D, a survivor from the Sweet Home days, arrives. He cannot stay in the home as long as she is there and physically removes her spiritual presence. But the ghosts presence revisits the home, this time in the form of a young woman. She has the mental and physical capacity of a toddler, and becomes a permanent fixture in the home of Sethe, Beloved and Paul D. Who this mystery woman is and what she represents is the great mystery of the book, one that is solved by the readers early, and by the other characters later. Unlocking her mystery will take a community effort, one that hasn't been seen around Sethe's house for over a decade.This novel is a great exploration of the past, present and future and how those three interact with each other within the hearts and minds of the characters. Sethe must understand her past in order to have a future and this struggle is played out in dramatic turns which credit Morrison's creative genius. At times this book seems almost epic in size. Morrison flies back in time with every turn of the page. As a result, the reader understands characters' entire histories, and one feels as if they have known them for quite some time.Morrison's non-linear writing can at times be intimidating for the reader. Yet for those who stick with the book they will be heavily rewarded. Her language use and non-traditional sentence structure left this reader in awe. Descriptions are unique, honest, and accurate. She describes the trials of an ex-slave with seemingly effortless grace.I highly recommend this book to both veterans of Morrison's work as well as new comers. She has mastered the art of story-telling and has something to offer for every type of reader. She will long be remembered as a shaping force for contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Having recently earned a BA in English from a historically black college, I was more than familiar with Toni Morrison's work. My best friend and I had a joke--the black female English Ph.D.'s we knew had an alternate Holy Trinity which included Morrison, Alice Walker, and Zora Neale Hurston. Even before college, I went to an almost all-black K-8 TAG academy (where I read Sula), and then a college prep high school (where I read The Bluest Eye).I say all that just so that you'll understand where I'm coming from. I'd read just about everything considered to be a classic in the African-American canon. But I boycotted two books: Richard Wright's Native Son and Toni Morrison's Beloved. (FAMU, don't revoke my degree!) I am black and proud of that fact, but I am also an aesthete. The barbarism I'd heard about that was central to the plots of these novels sickened me.But then last night we rented Beloved. I watched it. In two hours I experienced every emotion known to man.The minute I turned it off, I ran to my personal library and picked up my own copy of Beloved. (Every self-respecting English grad student owns this book, at least for appearance's sake.) It took me four hours to finish.I did not find the book a difficult read at all. At long last, the story was clear as spring water before my eyes. I devoured every word.Demonic? Yes, it was. Very much so. But the institution of slavery was demonic. Anyone who wants to pretends that it was otherwise is &quot;a liar, and the truth is not in him.&quot;Offensive to some whites? Good. I'm glad it was. America isn't Candyland. Neither is its history and legacy the fifth Gospel some would have you to believe.Beloved challenged me both as a literary scholar and an aspiring novelist. Every educated person should read this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Some reviewers would have you believe that Beloved is a pretentious, over rated, convoluted mess. (Many of these reviewers appear to have read the novel as assigned reading for a class). Other reviewers will tell you the novel is a haunting, provocative literary achievement.I agree with the latter (I gave it 5 stars) but I understand the criticism to a degree. The subject matter is disturbing and the narrative flow can be difficult to follow. The novel is told through the eyes of multiple characters and much of the story is pieced together through their memories. Morrison's writing, it could be argued, is too aware of itself. In particular, a series of \`stream of consciousness' chapters near the end of the novel are dense and elusive, reminiscent of some of Faulkner's work. Detractors may claim that these chapters are nothing more than an overtly pretentious attempt at \`high brow' literature.I disagree. I was spellbound by Morrison's mesmerizing prose and in particular was captivated by those same impressionistic chapters. Morrison effectively conveys the de-humanizing nature of slavery but resists the urge to be heavy handed about it. Her characters, both black and white, oppressor and oppressed, are fully realized, imperfect human beings. Morrison's narrative allows both victim and oppressor to confront their pasts.This is a powerful novel that forces the reader to confront the horrifying legacy of slavery. Resurrecting the past is painful and can be difficult to content with, but the past should not be ignored or forgotten."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's 1988 Pulitzer Prize winner, Beloved, completely caught me off guard. I finally understood why everyone was telling me it was a difficult book to read. Beloved was about a fight between a woman and her past memories. Morrison wrote this novel like a puzzle. Throughout the story, she would give bits and pieces of information to the reader and would leave it up to him to put those pieces in place. This style is at the same time the most frustrating, and the most rewarding part of the story. I constantly found myself flipping back and forth through the pages trying to make sense of what Morrison was trying to tell me. I was never involved with this style of writing before so this made me stress and get frustrated a lot. But, when the pieces finally started to come together, I felt proud that I was able to do so. It is hard to judge Morrison's book. Judging it would have to depend on an individual's opinion. If I had to choose, I would likely not read another book by her again. Don't get me wrong, Beloved was a fantastic book. I just don't like to have to constantly keep flipping back and forth because it starts to get annoying. One positive of Morrison's style is she was able to keep the reader in the book and always have him asking himself questions. The content of the book was excellent. Morrison described her characters well. I really got to know and understand the characters. Morrison's descriptions of her scenes really painted pictures in my mind. The story itself about how Sethe, the main character, killed her baby girl to protect her from the hardships of slavery was shocking. How can someone kill their own child in order to protect them from the undetermined future? Was Sethe a murderer or a hero? This and other bad memories of slavery plague Sethe everyday. The quality of Beloved is based more on the reader's opinion then anything else. If you love being critical with books and love to read \\"in between the lines,\\" this book is definitely for you. This novel is filled with mind twisting scenarios. But, if you would rather have everything spoon-fed to you, I would warn you to stay as far away from this book as you possibly can. To enjoy Beloved you must have a critical eye and you have to be prepared to do a lot of thinking."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I understand some people's frustrations in reading this book. It's not a straight-forward &quot;here's the plot and here's how it ends&quot; kind of book. The plot or central theme of the book is simple enough, a slave-woman escapes to the free north and the aftermath of her supposed freedom. As in Song of Solomon, Toni Morrison uses magical realism to drive her story, it's reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende. I think it adds an element to the book that heightens its emotions. Slavery is a difficult subject to write about, and to write about it from a personal viewpoint, rather than a historical viewpoint is even harder. I think Morrison has successfully done that in Beloved.To those who didn't understand the book or wanted to force it into something commonplace so it's more palatable to their pop-culture minds, I say to them, you're missing out on a great piece of American culture and literature. Those who didn't like it are probably young, undergraduate or high school kids who simply don't have the patience for a story that requires a lot of thinking and feeling. Also, I believe you have to know suffering or have the capacity to understand and relate to other people's suffering to fully appreciate this book. A young person or a person who has lived a life of privilege, be it financially or emotionally, will have trouble sharing the meaning of this book.It's true that the style of the book is different and combines elements of different writing formats. Morrison uses poetry and stream-of-consciousness style writing in parts of the book. You just have to take it for what it is and not fight it too much. It's a personal voice, a personal story, a personal pain. You don't have to get everything everyone writes. Focus on the beautiful story-telling and the emotions it stirs in you. American writing needs this willingness to experiment to create a different and distinct voice."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a truly beautiful book. Part history, part ghost story, Beloved is based on an actual incident and concerns themes of love and family and the legacy of slavery in the United States. The characters are all highly symbolic and it is no accident that no one's memory extends further back than the beginning of slavery in America.Toni Morrison wrote Beloved in an experimental style which she began in The Bluest Eye. This narrative style is deliberately filled with holes and spaces and calls for much reader participation, something I think caused many readers to dislike this masterful book.The film version of Beloved was a box office failure. Those who didn't like this book point to that to justify, in part, their feelings. To me, the failure of the film simply points out that Beloved is a uniquely literary work and one that cannot be translated to another medium. Fiction has come a long way from the traditional and Toni Morrison is one of the world's best writers, possibly the greatest living female writer.Approach Beloved with an open, willing mind and you certainly won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If someone who had been gifted with a great voice, stood before an audience for two hours and sang nothing but scales and random musical phrases, I would feel the way I do after reading a Toni Morrison book. Certainly there are moments when one's breath is taken away at the sheer brilliance of the raw talent - but where is the discipline to harness that talent into a coherent piece of art?I found Beloved to be a heavy handed work, without logic or flow. It was as if Ms Morrison had assembled a list of every atrocity ever inflicted on a slave and then proceeded to tack every single one to the front of her cardboard characters. Just one of these horrors, inflicted on a character we had learned to know and love would have had a shattering impact on the reader. Instead it is as though we are in a violent classroom and the author, has decided that none of us are intelligent or aware enough to realize how horrible slavery was if she doesn't scream at us about it.Too much. Too much forced symbolism, too much obvious hatred for all white people, too many characters who had completely given up. I have much more faith in the strength of the human spirit than this. Read the writings of people who really were slaves and that spirit will come shining through."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I'm not surprised by the extreme fluctuations in the reviews on this book. Frankly, this is the sort of work people will like or loathe with very little ambivalence. Morrison uses a strange style in telling the story of a woman who tries to kill her children rather than see them be returned to slavery, yet it works.The past and the present are jumbled together for Sethe, who does succeed in cutting the throat of her baby daughter before the slavecatchers can stop her. The same is true for the other characters in the story. They've been in chain gangs, raped, seen all of their children sold away. These people can't stop reliving the horrors they've seen. The fluid, sometimes confusing jumps between past and present underscore this: the words read like the jumbled thoughts of humans who have suffered severe trauma in a time when post-traumatic stress disorder wasn't acknowledged and therapists didn't exist.Confusing to read? Sometimes, I'll admit. But in light of the story, it make sense.This is not your typical ghost story. Sethe's baby daughter does indeed haunt her house, and violently so. Her young sons are so terrified that they flee and never return, and Sethe's dwindling family lives in isolation since the house's reputation pretty much stops all visitors. But unlike most ghost stories, this is one in which the ghost takes physical form. Beloved returns from death as a young flesh-and-blood woman, but this only increases the chaos she wrecks on her family. Even Beloved's memories are recorded here, but they're not all Beloved's. One hears a story told by an anonymous girl who survives a voyage across the Atlantic in the hold of a slave ship.In this sense, Beloved's rage isn't just that of a daughter murdered by a mother trying to protect her in the only way she knew, but the rage and despair of millions of black people who suffered and died under slavery. This is the story of Sethe and her family's healing. In all these ways, this isn't just a ghost story, but a tale of an exorcism, of tbe purging of a bad memory.The people are fantastically-rendered. I'm not sure where some people get that the characters are \\"just supposed to represent something\\". These feel and act like real people. Morrison describes the heart of Sethe's lover, Paul D, as kept in a tin box that's been rusted shut - the only way he's managed not to crack after surviving a chain gang and traveling homeless the last twenty years. Denver is a young woman too afraid to leave her house. So isolated is she that she's happy to have a ghost to play with, even if it is a ghost.White people are viewed with a detached mistrust for obvious reasons. Seen through the eyes of the novel's black characters, whites are unknoweable, bland, perhaps not real people. This is an interesting switch from old literature (written by whites) in which blacks were the ones viewed as otherworldly and strange. It all depends on who's the witness, after all.No one is perfect and, with the exception of the sadist Schoolteacher, no one is purely bad. The white couple who bring Baby Suggs out of slavery are very kind indeed, and certainly more evolved than many white folk of the time period. Yet in their home they have a statue of a black boy, his mouth open to receive coins, a sign affixed around his neck with the words \\"At yo service\\", revealing that even good, kind people still need to deal with their racism. Slavecatchers are able to catch Sethe unawares because none of her neighbors warn her of the white men's advance. They are jealous and spiteful of her family's prosperity, and so in her hour of need, they abandon her.A friend told me this book gave her nightmares, and I understand why: the violence and cruelty is breath-taking. At the plantation ironically-named Sweet Home, boys are hanged from trees, pregnant women are raped and men are burned alive for trying to flee. It is from here that Sethe and Paul D escape, but the horrors of the place live in their memory and affect everything they do, even after two decades. The master, known only as Schoolteacher for the way he \\"teaches\\" those who need behavior modification, is a monster reminiscent of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. The murder of Sethe's daughter is appalling, but given the circumstances, understood. Death is the only way Sethe can save her children from Hell.Although the core of the book focuses on a mother and her murdererd daughter, the story is that of a people, really. Sethe and Beloved are only tiny fragments in a bigger story, that of the abduction and torture of a race. Slavery was the most antifamily institution ever invented, where the break-up of the family was not an act of terror but just another bit of public policy.With a tale of such great magnitude, a writer could easily lose track of what she were doing or never even get it off the ground. Morrison is up to the task and succeeds wonderfully."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrrison's writing style in her beautiful novel Beloved is reminiscent of poetry. The writing is concentrated; each word has purpose and conveys meaning to the reader. She doesn't concern herself so much with writing conventions as with telling the story. A book of this style is incredible because you read some sections and are left only with a feeling that is hard to articulate. Reading this novel was for me a highly emotional experience. Beloved, with its rich tapestry of images and emotions, left an indelible impression on my soul. Using unforgettable characters, Toni Morrison illustrates the balance that we must achieve with the past in a story dealing with the aftermath of slavery. Sethe, the protagonist, is haunted by the past, by slavery and the death of her oldest daughter, only referred to as Beloved. She swings between pushing the past away and being totally consumed by her previous actions. Morrison weaves the story together in a way that draws you into the life and experiences of Sethe. When I think of strong women, the image of Sethe will be conjured up in my mind. She is a symbol of sorrow and suffering but also of love."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Reading BELOVED is comparable to savoring every morsel of a sumptuous feast. Morrison's superb manipulation of language, delicate touch with emotions, and sustained appeal to imagination combine with her erudite intellect to tempt the reader into tasting each nuance presented. The best book about Slavery ever written, but not for those readers who are into &quot;quickie&quot; gratification. This is a captivating novel that leaves the reader with intriguing memories and the notion of returning to the writer for more. BELOVED is both satisfing and elusive simultaneously."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a beautifully written fiction novel full of vivid descriptions and well crafted metaphors. The topic of the novel is emotionally charged and, at times, difficult to swallow. In particular, the instances of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse are raw and somewhat vague, leaving room for interpretation. The super-natural theme described in the book diminished the importance of what was being conveyed in the story. Beloved and her own narrative in the story cloud the bigger picture of the novel. Overall, the other characters and their journeys are intricate and well developed.Beloved (Everyman's Library)BelovedBeloved (Paperback)"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I found this book difficult to read, both in terms of Morrison's style which demands more from the reader than your everyday sideboard novel, as well as in content. At times the harrowing detail was hard to swallow, but we must read these things, if only to understand, empathise and ensure we are aware. Every American should read this as it is such an integral part of their history. Everyone else should read it too, slavery may be illegal since the abolition, but it continues for millions of people throughout the world.The story gripped me and I found myself thinking about it even when I wasn't reading. The historical aspects of it, its basis in the history of Margaret Garner, contributed further to the sense of intrigue I experienced as I was reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Authors don't win Nobel Prizes for no reason. This novel is an incredible story of suffering, healing, and hope. To the reviewer who said that this book was only revered because it's by a black person and about slavery, shame on you (I'm white, by the way). Given some of the questions you expressed about the narrative, you obviously weren't really paying attention and if you think the plot is \\"ridiculous\\", then you don't understand that this isn't meant to be realistic. That's ok, but say that the book isn't for you or that you didn't get it or even that you didn't like it. Just don't insult the undeniably great Toni Morrison by saying that the esteem of this novel is based on her skin color."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Admittedly, I was lost at times while reading this, read many a chapter and sentence over and over, but by the end, I found the effort more than worth it. I can't pretend to know what it must have been like for women/slaves like Sethe, but if I've now gleaned even an inkling, this was the story that did it.Much like after reading the Color Purple, I found myself thinking about this story again and again, and would highly recommend it for anyone with the patience to see it through. The pay off is well worth it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"No matter how many history books one picks up on slavery and its effects, it's impossible to replicate the response Beloved elicits. Tony Morrison does a brilliant job of pulling us inside the world of a handful of former slaves' lives just outside Cincinnati, post-Emancipation.Her style is unorthodox, sometimes reading like free association by post-traumatic stress syndrome sufferers, and in many ways it can be reminiscent of Catch 22 (Side note - Beloved is not funny, the similarity is more the ways in which a character is formed by a single trauma.) However, it is not overly difficult to follow if one reads carefully.While some may argue that Beloved has been inflated by critics due to the seriousness of its slavery, this book deserves to be ranked where it is. It will leave you feeling like you've experienced something, not just read about it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book after reading The Known World and March so I had already had a good (better, actually) dose of reading about the inhumane conditions slaves lived under. This was a ho-hum book for me. I thought it was more work that it was worth and I wanted it over with and was glad when I finished it.I was really struck by Morrison taking you inside the damaged spirit of some of the characters. You learn how they only let themselves love others a little as all things important to them will likely be taken away. You learn the significance of a star or a leaf to someone who has no joy in their life whatsoever. You come to understand why a mother would rather take the life of her child than subject it to a life of continuous degradation and misery."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"124 was spiteful. Full of a baby's venom.\\" Nobelist Toni Morrison begins her 1988 Pulitzer Prize novel with a house haunted by the ghost of a dead baby. Sethe, who occupies the house outside Cincinnati, is a former slave who escaped from her Kentucky plantation Sweet Home eighteen years before, heavily pregnant with her daughter Denver, who now lives with her. At the start of the book she is joined by Paul D., also from Sweet Home, a good man who drives out the ghost and begins to bring back happiness to Sethe's life. But the specters of the past cannot so easily be laid to rest.Unlike other novels of slavery, Morrison begins her story after Emancipation, in a Northern city with a supportive black community, focusing on what happens after so-called Freedom has been obtained. In doing so, she asks what freedom truly means, and whether the events of the past can be expunged from the personal psyche simply by crossing a river or passing a law. And so the haunting continues. Fragments from the past come back in apparently random order; Morrison writes the way the mind works rather than following the chronological rails of history. It is essential to her purpose that the ghosts of the past should enter and leave freely, some resisted, some embraced, some mere memories, some taking apparent physical form. At times it is impossible to tell what is real and what imaginary; Morrison's Magic Realism hovers on the edge of hallucination, but the events that lie behind Sethe's trauma are very real indeed.My advice: surrender to this book, don't fight it. Give yourself to the beautiful writing and warm characters. The underlying story will become clear in time, but it will reveal itself as a rich web of connections rather than a single line. This is a horrific book, but it also contains moments of kindness, love, and beauty. It is a feminist book, but it contains men who are strong also. It is a black book, but not all the whites are evil. It is a book that will stay with you long after you put it down, and make you want to pick it up again and again. It is a haunting book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"Beloved\\" tells the story of survivors of slavery living in Ohio, before, during, and after emancipation: a mother, Sethe, who makes terrible sacrifices to save her family; a daughter, Denver, who was miraculously born on the road to freedom; and Paul D. who bravely comes to terms with inhuman attempts of slaveholders to destroy his soul and his sense of himself.When a young woman named Beloved comes into their lives (no one is sure from where), she embodies the pain of slavery, the unrelenting anguish over the loss of loved ones, the rage and sorrows that are legacies of enslavement.The novel gradually reveals its mystery and its meaning and tells of horrifying aspects of slavery. Toni Morrison's language is beautifully poetic. I will remember her vivid portrait of slavery, and the window she opens into the souls and psyches of her characters for a very long time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's Beloved is a captivating novel. As I read through it, I started thinking to myself, this is one of the best stories that I've ever read. At first, I didn't think that it would be worth my time to read the book, but the more I read, the better it became.Beloved is the story of a freed slave named Sethe who has had one of the roughest lives imaginable. The theme of slavery already made me feel a need to explore the tale. From what I know about slaves and their lives in the past, I wondered what this woman's story would be like. What could have happened to this slave to make her life story different from all of the others that suffered the same fate as she did?I soon found out what makes this story so unique. Sethe's troubles come from her past, which haunts her. She runs away from her master and takes her three children with her; another one is born on the way. After experiencing a small taste of freedom, her fears suddenly return when she is found. In order to keep her children from experiencing the same plague of slavery as she had, she takes matters into her own hands and decides to kill them. Now, in the present, the ghost of the one daughter she managed to kill haunts her house causing her youngest child Denver and her to live in seclusion. They have no choice but to live in the haunted house, which no one in the neighborhood dares to go near.Symbolism is one of the tools most used in the novel by the author. Morrison uses it to tell two stories at once. The literal meaning shows the reader the story of Sethe, the brutal memories of her past, and how it effects the people around her. At the same time, the alternate meaning being presented includes the evils of slavery and the injustice done to the blacks by the whites. Although the past lives of the characters include slavery, the story is mostly about their present lives and the choices they've made in the past. An example of this is clearly seen in the fact that Sethe killed her child to keep her from becoming a slave.The novel is excellent. Beloved is unlike any story you've ever read. It gives you a better understanding of slavery and discusses gender and racial issues. I liked it because of the author's unique style of writing. The imagery is terrific, the characters' points of view are very detailed, and the themes are very compelling. I enjoyed it very much, and anyone who hasn't already read it should read it as soon as they can."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is, in my opinion, one of the most magnificant American novels ever written. As a writing and literature instructor, I find it rather disturbing that so many readers complain that the book is &quot;difficult&quot;to read. Why must all enjoyable books be an easy read?? Morrison's work is brilliant in part because it is constantly challenging; it is impossible to sit passively and read her work --she complels and inspires active reading. The &quot;confusing plot&quot; that comes together in pieces is done deliberately to emphasize an integral theme of the book. In Beloved, Morrison shows us that the past, the present, and the future are all one; each is interwoven into the fabric of every moment we live. Our memories and histories, both individual and collective, infuse our lives in profound and immeasurable ways. Yes, this novel is a challenge, a blessed one -- to the spirit as well as the brain. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"There are a dozen reasons to resist Beloved: It is too PC, Morrison supports O.J. Simpson, magical realism and stream-of-consciousness are pass&eacute;. Nonetheless, Beloved is one of the extraordinary works of the 20th century. It combines a compelling story, a profound depiction of slavery and its human consequences, insight into pride, consciousness and self-awareness. The author's style fits the tale on several levels: its portrayal of an institution and experience too hideous to convey in conventional terms, its roots in the African story-telling modes and, finally, a sonorous resonance. The final pathos in the plot is its roots in a historic incident.As an avid reader, I'm surprised it took me fifteen years to catch up with Beloved. It has left an indelible impression."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I must confess that I started reading the book because it was written by a Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner. After I finished the book I am still trying to figure out which are the artistic merits of the work. Sadly this is the type of book which you can leave to rest in your night table for weeks without feeling any particular need to end it, nor any particular desire to make it last. All the characters are surrounded by an overwhelming sadness, which is certainly understandable due to times in which they are living, so all of them are rather gray and dull. The author in order to compensate for this lack of \\"spark\\" within its novel, places a ghost which becomes the center of the action, with such a bad luck that the only parts of the plot which are good are those which have nothing to do with the ghost, either at the times in which it was an ethereal figure, or when out of the blue it incarnated in a very stupid an neurotic woman. Its a pity, I hate to loose my faith on the taste of the Jury who chooses the Nobel Prize of Literature. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I expected Beloved to be a stunning, riveting semi-historical fiction about slavery and its aftermath, but it was disappointing in that respect-I don't even consider it a satisfying story because the plot was too wierd and everything just seemed so slapped together. I am of the opinion that ghosts should not be put into a story unless the author can do a superb, subtle job of writing them in, such as in Wuthering Heights-or else the story is simply ridiculous. I have a feeling Oprah is inclined to 5-star and promote any book that presents an emotional tie with slavery no matter what kind of slop it is, so I tend not to trust her!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I did not read this book. I had the unfortunate experience of listening to Toni Morrison drag me through her unabridged book on audio. If ever a book needed to be abridged, this is the book. I listened to it on a long driving trip that I had hoped would be shortened with Ms. Morrison reading her much applauded book to me. As it turned out the long trip became a long ordeal. I kept thinking ... somewhere is all this fluff there has to be a story. There is little doubt concerning Toni Morrison's command of the English language, but her style is so pompous and detailed as to leave me cold. The story is so boring and confusing I can't imagine a decent movie from it. I give the book 2 stars for the language. The story itself deserves no rating at all ... same old brutal slave story. I already know that slavery was wrong and bad and all that other politically correct crap. I hardly need Toni and Oprah to beat me over the head with it again. By the way, I noticed some readers comment about reading this book several times. I can understand that ... it is so confusing you need to read it several times to understand it and once you understand it the conclusion is ... so what!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"One of the wonderful qualities that permeates all of Ms. Morrison's books is her wonderful narrative voice that brings to life in chilling detail the stories that define individual lives and overall our collective history. In turn, her novel Beloved is no exception. While the plot is based upon the &quot;real-life&quot; story of a slave woman from Ohio who committed an unthinkable act, like Sethe in the novel, the brilliant dialogue, plot, and setting is uniquely Morrison -- she makes a personal investment in the story, and therefore owns it -- which she willingly shares with her readers in a poginant and appropriate manner. Through marvelous characters such as Sethe, Paul D, Denver and Beloved, Morrison weaves tales of slavery, the search for justice and truth, and more importantly the quest for self-worth and acceptance. The wonderment of her characters is that they are so well written that they allow readers to become personally involved and to express empathy -- these are not one-dimension people. Morrison &quot;pushes&quot; you to care, to listen, to question, and to reflect. In my opinion, she is one of few authors of contemporary fiction that is a master of this craft. Overall, Beloved is a charming mixture of plot, characters, and history wonderfully wrapped in a mystical package brimming with telling dialogue, thought-provoking themes and intriquing spirituality. Bravo Toni Morrison!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"While I enjoy reading these book reviews, I've not taken the time to add my own comments, until now. The bad reviews listed here for Beloved make me ANGRY. This book was brilliantly written, the characters were complex and complete, the story unique and SO important, it baffles me that a literate person would find it difficult and disappointing. Perhaps these folks got lost in the library and should head back to the easy-reading section, or should try Howard Stern's new book. Beloved is a beautiful, inspiring, wonderful trip I'm proud to have taken. Every person should read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I can almost see Toni Morrison, once she has a character in mind, asking herself, &quot;What else can she be? How many things can she represent--things which will represent that which must be told, yet be in conflict with each other.&quot;Does Toni Morrison hold points of conjuncture of race, class, and gender in balance? No. Nothing is ever in balance. It is the constant imbalance between and within her characters caused by slavery and the memory of slavery that is the essence of Beloved. As examples, I will focus on one character: the title character Beloved.Beloved is several things. When Paul D asks Denver, &quot;You think she sure 'nough your sister?&quot;, Denver replies, &quot;At times. At times I think she was--more.&quot; She was a heck of a lot more. Yes, she was Denver's sister, the child Sethe killed, just as the real life Margaret Garner killed one of her children to keep her from slavery. As that child, at first an unseen and unnamed spirit, later as the bodily Beloved, she is the one and only appropriate judge for Sethe--the only one who can not only judge, but forgive.She is also, apparantly, a real person--a young woman who has survived the horrors of a slave ship. Her spotty recollections of being among bodies and death and of maybe being a sex captive are evidence of this.Beloved also is the ghost of slavery that haunts history and our consciousness--not blacks alone, but also whites. The repression of this memory causes psychosis in not only those who were slaves or who owned slaves, but also those who think about slavery, who have extreme opinions of it, who feel or felt demeaned by it, or empowered by it. This repression allows a human to rationalize animal attributes to another human and thereby justify inhuman treatment. This repression allows one who is or was a slave to survive, but in a way which does not permit a valid existence. It causes a lack of self-esteem and, perversely, guilt feelings.Beloved: daughter/sister, judge, middle passage survivor, and ghost of slavery. Who could ask for more conjuncture than that? The story does does not end on page 275; it only pauses. The ghost of slavery still haunts. Morrison tells us that &quot;blackpeople&quot; must face the ghost together, as a community, in order to make her go away. She tells us, both black and white, to dig out and look at the historical truth and thereby end our repression which allows the tragedy to continue. Sethe's child had no name, but the ghost has two names: predjudice and ignorance.ROBERTLLOYD@HOTMAIL.COM"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I'm not sure if it was just because it was for a class and I had read so many fantastic novels before this one, but this was possibly one of the worst books I have read. The story was rather depressing in my opinion, and I just could not get through it. Maybe if I don't read it for a class or after amazing novels I might like it better, but I'm not sure if that would do anything."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of 1988, Toni Morrison frees herself from the bonds of traditional narrative and establishes an independent style, just as her characters have freed themselves from the horrors of slavery and escaped from Kentucky to Ohio. Revealing the story of Sethe and her family as they survive the brutality of the farm, only to encounter torments even more punishing than whippings after they escape, Morrison presents scenes in a seemingly random order, each scene revealing some aspect of life for Sethe, her boys, her dead baby Beloved, and the new baby Denver, both in the past and in the present. Moving back and forth, around, and inside out through Sethe's recollections, she gradually reveals Sethe's story to the reader, its horror increasing as the reader makes the connections which turn disconnected scenes into a powerful and harrowing chronology.As the novel opens, Sethe and Denver have lived in #124, a house in Ohio, for eighteen years, refusing to socialize and enjoying no company. When Paul D. Garner, one of the Sweet Home men and a friend of her long-missing husband, arrives on her doorstep and moves in, Sethe slowly reveals her long-buried nightmares, and the two share their stories of the events leading up to their escape. Most haunting to Sethe is the death of her young daughter Beloved, shortly after the escape from the farm, though the reader does not know for many pages the shocking manner of her death. When a ghostly figure who calls herself Beloved arrives at #124, shortly after Paul D., Morrison creates mystery and a heart-stoppingly tense atmosphere, when Beloved, too, moves in. As Beloved gradually takes over the household and seems to demand and then possess Sethe's soul, the sorrow which has burdened Sethe seems close to breaking her.The sadism of some slave-owners, the devices used to torture, and the desperate measures some slaves took to protect themselves and their loved ones come fully alive here, the horrors growing as the reader gradually discovers the real source of Sethe's torment. By forcing the reader to make the connections, instead of spelling out details in a traditional narrative, Morrison strengthens the impact of the novel and its brutal revelations. Symbols of water, rain, snow, and ice connect the disparate scenes, and the use of shadows and the ghostly character of Beloved keep the reader on tenterhooks until the action is eventually resolved. A powerful, atmospheric, and shocking novel, Beloved is also a searing indictment of slavery and the damage it has done to the fabric of life, damage that cannot be repaired until it is fully recognized through novels such as this.

Even with the jagged handsaw as her accomplice, Sethe could not sever the intent for unity that flourished within the umbilical cord, and so, she and Beloved remained on one accord in the Here and After.

Overall, easy to come away with the desperation some people must have felt."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Read a master of literature. Read books written by Toni Morrison. Beware! The experience will be challenging, rewarding and profound. The books will touch you where you don't want to be touched. Morrison makes you uncomfortable sometimes because she tells you a bold, brave and courageous truth. In an interview on PBS with Charlie Rose, he asked her: &quot;Why do you always write about marginal people?&quot; Morrison responded, &quot;You mean, I should write about important people?&quot; He nodded affirmatively. &quot;You mean white people.&quot; She added and he nodded affirmatively. Morrison went on to say something like the marginal people have something to say and they say it loud and they say it best. Morrison's characters are loud and humble at the same time. They are &quot;marginal&quot; after all. Now that is a reason to be loud. Morrison spoke about her ancestry immediate, like in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s when they were washed down the street and beaten, bitten and killed just for trying to vote in THEIR country. And she spoke about the ones who were held in bondage as slaves. She said she has a debt to pay. She knows but by their sweat and blood and death she had no claim to America. But because --she has a very large claim, a 100% claim. I read a lot of the reviews here and they are excellent. But I do want to say that they seem to swing from people who areNOT aware that they are reading an American master of prose and a master of story telling. They are not aware that Morrison is a rich learning experience. The other end of the spectrum are those readers who do know the uncommon importance of Morrison's expression. And they reach joyfully for the rich challenge she offers. But what gets my goat and makes me angry, in fact rageful, is the reader who speaks as if the symbolism in Beloved has nothing to do with real American history. It is American history. Beloved is a novel based on true, real, American history. People weren't slaves though. People were held as slaves. We refer to &quot;the slaves&quot;. They weren't slaves. They were Tom, Mary, Betty and so on. They were people held as slaves. If we never call them &quot;people&quot; we will never understand and realize what American ancestry did to them and what we do to them today. We do not acknowledge that they were really AMERICAN CITIZENS on July 4, 1776. They fought for freedom in the American Revolution and ever since. I get angry when people talk as if the people held in slavery held themselves. They talk about &quot;the slaves&quot; but do not mention the slaveowners who were our American ancestry. Novels like Beloved reminds us of something we would rather forget but just like the little baby, the past comes back to haunt us---and it should! To not read Morrison is to miss one of the finer purposes of reading --to experience the wordsmith. &quot; Morrison does with prose what Bassie did with jazz,&quot; somebody said.

Morrison spoke about her ancestry immediate, like in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s when they were washed down the street and beaten, bitten and killed just for trying to vote in THEIR country. And she spoke about the ones who were held in bondage as slaves. She said she has a debt to pay. She knows but by their sweat and blood and death she had no claim to America. But because --she has a very large claim, a 100% claim. I read a lot of the reviews here and they are excellent. But I do want to say that they seem to swing from people who areNOT aware that they are reading an American master of prose and a master of story telling. They are not aware that Morrison is a rich learning experience. The other end of the spectrum are those readers who do know the uncommon importance of Morrison's expression. And they reach joyfully for the rich challenge she offers. But what gets my goat and makes me angry, in fact rageful, is the reader who speaks as if the symbolism in Beloved has nothing to do with real American history. It is American history. Beloved is a novel based on true, real, American history. People weren't slaves though. People were held as slaves. We refer to &quot;the slaves&quot;. They weren't slaves. They were Tom, Mary, Betty and so on. They were people held as slaves. If we never call them &quot;people&quot; we will never understand and realize what American ancestry did to them and what we do to them today. We do not acknowledge that they were really AMERICAN CITIZENS on July 4, 1776. They fought for freedom in the American Revolution and ever since. I get angry when people talk as if the people held in slavery held themselves. They talk about &quot;the slaves&quot; but do not mention the slaveowners who were our American ancestry. Novels like Beloved reminds us of something we would rather forget but just like the little baby, the past comes back to haunt us---and it should! To not read Morrison is to miss one of the finer purposes of reading --to experience the wordsmith. &quot; Morrison does with prose what Bassie did with jazz,&quot; somebody said. Or Piccaso, or Michael Angelo with painting. Morrison is a master."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Two months? I read this book in 4 hours! It enthralled me from the very beginning, and as each facet of the long and sometimes twisted story revealed itself, I found myself unable to stop until I had read each precious word.The story isn't pretty, certainly. The utter physical, emotional, and spiritual agony of each character was so carefully written. Morrison's style is very different, but this story begs for that.I do understand that this might be a difficult book for high schoolers, but as a nursing mother myself, I agonized along with Sethe over the separation from her nurslings and the physical ways that separation manifests itself. Perhaps this is a book that should be returned to later in life, after much experience, perhaps after parenthood."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After reading the novel Beloved, by Toni Morrison, I have come to the conclusion that there is a Beloved in all of us. It does not matter what race or nationality one may be, everyone has a &quot;best thing.&quot; That special something that has come back from your past that you never want to lose again. Sethe, upon finding out who Beloved actually was, gave her everything; her attention as well as all of her love. She forsake all others, including Denver, the daughter she had raised from birth. This level of giving is very parallel to matrimony. Spouses forsake all others and think only of their partners needs first, just as Sethe did with Beloved. It was almost like a marriage between a demonic being and one of this world."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Morrisson's narrative brings forth a question central to the human experience: &quot;How can people allow themselves to be taken as slaves or treated so abominably?&quot; Some may ask themselves why &quot;African Americans&quot; didn't fight back in a country that freely shouts &quot;give me liberty or give me death!&quot;Sethe's &quot;sin&quot; was uttering the cry FOR her daughter. The catch-22 of &quot;Beloved&quot; is that slavery as an institution inherently prevents its victims from crying out, and the reader knows that Sethe's daughter never would have had a chance. Sethe is punished for her misdirected love nonetheless.The farther along into history a &quot;familial&quot; lineage advances within the bondage of slavery, the quieter the potential for a loud shout becomes until it is finally extinguished. Successive generations of slaves continue to pay for the inability of their ancestors to end their torment.This is the horror not only of slavery, but of American correctional institutions, and Mao-Tse Tung's famines as well.There is something about human beings that makes them cling to life even if their lives become unbearable. The crime of slavery is that it takes advantage of this &quot;flaw.&quot; Toni Morrison explores the black experience with such a phenomenon in a language most amenable to those with the predilecton to comprehend it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Ok, you all must be thinking I'm this all-over negative type of person. Well, this book, was VERY low on my reading list. After reading the first 40 pages, I was so lost, it wasn't even funny. Too many characters were introduced in the first few pages. I think the author could have written the story in a little bit of a lower &quot;key&quot; so-to-speak. And, as most people do, I judged not only the rest of the book, but the author herself, on the basis of her first 40 pages. First impressions last, as the saying goes. So, as my teachers would know, I express a deep dislike for the authors style of writing. But, don't let my negativity--if you may call it that--stop you from reading this book. For you, it might all tie together in a tight knot, but for me, there were too many strands to tie off, and most ended off astray."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If you have not checked out the movie, GO! This book was exciting to me to see a nice combination of history and supernatural. I was stunned and informed all at the same time. Toni Morrison is in the ranks of Ntozake Shange. I have not read any other author, who has kept my attention as well as amaze me with some good ol' truth. I think for too long writer's have focused on a conventional tales that are beginning to bore. Morrison is definately not boring in any area. If this is your first time reading Morrison get ready to be glued to the book and take time to read more of her books. This book will definitely be etched in your brain when you finish. It will also put your brain into motion."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is amazing. Halfway through, however, I would not have said this. Morrison's work is quite confusing and challenging in places, but rewards those who persevere with a true understanding of her theme and the emotional makeup of her characters. Light reading? No. Worth the effort? Absolutely."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"toni morrison tears up the pages with shear lyrical beauty and her characters are very human!

I was a little hesitant due to all the hype about the difficulty of reading Ms. Morrison's writing. Phooey. This book was not only a great story but excellent histoical literature. The story made me laugh, cry, shudder and think. What a work of art."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"One thing that is undeniable about this book is the amount of thought put into the story. It is extremely complex in and of itself. Her writing style, which is profound and beautiful, only makes the harrowing, disturbing plot all the more original and mythical."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This does not apply to all who gave this book a negative review. Opinions are opinions, and better to be arguing over the merits of a book than drooling in front of the television. What I'm trying to understand is the smug tone of *some* of those who disliked this book. Why do you feel the need to look down on the rest of us? It seems you are trying to justify not liking this book by putting yourselves exactly where you *claim* Morrison is: on a high-horse. Yes I was lost at times, but what a beautiful place to be lost in. Each word was chosen with complete care."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I believe Beloved is the best contemporary fiction I have ever read. Period. It will teach you, touch you, and haunt you for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Imaginative! Creative! Humanity at its best! Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot; is testimony to the power of human thought and creativity. Beloved was not like any other book that I have read because it tapped into human musings that were beyond recycled and &quot;accessorized&quot; musings that we're fed by television and other forms of mass media. It touched a level of humanity that I had yet to explore. I don't know Morrison personally, but I think I know what she is about. The novel is so human--it delves into humanity's beauty, its ugliness, its closets, its dirty drawers! It is philosophy too as it doesn't discount the incredible or the impossible. It frightens as it changes both incredible and impossible into the inevitable. Oh Professor Morrison!! I've sold my television...I can only hope that my mind will now progress beyond the scope of the &quot;limited life&quot; to which popular art has access. I loved this book. For those of you out there who didn't like the book, I would just like to advise that you look beyond whatever it is you did not like... Do you know the saying that &quot;it's the thought that counts&quot;? Well apply this saying to &quot;Beloved&quot;. This book was a rigorous and awe-inspiring exercise in human thought. Go humans!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"i \\"read\\" the audio version of Beloved, performed by Lynn Whitfield. Having a long history with audio books, i can honestly say this was one of my favorite performances. It's so frustrating to take the time to choose an audio book and pay almost $40 dollars for it, only to get in the car and find that you're stuck with the world's most obnoxious or unintelligible reader. And when your 12 hour drive is largely dependant on that book, it's downright maddening.But thank goodness for Lynn Whitfield! Her reading is spot on without being either bland or overdramatic. i found myself stopping the tape to write down portions of the text (yes, while driving!), which is something i rarely if ever do while reading to myself. If you want to listen to a great book made better by a flawless reading, look no further."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Let me start out saying that I love to read. But this book was so difficult to follow. I had a really hard time getting involved with any of the characters or caring about them. I do not want to have to try that hard to find a flow to the words I am reading. I realize a lot of people loved this book, but not me."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"A must read! I would recommend this book to anyone... especially women. Sad, poetic, triumphant, historical, painful, in so many words."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I am reading and listening to Beloved for the fourth time. Every time I read this book, I get something new out of it. There is no point into going into the plot as the plot is subservient to the magic of the words that fit together like a dizzying, beautiful, maddening, frightful and dazzling puzzle. Bit by bit the story weaves it's way into a work of such grander and cohesion. The first time I read it, I couldn't read anything else for nearly 6 weeks. Nothing captured my interest. So I read it again, and the second time (since I already knew the taut, suspenseful story) I could really revel in the poetic beauty of the words. I have read so many books on American slavery...and this one is just by so far and away the best. Maybe the only thing that can touch it is The Known World by Edward P. Jones. Sethe is the bravest protagonist I have ever met. Her love burns like a forest fire to the exclusion of all else. Thank you, Toni Morrison for writing this masterpiece. I will return to it again and again."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was really pleased with Beloved. I picked it as my novel for a Lit class, and the way in which Toni Morrison writes is exceptional. Her foreshadowing without foreshadowing is an interesting and enjoyable aspect of her style. The motifs, themes, and symbols that she uses are wonderfully integrated into the story; integrated well enough that they are not always apparent on the first read. It is not the most fast-moving, action-packed novel around, but it is a novel that I would suggest to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book hardly needs a review from an ordinary reader like me. It was judged the best novel of the past 25 years by a team of book critics of the New York Times. It is a stunning, heart-wrenching story about escaped slaves during a period straddling the civil war. The plot is very complicated and often dificult to follow. But it is well worth the effort to sort it out. Truly a magnificent book"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison shows off her major talent and her firm understanding of the evils of American slavery in this novel. The story is a relentless revelation of how most slaves were treated by masters who considered them animals with human characterisitics. The harrowing lives of major protagonists Sethe and Paul D ring true and arouse both shame and sympathy that human beings were demeaned and subjugated to provide profit and ease for white Southerners. But, of course, that is an old story. The question this reader considered after finishing the novel is whether this story needed to be told again, even by such a talented writer. Of course it is similar in nature to a Jewish retelling of the Holocaust; therefore, I think it needs to shed some new light on the old story in order to be worth a reader's time. I'm not sure this novel does that, nevetheless, it seems worth the reader's time because of the author's talent. Morrison uses a poetic prose to tell her tale which, perhaps, suggests more than it details. On the whole, it represents a worthwhile work from one of America's major writers. Is Morrison as great a talent as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner? No. Is this the best American novel in the past 25 years? I don't know. I'd like to think there's something better. Nevertheless, it is a fine achievement."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I agree that in order to enjoy this book you need to understand it in some level, the human level. This book may not be a good choice for required reading because of its nature, some college kids or young minds might not be able to relate to the characters just because of the society in which we live in, of inmediate self-gratification, not having to sacrifize much, luxury lives. Nonetheless, with a little more maturity, with tougher experiences, and the greatest of them all being that of becoming a parent, this book becomes in the very least a heart-touching story of humanity."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Though I started the book thinking that it would merely chronicle the life of an ex-slave, I was soon sucked into the chilling world that Morrison created to be all too real. Beloved reaches into the heart of slavery and exposes the pain, the heartache, and the intense love that survived the torment of captivity.The ghosts of slavery never escaped the main character, Sethe, and though she tries to suppress her terrible memories, they have a way of returning to haunt her. In fact, her memories seem to become embodied in a mysterious woman who calls herself Beloved. No one is entirely sure of who Beloved is. She has the memories of Sethe's murdered daughter and also the memories of Sethe's long forgotten African mother. At times it seems as though Beloved represents all slaves, their plight and suffering. When Beloved arrives, the thoughts and memories long forgotten come flooding back, releasing a wave of torment that re-echoes in every character.Beloved is one of those books that leaves you wide-eyed in the end. It's disturbing yet beautiful, scathing yet inspiring. Morrison leaves out no details and isn't afraid to declare the horrors of slavery-psychological as well as physical.I found this book to be mind-opening and I recommend it to anyone looking to expand their views on the issue of slavery."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Thank you Mrs. Morrison, for proving that the art of writing is alive."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The writing in Beloved is nothing less than genius. Toni Morrison is at her absolute peak in this novel. I've read this book several times and each time I discover something new and amazing. Morrison masterfully weaves the construct of time into themes of this work. There are so many poetic, philosophical and spiritual nuances to this piece that I would do this novel no justice by trying to explain them or list them. Of the hundreds of books I've read in my life, Beloved is my favorite and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys reading....it is a treasure."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison shows true talent in writing &quot;Beloved&quot;. It was beautifully wriiten and very powerful to the audience. She shows the past in a brilliant way. I would recomend this book to anyone, ecspecially those interested in the past or romance. Toni Morrison teaches great lessons in love, freedom, and life in general. Much can be learned from this piece of art."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The story is very controversial and difficult to think about. But the way Morrison writes is so moving and powerful that I think the book is a must read. It is important that our society read books that give such insight to historical times. To be able to read this book is difficult and challenging but also so incredibly inspiring. Morrison writes in such a way that you believe you would act in exactly the way the main character does. Unbelivably powerful!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"toni morrison is a genius. there is so much in this novel--it's drenched in symbolism and literally almost every sentence has a deeper meaning than the one it seems to have. if you can take the time to read it more than once and see how different themes connect, what different sections mean, i would definitely recommend it. but if you don't have time for more than a surface reading, i would still recommend it, because there's enough plot and beautiful writing to hold a reader's interest. either way, there is so much to learn in Beloved. it should be required reading for anybody who wants to better understand the history of our country."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This novel touches many bases. It touches th human soul through its plot. Ti touches the readers mind with its complex writing. The powerful message behind the story over shadows and confusion. The mixes between reality and memory puts the reader right into the book. This stiry of slaves who are free after the civil war reveals the desperation and pain they went through. Slaverey must have ben very horrible for a mother to try and kill her own child.This book was intrigueing, The fact that most references in this stiry were alot and makes the reader think, \\"Does this have a meaning?\\" It makes you think,\\" what does this word, or this name mean?\\" The author used great references, such as the turtles refering to what will happen between Beloved and Paul-D. The interpretations of some things are up to the reader. For example, the house number 124, could refer to one being Setheall alone, two could refer to Sethe and denver living in the house together,and four could mean Sthe Denver Beloved and Paul-D. This might be true because it is the first word at the very beginnine of the novel.The twists and turns in the novel leaves tyhe reader hanging even after you are finished. The fact that Beloved runs away in the end makes you feel as if she wasnt real, due to the fact that she left as quickly as she arrived.Overall, this story was great if you love touching novels about slaver, but if you like being caught up in a confusing mess of memories mixed with real life. Then this book id for you! T would suggest rading this only if you have to. Reading it for fun, won't be. This book is not for fun to read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a very twisted story that gives you an excellent insight to the lives of slaves and free blacks in the post civil war era. Toni writes with a very different style that makes reading a real task and treat. The constant flasbacks and viewpoint shifts keep you reading carefully and cause you to absorb the entire life of the book. the characters are abstract yet familiar, and their interactions are very odd, but are shown in a way that is easy to identify. Toni has written a book that is very different than any other, and the technique is very fitting to the story that is being told.This story revolves around the freed slave Sethe and the troubles she and her family go through. She has experienced many traumatizing events, such as having her milk stolen and having to kill her own child. These events, and having to experience the pain of slavery cause her to be very closed and unemotional. She struggles with the memories of her former abuse. She pushes them deep inside, and when they come up they shake Sethe and her family. Sethe lives in a house with her daughter in seclusion. They are separate from the outside world with only the ghost of Sethe's dead baby for company. This changes when Paul D., Sethe's old friend from Sweet Home, comes to stay with them. He chases the ghost away, and begins a family with Sethe and Denver. All is looking good until they find a young lady with baby-like skin who changes everything.This book focuses on memory and tells things through flashback and remembrences. This causes the reader to be pulled through a whirl of time and events, where one has to read and reread to follow and understand what is going on. While difficult to read, this causes the reader to absorb all the events and get the full effect of what has happened to the characters. The reader learns as they do, and grows with them.This book shows a very dark side of humanity; topics like racism, mercy killing, rape, and abuse are delved into and explained in excruciating detail. The reader feels the pain and sorrow of loss, and the anger ad hate of being mistreated. The story brings the reader through every emotion and experience,painful as it may be.This book is a very different piece of literature. The style, themes, and characters are very different than what are typically depicted, giving the reader a unique and interesting treat."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's novel Beloved is a powerful piece of work. The novel shows how hard a slave's life really was. The slaves suffered through so many hardships, such as losing family members, getting beaten-up, and for the females- being raped. Most of the whites treated slaves as if they weren't human at all, but rather a piece of property, which they could do what they pleased with. Luckily for Sethe and the \\"Sweet Home men\\", their kind slave-owner, Mr. Garner treated them with respect, though it angered other slave-owning whites. Sethe and the \\"Sweet Home men\\" did not realize how fortunate they were till Mr. Garner was gone. Their new slave-owner's cruelty caused Sethe and the \\"Sweet Home men\\" to run away and pursue freedom. For many blacks that were slaves on a plantation in the south in the early 19th century, freedom was only a dream. A dream, which was wanted by all, but owned by few.The novel has many twists and turns to it. The reader can never be quite sure what will happen next. When one of the \\"Sweet Home men\\", Paul D, arrives at Sethe's house he overpowers the baby ghost who has been haunting the house for the past 18 years. That would seem to be the end of the baby ghost, but the next day the baby ghost shows up in flesh and blood, calling herself- Beloved. At first nobody realizes Beloved is the baby ghost as well as the crawling already baby. Denver is the first to discover Beloved's secret. It takes Sethe, Beloved's own mother, a few months to come upon the true identity of Beloved. By then Paul D has found out what Sethe did to her crawling-already baby and left. Once Sethe figures out who Beloved is, she is overjoyed because she can now spend time with both of her daughters. Each of the three girls- Sethe, Denver, and Beloved, enjoy happy fun filled times. They go ice-skating, stay up late talking, and Sethe cooks and eats with them. However the fun doesn't last. Sethe loses her job and they start to run out of food in the house. This food shortage combined with Sethe's failing health convinced Denver to go out into the real world to find help. Denver finds a job and brings food home, and then the neighbors come to help her get rid of the disease-causing Beloved. With Beloved gone, Paul D returns. Sethe, Denver, and Paul D become a family who have made it through the hard times, and now have a bright future in front of them.Toni Morrison wanted her opinion on slaves to be heard, and it is heard clearly. The style she uses to express her opinion through her novel Beloved is loud and strong. She didn't like how white men treated blacks and especially black women back in the 19th century. She believes like I do, slavery was a very wrongdoing by the whites that lived in the United States. The slaves were treated worse than animals and had no rights at all. Therefore it is very gracious of Morrison to dedicate her book to the 60 million or more slaves who died on the slave ships on their way over to America."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, a winner of the noble prize in literature and of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction is Toni's best novel. The way its written makes the reader believe the haunting view of how it was for slaves back in the 1870's.I think this novel was very well thought out about the characters and the main events that lead to the next even. Sethe is the strong character in the novel, who has experienced so much terror and cruelty in her life. The other main charter I would say is Beloved who is nameless but is called beloved by her mother. Sethe's baby girl who grows up and comes back as the haunter. Sethe shows the reader the kind of hard life a black person had to go through. Sethe's mother was a slave, Sethe herself was a slave, but she was not going to let her kids be slaves, and that l led to her third child to die .Many things happen in 124. Toni does a great job in making every details meaningful, whether it with history or with past events within the novel's story. If you look at the door number that Sethe and her family lives in the number three is missing, it's because her third child is missing, so this novel is very educational and very inspiring to read. It's not the easiest novel to read but you'll see it's worth your time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I just finished reading Beloved and I enjoyed it very much although I understand the difficulty many readers might have with this book. In my opinion it is a wonderful piece of abstract art of the written word. It does not flow and make sense in the way most novels do, in the same way as an abstract painting doesn't make immediate sense but I think the author was trying to create a mood, to capture one facet of a horrific situation and she does this extremely well. It gave me a real sense of how terrible a thing slavery was, so terrible that it is hard to believe that one human could do that to another. In my opinion, I think that white Americans have to accept that this was truely an unforgivable act and no reparation can erase the harm that was done. Sometimes we have to live with the fact that we can't have forgiveness but have to live with perpetual atonement. My only dissapointment with this book was the slightly Hollywood happy ending; ghost gets kicked out, Sethe lives happily with Paul D, Denver gets thin, gets a job and a man and they all live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Similar to &quot;The Colour Purple&quot;, &quot;Beloved&quot; takes you to a time and place where the unimaginable did happen. Toni Morrison manages to capture many moments of madness, sadness and extreme cruelty. Taking the reader deep into the psyche of a mother living through slavery harship, the impact of the era on people's minds and stability and the variety of views that surrounded the actions of the plot, Toni Morrison really has told the unimaginable. Not alone does the story attempt to tell a tale that would better be untold, but it tells a story that everyone would rather forget. The point of this story is, history should not be forgotten. Much literature surrounding this book would advocate that this story is more &quot;her story&quot; than &quot;his story&quot;, attempting to take a different angle on issues that people have preconceptions about.Sometimes you really do have to read between the lines, but when you do, the book becomes a pop-up book in terms of the images it conjures up.I had to read this book six years ago for my degree. I found it intriguing then, and even more so now six years on. Remarkably, whilst the story tells a tragic tale, it is not a book of pure doom and gloom, but a captivating read.I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I did not like this book at all. It is hard to follow and keep up with. If it were not a required read for a college class I would have never read it. I even considered dropping the class because I didn't want to complete this assignment. There are so many other things to write about. why pain and anger? Why so much disgust. We have read about the disgusting things slaves suffered at the hands of their 'masters' it was horrible but why do we need another book?"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Just in case you're wondering, I mean sad as in this book is a sad excuse for a piece of literature. I think Toni Morrison is a sick person who has nothing better to do than complain about slavery and the horrible condition of African-Americans in America today. I watched an interview recently with Toni and i was sickened by her prevailing and redundant thoughts that blacks are treated so terrible and that white people are monsters. Yes, you read correctly, she didn't say white people &quot;were&quot; monsters, she said we ARE monsters. I find this very offensive and while I am admittedly embarassed that this nation went through the cruel period of slavery, I was not part of it, nor were any living blacks, including Toni Morrison. Toni is like a disabled person whose only ability in life is writing. I wont argue anyone that the book is written in a brilliant fashion, but the content and subject matter are demented and sick.Having given my opinion of Morrison herself, I would like to say a few things about this book (since the book is what I'm supposed to be reviewing, I think it would be a good idea for me to put a little bit about it in here). As I have already stated, I think the book is written very well and maybe even deserves the Pulitzer. However, I still believe it is nothing more than an attempt by a liberal black woman to cry bleeding-heart, feel sorry for me, it's all your fault (white people), to a society that treats blacks more than fairly. The whole story this book tells, of a mother killing her child to save it from the horrors of slavery is twisted to say the least. Further more, the book goes on to portray this as the &quot;ultimate act of love by a mother.&quot; I think not. I appreciate the debate this arouses, but then again, not really. I do realize that this story is not something Toni thought up herself, but i still dont agree with it. Actually, the only thing I really agree with in the book, is when Toni says, &quot;This is not a story to pass on.&quot; Next time a thought crosses your mind to write Toni, take your own advice, and don't."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I had to read this novel for a college English course. I was looking forward to it, but with three stars, you can tell I was a little disappointed. I didn't expect this historical slave novel to incorporate ghosts and the paranormal. It shocked me actually to realize, \\"yes, there is a main character in this story who is a GHOST.\\" I expected more from the story as a whole. I'm glad I got the chance to read it but I wouldn't read it again (unless I have to)."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Morrison's word choice is excellent. She's obviously a good writer, but truly, her subject matter leaves A LOT to be desired, in this book. Its raunchy beyond belief. People do things with farm animals that they shouldn't. I couldn't get through the first two chapters without vomiting. Some things you just shouldn't put in your head."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Having read Toni Morrison before, I have been distinctly unimpressed with her writing style. I was not looking forward to reading this book when I found it on my fall semester reading list but decided to plug through it anyways. Needless to say, my opinion of Morrison's writing has not changed.Allow me first to give credit where credit is due and say that at moments Morrison's creativity shines through, especially in the emotionally charged and disturbing storyline. However, she chooses to employ several contemporary literary devices that her writing is not suited for (creation of words such as 'coloredfolk', 'rememory', and 'crawlingalready?baby') as well as unnecessarily dramatic writing. Referencing Paul D's heart as a 'tobacco tin' that has been rusted shut is a rather trite image. Morrison also pretends that she is hinting at possible identities of Beloved, but the repetitive parallels drawn between the dead baby and the mysterious woman are blatant. She needs to either pare down the 'subtle' references or leave out any room for interpretation.What carries this book is the storyline and the themes, not the writing style. For lack of a better comparison, Morrison reminds me of Stephen King-- exceptional ideas, but lacks (or fails at) innovation in the actual writing. Despite my poor rating I would recommmend reading this book simply for the issues it explores, but instead of paying $13, go borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What were some of my reactions to this book? Well at first I really didn't like it, because it confused me alittle. but once I got into it I kind of started to enjoy it. Really like how they had the ghost in the book. I thought that it was cool because it was Denver's baby. The book kept me interested in the middle. At the begging I thought about getting a new book, because it was a such a slow start. I guess that overall though that I would recommend this book to someone. But they would have to stick with it. Thanks for your time!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this in college. Awful and literally disgusting to read. The impact of slavery still resonates with us today, by bringing a ghost into the story it makes it fantasy and I found it impossible to take this book seriously. Toni Morrison is the most overrated author in America, it's only because of Oprah (the most overrated \\"personality\\" in America\\") that she is popular."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Was enjoying it until Beloved \\"strangled\\" on a raisin. After a stupid part like that I had to stop reading it. I assumed Miss Morrison meant choked, and how can a full grown woman choke on something as small as a raisin? Who chokes on a raisin? Couldn't she have just said it was an olive or somethin?"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This story jumps from current time to past time and narrating person to narrating person so it is confusing. I love books about slavery, civil war but this was very disappointing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Beloved was one of the dullest, most unimaginative books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. OK, life in the South is rough. The black experience is a deeply spiritual thing. Richard Wright said that 40 years ago, as did Zora Neale Hurston. And they said it a lot better than Tony Morrison. Morrison is an overrated author whose success is as much due to Oprah's poor opinions as her own talent."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morison's Beloved is an unflinchingly honest portrayal of what it was like to be an African American slave in the US. The images of brutality and prejudice are extremely intense, often distasteful, but what really shows you the dehumanizing aspects of slavery are the effects that it has on her characters. The most chilling example is of course Sethe, who kills her infant daughter with a saw to keep her from being brought into slavery. Many people say that this act was inexcusable, and in a way it was, but this only underlines the fact that we cannot ever fully comprehend what slavery was like. The fact that a mother would kill her own daughter in order to keep her from slavery shows that it must truly be horrible, and, though you may never be able to reconcile yourself with that act, Morison's book may be the closest you get to understanding the experience of belonging to another human being.The story rotates around Sethe, an ex-slave from a plantation called Sweet Home, her daughter Denver, and Paul D, another ex-slave from Sweet Home. These characters are all affected by the ghost of the child Sethe killed, and her manifestation, Beloved. T Supernatural phenomena are an integral part of the book, and the characters accept these as normal, never questioning their existence.The characters trigger frequent flashbacks in each other, and much of the background is laid in this manner, the story coming together like a puzzle as the details supplied by each \\"rememory\\" fall into place. \\"Rememory\\" and \\"thought-picture\\" are good examples of the way that Morrison uses language to enrich the experience of reading the book. Not only her dialogue, but the narration uses delightfully appropriate colloquialisms and slang such as the \\"crawling-already-baby.\\"While Beloved contains a lot that you may think distasteful or gratuitous, and you may not like the book or the subject matter, I think everyone should read it anyway, because it is the kind of book that affects you, makes you think and, in the end, leaves you with the feeling that it has some how changed you, subtly altering your outlook on the world, though you may not be able to say how."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Caution. This book is for mature audiences only.Beloved by Toni Morrison has powerful imagery. There are explicit and offensive scenes throughout the book. I was appalled by the graphics and I pained me to have to continue the book. This is the main cause that I felt this book is for only the mature. I was constantly squirming at the pictures that had been created in my minds eye. It is a book filled with anger, hate, sex, violence, and offensive language. (How much more like a rated R movie can you get?)The book is about a freed slave woman and her family. Sethe, the main character has to deal with the memories of her past and live with the choices she's made.A plot that was as twisted and confusing as the labyrinth but unfolded to somewhat of being understandable was impressive. From the on set you are set in confusion. The complex plot was, at times frustrating. There were many random flashbacks and sometimes you dont know if its a flashback or not. It was a puzzle that was scattered out and ever so slowly, piece by piece it all came back together in the end. It was very intriguing in that sense, but frustrating because I was constantly going back to find out what was going on, and only when I had gone back did pervious things make sense. The author traps you in her sticky web where you are disgusted and would throw the book away but yet curious to see what will happen next.The book has controversial themes to it, which are always mature topics. Some of the many themes that are encountered are: the supernatural, slavery, women's rights, prejudices with blacks and whites. Hot topics like these are difficult for the younger ones to comprehend.With all these things bombarding me I felt like my poor brain would explode from all the pressure.All in all I felt that it was a really well written book. The author allowed me to be apart of the story and to get in to it even though I didn't care for the content or to be apart of the story. So if you liked everything I've mentioned so far, than that's terrific. You should get the book right away; if not, than its better to avoid it. The author, however, I feel is very talented in her craft. Props to her."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a beautifully written novel. Morrison creates beautiful images throughout the entire novel that help the reader to try to understand the emotions of the characters. However, the concept of &quot;rememory&quot; and the various flashbacks that occur throughout the novel confuse the reader rather than help them.Every character in the novel is forced to face their pasts at some point in the book. Morrison demonstrates this by strategically placing flashbacks throughout the book. Although the flashbacks do provide some insight into the life of the characters, they confuse the reader and force the reader to piece together the puzzle of Beloved themselves. Morrison should have written the novel in chronological order to help readers understand her concepts.Despite the fact that Beloved is quite confusing, I still give it three stars. Morrison is quite good at her craft, as her complex plot kept me interested in the novel. I would reccommend the novel to others."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Without a doubt, Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved\\" is a powerful novel, addressing such controversial issues as race, religion, slavery, gender, and the supernatural. With such powerful topics to cover, one question is asked: Is Morrison pushing her book too far?Obviously, slavery is a major issue in \\"Beloved\\". Set in the Civil War era, in a time where slavery plagues American life and Black people are made to feel its wrath at the hands of white people simply because of skin color, \\"Beloved\\" revolves around Sethe, a Black mother who, while fleeing from a life of slavery, becomes pregnant. Not wanting her newborn daughter to have to endure the horrors of slavery, Sethe does what she feels is the right thing and kills her, believing that even death is preferable to a life of slavery.Life is the issue at this point. A question that still is being asked today is \\"Who has the right to life?\\" Does a baby have the right to make his or her own choices, even though they aren't clear, or should adults be able to make those choices?Another critical issue is the role gender plays in the story. With men being portrayed as being passive in the face of injustice, as when Halle, Sethe's husband, does nothing to prevent her from being raped by white boys, or ovely agressive, as when Paul D., a former slave, pushes Sethe to remember her past and not just to forget it, and women being portrayed as caring, as is the case of Sethe's mother-in-law Baby Suggs, who devotes her life to aiding those coping with slavery, or the case of Amy Denver, who, though despite being White, aids Sethe in giving birth to Denver, is Morrison trying to reverse the role of the sexes to strike back at sexism, or is she only trying to reverse the cycle of sexism by lifting women up and cuting men down.Lastly, with the story told from the perspective of the slave rather than that of the master, the reader is able to witness the evils of slavery. Again, controversey arises. Is Morrison using the story as a realistic satire in hopes of alreting people to the harshness of racism, or is she, with the use of anti-White language and imagery, trying to lift up Black status by cutting down White people?In closing, no one can doubt the power of \\"Beloved\\", but much can be said and debated over how that power is used."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is one of the most complex albeit rewarding and satisfying novels I have ever read about American history, especially that regarding the treatment of blacks at the hands of the racist whites at the time.I got introduced to the novel Beloved this year in my literature class, and i am really disappointed that many people my age (16 years) or a bit older do not appreciate aspects of Beloved...Yes, it is a hard and confusing novel, but it is unique and that is what caught my attention...Many people complain that the ghost aspect of the story puts them off the novel. What they fail to realise is that the Africans of that time believed and accepted spiritual occurrences and so the ghosts were part of everyday life..Beloved is packed with symbolism and metaphors. This is what makes it such a challenging read because the reader can never let their guard down, or else they might miss out on valuable and subtle clues about the characters' pasts.One example of the use of symbolism by Morrison is the house 124. To all the characters, it did not feel like just a house or a structure to live in. It was a person by its own right and meant different things to different characters. &#65533;Denver approached the house, regarding it, as she always did, as a person rather than a structure. A person that wept, sighed trembled and fell into fits.&#65533; (Page 29)To many runaway slaves, 124 was their first taste of freedom after a life full of the horrors of slavery. To townsfolk, it was a place not only of childhood memories, but also of the murder of \\"Beloved\\" and Sethe's craziness.To Baby Suggs, it was her first house that came at a hard price. It was a place where no one was allowed to come from the back door. Everyone was welcome to come and stay. It was the first place in which she was truly free, where she could block memories of slavery. (Slaves were forced to come from the backdoor of a white person's house, which is why Baby Suggs blocked the backdoor)To Sethe, it was two things. She believed it was her freedom. By shutting the front door, which had remained open to outsiders and the neighbourhood when 124 was at its hey-day, she had shut herself away from the world. It was her first ever house and that was significant to her. I think Sethe's the kind of person who needs something to show milestones in her life. For example, when she married Halle, she really wanted a proper marriage and as that was not possible, she made a dress on the sly. It was important to her that there was something to affirm this marriage. Similarly, I think that as the dress was important to her, the house must have been too, which might be one of the reasons that she was so adamant that she wouldn&#65533;t leave it. It was her first taste of freedom and the first time she was able to feel secure, away from white people.124 was a form of repression for Denver, who yearned to be loved and enjoy the companies of people outside of the house.As you can see, there is more to the house than meets the eye, and this is just one of many examples of how Morrison uses symbolism to get her message across and to help you form your opinion about the characters. You just have to have the patience and the time.Who do i recommend this book to? It is not an easy book, so i do not have an easy answer. Mainly, i would recommend that this novel be discussed in a group, because sometimes you might miss out on an important detail that another person might have picked up..I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a quick read or anyone who does not want to learn the truth about slavery. It IS grotesque in many places and touches many tabboo subjects.However, I would recommend it to mature readers who like a challenge and who are willing to be immersed in a novel.So I really hope that you read it because it rewards you in the end. It is a captivating novel if you allow it to be.. Take your time and let the novel speak for itself."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, by Toni Morrison, is a shattering book. The ingredients of the story are simple: slavery, a dead baby, broken lives and a broken family. But the lyrical prose and ingenious structure of this tale yields far more than a good novel: it produces a masterful epic that resounds with themes personal and universal, from the haunting of the past to the terror of slavery.Some readers may not digest the way the story is told, and the author certainly makes no allowances. Her writing is similar to her protagonist, Sethe's, situation: either accept, understand, and experience the tale to its fullest, or leave bewildered.Beloved is an extraordinary novel that I strongly recommend anyone to read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"How to write a review for a book which thousands of articles and reviews have been written on? I'll try to stick to the primary highlights and pros and cons, and let you be the judge. Set in the US after the Civil War, blacks are technically free, but not really as they is still oppression from the white majority. However, in Beloved, that's only one aspect of the oppression, as it also comes in the form of the black community within its self, within people's personal lives, and from... a ghost.A very unique, but powerful form of prose that Morrison uses is that the storyline is not linear. Meaning you jump around from present to past and from different points of view almost constantly. It works, but you can read it like a regular book and will have to read more slowly. It can be worth it, but it can also be frustrated at times. But by the end, you realize it couldn't have been written any other way, and still have the impact it leaves upon you.Now let me say right now that my description above is a VERY shallow scratching of the surface. There are tons of issues throughout this book for the read to think upon, which is why this book earned both a Pulitzer and the National Book Award. So do not classify this as a \\"ghost story\\" as it's much, much more. Indeed, it is more of a post-Civil War story on the black experience than anything else, if you can believe that. In that sense, the \\"ghost story\\" seems out of place at first, but it definitely lends itself to the ex-slavery aspect very strongly as you continue reading.One thing to note that I did not care for, and others may not, is the rather animalistic portrayal and graphicness of the sexual tones throughout the book. It may be accurate of the times, though I don't know, but it is disturbing regardless. All in all, a very good read, and I can see why it's fated to be an instant classic. For that reason, I probably should have given it 5 stars, but I can't say it's my favorite type of book personally. But for any literary critic out there, or anyone interested in the black experience after the civil war, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The plot of this book is only understandable if it is read symbolically. I am a Ph.D. with an undergraduate degree in English from a Southern University with a well-respected English department, and frankly, I didn't really \\"get\\" this book until I read the Cliff Notes and talked to folks with degrees in literature who had read the book. The book is only understandable if you read into the plot that Beloved is a representation of all slaves and of the burden and history of slavery. It is only on this level, for instance, that one can understand how Beloved insinuates herself between Sethe and Paul D, why Paul D becomes sexually involved with Beloved, and why, despite the fact that Paul D dislikes Beloved and does not enjoy sex with her, that she nevertheless opens his \\"tobacco tin\\" heart. It is also only on the symbolic level that I think most readers will be able to \\"suspend disbelief\\" and accept that Beloved returns to her mother from death. I very much enjoyed the \\"magic realism\\" of The House of the Spirits and Like Water for Chocolate, but in both of those books, the magic realism enhanced the plot; in Beloved, the magic realism is the plot.I could go on with example after example of how the plot functions only if it is read symbolically. This is why I found the book frustrating, and why I am not convinced that it should be part of the canon of works that high school students should read. I read this book because my son had to read it during Spring Break and I thought that I could encourage him (he prefers Math, Physics and History, but is never sent home with material to read on those subjects during Spring Break). Unfortunately, I was almost as frustrated with the book as he was. Yes, I think I would enjoy it more on a second reading now that I understand that the book's plot doesn't really function without knowledge of the symbolism. If you want a real challenge, enjoy dense symbolism, and/or are interested in what high school students are being encouraged to read these days, read this book. If you want something that makes sense on a first reading, well, choose something else."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Slavery remains a sore subject. No family likes to air dysfunction in public let alone takes responsibility for any harm down to its family members and certainly no country, especially one taunting that all men are created equal, likes to acknowledge its hypocritical history. No one wants to slice open the American apple pie and find maggots. Back in high school, sitting comfortably in my suburban northeastern classroom, the history books emphasized the triumph of the North not only winning the Civil War, but also freeing the slaves from a life of imprisonment. Good had triumphed, the country made whole again, and everyone lived happily ever after. There was no contemplation of the hardships suffered by the newly freed men, women, and children, who after having been &quot;owned,&quot; were tossed into society, given no or little resources and greeted with a great deal of animosity, for while Lincoln's leadership eliminated slavery it did not abolish the racist belief system of our country that sadly continues to this day. Morrison's Beloved, a rich, lyrical tale, dares to pressure the reader to face the forgotten and ignored reality of those post-war slaves.The former slaves of Sweet Home, Sethe and Paul D., deal quite differently with their physical freedom from slavery but both remain equally haunted by the pain, humiliation and abuse they have endured. Memories of the horrific dehumanizing mistreatment-brutal beatings, rape, imprisonment and murder-flood them each and every day, even twenty years of living slavery-free. By alternating the point-of-views within the chapters, including the ghost, Beloved, the story's core, the frightening truth of the soul annihilation of the slaves is masterfully unveiled by Morrison's pen. Morrison shows how the unspeakable abuse haunts the slave survivors. By the book's end the past has conquered Sethe and the story center's of infanticide while living in freedom from slavery has been logically rendered as the most loving gesture of protection Sethe could have given her eldest daughter. Because as Baby Suggs had told her, &quot;No bad luck but white people. They don't know when to stop.&quot;Unfortunately, while beautifully rendered, the narrative line becomes more and more jagged as the main narrator, Sethe, loses her sense of reality. The traumatic memories heighten the pitch of the story. This is a complex, tragic story based on the horrid reality of our country's history. Why make it any harder for the reader to face the atrocities and devastation that attacked a people long after their birth right of freedom was legally declared? Morrison's story reveals how unbelievably resilient the human spirit is and how cruel our white ancestors were. However, as a literary work, the piece falls a tad short by making the reader plow through the frequent narrative time changes and at times, an unreliable narrator. While the story's integrity is maintained by Sethe losing her mind, the actual story time becomes fuzzy, creating a parallel process for the reader perhaps, but at the same time unnecessarily clouding the clarity of the narrative. This reader became confused and had to re-read passages to regain her footing, asking: Are these delusions of Sethe in the story's present? Or traumatic memories? For instance, Sethe is headed for the Clearing where Baby Suggs preached and Sethe is remembering Baby Suggs just prior to her death laying in bed in her room at 124 and obsessing about colors. Within the same paragraph the story jumps to the past within the past to Sethe's arrival with Denver to Baby Suggs' home. This literary masterpiece is not as fully realized as it could have been because these flashbacks within flashbacks push the reader away from an already difficult topic. The abrupt time shifts mar this masterpiece by disengaging the reader from the story's natural progression. Dialogue is never transcribed literally because it would bog down the narrative, nor should the process of remembering be literally transcribed because it confuses the narrative line and in Morrison's case, unnecessarily tarnishes a profound literary work. Despite this minor flaw, the novel haunts the reader long after the final word is read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is an intensely difficult book. Not just in its writing, but in the story it tells. At the same time, it's so hard to put down that I found myself up late at night just waiting to see what would happen. Morrison pulls no punches here, from the evils of slavery (and they are depicted in this book as I have never seen them before... with a spare, unflinching look that maks you feel that you are down in the mud and blood with them), to the confusion and turmoil of the post-Civil War years. At its heart is Sethe, and the secret that she carries. (It would be more fair actually to call it guilt, it's only a secret to the readers... not to most of the characters.) This book will wear you down, but not in a bad way. The depictions of the horrors are bloodcurdling. This book also is so densely written, and so full of images, and stories and visions that its also hard to put it down with your first reading and say, &quot;Wasn't that pleasant?&quot; and go on and never botehr with it again. Beloved sticks in your mind like a popcorn kernel between your teeth, and it won't come loose until you work at it some more. This book may have taken a while to read, but even longer to process, and THAT is the sign of a great book, and even better author. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book for the first time in 1999; I had to think about it prior to knowing how I felt about it. However, I have come to realize that this is a kind of African American Reference book, not only for understanding slavery, but for many cultural pitfalls that are indigneous to the Af-Am community. Therefore, if you don't know anything about the history of blacks as enslaved community, or if you don't wish to be provoked into thinking, don't attempt to read this or any of her earlier works. I came to the understanding that Morrison writes in a kind of double consciousness when I was reading the inane reviews of Paradise. One can't be taught to understand Morrison, nor can she be read superficially."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Although it took me 2 months to read the book, when I did actually force myself to read it, I enjoyed it. Toni Morrison's story is beautiful and complex. In fact, this book is so complex that I do NOT recommend it for the type of person who refuses to think about/re-read certain passages.Also, I noticed that in other reviews, some people were distracted/offended by the sexual imagery in the story. While sex is mentioned a few times, only the ignorant would be so obsessed with these few passages to find the entire book repulsive.If you want a challenging book that opens your eyes to the hardships slaves faced, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I absolutely love this book. It's certainly my favorite, and I've read it about 4 times through thus far. Everytime I opened it up and begun to read I realized that I found something new, a new perspective, hidden meaning, etc. that I thought wasn't there before. My first Morrison book was \\"The bluest eye\\" and she really caught my attention with that one, so I decided to read Beloved and was absolutely blown away by her astounding abilities as a writer. The only thing I didn't like the 1st time around is the open ended question in the conclusion that a reader can feel trapped in when she/he wonders where Beloved went, how, why...it takes patience :). Aside, it's magnificent! I recommend this book fully!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I think that Beloved was a great novel. It was very suspenseful. In a way it made me a little scared to finish. If you are not a comprehensive reader then you will have trouble with this novel. It tells of a dark-past that has came back to haunt Sethe. She is faced with the reality of how cruel,yet understood that killing her infant daughter was. She also tries to put her past at Sweet Home to rest. But simply can't bacause she has been scared so badly from her experiences that she has come to think of the one on her back as a chokecherry tree with different branches. As her daughter Denver is presented with some suspicious evidence, she then puts all the pieces together that would eventually lead up to the explaining of who the baby ghost was. She was indeed the ghost of the girl whom walked out of water from over there. Her sister Beloved. As Denver wanted to keep the secret dark and unknown, Beloved had other plans. She intruded in their house and came back for her family. As the story was brought to a close, it all made since to me why such actions had taken place. I was able to understand everything i hadn't understood in the beginning. This is a very complex book that should be read with very extreme cautions. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison shines in this novel with the use of powerful, spell-binding writing. Creatively apt metaphors abound, \\"Beloved\\" showcases a feast of brilliant storytelling techniques which promises to mesmerize the reader. Well-crafted life-like dialogues, a convoluted yet captivating storyline and heartwrenching themes are just some of the gems that can be found in the book. Through a story set in rurual Ohio several years after the Civil War, \\"Beloved\\" is founded on the aftermath of the protagonist(Sethe)'s escape from slavery. The opening statement \\"124 was spiteful\\" set the tone for the book. Though a free person now, Sethe is still tortured by memories of the past. She wants to let go and start life anew, but her child whom she killed, the tree-like scars on her back, stories of from Paul D and Stamp all return to haunt her. Not many will be able to rationalize Sethe's intention behind murdering her children. However, considering the setting of the scene with \\"four horsemen\\", reminiscent of the biblical Apocalypse, we are actually more inclined to empathize with Sethe.The inhumane treatment of the black slaves described so vividly reminds us of the atrocities of slavery. \\"Beloved\\" also seeks to illustrate the theme of love - mother-daughter love, sisterly love, heterosexual love and brotherhood love among the blacks. The book's allusion to a ghost wreaking havoc in the house is only an excuse for the unfolding of the plot.\\"Beloved\\" is a book that scores on the depth of the issues covered, the marvel of its storytelling and the soundness of characterization. A first reading may leave the reader a little confused, but subsequent readings will leave him in a savoury mode. \\"Beloved\\" is ambitious writing, but Toni turned in a spectacular performance. Few will not be touched by it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison displayed her extraordinary talent as a writer with her novel Beloved. She magnificently painted the picture of the trials and tribulations of African-Americans in post-Civil War America. Morrison created images and spawned emotion with her powerful words.However, Morrison was unable to create an entertaining story. The images she created were often distasteful and took away from the impact the story had on me. I believe the author intended to provoke mixed emotions and mixed reactions. If this is so, she succeeded. However, Morrison failed to get her point to the reader. She suggests many things, but never displays the courage to express what she is really trying to say. She was inconsistent in her opinion towards white people. She portrayed whites as cruel and evil at times, and at other times had her characters express gratitude towards them.Beloved was a good book, but not a good story. If you are one who reads for gratification, I would not suggest it solely because of lack of satisfaction and/or fulfillment the story leaves you feeling. If you read to expand your horizons on a cultural level, just remember, you'll never get the hours you'll waste on this book back."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I liked the movie, but the book knocked me out. I felt the story was too brilliant, uncomfortable, symbolic, just plainly TOO DEEP for the majority of people. But that's ok, that's what makes \\"Beloved\\" what it is. Unique. This book took my breath away. Pure genius. Dark genius.Who am I? 44 yr. old white female surrealist artist (full time), loves history, classics, Jung, mythology, and science for non- scientists. Live in Fells Point, Baltimore. Believes in reincarnation. This is the general picture of where I'm coming from.I enjoy black history. I don't get defensive about the slavery thing because I'm certain we all are, have been and will be, many things. Back then the only people on the entire planet who weren't cruel were Quakers and Tibetan monks. We are now becoming civilized because of a combination of education and mass-media communications which can breed empathy. So stepping into these characters heads that existed in those circumstances in that culture at that point in time is completely interesting to me. Then, to have this deep, beautiful, hideous, haunting story take me on this journey that I couldn't have dreamed of myself was a privilege.I believe it's important to consider parts of the story as a manifestation of the symbolic, not just simply viewed as a fantasy. The daughter comes into her life from somewhere;ie, the daughter \\"haunts\\" her. The daughter's character has sex with Paul; symbolically, the daughter (the murder of the daughter) haunts Sethe to the point that the daughter even \\"comes (psychologically) between them\\" in bed. What the author has done is have these characters act out the symbolic events in physical form. This realization makes everything deeper, more interesting, and really creates new questions with no answers. This is not something of interest to people who want to have a fun read, seek escapism. You escape here into a kind of nightmare.So yes, I recommend it to people that thrive on these kinds of things. But one thing I want to add, which was a touch of pure genius in the book, without giving the whole thing away; on the last page, if you have come this far, you have been deep into these characters, have gotten to know them, feel their pain. Then Tony Morrison wings that description, that physical detail at your head, knowing if it was even mentioned earlier it would have tainted most people's ability to empathize with this character. Most people would have mentally compartmentalized the character in a kind of \\"freak show\\" category, allowing a person to dismiss the character because it would be so hard to imagine that character's particular plight. She doesn't let you get away with it. If you have come this far, you have been there with the character the whole time. This master stoke was not acknowledged in the movie; it would have been almost impossible to present it visually, and one whole chunk of psychology was omitted and this is what makes the writing genius. This is what makes the psychology of the writing genius. This is why I love the book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The book Beloved is a captivating and enthralling story about a woman who is forced to confront her horrible past in the hopes of dealing with her present, and perhaps, what remains of her future.The main character is Sethe, a former slave-woman who escaped from her bondage after being raped by two young white men from Sweet Home, the plantation they all lived on. She fled from Sweet Home and arrived at 124, the way-station house where her mother-in-law lived. For a while they were happy, until Schoolteacher, the new owner of Sweet Home came after Sethe in an attempt to make the best of her remaining \\"breeding years\\". In a desperate attempt to protect her children, she wounded her sons, murdered her baby daughter and was about to kill her youngest child, Denver, until a family friend stopped her.From that day on, everything seemed to go downhill: Sethe's two sons ran away, her loving mother-in-law Baby Suggs died, and 124 was haunted by the spiteful baby ghost. Sethe and Denver lived alone and isolated in the condemned house until Paul D, who used to live at Sweet Home with Sethe, arrived at the house and scared the ghost off. Finally it seemed like the characters could move on with their lives, but then a strange woman, who said her name was Beloved, appeared in their front yard and the characters were swept into a tidal wave of emotions dealing with their pasts.Beloved is like the daughter Sethe thought she was protecting with murder, the sister and companion Denver never got to know, and the seductive young girl Paul D yearned for when he was living at Sweet Home. One by one, Beloved gained control over the characters, and treated each of them like meaningless \\"rag dolls\\".Throughout the story, the characters are forced to remember all the events of their past they try so hard to repress. Sethe struggles with the memories of Sweet Home and the dreadful day she swept up her children when she saw Schoolteacher coming; Paul D fights with his memories of being jailed in Alfred, Georgia; and Denver tries desperately to remember the stories Baby Suggs used to tell her about her \\"angelman\\" daddy.The story is a confused mixture of memories and emotions the reader is forced to piece together. One of Morrison's aims was to allow the reader to experience the same painful journey the characters were faced to go through confronting the nightmares of the past so the present could be dealt with as well, and the author did an excellent job. There was no way you could read the story and not feel like you, too, were experiencing the painful memories of the characters.Morrison also presents this to her readers: is it really possible to imagine just how bad slavery really was? Can people really even begin to imagine the horrible reality of one of the cruelest aspects of our history? For a mother to think that death is the only way out of a life of slavery, it had to have been pretty serious in pushing someone's mind beyond the barriers of right and wrong. Sethe believed she was protecting her child-could she really have been that terrified for her daughter that she murdered her? Morrison's masterpiece surely makes her readers question time and time again the savageness and barbarity of such an awful and cruel way of life some people were forced to deal with."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"No review can do justice to this beautifully written and anguishing masterpiece--you simply must read it, or rather: taste it, feel its many-textured fabrics, let it work on you, wrench you, make you laugh and weep with despair. And laugh.Reading it, I was reminded of the Hispanic legend of La Llorona, the ghostly Weeping Woman who dwells near bodies of water. Some version of her shows up in every time and place where the feminine is enslaved, used up and exiled. The land itself weeps Lloronic tears. So do haunted houses.In our Get Over It society it is often asked: why must we continue to dwell on such terrible pasts--the Holocaust, slavery, or, as in this novel, whose unfolding story is its own and only \\"message,\\" the genocidal times just after the Reconstruction that ought really to be called the Redestruction? (As though we ever really did dwell on them!)Because to forget is to repeat the past. To forget that our racist, imperialist age of empires has infected us with a microbe of intolerance gives it the quiet in which it mushrooms into still more hatred, still more retaliation. When politicians start talking about ridding the world of evil, the one thing you can count on is that denial of the past has helped reawaken the plague....and that the only possible containments are the awareness of being its carriers (I speak as an Anglo-American whose country is fed with steady transfusions of incomprehensible injustice), the courage to differ--and the stories of those we have tried in vain to silence.For the dead, too, speak in this novel. To contemplate how many of them stand behind it in the shadows of being is to sit, for a page or two at a time, within a hallowed space."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is an absolutely beautiful, haunting book, that can ravage the reader emotionally. By the end, however, the strength of the characters after facing extraordinary adversity is inspiring, exciting, and profound. The characters are complicated, realistic, and nuanced.I am shocked that so many people have complained about the plot, writing etc. This is a difficult read in many ways: it is highly symbolic, not entirely linear in timing, and emotionally difficult. But I think that any reasonably mature and skilled reader can handle it. In reponse to the person who complained about the racial depictions: there is one very important white character and that is the girl who helps Sethe in the forest after escaping. I suggest rereading it and thinking more about how symbolically and practically important that character is.This book touches on many deeply moving subjects, race and slavery or course, but also familial tensions, romantic love, sexual passion, and (I think) most importantly, overcoming the weight of one's past and self acceptance.I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After the first 15 pages and adjusting to her style, the story grabbed me so tight, I sat all day Saturday until I finished the book. Haven't done this in 20 years or more. Stellar, view-altering, yummy, and soul searching angst. Read it, weep, smile and learn."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In the award-winning novel by Toni Morrison, BELOVED was one of the many books that I enjoyed reading with a heart-warming passion. It lead me by the hands through the struggling story of Sethe, a runaway slave, trying to let go of her past. As her and her family move to a farm in a house called #124, Sethe realizes that she hasn't left all the torment she has been haunted by behind. She's lost so many along her life, that she's not even sure she can survive on her own, so she leans on Paul D. to help her along the way. Even though it was tough to follow through the book, with the different scenes being mentioned to help readers understand the many struggles Sethe has gone through, but you learn that Sethe has been through a lot in her life.For eighteen years, Sethe and her daughter Denver, have lived in #124 in Ohio, secluding their selves from the people around them, she meets a man by the name of Paul D., her long-missing husband's friend, and they begin to reveal the stories from their great escape of slavery. As her young daughter Beloved haunts her, a ghostly figure who calls herself Beloved moves in and gradually takes over the household and begins to demand and take over Sethe's soul, which breaks her soul.This book is a marvelous book that taught me the meaning of struggle and letting go of your past."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved / 0-452-28062-1\\"Beloved\\" is not for everyone, but if you cherish the tradition of rich symbolism given to us by such masters as Hawthorne and Poe, you may well love \\"Beloved\\".\\"Beloved\\" tells the languorous story of the set-upon Sethe, an ex-slave who has endured the worst hardships life can offer. Having lost a child, she feels deeply burdened with the guilt of the death, her feelings of failure as a mother, even her regret that she could not procure a more elaborate grave marker for her dear baby. When a mysterious girl arrives, seeming to embody the ghostly spirit of the lost child, Sethe clings to the girl in an attempt to salvage some forgiveness for her past sins. As the girl grows stronger every day, she seems to leach Sethe's own spirit and Sethe withers away, to the sorrow of her friends and loved ones.The rich symbolism is so heavily redolent of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, only here the shame is directed (however unfairly) inwardly, rather than from outside forces. \\"Beloved\\" is, at the heart of it, a wonderful novel of how destructive our guilt and pain can be, when we allow it purchase.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I have to admit, I approached this novel with quite a bit of trepidation. It was an Oprah's book club pick, which generally means depressing, and I tend to be leery of \\"highly acclaimed\\" books. Maybe a bit of reverse snobbishness. But I've been making a point lately of ignoring my knee-jerk reactions and trying to check things out before I judge them.If you haven't heard anything about it, Beloved is the story of Sethe and her daughter Denver, who live alone with a ghost now that her mother-in-law has died and her two sons have left home. A man from Sethe's past shows up, Paul D., and then a young woman, Beloved, who becomes ever more demanding.Through a series of flashbacks and memories, we get the picture of Sethe's life, and how and why it culminated in her killing one of her children and attempting to kill the others. I'd been forewarned about that, so it wasn't as much of a shock as it might have been.Beloved is a powerful novel. I can't really express it any other way. It provides an unvarnished look at a period in history that would be more comfortable to forget. But if that were all it was, I wouldn't have liked it so much. I'm not one to hide my head in the sand, but I don't see the point of dwelling on the horrors people inflict on each other, either. I like to know and then move on.It's also a story of community, and how people react as groups. Sethe was rejected by her community, not as much because she'd killed her child, but because she was too independent. It's an interesting concept, and one that applies very much to me as well--like Sethe, I find it shameful to ask for help, preferring to do without than to reach out. So the story hit me on that level as well.But for me, mostly, it was a story of guilt, and how Sethe's guilt manifested itself (literally), and how she needed to accept help to forgive herself. And that's what really made the story for me.I doubt I'll re-read this, at least not for a long time, but I'm very glad I did."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I've read this book for two separate English classes at Williams College now, and it's been a really remarkable experience- I don't want to ruin any of the plot or the characters, but I would really recommend that anyone, particularly those with an interest in the history of slavery, pick this up sometime. It made me cry, but maybe I'm just overemotional..."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I don't know how many times I tried beginning this book. The plot was confusing - I couldn't follow it. But when I really began reading it, turning the pages, it was a feeling more than a plot; I just let the words flow across my mind. Eventually everything came into place. The most amazing thing is Morrison's talent. She can put you, as a reader, in someone else's shoes, whether it's Paul D. or Sethe. I don't care if your ancestors were slaves 100 years ago in America or 1000 years ago in Rome, you will feel what it's like, how dehumanizing, when you read this book. And I'm still wondering if Beloved was truly a spirit or simply Sethe's insanity."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Amazon.com great company to buy from. Prices, shipping, etc.I was expecting a bit more in the book beings the movie was so good, did not hold my interest, but the price was good."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"A book almost too painful to read, it reminds me in a way of the movie Schindler's list, very heavy with horrific images, make sure you pick the right mood to read this in. I enjoyed the author's going back and forth between past and present and switching between characters, it kept my attention. While I found the book easy to read it was certainly not light reading, this is a story of slavery in America described through the personal experiences of several characters. The main character Sethe is a black woman who escaped from slavery - when her \\"owner\\" tracked her and her children and was going to take them back, she actually killed one of her children rather than having her too experience life as a slave. The book begins 18 years after that event, and it is a story about facing ghosts from the past.Harsh as the book is, there are a few moments that are truly uplifting. The scene where Sethe has arrived at Baby Suggs' house of freedom and wakes up to her first days out of slavery thinking of what to do with the day and getting to know other black people as unique personalities for the first time. Also no matter how bleak the past, there's still a promise of something better for the future symbolized by the character of Denver.In spite of all, the human spirit survives."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book can't really show you what it was actually like being a slave, it more or less tells you what the characters experience in those times. Morrison tries to give a slight visual of what happen in those times and how they felt about not being able to be there own person. And forgettin about how it felt to laugh and love. She talked about Sethe not wanting to remember her past . I mean who want to remember being beat and rape. She was rape for her milk that was there for her children and they &quot;stole it&quot;. Morrison has a way of writing in a very descriptive way . Each chapter is giving you a vivid image in your mind not trying to make you undrestand what happen but letting you see through the eyes of the writer. Is this our story? (African American) or His-Story"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This novel makes you think and use your brain from the first sentence to the last, if you don't like to think while reading, then this book is not for you. It is, however, a truly breathtaking book that makes you ask questions about what you thought you believed. Through Sethe, readers are brought into a life of unspeakable despair and brave hope that are mixed together in a way that leaves you wanting more. With no true ending, this post-modern book leaves you expecting to see more chapters; but that's a signature of a good book, it makes you think about it and remember it, long after you've finished reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"...Although I loved this book, and furthermore love Toni Morrison as a writer, I will even admit to not having cracked all of the meaning of this immensely complex and textured novel. By the same token, not knowing every spice that a great steak was seasoned with does not mean I can't appreciate the steak. You seem to have missed the most central point in the novel, Beloved is not simply Sethe's child, she is slavery personified. Beloved is as you put it &quot;annoying,&quot; but really annoying is flagrant understatement. You were right to negatively react to Beloved. She is kniving, greedy, selfish, and yes even &quot;revolting.&quot; And every one of those words, and worse, could just as easily describe slavery. It is actually slavery, not Beloved that comes back to haunt Sethe, and it is only once Sethe learns to value herself, to reverse the devaluation that was a result of slavery (&quot;you your best thing&quot;) that Sethe can let go of Beloved and of slavery. You question Sethe launching into her life story, but it is the only story she knows, the one that is branded--literally and figuratively--on her. A life of subjugation has left her with nothing but that subjugation. It is her inability to move past that story--of reliving and fearing it--that speaks even today to the black condition. It was the evil she knew, and the psychological basis for some enslaved Africans, even upon emancipation, remaining with their masters often becoming sharecroppers. It was not because slavery was in any form or fashion humane or kind to those whom it enslaved. It was all that they knew. Years of maltreatment, of being told what to do, when to do it, and where, left many slaves hopelessly lost. Sethe hated Sweet Home, hated Schoolteacher, but despite her efforts otherwise, both seemed to always control her, always haunt her.That Sethe would lose control of her bladder when confronted by this pervasive and evil apparition is, in effect, a mild reaction. I assume that you have no historical understanding of slavery in the United States. I can especially assume so from your description of &quot;black&quot; slavery as &quot;noteworthy.&quot; Slavery, although, not often acknowledged, haunts the United States just as Beloved haunts Sethe. The Americans fought and died over this &quot;ghost,&quot; and this &quot;ghost&quot; still plays into so much of how race is viewed in this country. And although, again, often not acknowledged, slavery was the birth of black people in this country, and still factors into how we view ourselves and approach this world. On the surface, slavery provides free labor, but enslavement meant much more. It was to deny them their family, their history, any sense of self-worth, independence, or community, to ensure that they would remain enslaved. Enslavement does not just trap a body: it holds the mind and the spirit captive, as well, long after emancipation. &quot;Beloved&quot; captures that on so many levels. I would suggest that you read a book on slavery. &quot;Africans in America&quot; by Charles Johnson and &quot;From Slavery to Freedom&quot; by John Hope Franklin are primers on African American history or for a more specific look at slavery &quot;Slavery and Social Death&quot; or &quot;Rituals of Blood&quot; both by Orlando Patterson. Further, the mysticism you criticize is also an acknowledged part of African American culture. The power of dreams and insults to ancestors, while not as strongly believed in as it once was, is still a central and integral part of black history. This book could have instructed you, if you had allowed it to do so. Instead, you bought into some sort of hype as to what this book was: Pulitzer prize winning, yes, written by a Nobel Prize winning author, most assuredly, but an easy text to read, one you can skim, or even read once and still understand, most definitely not. More than that, it is a statement on the enslavement of not just this one woman, or even simply of black people, but the racial enslavement of this country for nearly 500 years, from the moment the first African set foot on this continent..."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, an unimaginable tale of slavery and it's aftermath, is truly a heartwrenching and astounding novel. Sethe, a former slave, escapes from her life of slavery to Ohio only to be haunted by her past all over again. Through all the hardships Sethe has faced, her only weakness is her children. Sethe is haunted by the decision she made years earlier, the decision she believed at the time was best for her child. Sethe's past comes back in the form of a ghost (Beloved) and is determined to never let Sethe forget about her past mistakes. When I first started reading this book, I had a hard time understanding the story line because of the way Toni Morrison brings about her characters and plot. She uses &quot;rememory&quot; and many complicated metaphors to bring up important subjects that are vital to the story. For instance, she constantly and unexpectedly shifts from present to past tenses which often confuses the reader. Also, she introduces new characters into the novel unexpectedly and does not explain them until later on. Extended metaphors are used to force the reader to actually think and try to figure out the true meaning of the book. For example, throughout the book, Sethe keeps mentioning that she has a &quot;tree&quot; growing on her back. Readers are left dumbfounded and curious about what she is talking about. It is not until later in the novel that we find out that the &quot;tree&quot; on Sethe's back is actually the scars and markings from when she was whipped by the schoolmaster and his boys back at Sweet Home, where she used to be enslaved. The permanent scars, which formed the shape of a &quot;chokecherry tree&quot; on Sethe's back, not only refers to the physical scars but also refers to the mental scars that will serve as a reminder of slavery that will never be erased from Sethe's mind. Even though Morrison's use of &quot;rememory&quot; and metaphors can be confusing to some readers, these little touches are also what make's Morrison's style so unique and enjoyable to read. Therefore, when reading Beloved, one feels like they're actually in the book. You get so wrapped up in the novel that it's hard to put it down. Beloved is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I must say I am saddened by the many reviews that think Beloved is too complicated or too afro-centric. should Jews forgive and forget the holocaust? Slavery represents the struggle of a people, and should be re-told and re-membered. Slavery is a difficult and desperatly confusing issue, so it is no wonder that Beloved is so difficult to read: thats what makes it good. You have to work for the story, and once you do you will find it worth it. I read this book first five years ago as a senior in a HS AP English class. It was a struggle for me, and I never quite understood much of what the text had to say. As a sophmore Lit major, I reread the novel in African American literature... and found it captivating. I have since read it again and again, getting more out of the book each time. This isn't pool side reading that can be gulped down and forgotten... it must be tasted a little at a time, analyzed and remembered.Also, don't take the movie version of this novel as gospel... that is only one interpretation of many. Beloved may be a ghost, but she may not... the whole point is to decide for yourself. What does Beloved mean to you?"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well I'd like to start off by saying that the prose in this novel is absolutely stunning. Morrison writes with beautiful and poetic language. That aside, I struggled through this book despite the magnificent writing. Firstly, I just want to note that DO NOT ATTEMPT to read this book if you have never read the Bible. Literally every other page is a literary picture of a Bibical image; whether it be the Four Horsemen, Snakes, Sword and Shield, or the Flood. This imagery was very vivid but it becomes so bogged down in symbolism and imagery that it is impossible to evade confusion. One chapter (not labeled chapters although) in particular has a conversation at the end without quotations or names and takes you about 5 rereads to understand it. I read this for International Baccalaureate Advanced Lit Studies (Higher level lit) and even my teacher noted that it will take several rereads to understand the novel. I can see how this is ok for a Lit class but not someone who is reading it for fun; it is definitely not a casual, \\"hey I need something to read!\\" book. No casual reader should struggle to basically read a rewritten version of the Bible; avoid this book unless you are planning to attack it, ripping out every little sentence with an image or motif and noting the mood and tone."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was very disappointed with Morrison's \\"Beloved\\". Granted, there were several creative lyrical phrases scattered among the disjointed paragraphs and strange plot lines, but the work as a whole wasn't worth finishing.

Don't be fooled by the hype."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I tried to listen to the CD version of this book. Morrison reads it herself. She should have hired a professional. I listen to books in my car. There is road noise. Even with my hearing aids and the volume turned to max I could not understand much of what she was saying -- even when the car was stopped. She talks in this breathless, whispering, trailing off at the end of words sort of way. Those of you with hearing issues know what I am talking about.

I got so tired of reading about Sethe's daughter Denver trying to keep Beloved happy, of Paul's confusion as to where to sleep, of Beloved's mood swings...I've read thousands of books in my life, and only twice have I not bothered to finish a novel. &quot;Beloved&quot; was one of them.

You can't read Morrison once; every book she writes is a treasure, but she makes you work for it. 'Beloved' tells the story of Sethe, an escaped slave who finds sanctuary in Ohio, and posits the unanswerable question: is it possible to kill someone out of love? When the slavecatchers find Sethe in hiding, she kills her youngest child, Beloved, to spare her from being taken back into the hell Sethe escaped from. Her act can be viewed as horrific (as her lover, Paul D, reacts when he tells her 'you got two legs, not four'), or as desperation; Morrison lets you decide for yourself. Beloved's ghost returns and causes all kinds of chaos in the house, and her actions raise the question of just who is Beloved -- is she some kind of demon, or is she a lost soul searching for love so she can finally find peace? This is one of the most powerful, disturbing, and ultimately uplifting books I have ever read. As I said, Morrison makes you work for the treasure hidden her books, but the search, and the reward, make it all worthwhile."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Unfortunately, though I gave this book two attempts with a years interval, I still couldn't finish it!

Sethe, one of the main characters, lives at 124 with her daughter Denver, mother-in-law Baby Suggs, and the ghost of the baby she murdered 18 years ago. When a strange woman named Beloved arrives at their house, Sethe is forced to confront her past, including murdering her baby girl. Beloved also makes Denver become more independent and self-sufficient.Beloved acts as the catalyst in making Sethe remember her past. She asks questions that help to trigger painful memories, such as her illegal marriage to Halle, another slave. Sethe then finds out that Halle betrayed her in the worst way. Beloved's presence helps to fill in the gaps that Morrison leaves in the beginning of the book.Beloved also helps Denver become an independent woman. In the beginning of the book, Denver is a recluse who rarely goes beyond the fence around the house in fear of the \\"evil thing\\" that made Sethe kill her baby so many years ago. However, when Sethe's attention turns to Beloved, Denver must start taking care of herself. She conquers her fear of the world beyond the fence and gets a job to support herself, Sethe, and Beloved.I would recommend this book only to certain people. I would recommend this book to you if you had someone else to discuss it with. This book is difficult to read and just as difficult to understand. You also need to have a certain level of maturity to understand the meaning behind all of the swearing and graphic sexual content in this book. If you do read this book, I know that you will experience a powerful, moving novel."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The story of Beloved unfolds not chronologically, but concentrically, opening layer after layer of narrative around one central event: a former slave's murder of her daughter, Beloved. This design makes for some confusion at the beginning of the text, and especially on a first read. But because the action at the heart of the novel, the infanticide, is so horrific, it seems Toni Morrison wanted to approach it slowly, indirectly. We find out much more about the aftermath of the murder, and the events of the mother Sethe's life leading up to it, before fully comprehending the events that take place in the barn at 124 Bluestone Road. The way Morrison tells the story mimics the manner in which Sethe deals with this moment of her past, where central events are danced around, moved in on.I'm fascinated by the way Toni Morrison has been able to create, within the context of a ghost story, a novel about the inheritance of culture, and how today, we might grapple with the history of slavery we all share. The characters in this novel straddle two worlds, one of freedom and one of former slavery, life in Ohio and bondage in Kentucky. The first section is preceded by two epigraphs-\\"Sixty Million and more,\\" and on a separate page, a quote from Romans 9:25, \\"I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.\\" Indeed, the Beloved that appears in the story is a ghost and feels she has not been loved right. The novel opens in the house that Beloved haunts. \\"124 was spiteful,\\" and as a result, Sethe's sons, Howard and Buglar, have fled (they took off when the ghost stuck its hands in a cake). Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother in law, has died. And the only living relative at 124 is Sethe's daughter, Denver. The house, its moods and shifting atmospheres take prominence at the opening of each of the three sections of the novel.Beloved deals pointedly with the atrocities of slavery; so much so, that the reader may begin to debate whether Sethe's \\"prideful\\" act to keep her daughter from it was actually a merciful one. The most devastating bargain Sethe, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and others who have come out of slave life in Sweet Home make, is that they will not love anything too much in order to survive. In a climate where children are taken from their mothers, husbands separated from their wives at slaveowners' will, the characters guard themselves to simply maintain their sanity. But when a gentle man by the name of Paul D reappears in Sethe's life, she cannot suppress her desire for a family.But just when Paul D and Sethe and Denver seem to be cohering, a stranger appears leaning on a tree stump at 124, a young woman who has come out of the marsh, dressed in a wet black dress, who is thirsty and sporting new shoes and smooth, wrinkleless skin. The book deals intelligently and in the most startling prose with this conflict between a life one might want to construct for oneself in the future and the choking tendrils of the past. Sethes returns from the carnival with her \\"family\\" in hand and meets this specter of a woman, her baby ghost-in-the-flesh, and at once the conflict begins."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved by Toni Morrison. Highly recommended.In 275 gripping and unsettling pages, Toni Morrison encapsulates the late 19th century black experience through the story of Sweet Home, a small Kentucky farm, and one of its former slaves, Sethe, who has found an uneasy freedom north of an arbitrary line that does not exist on any natural map.To empathize the universality of experience, Sethe's mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, notes wryly, &quot;Not a house in the country ain't packed to its rafters with some dead Negro's grief.&quot; Later, Beloved, living in freedom in Ohio, will experience vivid ancestral memories aboard a slave ship-the memories of generations before her. These are contrasted to Sethe's &quot;terrible memory,&quot; where she recalls the beauty of the sycamores better than the dead men hanging from them. This may explain the persistence of the dead baby's ghost haunting Sethe's house at 124 Bluestone Road-the need to remind Sethe of everything she cannot forget.From the forced bestiality of the Sweet Home men to Sethe's anguish about how teacher's nephews stole her milk as though she were a cow, the theme of animals prevails throughout Beloved. Later, it is revealed that Sethe experienced an epiphany when she discovers teacher and nephews dividing her on paper into human and animal traits.Her companion, Paul D, has witnessed the difference between an animal and himself. Once imprisoned underground, once forced to wear a bit like a horse, Paul D walks past a rooster whose egg he had helped break open during hatching. &quot;Mister, he looked so . . . free . . . Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. But wasn't allowed to be and stay what I was . . . wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D again, living or dead . . . I was something else and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.&quot;Ultimately, Beloved is revisionist history that makes the connection between racism and slavery-a connection that often seems missing from the whitewashed history we are taught. The Sweet Home farm represents this version of history. The male slaves are encouraged to think of themselves as men and are even allowed to carry guns, while Sethe is permitted her choice of partners and to keep her children. In this version of history, no one is beaten or restrained. Sweet Home's slaves, while not free, represent what we like to think-that slaves were well treated, that families were allowed to stay intact, and that somehow, antithetical to our declared values, black slaves in the United States were better off than free blacks in &quot;primitive&quot; Africa.While Alex Haley's genealogical epic Roots dramatically depicted the reality of slavery-the brutal amputation of runaway Kunta Kinte's foot, his beatings, the rape of slaves by white masters-Morrison takes a different approach. The reader learns the story of Sweet Home-both before and after teacher arrives-through the gradual unfurling of Sethe and Paul D's &quot;rememories,&quot; both thought and spoken. In other words, in Beloved the former slaves aren't just shown and depicted; they speak for themselves and they tell their own version of slavery directly. The advent of teacher (a symbol of education and civilisation) marks the transition from the relative idyll of Sweet Home to slavery as practiced, where Sethe is brutalised, her husband is reduced to shock, Sixo is hunted down like an animal and killed for asserting his manhood through song (which may explain Paul D's singing by the time he and Sethe find each other again), and any sense of rights or autonomy is proved to be an illusion. It's not necessary to witness Sethe being beaten for telling her mistress how her milk was stolen; the branching tree on her back will tell the story for the rest of her life.Sweet Home under teacher is slavery as it was, where slave owners who behave like animals convince themselves that it is the slaves who are part human, part animal, and where slavery is motivated by racism. Throughout, there is Beloved, rightly perceived by Denver as &quot;more,&quot; who is sacrificed to be spared what everyone knows, &quot;that anybody white could take your whole self for anything that came to mind. Dirty you so bad you couldn't like yourself any more. Dirty you so bad you forgot who you were and couldn't think it up.&quot; Through her action, Sethe deprives Beloved of her own choices, thus enslaving her. And so Beloved returns to deny Sethe her own will.Morrison may be accused of racism, but there is no feasible way to deny her characters their feelings after what they have heard, witnessed, and experienced. They cannot feel otherwise. Characters like Amy, the uneducated (unlike teacher) &quot;whitegirl&quot; who helps Sethe deliver Denver, and the sheriff who is kind toward Sethe despite her action, prove that there can be humanity among even a people who may seem otherwise inhumane.Beloved is beautifully written and structured, poetic in tone, and compelling to read. It is also timeless and will most likely stand as one of the great novels of the 20th century.Diane L. Schirf, 22 February 2004."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, by Tony Morrison, is a mesmerizing novel which draws the reader in using unconventional methods to tell a powerful story about blacks in America. Morrison tells the story of Sethe, a black former slave who now lives alone in a haunted house with her estranged daughter Denver. The story progresses in the form of various flashbacks from different points of view. The reader starts off the novel in a state of complete confusion, as the story takes off leaving you in the dust, wondering what's going on. This ingenious way of writing the novel makes the reader feel gratified as they read on and begin to discover the tragic story of Sethe's life. The characters in Beloved stand out and become real as the story goes on. You sympathize with Denver, Sethe's daughter, who has never had a real childhood or anything happy in her life. There is Stamp Paid, an old former slave himself who rescued many slaves including Sethe. Sethe herself, an escaped slave who slit her baby's throat so the white master couldn't have her. Finally, Beloved, a strange girl who appears as her baby come back to life. The reader gets no central lesson out of the story. Morrison was not trying to teach a lesson when she wrote Beloved. She simply was telling the story of the thousands of black slaves and what they went through. The result is a story which touches the reader inside. While there is not a lot of blood and gore, the book speaks of the horrors of slavery quietly but very powerfully. Imagine a black man watching as a group of white men rape his pregnant wife. Think of a black man being burned alive by his master as punishment for trying to escape. And finally, there is nothing more conceivably horrible than the slaughtering of your own child. It makes you ask yourself, \\"What could be so horrible that you would actually saw off your own baby's head because of it?\\" To me, that was the whole point of the story, to make the reader realize the complete and utter devastation slavery was on blacks. The story also portrayed the strength and courage of the women slaves, who had to be put through so many hardships, especially being raped by their white masters. Morrison wrote the story to touch all those who read it. The broken-up plot which perplexes the reader also makes him willing to come back for more. Beloved is a story that should be read again, if not to discover something new, then simply to understand it!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"Beloved\\" by Toni Morrison is a beguiling, beautiful story. I found myself a little lost at first. It seemed like the story would shift at a crucial point, and we were left wondering what happened. But I was pulled in, even from the first couple of chapters,the characters had a hold on me, and I had to know their story. The more I read, the more I saw that the story was actually coming together beautifully.The tale which is told through the memories of the main characters, revolves around Sethe, an ex-slave who has escaped and is making a tough journey to be reunited with her children. The house in which they all live, is occupied also by the spirit of a baby girl. Sethe and daughter Denver, seems to take this spirit for granted and learn to live with it. When a man comes into Sethe's life, he banishes the ghost from the house, and soon after a strange young woman comes to live with them. Has this the spirit come back in the form of a woman, to claim her territory? As the past is slowly revealed to the reader through flashbacks, we learn the strengths and weaknesses of the characters, the hardships they endured, and the story thus unfolds wonderfully.Morrison's style in this story leaves the reader with great anticipation of what was to come. It was okay, not to know how someone got somewhere, or what the relationship is between others, as the suspense was very much a part of it. The reader also gets a good feel for the true nature of the relationship between slaves and owners, and some of the abuse was pretty tough to take for the reader. But it also served to bond with the characters, understand a little why they acted as they did, and maybe feel their pain.Could the ex-slaves, ever really be free of the chains of the past? Some of the flashback are pretty intense and emotional scenes, and I thought Morrison painted the pictures brilliantly. There were sometimes I thought the way she wrote a phrase, or a thought were so beautiful, I read them again and said \\"Wow\\".It is the story of one mother's great love for her children, of people coming together in times of need. The story and it's characters had me under a spell. One I was happy to be under.A beguiling read...enjoy...Laurieother recommended reading:Mother of PearlRiver, Cross My Heart (Oprah's Book Club)"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was required to read this book for my Advanced Placement English class, and I must say in the begining I found it to be very bizzare. Though as the story progressed I came to love it! The women of the book, to me, are so strong. They have been through so much but they continue to live, and they become stronger than they were before. It is a book that proves anything can be overcome if you have faith in yourself. Toni Morrison does an amazing job at making you feel a deeply personal conection to her characters. Denver is my favorite of the characters in this book, because she begins so closed and empty (afraid of her own mother), and becomes a quite strong and capable women. This book shows the horrors of what some people can endure, but the calming aftermath that can come if you believe. I rated this book a Five, because of it touched me as one of the best works I've ever read. I applaud Toni Morrison, and am anxious to read more of her books."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Along with Song of Solomon, this is Morrison's best book. It is a sophisticated narrative told with zest and poetry, and a deeply experimental, philosophical novel that dares to intervene in history. Morrison hits all the right notes. A classic."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Engrossing, Unputdownable, Probing, Shocking, at some points terrifying are all adjectives i would employ to describe this masterpiece of hope and shocking reality which combine to leave the reader lost in the realms of philosophy well after it is collecting dust on the bookshelf. Five stars and a pat on the back for brave Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a book of the trials and tribulations of life and struggles a women and her family wen't &amp; goe's thru. Such as loosing loved one's by natural death and murder and the a love tail that develop's as you read the book. Over all Toni Morrison does a good job of keeping your attention questioning your thought's on everyday life."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If you are looking for a good book to read, Bloved, by Toni Morrison, is definitly a book for you. The imagery is great. The author does a great job at painting a picture for the reader. Morrison also does a great job at involving the reader in the book and sucking them into it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a story of human spirit. Baby Suggs' once powerful and thriving is broken soon after the baby's death. Sethe is worn down by years of painful memories and regrets. Denver is forced from lonely solitude to be strong and independent as her mother weakens. Toni Morrison uses vivid, sometimes offensive, imagery to show the life Sethe ran away from. In Sethe's mind, she never seems to escape slavery. The memories haunt her, they keep her apart from other people, which is why she finds comfort in Paul D because he is familiar, he can understand. There is, however, often much distance between such scenes and since they take place outside of the current plot, they can be distracting. The scenes shine like faint glimmers in darkness, only small pieces of the whole picture are seen. The novel ends with a feeling of incompleteness. No matter how thoroughly Beloved is read, it gives the impression of skimming, instead. Toni Morrison tosses pieces of the story puzzle in the air, but gives no direction on how they fit together. Resultingly, the story keeps you guessing, and hoping."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I have just finished reading Beloved and am hooked. Morrisons book is filled with the beautiful language of literature while remaining readable and compulsive. Some appear to be confused by the style, it helps to let go occasionaly and just let the words be. I think a problem that many Americans have with this book is that it encourages the rememory of how the US was built upon the back of slavery and genocide. Its pretty much the same in Australia. Denial never helps, it merely perpetuates the oppression. Accept the source of your riches and recognise how and why you have the standard of living that you enjoy."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison did a superb job in writing such a powerful novel. Her technique sort of 'dizzies' the reader at first, then builds a foundation on what slavery was like in those days. Her story was based on an actual ovvurrence. Morrison took this event, embellished it by creating a baby ghost who shows itself in the form of a young women, and called her story Beloved. Each character's thoughts is heard to share with the reader his/her perception of the events. The one amazing character that is heard the most is Sethe. Sethe grows up on a farm called Sweet Home. There she marries Halle and has children. One thing black women have to refrain from is forming a bond with their children because majority of the babies gets sold to another farm. Sethe did form that bond with her children. Because she loved them boundlessly, she'd rather they die than have to go through the agony of being a slave. Unfortunately, Sethe was only able to save one of her babies, Beloved. 124 was spiteful. Full of baby's venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children. For years each put up with the spite in his own way, but by 1873 Sethe and her daughter Denver were its only victims. The grandmother, Baby Suggs, was dead, and the sons, Howard and Buglar, had run away by the time they were thirteen years old - as soon as merely looking in a mirror shattered it (that was the signal for Buglar); as soon as two tiny hand prints appeared in the cake (that was it for Howard). Neither boy waited to see more...This is the opening statement of Part I. It is effective in a way that reveals the strength of this baby ghost. The baby's venom is so potent that it scares off Howard and Buglar, and the word victim, suggest that Sethe and Denver are helpless against the baby's venom. Sethe and Denver's lives evolve around the baby ghost until Paul D. arrives. He is a former slave that labored on Sweet Home Farm. Paul D. took interest into becoming part of Sethes' life. He was ablto drive away the spirit. In the late afternoon, after a family day at the festival a young woman is found sitting on a stump near house 124. She calls herself Beloved. Her skin was a ssmooth as a baby's 'okole'. She never spoke much at first. As days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months she expressed herself more freely. Beloved grew and became stronger.124 was loud. Stamp Paid could hear it even from the road. He walked toward the house holding his head as high as possible so nobody looking could call him a sneak, although his worried mind made him feel like one.The arrival of Beloved triggered irresistible interweaving memories of the past and present events that were filled with anguish and fear. What treggered in Sethe was the &quot;rememory&quot; of the death of her baby. The grief and guilt in her hert, soul, and mind was Beloved's main food source. She was greedy for her mother's-love that was taken from her by brutal death. The beginning statement of Part II, stated above, is 124 being loud with urgent demands from Beloved to Sethe. Sethe was aa Beloved's every beckon call. She does everything Beloved desires because she does not want to lose her baby again. Beloved is awae of this and is taking ultimate advantage. Beloved mysteriously disappears when Sethe suddenly attacks Mr. Bodwin, a white man, instead of her own flesh and blood.This black literature of slavery is of top quality. The language of Toni Morrison does more than entertain its audience, history of being a slave is taught, history of being a slave is felt and the history of being a slave will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"A little bit of patience and an open-mind is all that is needed to fall in love with Beloved. The book presents itself in the first few lines as being a maze of story lines leaving the reader to choose which path to follow. The controversial issues of slavery, murders and ghosts may be overwhelming for the reserved readers, but if you are adventurous, this is the story for you. The style may be perplexing at first, but if you are patient and take the time to read, you may find Morrison's style to be one of the elite. However, I happen to be one of those reserved readers and I find Beloved to be a very disturbing book. Although Morrison should be praised for writing on subjects that other authors wouldn't dare to think about, I do not feel the impact that she had intended. The ghost child who was murdered by her own mother and the cruel punishment that the slaves endured are not subjects that I want to read about. I am also not patient enough for Morrison's style. I could not get past the first page without reading it three times. If you can get past the first page, Beloved is a novel I would recommend to you. However, if you are like me, it would be better if you read something that fit your personality."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Opening with a grtesque scene of evil, Beloved sets the reader onto a roller coaster of the mind. This roller coaster was fast and exciting at some ponts, leaving more to be desired,and slow and hard to follow at others.Throughout the book were tossed small little subplots, that in many ways had nothing to do with progressing the book forward, but that kept it in the past. Baby Suggs' singing in the field had little to do with how Sethe, and Denve had their current lives, it did not directly impact, just removed a minor character from the story, who didn't want to go. Another one was Sethe being ar work, it was rare when Beloved left the house, and when she didn't go to Sethe's work place.Paul D, when he arrrives at 124, finds an old broken down house, which is in the middle of a mid life crisis. He is also like the book in many ways, he takes a while to let his feelings show, preferring to keep them locked up inside. As he enters he sees the evil, and &quot;throws&quot; it out. This effectively gets rid of the evil, but only for a short time.In this time the reader is entertained with little sub stories, meant to either slow down the story, or to show more detail, and creativity of Toni Morrison. These little plots were very hard to piece together into anycertain order, especially when they did not deal with a chapter before or after the plot, but related later on in the book.When Beloved arrived the story begins to pick up, but again at a snails pace. More little intricacies, like Sethe's working chapter, where she goes to work, are brought up. With Beloved in place and much of character developed earlier, in essence she is the reincarted ghost of the house, it starts to get slower, as if the snail is dying. Paul D again stirred up the book and got it moving forward, but only a little, as he put it, &quot;a tin heart that didn't want to be opened.&quot;To recommend this book for furter reading past just for content would not be to much fun on any readers part. With the &quot;experimental&quot; style, of throwing everything into the book whenever wanted, instead of some organization of ideas, it gets difficult to read.Beloved brings to mind that maybe such things as the parnormal actually exist, and also that maybe some of the plantationsof the old south were not so bad and whipped the slaves. Beloved also allows the reader to see life through the eyes of a slave turned ex-slave, with many hardships, like the boys who milked Sethe, and the &quot;tree&quot; on her back, and how they, the slave, viewed the white man, as &quot;a man without skin.&quot; Morrison did on thing well, and that was to show how slavery would, in the case of an ex-slave, prompt him/her to take his/her own life, and that of the life of those he/she loved, and cared about."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I found the book to be diffucult and slow at first, but once into the book it was actually intriguing and I couldn't put it down. I do not feel the subject is over used, this was about a important time in our history, it expresses the feelings a few individuals might have had at the time. It showed that Sethe believed death was better than a life of slavery, and to imply that, I find it a very powerful novel. It was very emotional and touching in parts and I recommend it to any one who enjoys a well written story."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If your looking for a book with muliple ideas to connect with then Beloved is for you.

At least James' form follows the function of his novels. Morrison's style does not add to the artistry of what could have been a very powerful novel based on the theme. All the plaudits are much ado about nothing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved was one of the most riveting books I've ever read. Toni Morrison really grasped what it was like to sacrifice yourself and your children for freedom. Her characters were rich with meaning; with them she was able to conveythe true meaning of pain and anguish. Ms. Morrison is among the greatest to ever pick up the pen. I am proud that she was able to get millions of people to finally understand what happened in the moments when no one was looking. She presented the realism that is Black thought and belief; never before has a more real situation or more real characters been created."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison has a strong grasp of the English language in everything she has written that I've read. But in them all, the words never really flowed for me and came up cold and stilted.

Sad, but true."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I've read this novel three times and recently watched the movie. Like all of Morrison's fiction, Beloved takes the reader through the pieces of shattered identities and lives. With the patience required to read any good piece of fiction, Morrison's novel begins to unfold on a variety of levels. For the African American community there is the subject of the history of slavery, struggling to place that history in the creation of identity, and the power of community. There is also the all-important question of what is your &quot;best thing?&quot; The book is marvelous and will haunt you for life--but with issues that *should* haunt you for life!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I am an avid, long-time fan of Toni Morrison. Each and every word she has published up until now sits on my bookshelf permanently, except when I take down a book to re-read it. Beloved, like the title, is my first and favorite Morrison. At first read, I found it extremely difficult. Thankfully, a college literature course forced me to read it again. It is an emotional labyrinth that draws you in deeper and deeper, dangerously close to your own psyche. In this one novel, Morrison teaches more about slavery, culture, humanity, and spirituality than any history, sociology or religion course could ever aim to.

Hopefully the book will go more indepth."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As I read the reader's comments, I am sadly reminded of my own book discussion of Beloved a few months ago, where a white woman began the discussion by announcing that she wanted to discuss the book, but she didn't want to talk about slavery because it &quot;made her feel bad.&quot; Other white people in the group nodded in agreement. I simply explained to them that slavery is at the very core of the novel; afterall, Sethe's motivation for killing her daughter . . you know why. Naturally, the book discussion went badly, for despite my efforts to convince folks to put aside their need to avoid what makes them uncomfortable (i.e., the very tired &quot;white guilt&quot; thing that I'm sure we've all heard of)and have a serious dialogue about the novel. Some of the comments that I have read today makes me question the reader's motivation -- were readers dismissing the novel out of a need to dismiss a subject that makes people (both black &amp; white) squirm, or were the claims legitimate? One reader described the novel as &quot;wallowing in grotesque&quot;, &quot;repetitive and repulsing,&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;. Well, what do you think slavery was? Not everyone on the plantation had cute lil names like Kizzy &amp; Chicken George nor did they dance and sing 'round the plantation with a fiddle. If you're disgusted with the &quot;peculiar institution&quot;, then great(!) -- we all should be, for the true horror of slavery wasn't that it was unpaid labor. Get disgusted with slavery, but don't blame the novel if you are. Some readers have commented that the characters weren't sympathetic enough. Sethe was a proud woman, proud to the point where she participated in her own isolation in the black community. A woman like that certanly wouldn't want a reader's sympathy. Why readers think Sethe needs sympathy because she was enslaved is beyond me -- I think that Morrison was trying to show that Sethe is human with human characteristics and flaws (her excessive pride being one). My point is that Sethe(and her descendants) want and need your sympathy about as much as we want and need your guilt. Now I am not one to bash people for having an opinion -- fine, think what you want. But I challenge readers to be honest about what they're challenging. To negatively criticize a book because the subject matter isn't the stuff that skips down the yellow brick road isn't really about the novel at all. Toni Morrison is a master story teller (I've been a fan long before Oprah) who opens the too-long silence of the black woman's experience in America. Here we are with an opportunity to have an open dialogue about the &quot;S&quot; word and the aftereffects that we are still experiencing. We have an chance to really break through some very old,painful barriers, but we're still playing hide-and-seek because true commnuication and healing runs the risks of making us &quot;feel bad.&quot; Pity. Perhaps you'll dismiss me as another whining, preachy and angry black woman. Now I offer my sympathy."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book the third time throughout four years and the more I read the more I like it. Because of the continuous moving back and forward with the time and because of the supernatural happenings,it is not an &quot;easy book&quot;.

I have read several of her books, Beloved is by far the best. Not to say that the others weren't exceptional. Morrison is so amazing, the detail with which she describes aspects of slavery and of Sethe's life, astound me. You definately have to be patient and read this book carefully--maybe twice. I am looking forward to seeing the movie, though the actors chosen to play the characters in the book confused me a little. I think Oprah and Danny Glover are amazing, but I did not see them in these roles. Morrison is an amazing writer and I look forward to reading all of her books."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beautiful language, but the story and characters left me cold.

Sethe is reborn as a result of her slain daughter's ghost come back to haunt her murderer's soul. She is forced to bring the past from deep within its safe hiding place and confront the horror of her past life as a slave and the stain of her own baby-girl's blood on her conscious and her own hands.

A little on the depressing side as is Morrison's writing as a whole, however, this woman is brilliant. She has the gift of transporting the reader to her world and the gift of being able to explain very tough, human concepts to the reader. I will admit, a lot of the symbolism and metaphors were lost on me because I am not a gifted analyst, however I do know brilliance when I read it. The main character Sethe is crazed yet rational in the setting; almost bizarre in her saneness in light of her past. Beloved is truly eerie as the woman who seeks to destroy Sethe. All of the other characters in the book are riveting, as is Morrison's commentary on the roots of the black community. How blacks interact, envy, and covet. Simply fabulous!!!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morriso is an absolute goddess of literature! Everything she writes is magnificent. She is the last living great American author.

Those three things earn this book four stars. The reason I cannot give this book the fifth star goes along the same lines of what one &quot;professional&quot; reviewer said above, that Toni Morrison has taken a mirror and shattered it leaving it to the reader to put the pieces together. Oh how often and how easy great contemporary writers are abusing this method, marginalizing their readers to a thin crust of university professors and mensa members. Give me Huck Finn, just as ripe a novel, over a lets play &quot;Connect the plot lines&quot; any day. However, besides the plot fragmentation and language density, which leads to the boredom that many have mentioned, what we've got left is one of the deepest explorations of slavery, memory, and family (in that order) in contemporary times."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I could say maybe one harsh word about Beloved if I wanted to, but I couldn't make it as harsh as 'boring' and consider myself sane.

If Toni's writing style can be described with one word, it would be 'poetic'. Unfortunatly, I'm not into poetry, or similies, or metaphors. I realize now that I'm more into story, which this book has plety of, just not the kind I like. So, it really boils down to whether you're into that kind of writing or not. If you are, than this book will easily become a favorite, as it already has for many others."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If you don't like a book, or just simply don't enjoy reading in general, why bother to read it? If the book is boring, find something more to your taste. If you don't like the book, don't condemn those of us that do. I personally enjoyed this book, and lok forward to reading more of Morrison's work. Though she is not to everyone's taste, there is no denying her standards as a writer, and this is clearly evidenced by the many awards she has deservedly won for her hard work and dedication. She writes about things that are important to her, something that is sadly lacking from a lot of authors' work nowadays."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"A jumble of ideas and events. Beloved is a story that thrusts ideas and events towards you with no explanation. For example, the main character in the story, Sethe, has many flashbacks from the past. A paragraph in the story may start with an event in the present time and then bring in something from the past without notice. Because of this, I had to flip back to pages and re-read the paragraphs in order to get the idea. Amongst the confusion, I got one basic idea from the story-the past will come back to haunt you if you don't face it and come to terms with it. Morrison puts this idea into action by her impressive writing style. The confusing flashbacks to her days as a slave, to killing her own child, to the present (not necessarily in that order) all conspire to force Sethe to let go of the past. There are some things I didn't like about the story. The idea that Beloved, the daughter whom Sethe had killed, comes back is great, but there could be other scenarios to that idea. Why did Morrison settle on making Beloved return as an ungrateful person? Would making Beloved a loving character change the emotional emphasis on the characters? There would be more guilt on Sethe's part if the latter idea were chosen. Also, I disagree with Sethe's decision in killing Beloved to \\"protect\\" her. Sure, we want to protect our children, but we shouldn't be the one to decide for them whether we live or not-the one affected should decide. There's also the idea of afterlife-Morrison could have expanded that idea. After all, the fact that Beloved remembers (after all, Beloved was only two years old) everything about Sethe and her past opens up the question, \\"What happens after we die?\\""},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's Beloved is a powerful novel that portrays a mother's personal experiences with slavery and her questionable love for her child. As Sethe takes us back to her past, we learn about her unconceivable choice to slaughter her baby girl. Sethe wanted to spare her child the burden of slavery, but can her dead daughter accept that? Sethe is forced to deal with Beloved, as she comes back to haunt her mother, until Paul D chases her away. However, Beloved refuses to be separated from Sethe and comes back to her in the form of a young lady. Beloved definitely encompasses the burden of slavery in a controversial way. One might say that he/she can understand why Sethe slaughtered her child and tried to kill her other children, but I absolutely can't understand her actions. What kind of mother could actually slaughter her own child with a hand axe? That is such a gruesome death. Furthermore, I would never be able to understand how a mother could carry her child for nine months, bring in into the world, and be the very one to kill it. Sethe's psychological problems would be the only way that I could justify her actions. I'm not a black person, so I would never be able to understand the effects of slavery from a personal perspective, but you don't need to be black to know that no one deserves to be slaughtered. I somewhat understand how much the black slaves suffered, and I definitely understand why Sethe didn't want her children to go through the things that she experienced. However, if Sethe really wanted to protect her children she had another option. If Sethe was in her right state of mind, she could have simply self-inflicted a miscarriage. Despite my refusal to accept the reason why Sethe killed her child, her choice of action definitely challenges my thoughts. Her choice of action makes me wonder about the depth of slavery. Killing a child in order to protect it reflects the unimaginable hardships and separations that black families experienced. Novels and history books can capture your personal emotions, but someone's experience with slavery will always remain personal. Those of us who have never been slaves will never be able to fully understand what they went through because we've never &quot;been in their shoes.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In a whirlwind of broken thoughts and memories, Toni Morrison is able to leave Beloved's reader desperate for more. Morrison uses unconventional methods to attract and capture the reader's attention. By telling Sethe's story in scattered fragments, the reader is forced to read on to keep from being left in the dark. Beloved is an example of what a fugitive slave would do to prevent her biggest fear from coming true. Morrison sets up this fear with extensive background knowledge. Morrison takes generic occurrences often stereotyped with slavery and transforms them into unimaginable horror. At some points, it is almost understandable why Sethe felt she had no other choice but to spare her children from slavery. Morrison's Beloved challenges the reader's beliefs as far as the supernatural is concerned. In the very beginning, the characters force the reader to accept ghosts and angry spirits as every day incidents. It comes as no surprise to the reader when Beloved's true character and whereabouts are revealed. Morrison's unique style makes Beloved the incredible novel it is. Her artistic flare and talent make Beloved stand out against a mass of boring detail."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book is very powerful. Once you read it, you will want to read it over and over to understand everything that happened, but you won't be able to. Morrison effectively mimics humans' process of remembering what was once forgotten. In addition, she shows the hardships that African Americans had to deal with and how the traumas of their lives affected them."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was quite an interesting book. Although I found it to be quite difficult, I found myself connected to the struggle that bestows the characters. How their past greatly scars their future, and how they continue to live with it is remarkable. Going into the mind of an ex-Afican-slave has to be one of the most unbelievable masterpieces in the history of novelsas it is portrayed in Beloved. Toni Morrison is one of the few great novelist of our time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I think that this book was great, althought it was quiet wierd and twisted, it still was an excellent book. The great detail and historical accuracy, made the characters in the book amazing. After a while(for me at least)they are not charaters but people, and you start beliving that they are real wich makes this book so wonderfull and hard to put down. I belive that this book will become one of the greats of our time and a classic."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well, after much hestitation and putting it off I finally sat down to read this book. I was surprised to find it a good story. Its a story about freedom, remaining free at all cost. Its about community and watching out for one another. Then, there is Beloved who is looking for love from the person who took life away from her. I guess hearing so much about the book, I was able to understand the symbolisms that I think I would have normally missed. The reading is slow, its difficult, but if you take your time it comes together. Even if you don't understand something, I found it will be revealed later in the book, just hold on."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I had the great opportunity to read Beloved about a year ago. Its descriptive, detailed writing was only a hint of the talent and skill that she has. The love that Sethe, the main character had for her children was the most intriguing love story that I have ever read. Toni's sensitivity towards Sethe's character made me compelled to understand her as an African-American, a woman, and a mother. Originally, I judged Sethe for her descision, but as the story line progressed, I began to see myself in this woman, this mother and understood her descision to take the lives of her children as well as her own for the sake of freedom. I believe that God has truly blessed Toni and I hope she continues to bless great lovers of literature with her writing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"When I first read this book, I didn't quite understand it. After I did reports on it did I finally come to realize the true power of Toni Morrison's words. Her book tells of one woman going through her life as a slave and then as an escapee. The decisions that the main character had to make were heartbraking, including the decision to kill her own daughter to save her from a life of slavery. The way Toni Morrison wrote the story with flash backs of the characters past really help me understand what emotion the characters were feeling and the time. This book has powerful thoughts and emotions about a very touchy time in our history, and I think Toni Morrison did a very good job in writing a story that tells of the past from a certian womans point of view that most people would over look."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was very confusing to me, but it held my interest to the very end. If you like stories about ghosts or mystery you will like this book. It takes place in the late 1800's in Ohio. The main character talks a lot about her struggles while she was pregnant trying to run from the white men that held her as a slave. Once she got away she didn't want to ever go back, so when the white men came to get her and her children she had to do something horrible. That incident is the link to the whole story. This book is to me sad and confusing, but it was very good and it makes you feel for the characters."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I first came to Morrison's work in graduate school when I was forced to read &quot;Sula.&quot; It was yet another occasion when I learned why the teachers were the teachers and the students were the students.Morrison's insightful and sometimes frightening representations of the emotions that accompany intense passions--hatred, love, fear, joy--blend seamlessly into her detailed and realistic accounts of lives that she seems to have lived herself. She never sinks to judging her characters for her readers. Instead, she gives living color to these pitiable yet proud, misguided yet messianic lives. And each life she shows us has at least one facet that rings true to our own lives.Buy it or borrow it. Or borrow it and then buy it. After you read it, you'll want it on your shelves."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison takes stream of consciousness writing to a new extreme. There is one whole chapter with no punctuation. This may not sound like a good thing, but it is. This style of writing, at which Morrison is particularly adept, allows the characters to do more than just talk and think. It allows the reader to look into the character and follow its thoughts. This book is puzzling, but as the story progresses it slowly becomes clear what exactly is happening. One must have great patience in the beginning of the book, for it is often times confusing, but after a chapter or so, the reader is irrevocably hooked. Morrison also makes symbolism and literary allusions work for her. If you're into an absorbing read, this is it. However, be prepared to invest a lot of time and effort in it. This book is not for the casual reader"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book three years ago and have recently read it again. Morrison's words are touching and frighening. The story of Sethe's life as a slave, her escape and life there after is very absorbing and disturbing. Although the appearance of Belovedis quite unbelievable (to me at least), once youget used to her presence, the book is excellentand will haunt you for years after."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What will a mother do for her child? Will she die for it? Will she kill it herself to keep it from dying at the hands of others? At some point or time we all say we'll do whatever it takes for the health and happiness of our children and then the day arrives when either we eat these words or live up to them. Sethe lives and and in a sense dies by them. This story is so full of metaphor and symbolism that a reader must bring something to the book in order to get something out of it. Toni Morrison has asked us a question and after reading this book some who thought they had the answer may want to re-think it. This tale, though gruesome and horrific is one of Ms Morrison's most fascinating and intriguing stories to date. We often ask what will love do for us, what does love have to give to us, when we should ask, what will we do for love? It doesn't get much better than this"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The book did not follow the accepted standards of the literary world and that is what makes it special. It is special because it does not describe the objective world; it describes the subjective world. It makes one appreciate emotions.The book delves into the characters' minds deeply, giving the reader a sense of intimacy.Excellent book for ones seeking original and refreshing work."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book just blew my mind. It tells how life was for slaves and former slaver in the United States. This book will definitely bring up emotions from deep inside the toughest character. This is the story of a family and their past. This is a strong learning experience.Stop what you are doing and read this one."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Luis Borges can be too scholastic for some, Kafka can be too grim and Garcia Marquez too magical. This is indeed one of the few books that I won't hesitate to recommend to any individual independent of his/her personal preferences in reading. After reading \`Beloved', almost three years ago, I felt compelled to read all of Toni Morrioson's other works, but I rate this one the best. It also won her the Pulitzer prize in 1988.I remember reading \`Roots' by Alex Haley, the torments and the frustrations of African Americans; he had searched the roots back to the slave trade and the atrocities committed hence. I feel equally enraged when I read Rohinton Mistry write about the inhumanity of an Indian to Indian in \`A Fine Balance'. Toni Morrison on the other hand doesn't write about the beaten and the downtrodden or about the plight of her people. She writes about the sensuous women and their loving men, the lovemakings, the songs, the birth pangs and death agonies. What is the most commendable is her ability to write without hate and without preaching.What makes \`Beloved' supreme is that the imagery presented in the book is almost poetic. For instance, Sethe's whipped back is described as a chokecherry tree complete with trunk, branches and tiny chokecherry leaves. The narration is non linear and yet she handles the threads masterfully without leaving the reader perplexed. The style borders on magic realism without being bizzare. If she had written nothing but this one book, I would still undoubtedly consider her the best living American novel writer."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Once in a blue moon you find a read that penetrates to avisceral level as Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot; does. Yourheart will never be the same after this hauntingly beautiful book takes up residence in that place for special feelings. This is one of the most poetically written pieces of literature I have ever had the honor to experience. You've got to read this one."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Why I read this book, I am not sure. It took a great sense of wonder to read and finish to the end. To wonder about the person who could endure writing such a book increased its enormous value,You knew she told a terrible truth.Maybe the most important book ever writen about how life was for blacks in america.It fuels the desire to never forget BELOVED and to do what you can to reduce or irradicate abuse of any kind to other human beings."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Something restive and irredeemable haunts the house known as 124. The spirit of Seth Sugg's dead baby girl, whose name is forgotten, but who is called Beloved, rives the house and its inhabitants. Just a child of two years when she was murdered, Beloved is at turns willful and fragile, petulant and loving, singular and legion.Such also is the nature of Toni Morrison's novel, Beloved. Like its titular character, Beloved is complex, mysterious, and fantastical.Toni Morrison's greatest achievement in Beloved is her dynamic sense of wordplay. Staccato bursts of idiomatic dialogue lack the preciousness that could have marred them. Omniscient narration is so finely and precisely crafted that the causal reader might well not notice the multitude of themes pour forth from the pages. Beloved manages greatness without have to proclaim its own importance, with the writing intelligent and accessible without falling into condescension. Through rich and varied wordplay Beloved manages the improbably: It is an undeniable modern classic that is as much at home in a university great-books curriculum as it is an engrossing who-dunnit mystery story"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Proclaimed the best novel written in the US in the last 25 years, and authored by a Nobel laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner, one may rightly expect something truly impressive when starting out on this story. And impressive it is, though in a gloomy, obsessive, and claustrophobia-inducing way. \\"Beloved\\" is a psychological ghost story in the manner of Henry James's 'Turn of the Screw'. Its style seems deliberately literary, heavy-handed at times, very much reminiscent of Virgina Woolf. Morrison takes us inside the minds of her characters with such insistence that the effect is analytical: it creates distance rather than familiarity. Though the horrors and inequities of slavery shock, for this reader the general tone is too artificial to truly move. But compelling it is.Some readers are apparently troubled by the constant use of flashbacks and memories; the discontinuous timeline does oblige you to pay attention, but in the end the complexity it creates is hardly more than superficial; this is, in essence, a fairly simple and straightforward story. Sethe, a slave who escaped from a Kentucky plantation, is now living in her mother-in-laws' house in Cincinnati, together with her daughter, Denver. For reasons that we learn of later, her two sons have gone away. Also, we are informed matter-of-factly on the very first page, the house is haunted by the angry spirit of a baby. Two arrivals upset the status quo. First that of Paul D., who has escaped from the same plantation where Sethe used to be. Then, that of a mysterious young woman who calls herself Beloved, and lays an increasingly exclusive claim on Sethe. As the story unfolds, we learn of the history connecting these people, and what drives them. We get acquainted with their friends, enemies, and families. The gruesome, merciless realities of the slave business and of racism are laid bare in all their inhumanity. We learn, too, the horrific eighteen year old memory at the core of Sethe's life, the cause of the haunting, and its connection to Beloved. None of this is presented in horror-story fashion, though; Morrison is concerned with the history and inner life of her characters, not with cheap thrills or cliff-hangers. It will, for instance, be instantly clear to most readers who Beloved is right at her first appearance.A strangely fascinating, but dark book, which I personally would not rate quite as highly as the forum of reviewers and literati did who were invited by the New York Times to name the best US novel since 1980, - but which I found very worthwhile nonetheless."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\`Beloved' has been shunned by many for its graphic portrayals of the dark side of human nature, by those who think that these portrayals are unnecessary to the story. But without these scenes and images that portray all the horrors of slavery, the story is incomplete and not as powerful. If the story lacked these scenes and images, it would make the resurrection of Beloved less believable and not as creepy. It would also make it harder for the reader to understand why Sethe could have possibly wanted to kill her children to keep them from a life of slavery. Slavery is awful, but doesn't seem that bad until you read about the chained black slaves who, when faced with the decision of performing oral sex on white guards, chose a bullet in their brain instead. Or, when slave owners used females slaves as breeders. Still, with all of the horrible images that Morrison provides, infanticide is probably the most shocking, although other scenes make it less horrific. Many readers are turned off or insulted by the author's graphic, offensive, and obscene incidents.Readers learn about Sethe's disturbingly graphic and tragic past. Sethe has had to let a stranger use her body in exchange for some letters on a headstone. She has had her own milk stolen from her. She has been beaten until her back has split open. She has been so scarred by the horror of slavery that she felt killing her own children would be better then letting them live in slavery. Not only Sethe has had to go through with these atrocities. Her mother has been hanged, and her fellow slaves beaten, raped, tortured, murdered and burned alive. Everyone around her has been affected, as black men, women, and children all suffer because of their skin color.Readers are drawn in as Sethe's past comes back to haunt her, and as the pieces of the story click together. The story is constantly delving into her and other character's thoughts, feelings, and pasts, and then resurfacing in the character's present time, and although this may be a little confusing or overwhelming, Morrison is able to relate the character's experiences of the past with the character's actions and decisions of the present.I don't recommend this book for the easily offended or immature reader. It contains graphic material. It is not an easy read!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"It is a good book but very hard to follow."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved was an amazing story. It took you on a roller coaster of emotion from pure disgust and disbelief to sympathy and understanding. The way Toni Morrison writes is somewhat hard to follow at first, but you get used to it, and it is a very effective way to tell this type of story. By the end of the book you see your life from a whole new perspective, it is definately worthwhile reading. It does however involve intense thought and concentration to fully appreciate the value of the book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison has a unique style of writing, and this book was all that I hoped it would be. Several times in my reading I had to put the book down and think about what I had just read. It is really complex though, and you get the feeling sometimes that you are reading poetry and not prose. Definately a must read.Do not read this book if you like very simple and to the point language."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I can hardly imagine the brutality and savage ways slaves were forced to live under. The powerful story of a woman named Sethe, her loved ones, and the community definitely raises a few eyebrows with its daring contents and horrific scenes of brutality mixed with absolute love. Unafraid of controversy, Toni Morrison sets no limits on what a person may do in the name of love. Love is dangerous in the house of 124 yet love is their only hope for a \`family\\" in the end.The beginning of the novel was unmistakably disturbing. It is possible; Morrison purposely made the story confusing in order to force the reader to take numerous pieces of a puzzle and assemble it to create something beautiful. When I was in the process of reading Beloved, I could not help but question whether Toni was angry, racist, or cynical. It is astonishing how a writer can take a well-known, well defined, subject and create a turbulent flow of question after question of the graphic treatment slaves encountered and how it influenced each character's behavior and personality disorders. The mind behind such a daring masterpiece seems bold and again brings up questions of whether something may be wrong with her.Beloved is not a novel easily understood. You are forced to use clues in her writing to realize the total effect of the plot. Sethe's attempted murders of her children and actual murder of her daughter, exhibits the severe life of a slave which a mother could not bare, her children endure. Morrison writes scenes pertaining to current issues such as euthanasia and infanticide. I could not help but examine whether Sethe's actions were understandable or psychotic.The novel Beloved can be viewed upon in many different ways and aspects. It is controversial and leaves the reader thinking and creating his or her own idea of what will happen where Morrison leaves off. You question if Sethe, Paul D, and Denver will finally grow into a family and be accepted by the community."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved Book ReviewDetailed flashbacks of the lives of Sethe and the other slaves on Sweet Home (a plantation in Kentucky) gives the reader a glimpse into the inhuman practice of slavery. Some of these detestable accounts include Paul D being forced to perform oral sex on white jail guards, and a pregnant Sethe being raped and nursed by her owner and being beaten so unmercifully that the cuts on her back resembled a Chokecherry Tree.This tree could also represent the family that Sethe longed to keep safe from slavery. Sethe wanted to be the base of this tree, providing her children with the protection they needed and a foundation on which to start a new life of freedom. She tried to keep her own children from slavery by killing them because she believed that what was in the next life was better then a life of slavery.After successfully killing her \\"crawling already\\" daughter, her two sons Howard and Buglar run away. Sethe struggles to keep her own life together while raising the only child she had left, Denver. Denver had only left the house a few times, two of which were with her mother. She was a lonely child who's whole world was in the house on Bluestone road. When the baby that Sethe killed came back in the human form of Beloved, Denver found the companionship that she had longed for all of those years. Denver later becomes the quiet heroin of the story, venturing out into the world to help her mother, and finding herself now able to be a part of the world outside her home.Beloved was a captivating story that made you work hard to piece together the parts of of the story. This story showed the intensity of the human spirit and what one person would do in the name of love."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was my first attempt at a Toni Morrison work and I must say, I wasn't really disappointed. Ms. Morrison rights in such a style that you actually hear the hooves of the approaching horses, see the frantic scrambling of the desperate slave, and picture the blood-soaked bodies of her children.Probably the one thing that I regret about this book is the fact that I listened to it on tape, as opposed to actually reading it in print. This caused a little confusion as I reached 3/4 of the way through the book and I tried to relate to characters and scenes that had been briefly described in earlier chapters who were now front and center.Overall, I really enjoyed the book and I'll certainly seek out Ms. Morrison's other works for enjoyment."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Although I have not yet finished the book, I had to write a review. I am in high school and doing a project on Toni Morrison, and specifically 'Beloved' (although I'll add some things about her other works.) I have only read the reviews on this website, and quite frankly have been helped. I hope you all don't mind if I use a form of what you said. i just hope I don't misinterpret the info. Anyway, this book is astounding. I have never been so drawn into a book yet so appaled by it. I find a struggle within myself before picking it up again to read. The book is confusing to start, but once you get into the flow its easier. I won't say a cinch, but easier.In any case, you can easily understand what Toni Morrison is trying to write about. A woman's life. Plain and simple. She just happens to be a slave woman trying to escape everything that's happened in her life and also accept it. Baby Suggs telling her to 'let go' and the way she acts around Beloved. I have also noticed that you start reading and you really do feel comfortable and have no idea what you are getting yourself into. Then you start to really understand what is happening and you are just so taken aback by it. I've found that I've had to read things over several times before I actually think about what I've just read, or before I can understand it. Sethe's(and the other characters') thoughts are written so bluntly, you almost HAVE to read it again to know that you have just read about the death of her(Sethe's) child. This story is unnerving, yet I also feel that people should read this book to learn about things that you really can't learn from history books. Oh, and if you don't like the content matter, don't read the book.By the way, the only reason the book only gets 4 stars is because I haven't finished it yet."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Ms. Morrison pulled it off! A story of pain and suffering integrated with the supernatural - just as if the supernatural was a \\"natural\\" everyday occurrence. For many, the supernatural is a natural part of life. In many a poor person's life, especially one who has suffered as Sethe has, there is terrible loneliness, a horrible sadness, and a heightened sense of the presence of those we have loved and lost in death. You cannot hold them, you cannot hug them, nor caress them. Our \\"beloveds\\" are just there - beyond our physical reach. I saw TRUE supernatural events as experienced by my mother, father, aunts and uncles, as part of my family history, (and yes, as experienced by my own person) come to life within this book. No one has ever captured this experience as Ms. Morrison has, and many, including myself, will testify that the experience is real. The red light filled with confusion and sadness...walking through it...feeling the sadness and confusion. This is an added twist to love being stronger than the grave. I read this book a few years ago, and it still haunts me. TEN STARS!!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I just finished Beloved and have a very vague idea about what it was all about. I must say I think Toni Morrison is an excellent writer. The detail, and description in her writing is amazing-but she failed to create a clear storyline. A lot of it was almost gibberish to me-especially when Beloved is speaking. With such wonderful, dimensional characters-the novel could have been a masterpiece. Though I love challenging works and like to interpret literature, I found this to be a frustrating puzzle and almost impossible to decipher!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"There was so much hype over this book, especially thanks to Oprah, that I figured it had to be a great read. On the contrary, it ranks as one of the most confusing, incomprehensible books I ever read. I tried to follow it as best as could but I gave up 1/4 of the way through and donated the book. The plot's confusing, the characters aren't introduced, it's almost impossible to tell which character is talking, etc."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I hated this book. I didn't like the style it was written in at all. I understand why she used a ghost in the story but it doesn't work for me. I felt she was too heavy-handed with the symbolism and it made it hard to empathize with any characters. It wasn't that I didn't understand the \\"complexity\\" of the novel, I just found it annoying to read. If I hadn't been reading it for an English paper I would have set it down and not picked it up again. I'm glad I enjoy reading because overrated books like this could turn a person off for a very long time. It wasn't as boring as The Book of Ruth, but if I were going to recommend any of Morrison's books, I'd say stick with The Bluest Eye or Song of Solomon."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What mother, in her right state of mind, would kill her daughter in order to prevent her from having to face the hardships and cruelties of slavery? Are there actually women who would do such a thing? The 20th century novel BELOVED, written by Toni Morrison, tells exactly how one emotionally unstable mother did just that. The only question left to ask is, \\"How could she do it?\\".Sethe's reasons for putting a saw to her daughter's neck introduce one of the main themes of this story-a mother's love. Morrison emphasizes Sethe's reasons for killing her daughter to be an act of love. But how much love is too much? When does a mother's love get too thick? The conversation between Sethe and Paul D about love barely justifies what Sethe did, but it is still difficult to agree with Sethe's thoughtless actions. Sethe's love is what you call \\"corrupted\\" love! Each person is entitled to live his/her own life, and should not be stripped of that right. Love is all a person needs-but to be loved is one thing; to be overloved is another. And too much love is obviously deadly.In answer to the question, \\"How could she do it?\\" one must be satisfied with the simple answer of, \\"She loved her\\". There is no other explanation. Whether it was moral or right is up to you to decide. If Morrison's theme is one you would take pleasure in reading about, dive in and start reading! But, if you are troubled by Sethe's motives and actions, set the book down, and never open its covers."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a book about slavery. Not about what slavery looks like, but what it feels like. That Madame Morrison (her royal highness!) was able to convey the emotional horror and dread and grief of slavery is truly one of the great accomplishments in literature and culture of the 20th century.I am descended from slaves. Never felt any shame about it; indeed, I was proud to have the strongest people in the world as my ancestors. (Come on, they HAD to be.) However, I never considered the dark side of their strength until I read Beloved. What profound sacrifices they made on a spiritual level. This is a profoundly spiritual book, and it hurt to read it. I was nearly mute with sadness and amazement after I read it. I could not even articulate what happened to me.We are not taught about slavery. I realized that this book taught me more about slavery than any history class could have. I became a DIFFERENT PERSON, and underwent a profound, life-changing transformation that resonates to this day. Something that I had known about, read about, heard about became real to me. I think literature is a form of magic. It has an inexplicable and sublime power to change the world. This powerful book made me into someone else, a person who could be proud to be a descendant of slaves, and also feel the deepest sadness about the plight of my ancestors.This country was built on slavery. All of our benefits and graces can be traced to 400 years of free labor. I am amazed at the price my forebears paid to build this country's greatness. I am angry when people want to deny their slave heritage. This country is mine, every stone, every monument, every blade of grass. I have a complete right to it.We still suffer the effects of slavery. Every child in the United States should read this book, especially African American children. All the history lessons in the world won't match the impact of this transcendant masterpiece. Perhaps it can teach them how slavery hurt us.I have a slave name, and I am overwhelmed with pride."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is the story of African Americans in the Cincinnati area just after the Civil War, living with the horrific, all too recent memories of slavery --what it caused people to do in the crucible of tortures and the indignities they endured. This unflinching history is personified by the ghost of a dead child that haunts the former slave Sethe, complicating her life with a surviving daughter, Denver, who was born as she was headed to freedom and with Paul, a friend and fellow survivor from the plantation. The suspense is gripping: how do you continue to live after all that, and in particular, how do you negotiate the freedom in a world co-opted by Jim Crow? As Paul observes, Sethe, the lightening rod of all matter of cruelties that the institution of slavery invited, had too many yesterdays and the new challenge was finding a way to make a tomorrow. This is perhaps the only book you need to read about slavery to understand what it did to people.As much as it drives home fact and ideas, this novel is an artistic success as well. Morrison uses language more like a paint brush, some parts of the canvas are impressionistic images, some of them startlingly clear. In an age when much literary fiction is rendered in arid prose that does not seem to go anywhere, this is a triumph of language and emotion. It IS; it isn't just \\"about.\\" It has a classical structure, with reversals, suspense and a climax. The narrative sweeps right along. The characters are fully drawn. Morrison creates an airtight world. Even after reading the last page, it takes a few days to get over the experience of being in it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I am currently an undergraduate at Princeton University where Toni Morrison is a teacher. She is not a very kind person. In any event, this book is overwritten and generally insults my intelligence. I recommend reading Faulkner instead of this plagiarizing trash. Huzzah!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I've read and have taught this book in several courses. Yes, most college students won't get this. You actually have to work hard to understand Morrison's book. This is a rich book, and I find something new in it every time I read it. I hate to see these reviews from people who easily dismiss this book because they didn't understand it. If you didn't get it, then you really have no place to speak from. You can only critique when you understand. Morrison is clearly the most important and innovative American writer, and this book is a testament to that."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I wih there were more stars to give this incredible and awe-filledbook. This is truly the best book I have ever read. There is nothing like falling under the spell woven by this story.Toni Morrison has taken a simple, tragic and horrific story and turned it into a soul poem. At first, it is hard to follow, but with due diligence, the reader is swept into the tale, which unfolds itself like a flower, petal by petal, shade by shade,scent by scent. The first part of the book puzzles and confuses; then as the initial questions are answered, more disturbing questions and mysteries emerge. As the story takes form and the horrific realities become clearer, the awesome power of Ms. Morrison's writing takes your breath away.I loved the movie also, but nothing compares to waiting for the next soul searing revelation of the words on paper.Unforgettable, it carves this story on your heart as clearly as the tree on Sethe's back."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I am about half way through and put the novel aside; it is interesting but not that compelling a novel. I will finish the read later. The present is a bit slow, especially at the start.The question that one might want consider is the following: if the author was less well known, would the novel have been published or at least in the present form? The prose is not unique in my opinion. It is similar to \\"The Sound and The Fury\\" by Faulkner and has colloquial complexities as found in Joyce's Ulysses - but obviously not to the same degree. But, there is even more colloquial language than Faulkner's book - and that is hard to imagine for most. I had to read the first 10 pages three times to get into the swing of her style and to try to get through the jumbled, convoluted, and incomplete sentences. She tries to recreate the speach of the characters. Some sentences are just fragments that are hard to interpret, and could have mutiple intepretations.Once you get to about page 30 or so the novel picks up and the reader adjusts to the prose. I imagine that more than a few stop at page 10.The story is well thought out, innovative, depressing, probably accurate, and strikes deep resonances with most readers. Clearly the author is brilliant. But, the barrier to an enjoyable reading experience is the convoluted prose. It is as if the author has tried to transform herself - and then take the reader along as well - through some sort of state of consciousness back in time. The idea is to make the reader feel and thinks like a former slave back around 1875. It works most of the time, but it is sometimes a painful read.It is written in the third person narrative, so the author did have room to take a slightly different approach. But, she has decided to write most descriptions in the colloquial form - trying not to break the spell created by the dialogue.Interesting read, but it is a literary obstacle course in parts. Still, it is a recommended buy.4.5 Stars"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Probably the most overrated book in contemporary fiction (though that title might be shared by Midnight's Children). A respectable start than descends into unintelligibility and stays there. I respect Ms. Morrison for what she is attempting to do. The fact that she has failed to do it has not deterred an overabundance of praise on her work. If you must read her, try The Bluest Eye instead. Somewhat better, and shorter."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book is the Emperor's New Clothes of literature. Critics fall all over themselves to praise it for fear of not seeming sufficiently erudite. I think Morrison is secretly laughing at all of them."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"First off I did not like the style it was writen in. It jumped from one thing to another at times and it took a while to realize what she was talking about now. I went into this book believing that it would be a story completely about slavery and what they went through. It ended up being a fantasy type book with slavery thrown into it. The symbolism of the baby ghost did not help me with the whole story. I would have liked it to be more about the slavery aspect than the fantasy with the ghost thrown into the mix. I only read this for my AP English class and I had to force myself through it or else I would not have been able to finish it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is one of the most famous novels by Toni Morrison, America's only female to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Set in the America before the Civil War, the story moves from the slave South to the non-slave North. Free the North is not, as this book depicts, for slaves could be captured and returned down South. The book is conglomeration of multiple themes and storylines. First and foremost is the story of Sethe, a black woman who used to be a slave. Second, the book focuses on her baby who died at birth, who goes by the name Beloved, and the reappearance of the baby as a ghost.Third, the book examines slavery, racism, and the politics of inclusion and seclusion. In the South, Sethe is excluded from civil society in many ways by her color and the institution of slavery, but being a slave, is an integral part of society in general. In the North, she is not a slave per say, but instead she is excluded from society in general by the ways of white people and their benign racism. The storylines of this book also explore the physical punishments and practices used to enforce slavery at the personal level. Here is where this book stands out from others like it like Uncle Tom's Cabin or Huck Finn. This book could be described as doing for black literature on slavery as what Passion of the Christ did for movies based on the Bible. it is quite graphic with big servings of the natural thrown in. But I would not use this book as a study of slavery and the racism built into it. The text is very confusing and I, the reader, spent much time trying to understand the entity of Beloved, and its use in furthering the story. In fact, I would call this book a tragedy not about slavery and racism, but a tragedy set against the backdrop of slavery and racism. Overall, a difficult book to read and though not boring, is not on my list of great American works."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"how did this book (if you can call it that) get an award? the only award this crap deserves is &quot;bob's award for horridly long and annoying literature.&quot; this is the biggest pile of hot, steaming trash literature that i've ever read. it's a soap opera set in post-slavery times. it starts normal enough... but then the baby that sethe killed comes back to life as a 1.5-year-old stuck in a 20 year old body. then to give the story another bullcrap turn, she starts screwing sethe's lover, paul d. and somehow she thinks that that's gonna get her closer to sethe. you tell me where this logic plays in. what a lousy story. fans of soap operas will love it; i, for one, thought it was a crappy book with a crappy plot with a few bad acid trips mixed in."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book as an assignment for school, which made it immediately not too appealing. However, I began to really submerge myself in its depth when I began realizing the allusions Morrison makes throughout to Lynyrd Skynyrd. I'm not a gigantic Morrison fan or a gigantic Skynyrd fan, but seeing such extremes meshed together awed me with the realization that Toni Morrison is a literary genius. Sweet home is the most obvious and first allusion I caught--sweet home Alabama. The intricate name meanings stem from &quot;What's your name?&quot; &quot;Swamp Music&quot;--the trek through the swamp; &quot;Travelin' Man&quot;--Paul D.; &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot;--Sethe's psychotic rampage. Of course, &quot;Freebird,&quot; Skynyrd's most famous song, depicts Beloved, the main and titular character, who is a ghost--definitely free as a bird. With this, Morrison meshes two opposing cultures, whose undertones struggling throughout the book and then settle in the end when they realize the importance of community (and cream cheese). This book is great, not because it is very effectual--many books do that--but because it leaves you rockin'."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a very certain kind of novel that only certain kinds of people will like. That is to say, if you like \\"literature\\" you will quite like it. Really, you are only going to like the book if you are able to tolerate pure characterization. There isn't much plot, or perhaps more precisely, the book is structured in a way that removes all the elements of mystery and anticipation that would ordinarily entice one to keep reading. What remains are flashbacks of things you already knew about or figured out and lots of brooding. It is almost like reading the commentary to a series of events. As such the characters have to be really engaging to compensate and the characters in the novel just wont be that enticing to everyone. The 4 most important characters are Sethe, Beloved, Denver and Paul D; while their characters all suffer specific neuroses and are complex in their own ways, they all read the same for the character types don't vary too much between them.The prose is okay. It has a very specific \\"flavor\\" that some people seem to absolutely love and other people like me will find grating. It is the sort of prose that quite often likes to string words together in poetic sounding ways that do not make much literal sense; as if an esoteric enough combination of words will yield a product of transcendent nature. This is very purposeful; I imagine the intent is to mirror how the characters feel or what the overall feeling of the novel should be as intended by the author. I just don't particularly like it. Other people do, so it is a matter of taste.As a matter of quality I suspect the novel is very good. But I struggled to read it; there was always something much more enticing I could have been doing so ultimately the novel became a chore."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This beautiful, lyrical, unflinching book will tear your lungs out and leave you breathless and weeping in your seat.

Though this book gives you a clear depiction of what being a slave looks like and what truly happens, it doesn't make it any less depressing and just down right gross. This book will cause your stomach to feel pain and your heart to ache. The agony of this poor women's life is horrible and I would only suggest reading this book if you truly want your heart and mind to hurt and if you want to be brought to tears."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I'm sorry but, Toni Morrison, this novel is about the occult. Bizarre. Basically, the author combined slavery with halloween. Very sad. Toni, if you had to do it this way, why couldn't the slaves along with the dead baby ghost all get together and free themselves from slavery before President Lincoln did so? Heck, even the X-Files tv show is better in this regard."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"At his best William Faulkner created towering monuments of despair, described in language poetic yet emotionally accurate. There were demons but they were more powerful than flesh and blood - they were internal. Never did a Faulkner plot depend on a real-world manifestation of a creature from beyond, it was not needed.Toni Morrison's prose and structure are strongly influenced by ABSALOM, ABSALOM!, LIGHT IN AUGUST and AS I LAY DYING, but where Faulkner never forgot that beneath the seemingly supernatural was always the real world Morrison's story disappears entirely when attempts are made to force it to walk rather than float. As long as one never asks who Beloved actually is one can appreciate the anguish of a mother who killed her child, but unfortunately a reader of a realistic novel can not fail to ask. And in asking what one is left with is the anguish but not the realism.And there are far too many loose threads. What is the significance of Halle and butter? What happened to Halle? Out of the entire country how did Paul D find Sethe in Cincinnati? If Denver is damaged, as she would have every right to be, how does she so suddenly become so competent? These are not quibbles, these are flaws an author should correct but Morrison never did. I agree with another comment that Morrison may have crafted a striking poem but her novel was not ready for public consumption by a critical readership (is it really necessary that so many descriptions of a woman's turmoil require reference to breasts? are women that obsessed with that part of their anatomy? poetic perhaps, but methinks Morrison doth poet-est too much).What Morrison got right is the unredeamable barbarity of slavery and the pain and scarring it left on its direct victims and in fact the society as a whole. These are stories Faulkner touched on but never with the necessary closeness. Morrison should be read for that sensibility alone.Overall, however, I can't shake the feeling that the accolades are based more on who Morrison is and what she attempts than by what she accomplished. Which is a good but deeply flawed work."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved by Toni Morrison was a very interesting book. In this book the protagonist named Sethe tells here story about when she was going through slavery. She explains her internal scars, and she explains all of the rough times that she went through. After escaping from slavery, she spends the majority of her time in the house with her daughter named Denver. Denver never gets the chance to have a normal childhood. Later in the book Sethe tells how she, her daughter, and her home has been haunted by a ghost which the novel makes you believe is her daughter. She struggles with that for the rest of her life. This is a very good book. I liked it because it had a lot of detail, and it kept my attention. This book often made me look at my own life and realize that I have taken a lot of things for granted. I believe others should take the time to read this book if they got the chance."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was the first and only book I have attempted to read by Toni Morrison and I really could not get used to her style of writing. Since I could not get past the style, I could not enjoy the book and get past the first couple of chapters. This book may have an &quot;amazing&quot; story line (if you can get that far); however the choppy dialect was hard to follow and read. Morrison tried to hard to immulate the dialect of that period, but it was more of a hinderance. I did not find this book reaching out and grabbing my attention. Good try though..."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was really disappointed after I was through with Toni Morrison's nationally acclaimed book, Beloved. I was constantly struggling to understand why Morrison would chose such a theme. A child is killed by her strong willed, proud mother because this mother realized how horrible her people were being treated by white Americans ( she is African American, post Civil War), and she doesn't want another child of hers to endure such hardships. This ghost &quot;comes to life&quot; after haunting the house for many years and drives the mother to an unreachable point of insanity caused by her self-reflection and guilt. The hardships the main character goes through helps to build her character, but other points of the novel didn't make sense. I was really discomforted by the fact that the &quot; ghost&quot; was able to do that much harm and receive so much love. Also,the whole novel was very abstract in that it contained different point of views, and posssibly parallel&quot;worlds&quot;.I was not expecting an easy read, but what I got wasn't per say dificult; it just didn't have any focus .

This Book is one of these items which no doubt raises many questions.The literary talent of the Author is unquestioned, yet the way she choose to construct this story and mix ceartain literary elements was ceartanly no success.What resulted was a confusing lengthy story with no plot, storyline, character development and an ending which can truly be called &quot;One of THE worst&quot;.The characters Flashbacks are neither interesting nor literary, but confusing and jumbled, forcing the reader to continue out of sheer willpower.

It is like being down at the creek, listening to the gossip of the washerwomen. There is no linear progression. Rambling and feral. It was frankly just hard to wrap my brain around this plot and, more importantly, the method of its unveiling. Now, before you throw me into the Morrison-hater category, I also read Paradise, and, though some of the same difficulties were present, (many pages were read four or five times trying to figure out what the hell was going on), I enjoyed it and found its theme more liberating. Beloved was simply a downer, wallowing in a depressing past. Paradise better balanced the search for roots with the need for wings."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Where do I begin??

I'd rather eat dirt & watch the grass grow. It's extremely boring, and everything is just strange and wrong. Don't watch the movie either unless you like violence, insanity, incest, rape, cuss words every few sentences, bodily fluids flying every which way, and just all around crappiness. However, all of those things happen in the book anyways; you just picture them in your mind (which, unfortunately, scars you for life) instead of seeing them on a screen.While I was reading this, I kept thinking (more like hoping) that the book had to be ending soon, but then I would realize that I was only on page 30.

For example, the pride that the neighbors abhorred of baby suggs celebration at the house was well demonstrated by the modern style of writing, in that, alot of times things go unsaid, but we feel 'em, and since no one has come to baby suggs and said \\"that party was disgraceful, because we took too much pride in our freedom and celebration not giving proper glory to God,\\" baby suggs then must feel the emotion generated from the neighbors and put it into words and ideas so that she can try to make meaning out of the feeling that permeates her and her house.This book did a wonderful job demonstrating that sometimes the nail sticking out will painfully be hammered down. It seems that this book is suggesting that the black culture throughout slavery and reconstruction started to develop a waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-fall mentality which was supported by christianity. Even though the african americans in ohio were free from slavery and had enough means to celebrate, the neighbors were deeply offended by baby suggs celebration at the house, because, it seems, that their interpretation of christianity admonished them from not giving proper glory to God or they would suffer and so when sethe killed one of her children this seemed to be punishment for the celebration. Once again, i really think the modern writing style fits well here allowing morrison to posit her own ideas regarding complex sociological trends that, often times, are not explicitly stated.When we enter situations where things aren't explicitly stated, we almost have to aquire a sixth sense by heightening our awareness of things around us and picking up on things that can't be quickly explained by set formulas. Once the reader has opened their mind and realized this, the mysticism of morrison's writing takes hold and lets us take to heart that we really have a small understanding of what life is all about.

There were many parts of it that described acts that are extremely triggering for me, and honestly I felt it was better to just not force myself through those parts for the sake of \`a grade'.

I wanted to reread this book because my son is reading it for his senior HS literature class. So we bought one hard copy for $10 and now the digital is $11.99? I just can't do it ..."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"&quot;A brutally powerful, mesmerizing story...read it and tremble,&quot; says People magazine about Toni Morrison's Beloved. Why, I ask? Powerful and mesmerizing? The only thing I trembled about was the thought of reading the story. Beloved is not the first book about colored people that I have read. Those I have read before, I enjoyed. However, because Toni Morrison's style is so unique, it's also hard to comprehend its uniqueness. Others have read Beloved and have been mesmerized by it. I'm not one of them.The story is full of holes and parallels that take a critical reader to fill as one reads it. This makes Beloved hard to read because there is a lot of back flipping of pages when information may be hiding. As I read Beloved, I began to get lost. I formed questions in my mind about characters such as Halle. The story never mentions what happens to Halle other than him going on with an original plan to escape from Sweet Home. What became of Halle? Also, a part of the story mentions Baby Suggs as a cobbler. She is spoken of as &quot;Baby Suggs holy.&quot; A cobbler is the mender of shoes and soles. Someone told me that in the first act of Julius Caesar, someone calls him the mender of souls and asked if I thought that Morrison had read Julius Caesar and was comparing Baby Suggs to Julius Caesar. Who would have known this fact unless you happened to be reading Beloved and Julius Caesar at the same time? Reading between the lines is something that not everyone does as one reads. I sometimes read between the lines, but this story just left me hanging.Because the story is about colored people, it seems as if the author still holds contempt for what white people had done to African-Americans in slavery. One example of this is Sethe's wedding dress. It was mad of a scarf, a sash, pillowcases, and other stolen items could find. The wedding dress does not have a back at some point and this may symbolize how Morrison could not let go of the past because of the emotional pain she may feel about the slavery issue. Baby Suggs says in the story, &quot;There is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks.&quot; This statement makes the author' feelings of white people even more clear to readers. The slavery issue is not longer an issue because slaves were freed from the outcome of the Civil War. There are still hard feelings about the slavery issue, but it's over and one just has to make the choice of overcoming it and getting on with oneself.Morrison also changes the point of view in Beloved. Most of it is done in third person. However, in part two of the story, Morrison begins a chapter with, &quot;Beloved, she my daughter.&quot; The narrator of the story is changed all of a sudden. Although this narrator not hard to figure out, another chapter begins with, &quot;I am my Beloved and she is mine.&quot; Who is the narrator of this chapter? It is not clearly mentioned and kept me wondering who was speaking. After re-reading the chapter, the narrator still was not clear.As you can see, mysteries are not pleasing to me. Beloved just has too much little details that one must look for in order to understand the story. There are too many changes over the duration of the story and hidden points and parallels that are hard to find. The writing style of Morrison is also too complicated to comprehend. How can you find out what went on in the author's mind while she wrote the story? It's hard to answer that question for all stories that have been written. I do not understand the story of Beloved, and I do not plan on reading other stories written by Morrison. If all of her stories are like this...well, keep them away from me."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"BELOVED BY TONI MORRISON: BOOK REVIEWToni Morrison sets the story in post-Civil War Ohio of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked her life in order to save herself from a living death. This living death is described as her lost husband and a buried child. She now lives with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, apparition \\"Beloved\\". Morrison focuses the theme on relationships between a master and slave, and marriage. Different views are introduced between Mr. Garner and School teacher's belief of slavery. Mr. Garner treated slaves as human beings as School teacher sees slaves as inferior. Sethe says the teacher would wrap string all over her head, cross her nose around her behind, and number the teeth she had. The image that the author reflects is the different white masters of that time. Morrison wanted to explain how people behave when they are given absolute power over other people. Both Mr. Garner and School teacher begin believing in superiority and later justifying their decisions by it. Mr. Garner gives an example when he doesn't use violence to get his slaves to work but listens to them, allows them to use guns, and calls them men. On the other hand, School teacher demonstrates his power immediately and separate himself as superiority as he tells his nephew to list Sethe's human qualities on one side of a paper and her animal qualities on the other side. Acknowledgement by masters of marriages between their slaves was not to be. This is evident when church or community didn't recognize Sethe's marriage to Halle because there was no ceremony, nothing to mark their union. Morrison also shows the reader that slaves were of minor importance to their masters as Sethe is sent to prison for damage to Mr. Garner's property when she killed Beloved. Throughout the work, Morrison creates an idea that human beings are merchandise, where everything has its own price. The statement that Morrison points out by linking these relationships is that slaves were the ones caught in the middle of the war even though the whole point of the Civil War was to free the slaves. Like Stamp Paid says, there were still black refugees who didn't know the war was over and it didn't seem any different. Morrison's work reflects history from the black viewpoint as she showed psychological and long-term damage slavery made on black people. Physical damage was expressed through the \\"chokeberry tree\\" that was on Sethe's back from whippings. I believe Morrison makes good use of flash backs where she links the past to the present but she could've been more clear in defining characters because the reader sometimes gets confused as to which character is doing what."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well, I don't know what defines 'masterpiece,' but I didn't find anything particularly ingenius about this book. Nothing against the author, but, why does this child come back for Love? How lame... Wouldn't the average murdered child ghost come back for bloody revenge? I'll stick to my Tolkien and Crichton."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well, it's almost midnight and I have a ten page paper due on this book tommorrow which I have yet to start. Unfortunatley, though, I haven't even finished the damn book yet, and I doubt that I will!While Morrison's language is undeniabley beautiful (who else would use the term &quot;baby's venom&quot; to such great effect?), she tends to weight her stories down to almost ubearable levels with the sheer amount of impotance that she places on EVERY SINGLE WORD.I have heard Morrison criticized for constructing her stories a bit too well, and after reading about half of Beloved and all of Paradise, I have to concur. By carefully placing meaning on every word of every sentence of every paragraph, she slows the story's pace down to a slug crawl. Not only did reading the first 175 pages of the book book take me an inorexible amount of time (and I'm a very fast reader), but when I finally did put Beloved down in mid story,I found that I really didn't care at all! In fact, I actually felt better, as if a sort of weight were lifted from my brain. I know the subject matter is heavy by nature, what with the slavery and all, but it would have been nice had Morrison added a bit of humor here and there to lighten things up. Does Morrison simply take herself too seriously? Who knows. . .Anyway, even though I ranked the book a on the low side, I still highly reccommend it for the sheer force of its language and Morrison's treatment of the subject matter. (I swear I'm going to sit down and read the rest of it one of these days!)"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"i had to read this book for a required course in english composition during my first yr in college, and looking back now it seems that BELOVED was the worst possible choice for such a course. ms. morrison is a writer of considerable rhetorical resources, but she has not grown out of her infantile narcissism--to which, perhaps, all talented writers are susceptable--to care about her readers, or to question her own half-baked ideas. throughout her book, as soon as the characters begin to speak their own voices morrison herself intrudes and pours her own beliefs on us, as to prevent us from forgetting what she is for and against. This repression of the critical faculty damages her examination of the issues involved. it is a failure of imagination, a failure to understand, in postmodern terms, &quot;the other&quot;. not surprisingly, for example, in dealing with racial issues, morrison is simply unable to see white men as concrete human beings; indeed, all white people in her novel remain a pure abstraction, a symbol for evil perhaps. if this is what morrison tries to do, as some of her facile commentators have suggested, it is an exceptionally stupid thing to do. i have been told, by people who read and know more fiction than i do, that some of morrison's earlier works are really fine. i can believe them, as she is evidently a talent. but her development worries me. it would be wrong to accuse her of being overly ambitious, to say her later works are failures in achieving greatness. good artists are required to be ambitious, to explore what they have not explored before. only morrison seems to be in the wrong direction."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is an American slavery novel based on the struggles faced by an ex-slave and her acquaintances and relatives. With the opening of the novel, diction and tone are used strongly to accurately portray the feelings and opinions of the people from this time-period. \\" Them the feet you runnin' on? My Jesus my.\\" (Morrison 32), is an excellent example of Morison's use of diction in order to portray Southern African American people and the way they behaved and conversed with each other. In this instance the main character of the novel is in the process of escaping the previous enslavement of a plantation, all the while getting closer and closer to giving birth to her daughter. This instance also relates to the theme in that it shows an experience that would rob the heart and round the personhood. In the end, this experience ends up robbing the main character, Sethe, of her passion, motivation and drive, all of which are characteristics figuratively found in a person's heart. The diction of the novel helps to expose the true sentiments and struggles of ex-slaves.After reading Beloved I have concluded that it isn't all its cracked up to be. The book received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, which I honestly don't really agree with. The characters in the book weren't well developed, although their emotions and reactions were seemingly exaggerated most of the time. I was unable to become engaged in the novel and found it hard to read. It is possible that I am too young, and I don't fully understand the influence this novel has had on others. I have talked to a friend who read another Toni Morrison novel, and she had the same complaints as I. She mentioned the over exaggerated characters and the lack of interest she had. Throughout the novel, Beloved, Toni Morrison blends diction and a linear repetitive pattern in order to reinforce the reoccurring theme of the pros and cons of a previous life of discrimination, confinement, and mistreatment. These literary terms also help to portray the idea that a previous life of imprisonment can harbor the soul, rob the heart, yet round the personhood."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"BELOVED is poor in its totality. I was forced to read it for an English class. It begins with a poorly developed premise and ends with lose ends still untied. The Immortal Beloved is completely implausible in its historical setting. Morrison made no attempt to create an appropriate premise/setting. BELOVED must have won the Pullizter for political reasons. This book has no depth or content. After finishing it, virtually everyone in my class felt cheated."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Pulitzer Prize for Fiction-you've got to be kidding me! This honor was ill-deserved. Indeed, Morrison faced a difficult task before she sat down and began Beloved, since she was not the first to write about the hardships of colored people. She had to incorporate something into her novel to set her apart from all the other authors. A unique style would surely make it an original work...but only if it was executed properly. Morrison fell short of a masterpiece because her novel was too confusing and frustrating. By trying to be different, she failed to accurately convey her ideas to her audience. I found I was always lost in the plot. In fact, by the time I got to the fourth page, I was already fed up with Morrison and her style. Due to Morrison's many narrators and time frames, I had a lot of unclear pictures forming in my mind as I read. Unfortunately, these events weren't clarified until pages, chapters, or sections later in the story. When I found out Denver was named after the white girl who helped Sethe, I was anxious to know the story. Although Morrison told the story, she referred to the white girl as Amy, and I wondered where Sethe had gotten Denver from. Finally, in the last paragraph of the chapter, she tells us Denver is Amy's last name. Not all of my questions were answered. Some remain unclear even though I've already finished the book. For example, what happened to Halle? Morrison doesn't say what became of him. Did he die? Why did Sixo laugh when he was being burned? Morrison mentioned that Paul D guessed what Sixo was laughing at, but she never disclosed that information. Why did Baby Suggs call herself a liar? What is the &quot;hot thing&quot;? All of these questions drift in my mind, unanswered. While I was reading, I often felt like I was playing Memory with Morrison...and I always lost. In Memory, when I stumble upon a matching card, I have already forgotten where the first card was. Likewise, in Beloved I couldn't remember what subtle hint Morrison had left 70 pages beforehand, so I often didn't make the significant connections. I had to wait too long to find out what was happening, and in some cases, I'm still waiting! I disliked the book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone as impatient as I am. Beloved is too befuddling and unsatisfying; Morrison left me guessing way too many times for my liking. Don't get me wrong, critical readers are supposed to piece together events and draw conclusions by reading between the lines. However, I'm not asking to be smacked in the head with everything. I just expect some explanation in order to keep up and enjoy the book. Morrison had an excellent story line, but she left too much work for her readers.

There haven't been many books that I've actually enjoyed, and this is definitely a book that I really did not enjoy. I would credit the sucess of this book to Oprah.... The only reason why I gave this book 1 star was that it was so pathetic I actually felt sorry for it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was expecting pure magic to flow from every page given all that I'd heard about this book but was really disappointed. It was too metaphorical and without any real punch to it. Also way too heavy and depressing for an end of day read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book as part of a challenge to read all the books on the NYT list of best books of the last 25 years. At the end of it I felt that all the other winners had been robbed of the #1 spot that went to Beloved - & that the #1 spot went to Beloved out of political correctness.Beloved is a fine book but is relatively poorly constructed & confusing - the reader's inability to sort it all out is attributed by the prize awarding committees to the reader's shortcomings rather than the author's inability to make her plot & characters clear. But anyone who has read the book - particularly against the other nominees!!! - & really searched for meaning understands that at a basic level Beloved can not live up to its reviews.It is a sorry day when books like Philip Roth's American Pastoral etc are superceded by Beloved."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"When I first heard that we would have to read Beloved for our AP English class, I had no clue as to what to expect. I had never read any of Toni Morrison's works, and I was totally unprepared for her unorthodox writing style. Overall, I found the book to be very vague and wide open to interpretation. The plot itself is very powerful and emotional, but I personally feel that the style of delivery Morrison chose lessened its impact. There are two sections of fragmented memories and poetry(?) in particular that I must admit left me more confused than moved. I also feel that the ghost/incarnation of Beloved is totally unnecessary. The addition of supernatural events and beings detracts from the whole of the story, making it less credible, causing readers to take it less seriously. It took me a while to familiarize myself with Morrison's style, but after a few chapters, it wasn't too hard to piece together the literal meanings. The overall theme of Beloved, however, still escapes me. I can see many possibilities, but I feel that there is no clear indication of Morrison's intentions to make a statement about any one thing in particular. Don't get me wrong, the book is written quite skillfully. It's just that I personally don't care for Morrison's style, or some of the choices she made in writing Beloved."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a book intended for the adept reader who makes it his duty to picture every image, catch every symbol, and are willing to take the time to put together pieces of a story in able to comprehend it's meaning. I am not one of those readers. The first time I picked up this book, the only thought in my mind was, \\"Whaa?\\" Reading the first few pages already made me confused and very bored. All I saw was a woman talking about her past and how horrible it was. This woman, Sethe, killed her own child so that the child would not live the life that her mother did, and now that child is haunting her. Halfway through the book I was even more lost, and more bored. A good reader would look back in the book at every page finding an explanation for what was happening, but not I. In the end, things are cleared up, somewhat, but things still leave me hanging. It took some discussion amongst my teacher and peers to actually understand the book. I do applaud Morrison's unique style and her decision to write a book that would cut into your mind and frustrate your senses, but it took too long to answer any questions that were on my mind. I understand that to the professional readers, this is a book of treasures and worth while, but to the average reader like me, I could do without."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is an eminently teachable book, probably the singlemost read text by students at my school over the past ten years. The supernatural elements, ghost story trappings (compare the basic plot to &quot;Poultergeist&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot;) and sensational (but tastefully presented) sex and violence make for instant accessibility for most students. As for the Faulknerian stream of consciousness and shifting points of view, students seem to have little difficulty once they are shown how to read it. But at other levels, the work fails to measure up to the greatest literature. The characters are types--good or bad, oppressed or oppressors; the themes are often obvious and paper thin (eg. Baby Suggs' revision of the Sermon on the Mount into a black pride message); the male characters, including Paul D., are objects of female fantasy; the imagery (water, corn, trees, characters' names) is contrived and repetitious. Two things of value emerge from the reading experience: the coming of age story of Sethe's daughter, Denver, and the use of Beloved as a metaphor for the holocaust that was the pre-emancipation African-American experience. But there is more complexity, depth, and fidelity to that experience and its transformation from suffering into art in James Baldwin's short story, &quot;Sonny's Blues.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The beginning of this book and the horrors of slavery all the way through are heartrending. Being a WASPy guy raised in the American South this book was a disturbing eyeopener. It was also an exceptionally strong story of relationships and overcoming adversity. It was difficult reading but worth the effort."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book when my son was the same age as Sethe's daughter when she died (&quot;crawling already&quot;).To me, Sethe's action made terrible sense.I could understand how she would rather have her daughter die than face her growing up in slavery(&quot;where people were moved around like chequerboards&quot;). Growing up in Europe I had never given much thought to slavery in America. I had not realised that it was a crime as horrific as the Holocaust, less bent on extinction for the sake of extinction but with more people involved over a much longer period and with individual consequences just as tragic.I am grateful to Toni Morrison for writing this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"every now and again, i am fortunate enough to find a book that can touch me on an emotional level while captivating me intellectually. Beloved is by far the best book i have ever been privelaged to read as it fulfills both of the above requirments. Morrison's use of unusual diction is the perfect tool to tell a truely unique and heartbreaking story. In the most fascinating chapter of the novel, the title character begins narrating in a stream of conscience that leaves the reader in complete awe of Morrison's raw power. Every generation has an author that will go into history and will be forever taught in English classes across the nation; i am certain that Morrison is our generation's Hurston or Steinbeck. Her ability as a writer and storyteller is unquestionably proven in this beautifuly disturbing work."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"It has been over a decade since the end of the Civil War, and even longer since the brutal slaying of an innocent child. Everyone has forgotten about the young babe, but the slayer's barbaric image still lingers fresh on the minds of observers and only grows fresher when the infant's ghost returns to haunt her mother's home. Sethe and her only remaining child, Denver, have grown accustomed to the always-present sense of evil that floats bitterly through their home. All of that changes though, when Paul D, an old friend, arrives unexpectedly at Sethe's door and scares the infant away with his rage over the constant injustices in life. For a single mother and former slave, who has lost all of her children but one, and who is constantly plagued by the haunting memory of her past, this liberation proves to be the gift of life. That is until, Beloved, a mysterious girl with no one else in the world, and who seems to know everything about Sethe, appears suddenly and re-imprisons Sethe's joy.Through the feeling created on Sethe and Denver's livelihood, by the infant's ghost, and by Beloved, Morrison leaves the reader with a sense of an aggressive authority fixedly breaking the life of a less omnipotent figure. During Sethe's fugitive days when her former master hunted her like a hungry savage, Sethe attempted to save her four children by unmercifully killing them. Although a lasting memory, all her efforts were unsuccessful except one, her eldest daughter, who was only a little over one year old at the time, perished during Sethe's brutal rage. While the child was alive, Sethe constantly feared the presence and power of white authority, but the moment that the child's last breath rolled from her lips, that authority faded away like a forgotten dream. As Sethe and her surviving family painstakingly moved on with their lives, an evil, lonely and unwanted presence moved in to their home, and although, with the death of her baby, the physical authority, had disappeared, the threat lingered on in their minds, when the ghost arrived. Their joy was never quite satisfied; it was as if it was always shaded over by a somber shadow, the sun never shone on their souls. That is until, one bright day, Paul D, an old acquaintance, suddenly appeared, like an angel, on Sethe's porch and, distraught by the constant and never ending challenges blacks have been plagued with, wrathfully breaks out, and chases out the infant's ghost. As soon as the presence has left, it is like a giant weight was lifted off of Denver and Sethe's shoulder, their joy finally radiates from all of the dark shaded years it was quieted. For the first time since Sethe was had her child, and for the first time in Denver's life, they are bursting with joy. The removal of the ghost removed any of their lingering fears of white authority, or any other powerful master figure. Unfortunately, the baby returns, not as a ghost this time, but as a mysterious young woman who is lost in the world, but whom both Sethe and Denver feel attracted to by something deep inside them which they cannot control. This mysterious girl, Beloved, they can not see it themselves, but removes the light and happiness which has shone in them for this short time, her presence entraps them, and at the same time separates them from one another. So, just as the feeling of authoritative threat vanished with the infant, it returned. Beloved and the baby are like government officials, when they have spent a considerable length of time monitoring one place, and they feel that they have scare the people enough that they no longer feel that their presence is needed to enforce the law, they move on. For a while, that threat lingers, and the fear stands in people's minds, until, one day, a person who is has not yet made the acquaintance of these officials, arrives and gives rebirth to the people's joy. It is then evident that they are not longer weaker than their government, and that they too can have fun, but it is when the officials return, that it is the hardest. The harder people resist the authority, the harder they will fall when they break anew. That is what happened to Paul D. Beloved was blunt towards him, and when she over powered him, she broke him for good. So, Morrison leaves the reader with a sense of over empowerment by an invisible force through the characters of Beloved and the infant's ghost.Beloved, was my first Toni Morrison novel, and I loved it. I strongly recommend this labyrinth of thoughts and emotions to all readers. This is especially appealing to those who have an affection for the abstract thoughts and the potent imagination of great minds in our world."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Uniquely written as only Toni Morrison could do, Beloved is a impressive novel. Toni Morrison has created a masterpiece, this book explores and exposes the reality of a slavewomen's love for her children. The characters in this book really come alive as you read from page to page, chapter to chapter. I did not just read this book, I experienced this book. Marcus Beard-Cal Poly Pomona"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, an intriguing novel by Toni Morrison is not your ordinary \\"slave story.\\" Morrison portrays the story of ex-slave Sethe and her struggle to come to terms with her past in a unique style. Readers are drawn into Sethe's life as she tries to overcome the guilt of killing one of her babies as well as deal with her past so she can have a sense of healing thus allowing her to move on to her future. Although, Morrison's inconsistency of time periods and character point of view may be a bit confusing, her complex characters and stunning use of symbolism within her plot somehow acts as a magnetic force drawing the reader into the story. Morrison sets the story with Sethe beginning to move on with her life by ignoring her past. Beloved, the daughter she killed, then unexpectedly arrives in the flesh forcing Sethe to reveal things she wanted to forget. Beloved untangles Sethe's web of secret feelings and experiences. Thus not only allowing Sethe to heal but also giving Denver the opportunity to hear stories she was always denied of knowing about and allowing her to grow with the knowledge of the pain her mother went through. Morrison creates this theory by writing, \\"Denver spoke, Beloved listened, and the two did the best they could to create what really happened, how it really was, something only Sethe knew...\\" As the reader becomes more aware of Sethe's secrets, Morrison uses flashbacks to make bigger impressions. Impressions to give readers an idea of how unbelievably unfair slaves were treated. Such experiences as Sethe's milk being stolen could not be left with a simple one-sentence description. Morrison cleverly uses a conversation between Sethe and Paul D. to show the reader just how cruel white men were to slaves. \\"They beat you and you was pregnant? And they took my milk!\\" Morrison intertwines into her plot an incredible use of symbolism. It seems as though almost event could symbolize something if you really think with an open mind. A simple thing like Sethe's home made wedding dress mean more than it seems. One may think it is just pieces of scrap material pieced together, but in actuality it represents Sethe's life. Each piece of material is a part of Sethe's life and the back of the dress being hard to find is Sethe's past as it is also hard to deal with and causes great struggle in her life. Morrison's symbolism allows critical readers to take one step further to totally understand where Sethe is coming from. One factor that causes readers to be discouraged to continue the book is that as Morrison flashbacks to different time periods the reader has the tendency to become confused. Along with the time periods the character point of view also sporadically changes. Readers are forced to pay close attention to detail to figure out where they are in the story. This is a factor that causes readers to be discouraged to continue the book. Whether the response by a reader is good or bad, the reader is curious as to what the conclusion to the story will be or at least intrigued as to why Morrison would use certain events or dialogue. Morrison delivers this engrossing story in such a way that it leaves a lasting impression on readers."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After hearing so much about this book, I decided to broaden my reading horizons and give it a try. Truth be told, it really is not that confusing or difficult to understand. The writing is beautiful and the book is full of both wonderful and disturbing images. I learned more than I wish I needed to know about slavery and I felt the depth of Sethe's love for her children. This was not a quick, fun read but it was worthwhile and I'm glad I persisted. However, I don't think there's any need to make readers feel bad if they happened not to like or understand this book. Toni Morrison's writing is not for everyone. It's a huge world with millions of books and, praise God, there's a book out there for everyone. If Beloved isn't it, it's really not a big deal. I've enjoyed reading the previous thought-provoking reviews but I think it's important to keep things in perspective."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This novel is dedicated to the millions of African slaves who died because of slavery or during the Atlantic crossing. The dedication alone caused controversy because it jars with the accepted historial versions of slavery. However, American history books are known to contain much inaccurate information, and are also known to omit extremely important information that they should contain--largely for political reasons.In Beloved, Morrison explores the emotional and psychic cost of slavery on former slaves and particularly on the first generation of free-born African Americans. It is a ghost story. The ghost of a slain child returns to haunt her murderer, her own mother, and her sister. In one passage, the \\"re-fleshed\\" ghost describes how she pulled herself together from the flesh in the swamp--the bits of flesh of other African Americans who have been murdered and tossed in the water. She is brought back by her mother's desire for her, and is sustained by that desire.The novel can be read as the story of how people become ghosts, and yet it is more than that. It is about coming to terms with an ineffably terrible past, and about surviving. It is about the power of communities to overcome holocausts and the sadistic cruelty of the oppressor. It is about how people go on after witnessing the annihilation of their loved ones."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If you like Faulkner at all, you will love Beloved.

Their business is selling misery and they have made fortunes. They live in palaces, enjoy their wealth, and sell commentary on poverty, suffering, and injustice. All the power to them. Are they writers? Maya sells gifts cards, picture books, and recordings; hers is the real industry. Toni has got that academic cult status, buying property from Princeton to Bear Mountain, and making you believe she is tapped into the voices of oppression. \\"Beloved\\" is marvelous; it should be made into a musical, a Las Vegas show, a movie, a TV serial, a required text in every school in America.

It should be made into a theme park."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, by Toni Morrison is said to be, \\"Dazzling... Magical... An extraordinary work!\\" This quote came from the New York Times. I personally have no idea as of why they think this. To me it almost felt like torture to read this novel. From reading the back of the book, I thought it sounded kind of interesting, but was I ever wrong. It took me forever to finally realize what had really been going on. I was way past the halfway point when a light bulb clicked inside my head, and it kind of halfway made sense. If you have a weak stomach, I would not advise reading this novel. There are some really grotesque scenes that occur.From the beginning every other chapter seemed to have a different narrator. One chapter Sethe would be narrating and the next chapter would have Denver, Baby Suggs, Paul D, or Stamp Paid as narrators. I was never able to tell exactly who was the protagonist. The antagonist was easy to find, though, because the novel is named after her. Beloved is the antagonist. The setting of Beloved takes place in rural Ohio several years after the Civil War. There are many conflicts that take place during Beloved. There is major conflict between Sethe and Beloved. The minor conflict occurs between Beloved and Denver and Denver and Paul D.The theme of Beloved that I, personally, thought that Toni Morrison was trying to convey was if you do not face up to something, the past would haunt you. The literary device known as the flashback was constantly used in this novel. They were used so much that it was sickening. Every time I thought I understood something, a flashback would occur and bam I am back in the dark. I hated this book and I would not recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Yeah, everyone is raving about this book. I think it's terrible. I spent maybe fifteen minutes on just a single page at some points. It's so difficult to read, it's hardly worth it. Morrison likes to say something that makes absolutely no sense, and by the time she gets around to clarifying it you've already forgotten the first incident. It has some interesting things to study for a literature class, but for pleasure reading it's horrible. It took me two months to get through it. It focuses a lot on motherhood and slavery, and as a high school student, I can't relate. Yeah, we've heard just how awful slavery was. I've read other more grotesque descriptions that hit a lot harder than this roundabout way of telling it. If you must read it, take notes as you go and note every detail or you'll be way lost."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Although Toni Morrision displays great skill asand sensitivity in her evocation of character and setting, her sense of judgement seems less developed than her stylistic excellence.Having found a heartbreaking and provocative premise -- a woman kills her daughter rather than sentence her to live as a slave-- she seems to think that this alone is insufficent to have an impact on the reader. To maximize the reader's sympathy for the heroine and to convey the horror of slavery, she submerges the reader in constant and excructiatingly graphic descriptions of brutality and suffering. Hardly a chapter goes by without a description of some act of sadism, usually sexual in nature. The impact of the central theme is then lost in favor of sensationalist wallowing in the grotesque, the effect of which is (ironically) to desensitize the reader to the horror she seeks to convey. What could have been shattering is sabotaged by this lack of self discipline and made to seem merely repet! itive and repulsive.

More, than an intermediate reader like me can take, I'd like to state....Of course, as a Pulitzer winning book, it must have been a feast for critics, but it was an agony for me....There might be readers who are apt to shed light beyond the ever-so-tightly-woven interactions of the characters, but me, as a not-so-profound knower of Morrisons works, her intention to make people think and act doesn't work out, as BELOVED, rather than makes one act, leaves one bedazzled and confused."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot;: a rich book that takes the reader in Cincinnati, Ohio, from the plantation cabins to apartment buildings in the city, from the South of slavery to the North, land of freedom. The title suggests how much space the main character occupies in the novel. The reader receives lots of information about slaves'life, where some white masters deployed extreme cruelty while others were too compassionate. &quot;Beloved&quot;: the story of a crawling-already slave girl who comes back because of an excess of love that her mother's slaughter prevented her to express. &quot;Beloved&quot; Signet Book edition reads on page 315 &quot;Ella didn't like the idea of past errors taking possession of the present.&quot; This sentence seems to summarize the presence of the ghost-child. All the characters are submitted to the wrath of Beloved, because of love unfulfilled. Denver, the only surviving character (nothing proves that she is still sane at the end) stays alive because she takes less space than Beloved and nobody cared for her because only those who are angry and desperate attract the attention like Beloved does. Morrison is a master teller. She keeps the reader abreath, by frequent intrusions into the past. Once you get caught up by the story of the three Pauls, Paul A, F, D, Halle, Sixo and his Sixty-Mile woman, Baby Suggs and Sethe, you cannot stop. You want to know all. Her story contains everything: she talks about the slaves' participation in the Secession War, the Underground railroad station, the situation of indentured servants, all mingled with love stories. And love. And love. Deep love that hurts. Love permeates the story. The key maybe to surviving: the absence of love. Page 314 of the Signet Book Book edition says, talking of Ella &quot;Nobody loved her and she wouldn't have liked it if they had, for she considered love a serious disability.&quot; Maybe love is at the heart of the matter.

I think some people are afraid to face thier own culpability, and use her intricate wording as an excuse to deny the truth of her words."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Although set against the atrocities of slavery, &quot;Beloved&quot; is not &quot;about&quot; slavery, as so many people seem to think. No one should enter into &quot;Beloved&quot; with a chip on their shoulder, not that way at least. The story is not about the slave, it's about the human. I think the novel's focus is coming to terms with past actions in the way that Sethe is made to come face to face with having killed her baby, no matter why she did it. The reappearance of Beloved represents an incredible mixture of pain and joy for Sethe, and she becomes practically enlaved to Beloved, just as she is in a sense enslaved to her past. Denver, also, is a wonderfully drawn, fascinating character in that she does and seems to have always lived in the shadow of this brilliant, burning, beautiful thing that her mother has been obsessed with for 18 years.The sex between Paul D and Beloved is totally functional to the plot, not only to Paul D's character, but especially to Beloved, who is the most basic, hedonistic part of all of us who knows only hot, cold, love, pleasure, pain, warmth, etc. While Beloved is a complete and total handful and at times a real nightmare, she hardly knows REAL wrong. She's like the two year old baby she was when Sethe killed crawling already? girl (another great twist, that the baby was never named).I absolutely ate the supernatural stuff up. The opening pages about the baby ghost's angry behavior (and the residents of 124's extremely matter of fact explanation of it) was the reason I wanted to keep reading (They actually did a pretty good job conveying this opening in the movie. It was done with a lot of red colors and images. I was loving it up until the animatronic dog playing HereBoy with his eyes hanging out lost my interest a little) When Beloved disappears at the end, you almost wonder if she was ever really there.Nothing is &quot;thrown in&quot; in Toni Morrison. To say that there's fodder in this book is to imply that pigs fly. Her language is like a finger painting to me. Incredibly beautiful with all kinds of direction, but too messy for some people. As far as I'm concerned, when you cook the raw, you boil the good stuff out."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a marvelous, unforgettable book. It's not perfect and parts of it were difficult for me to understand, but it was really powerful. Some scenes haunt me to this day, two years after I first read it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"PA-tennage reader. I found this book to be a somewhat dissaspointment. I really enjoy Toni Morrison's work, but this one was quite scattered and hard to understand. I am a really good reader, and i figured it was hard for me to understand because of my age, but a lot of adults that I know also had the same problem. I was confused on the signigicance os the &quot;Here Dog&quot;, was Beloved reincarnated into it? Overall it was okay, but could've been better."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was looking forward to reading another Morrison novel. I truly enjoyed Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, and even got through Paradise thinking it was pretty good. But Beloved lacks the continuity, excitement, and interest of her other novels. The theme is a good one, a person living life after slavery. Ghosts coming out of the closet...good fodder. But much too much time was spent on the ghost, and not enough time on Sethe. I think the hero of the novel is Denver. She is intelligent, open minded and respectful. She can figure things out and has compassion for &quot;Man&quot;.There are too many questions raised concerning the shallow characters of the book. What significance did Paul D. sleeping with the ghost have? Why was it so important? Why was alcohol such a big part of Paul D.'s life? I think they were just used as plot fillers.To summarize, I believe more time should have been spent developing Sethe's character, putting emotional significance to the acts she performed. Denver and the relationship with Sethe should have been stressed a little greater. Denver is the absolute best character, lest I say angel, of the book.I cannot say that Beloved is Morrison's best novel. Everything else I have read has been better."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Remarkable story. You'll feel every emotion there is to feel"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, as the title and as the center of Sethe's world, truly tears at your soul. I was left absolutely in awe of Toni Morrison's abililty to portray the horrific lives of the slaves and their families. I couldn't help but to be humbled and angry as this cruelty was truly a part of our nation's history. I was amazed at the author's abitlity to take something mundane - that perhaps I would describe in a few words - and turn it into a poetic paragraph. Yes, I had to reread more than a few pages because of the complexitiy of her writing, but I found it outstanding and compelling"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's account of slavery from the perspective of those humans forced into it, evoked in me a need to forgive myself. Forgive myself because I realized that like all of those ordinary humans in the 19th century, I too had the potential to commit similar atrocities were I in another time and place.'Beloved' would have to be best book I have ever read both for the historical account as well as the literary qualities. The stream of consciousness style lends itself very well to the content. Initially, I felt emotionally unprepared to take on an account of that magnitude. The characters were in your face and I think it's time they were because accounts of slavery or any other form of holcaust are usually relayed very statistically.The masterful lyrical style prevented me from reading the book too quickly - it seemed rereading certain portions was necessary in order to savour every precious sentence. Certain images, so subtle in its reporting and yet so powerful in its receiving, still remain with me eg. the rooster and Paul D, the perpetual smile on the face of Sethe's mother, schoolteacher instructing his pupils to list animal characteristics of the slaves, his coldness in recording everything in this notebook, and Sethe having to undo her 'wedding' dress so it could be returned to its original linen form.I am glad I accidentally came across the works of Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The novel Beloved is not a book just about slavery. It is primarily about one's past affecting and influencing the present and possibly the future if it is not dealt with. If one does not make peace with one's past and the decisions that were made then one cannot heal, there can be no hope. The characters;Denver and Sethe were hindered by the past, towards the end, Denver made a decision to help herself and her mother. There is always hope if we faint not."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The jumbled thought presentation/flow made this one of the most difficult books I have ever read.

Thanks Toni for Beloved..I just can't put the book down and I am rereading it over and over again."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a challenging work of literature. I have read two other novels by Toni Morrison and Beloved by far is the &quot;easier read&quot;. Upon completion of Beloved I happened to be vewing a PBS special &quot;Africans in America&quot;, this historical documentation so paralled Beloved from an historical perspective it helped me to visualize the taste of iron that Paul D referred to. Ms Morrison uses a lot of symbolism in her writings, however I appreciate the level of intellect that is required to bring her readers to a higher level of awareness. I have just returned home from seeing the movie and it was a pleasure to see how close the movie paralleled the book. This is one book that I wish I had purchased in hard cover."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I loved this novel, because while being aware that this work was something out of the imagination of Toni Morrison, I have also seen &quot;Beloved&quot; like traces in the lives of those around me. It's a wonderful story of history - how the past is always with us and never distant. How in order to get by we have to embrace the treasures as well as the tragedies of our history. We can't selectively choose that which keeps us comfortable. &quot;Beloved&quot; is also about the secrets we carry and how we live among each other and often not have the slightest clue about we're the other has been. Toni's prose is never overbearing or preachy. The characters can sometimes be in surreal circumstances, but their motivations and reactions, and most of all words, are always real and connectable. Paul D is wonderful - who can forget, &quot;you are your own best thing&quot;. &quot;Beloved&quot; is one of those stories that after reading it, it stays with you for a while. You may find yourself asking, what is my beloved? The thing which I can't forgive in myself?"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I feel that the novel Beloved was very amazing, however it was very difficult to understand at times. One really important thing that the book discussed was the hardships the slaves faced in the late 1800's. I could have never imagined that these people were treated so inhumane just because of their skin color. People should be based on their character and contributions as a person, not on the darkness of their skin. Toni Morrison writing really captures me. She describes things in ways that make me truly feel that I can picture, touch, feel, smell, and hear the events of the story as if I was right there in it. A lot of the events in the story confused me. I know some of the objects in the book actually stood for something bigger, but I think others didn't symbolize anything else. Our class discussions helped me a lot to put together the missing pieces. Overall I really enjoyed the novel Beloved. This is the first book I have read by Toni Morrison, but I'm sure that it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was rather confusing to me. The style of writing Toni Morrison used, to me is unique, and requires the reader to have a higher level of understanding to completely comprehend the book, and still get the most out of it. The book skips around a lot, refering back to earlier happenings in the story that makes it diffucult to keep up. Along with the literature she used for the characters, made u stop and think about what she is trying to say. This book also took a lot of relating, you would have to put yourself in the time period and position the characters were in to really understand their rationalization and decision making. Overall this book wasn't my personal favorite, but I didn't dislike it either. I would recommend this book to anyone with understanding and compassion."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was rather confusing to me.

Of all the characters in the novel, my favorite was Baby Suggs. She had a grasp on reality and wisdom which she shared with those in need. The character of Paul D. also struck a chord with me. All in all, this novel was delightful and a pleasure to read. It was a great contribution to American literature."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this book as an &quot;assignment&quot; for a literature class, and I have recommended it several times since then to people looking for a wonderful book to read. Simply put, it is a necessity for anyone who wants to fully understand that time in U.S. history."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's writing style is superb and undoubtedly she has a beautiful mastery of language. What I don't like about the story is that I find the protaganist so unsympathetic - it is very difficult to find anything to like about her. The story is so one-dimensional in the characters - both in different types of characters and in development of a complex personalities that they don't seem real. Maybe it is because the personalities aren't developed at all; just the description about how they float around in the world. You may feel sorry for these people but you don't want to know them. To anyone that likes this book, I would challenge you to read William Styron's &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; which is on my all-time favorite book list. It is absolutely phenomenal. Although based on a true story, it is completely fictional and Styron describes Nat Turner as totally tormented by the conditions of slavery. And you want to root for Nat Turner, wishing you could go back in history to be on his side or to even know him. It is really exceptional."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"toni morrison's writing is not stylish. she has a style to be sure, but one reason that i like her work so much is that this style never gets in the way of her storytelling. it seems very natural to me. i don't understand the repeated use of the word &quot;disjointed&quot; in the negative reviews of this book either. what are you trying to say? sure, the book moves backwards and forwards in time, but it has a rythm that makes everything make sense... the main reason i like this book so much is that it has so much passion in it --- passion that i think is missing in most contemporary english literature. and the comment about white people liking this book out of guilt is just absurd and really makes me angry. this book has also been described as &quot;difficult&quot; --- something else i don't quite understand... it is certainly emotionally trying at times, but it seems like a book that most people should be able to enjoy on some level. even with all the movements back and forth in time, the book just seems so refreshingly straightforward. i wouldn't compare toni morrison thematically to dostoevsky (though, now that i think about it, i'm sure i could), but reading her for the first time gave me the same feeling that reading dostoevsky for the first time gave me. here's someone who is really trying to communicate something to me. i wish i could express myself a bit better, but all i want to convey is that i think the folks that gave this book one star probably have some strange personal problems... don't pay attention to them. toni morrison is my very favorite author writing currently in english."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book really moved me. It was confusing at times, which actually turned out to be a wonderful thing because it truly made me THINK about what I was reading and what Morrison was saying. Morrison's prose are lyrical and moving. The premise for the novel, however, is even more touching. Reading the book is like getting a big warm hug and being slammed against a wall at the same time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a book that will trap your mind and soul from page 1. I believe it is a difficult book to understand due to the way Morrison can play with time...but the effort is worthwhile!I wrote my thesis on this book...I worked on the topic of slavery...I was trying to investigate and discover if the abuses,done to slaves, that are described in the book were based on real historical facts or if they were only fictional. To my surprise I discovered that those abuses were based on real historical facts and that some history books tried covering the thruth and the novel, due to the fact that it was protected under the tittle of a fiction novel, told us more about the cruel reality black epople had to live than many history books do.This novel has fascinated me more more than any other novel I've ever read, each character contained in it carries so much history and such much pain to tell us about that we could say they are each a short novel by themselves playing a crucial role in a larger story.It is a great book to read at any point in life, but I believe it is better appreciated if one has the opportunity to discuss its content.A MUST FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE LOVERS!!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What makes this book so great is the ambiguity at its core. Does Beloved return to facilitate Sethe in her self-forgiveness, or does she merely return to haunt her torn mother? A great book, open for much interpretation. A second read lends new ideas and new interpretation. Definitely a book to be studied and, without question, enjoyed."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I'm looking forward to reading more from Toni Morrison. Beloved boldly addresses issues that we modern Americans easily toss to the bottom of our internal skeleton closet after the high school history unit on &quot;Reconstruction&quot;. And WITH the importance of the questions posed in the novel, Morrison has given us a generous helping of poetry. This book sings. Read and re-read the paragraph about the corn-silk. the story line may be hard to follow if you dislike the stream of consciousness clip that the book takes. Think &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; but with a much more enthralling plot."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I once read that this book is like a mirror that has been smashed into a thousand disjointed pieces. As the reader puts those pieces together, they experience the raw beauty of the writing of Toni Morrison. Beloved teaches us about history and human experience. It is a book that will live forever."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As a scholar of English Literature, I was compelled to read a nobel prize winner such as Morrison. It was an outstanding piece of work and I am sure that it will be admired for many years to come. Recently I was priviliged to experience one of her lectures in Lausanne, Switzerland and it was very intreeging learning how she perceives her work, and how different it was to the sheer amount of critics who are unable to crawl into her complex recipe of thought and excellence. Beloved is, however a novel, for a reader willing to spend alot of time annalysing the deapth of her historical research and experience. It's a classic!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After having been forced to read this book for an English Lit class, I thought it was going to be boring like many of my other setworks. Not So! From the first page this book grabs your attention and doesn't let go for a second. It is absolutely amazing and was even more so on the second reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was a really good book! I recommend it to anyone ages 15+. Although it's pretty hard to understand the plot of the story, you have to reread it, and take your time. I think Toni Morisson is a great writer. I don't think &quot;Beloved&quot; was one of her best, but I think &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; was! I think you should read this book, you will learn about the suffering of slaves. The wordings and descriptions in this book are just amazing! The way she describes Sethe's character , the women of four, is truely unbelievable! If you don't want to read this book, you should rent or buy the movie &quot;Beloved&quot;, Opera stars in it! She's plays so well!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I think Toni Morrison's book Beloved is an excellent piece of work. Through her words she creates vivid descriptions and images in the minds of the reader of how life was back then in the past. It is truely inspiring to learn about the suffering of slaves. It brings out a very interesting and thought provoking question of &quot;What would you do?&quot; in Sethe's position. Would you let your child be taken away to slavery and live a life of misery or kill them so they would never know the horrors of slavery? I truely liked Beloved and Toni Morrison's style of writing. It has inspired me to want to read more of her works."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I would first like to note that while most of the reviews I have read on this amazing novel asume that their audience has already read Beloved, I will not. It seems to me the object of writing a review is to give a prospective reader an idea of what the book is about. On that note.......Beloved is the epitome of perfect literature. Reading it is like listening to a Beatles cd or being inside a Van Gogh Painting. It is not only an interesting story of spiritual enslavement, Civil War era African American Culture and mysticism, the human condition, redemption, and time. It is a book full of amazing imagery( beloved's rebirth into Sethe's life), symbolism( beloved is the symbol of the repression Sethe felt from slavery) and language use, such as &quot; grown men whipped like children; children whipped like adults...,&quot; a simple, yet very clear statement.A breif summary: A young woman named Beloved appears upon the doorstep of Sethe, an escaped slave and mother of four. Beloved is a reincarnation(or gohst, some say) of Sethe's first baby girl whom she killed in order to save from the abominations of slavery. Besides her obvious reason for coming back, Beloved ultimately becomes a healing proccess and a redeemer for many.Also, I wouold like to say, although I understand what Ilana(reviewer a few people down the list) is saying about trying too hard to create symbolism and double entendres, I disagree. When someone's writing does have so much symbolism and creative diction, yet it still flows so freely and fastly, like Morrison's novel, there is no way it was written purely to win the merit it did. So many people search all of their lives to find their purpose in life and never find it, but when someone writes as well as Morrison, it is not only a blessing for her but all of her readers as well."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved was a challenging book for me to read. It's not something I would have read for fun, but in my case I had to read it for my A.P. English class. As I read the first couple of pages I already wanted to put the book down; the book did not catch me as most books do. I forced myself to read more, but as I got further into the book I found myself getting frustrated and confused. Morrison style and diction were some of the things I found myself having trouble with. Morrison would talk about one thing then jump back and forth between her ideas and subjects. I would have to keep flipping back and forth between pages just to try to understand the book. I hated doing that I rather read a book that flows smoothly from one subject to another. Morrison diction was very confusing, for example the poem she included; I couldn't understand what she was trying to say and why she even included it. Beloved is a book for a more matured reader and a reader who has patience. I as a reader was not interested in the book nor satisfied. I do give credit to Morrison on the way she got her point across. She wrote Beloved in a way that the reader could feel and experience what the characters in the book were feeling and experiencing. I myself noticed that while reading this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's fifth novel Beloved is awarded with the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988. This book was a confusing book to read and very hard to follow. With her own mesmerizing style, she confuses the reader as well as the characters in the story. So when the characters in the story seems to be confused, Morrison wants you as the reader to feel the same way as the character is feeling in the story. From the start of the story Morrison throws out a lot of information within the very first paragraph. She gets most of the information out there and leaves you to fiddle with it and put it in your own understanding. While reading the book I found myself going back and forth to figure out what kind of sense Morrison was making. Half the time Morrison had the characters jumping back to past memories and suddenly awaken to the present where the conversation would pick up where it left off. This was one of the most confusing things about the book in which I found. It is up to you as an individual reader to critique this book. If I gave my honest opinion on Beloved, I would have to say that this book is well worth reading. Morrison gives you bits and pieces of information throughout the story and leaves you to fill it. With this the reader can use his/her own imagination and thoughts to fill in the missing bits and pieces. This is one of the styles Morrison uses throughout the book that entices the reader to go on. Although this was a good book that Morrison wrote, I would probably not read another book like this again because of the confusing style. Morrison brought her characters to life throughout the story. She used vivid imagery and went into extensive detail in the story. With this kind of imagery, this is what held me on to reading. The story is about a woman name Sethe and how she kills her infant daughter rather than putting her through the hardships of being a slave. Living with a conscious of killing her daughter, Sethe is bothered by it and tries to let go. Her daughter comes back to haunt Sethe in a form only to be known as Beloved."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was a good book, I do recomend it. But I found it extreamily difficult, even for Morrison's tough style. And on the whole overrated. It wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.But like I said, it is a good book. The story of trying to deal with your past, your communities past, your personal past, is always an important issue to explore.The book is full of historial notes and is a history lesson in and of itself. You could spend a whole year just learning about what items and stories Morrison used to craft her version of a true story."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"*Beloved* is an extended piece of jazz fiction. Each main character's consciousness is like a separate instrument in a jazz ensemble and Morrison improvises within each character's consciousness upon the melody of Sethe's story. Escaped from slavery, Sethe has buried the memory of her experience and in this tale the memories slowly, in fragments, without chronological order, begin to emerge, thanks largely to the appearance of Paul D, a man from her slave past. The story moves through Sethe's consciousness as well as Paul D's, Sethe's daughter Denver's, the ghost's, and the consciousness of other characters.As readers, we learn about slavery from the inside out. Not only do we learn about being enslaved, but we learn about the experience of being free. This story is about codes of conduct and we witness Baby Suggs, and then Sethe, violate the former slaves' code and we see the community of former slaves betray Sethe and her family as a consequence.Morrison's exploration of Sethe being betrayed and shunned by her own people is courageous and moves us into the complex history of African-American community relationships. Can this community welcome Sethe back into its fold? Can Sethe ever be ready to accept others into her intimacy again? Can Sethe heal from having been treated atrociously and from committing an atrocity herself? How is memory an agent of healing? And, finally, how does Toni Morrison explore all of these questions in the context of a ghost story?This novel is deeply internal. It resides in the memories, dreams, thoughts, and stories of its characters. As the fragments begin to cohere, we see a profoundly moving and, I think, healing tale unfold.In this novel, Toni Morrison has beautifully reconstructed history so that we imaginatively experience slavery from the inside of those who experienced it. The lyrical language of each character's soul vibrates with joy, suffering, longing, desire, and hope. I consider *Beloved* a divinely inspired novel. I can't imagine a history of slavery reaching as deeply and as profoundly into the truth of slavery as this fiction does."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's BELOVED is a magnificent achievement in literature. Her prose is alternately hertbreaking, moving, funny and profound. I must admit that I am very biased about Morrison's work as she is my favorite author, but this novel is borderline peerless. Toni Morrison has fashioned a tale about the gift of love and the ultimate sacrifice a mother can make for her children. It is not a quick read, but a glorious journey into an abyss of poetic elegance and courage. If the reader lets it, the novel can be an extraordinary and breathtaking pleasure. Toni Morrison is a genius, a champion of words and major contributor to the art of literature. Thank God for this wonderful novel and the literary force known as (the great) Toni Morrison"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The book \\"Beloved,\\" written by Toni Morrison, is a difficult but fascinating book. It takes place in 1873 in Ohio. The two main characters are Sethe and Beloved. Sethe is a black run away slave who escaped from her home in Sweet Home, a place where she was a slave, to live with her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and reunite with her family. Beloved was Sethe's oldest daughter of four children, two boys (Buglar and Howard) and two girls (Beloved and Denver). When Beloved was a baby she was killed and now haunts the house that Sethe and her family live in. Sethe says that Beloved's spirit is not an evil spirit but a sad one. An incident that happened in the book, which exemplifies why I enjoyed the book is sort of disturbing but shows, in a strange way, how much Sethe loved her children. Sethe and Baby Suggs were working in the yard one morning when the schoolteacher, the one who used to own Sethe, showed up to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Sethe saw him coming from down the road so she quickly grabbed her children and ran into the shed as she started to kill them. She knocked the two boys unconscious, killed Beloved by slitting her throat and almost killed Denver but was stopped before she could. Sethe did this because she wanted her children to be free. Sweet Home was a terrible place and she didn't want her children to live or die there so instead she tried to kill them. I recommend this book to people who want a challenge and have a lot of patience. It took some time having to read pages over at least twice to understand what was going on. Overall I thought it was a pretty good book. If you understand what is going on then it is a very touching book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"For the reader that has an appetite for the extraordinary and surreal, BELOVED is a definite filler. Morrison incorporates the supernatural and the unthinkable into a true story of horror and perservering strength. The novel embraces the unseen and suffocated effects of slavery; an issue ignored for many years by mainstream society. BELOVED dives head first into one woman's formidable tale of a choice she made out of love but is punished for unceasingly by a society that cannot understand. The story progresses with revelations on all levels and is incredibly enticing for the curious mind. One walks away from BELOVED with entirely enlightened views on compassion, strength, and love."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I ordered this book for my American Literature class.

Like the part where Sethe has to pee, but can't make it to the outhouse. The act of her peeing is very graphically described, but it had no purpose. It was never brought up again by anyone in the story.

However, there were sections in the end that were confusing and difficult to understand in terms of the whole story. I think it was as much me as it was the author for so often just the time of day can affect my level of understanding. Toni Morrison&#8217;s tail is so riveting at times that you cannot but the book down and yet, at other times you wonder what she is trying to convey. I think this would be a great read for a book group.

When is this simple story era we're talking about? Cause literature was sure never simple (easiest example to cite-Shakespeare). If you want a good, fun, easy read, this novel is not for you. But if you want literature, then give this book a try. Morrison's style is engaging and really allows us to get into the feel of the characters and their stories. Keeping this short though- I am reading this book as a college student. Any younger, and I don't think I would have appreciated it as much (parf of the reason I believe this book should not be taught in high school).In short, great book. Awesome job Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If you forced me at knife point to describe this novel in one word, that word would be astonishing. Or maybe devastating.Beloved is the grandame by which other ghost novels will be judged. Many will be found wanting.Set in the pre-Civil War south, the novel tracks the ravages of oppression across one matriarchal line-that of Baby Suggs, Sethe, Denver, and their sons and lovers. The last of the daughters, Beloved, is killed during a slave raid.Soon, the venomous spirit of Beloved emerges from the waters \\"breathing shallow\\" like the first primordial creature to venture onto land.* Once she adjusts to a woman's form, Beloved taunts her mother's lover and torments her mother's soul.Yet hope resides at 124 Bluestone Road.

The sage Paul D. insists, \\"You got two feet, Sethe, not four.\\"The eponymous ghost is born of a mother's tragic response to the terrors of slavery and serves as an anti-legacy that will haunt the reader long after the final word, Beloved, leaps from the page.

But why would you?"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's masterpiece, Beloved, was a story like no other. This story takes place in rustic Ohio, a short time after the Civil War, so the tension between blacks and whites is still very fierce. You are introduced to Sethe, an escaped slave, who has a haunting past, a past that won't let her forget, even though she tries so hard to not remember. Denver, her daughter, is her only comfort until an old friend from Sweet Home, Paul D, appears. Even the presence of these two people in her life won't keep her haunting past at bay. Sethe committed the unforgivable; she killed her own daughter to keep her out of slavery. Now the dead daughter, Beloved, is back; not in the form of an unseen presence, but as a physical being. The chaos her attendance would bring, would greatly change the lives of those close to Sethe.I found this story to be very confusing. Toni Morrison would never tell you straight up what she meant, but rather dropped hints and left you to draw your own conclusions. There is no doubt she is a very skilled writer for her use of allusions and symbols are greatly admired. At the beginning of chapter 16 she makes an allusion to the four horsemen from Revelations. Why she chose to make a reference to them at this point was ambiguous. A symbol of Morrison's that had a lot of meaning was the \\"tin can\\" of Paul D. This symbolized his heart, which he felt could never be opened again to feelings. Simple words like \\"teeth\\" or \\"a hot thing\\" could have multiple meanings, and it was up to you to determine what each really meant. It's her style to let the reader experience the story from the Sethe's point of view which leads to much confusion. If you had no prior knowledge of what happened to Beloved, you wouldn't understand why her returning as a ghost was so significant in the beginning. It wasn't only the fact she waited to reveal things until a later time in the story, it was also her means of telling the story. As the reader you aren't constantly moving forward to the future happenings, but you're exposed to memories of the past. The line between reality and a memory was very blurred, causing the reader to have to look back to gain a better understanding. As for a recommendation on whether or not to read this story it depends on what kind of person you are. If you are like me, and have an analytical mind, you will have a hard time enjoying this story. I like things to be black or white; everything presented straight forward, and no questions about it. This meant I didn't catch many of the symbols or allusions the first time around. I had to reread pieces before it started to make any sense. Once I recognized the symbols or allusions I was unsure of what they stood for. I couldn't be definite about their significance to the story, and this left me questioning many things. I don't recommend this story to anyone who likes things to be uncomplicated. Regardless of whether you think you might enjoy the story, the message behind it makes it worth the effort."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"&quot;Beloved&quot; is a book that has garnered many accolades from both the press and my book-loving friends.

There is nothing exceptional about Beloved. It is pretentious, self-righteous, and sanctimonious. The characters are amazingly one-dimensional, and the self-congratulatory structure makes it almost painfully difficult to read. From a thematic point of view, it explores almost nothing new and lacks originality. Overall, an irritating novel which doesn't deserve a single measure of the superfluous praise it has received."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This story of a black family and their trials and tribulations, and their mistreatment at the hands of slave owners, reminded me of Harriet Beecher Stowe's famous Uncle Tom's Cabin, which I read decades ago. Morrison's book is an equally great novel about the evils of slavery. In reading the reviews here, I notice that Morrison's writing is described as rich, or flawless, or that it strikes just the right note for portraying the tragedies of Seth and her family. For me the beauty of the prose contrasts starkly with the events Morrison describes. The characters are very believable and are developed in great depth. I can see why this book was voted the best novel of the past 25 years by critics. It's a great novel on many levels, and I think it deserves the acclaim it's received by critics and readers alike."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"To all members of the Nobel Prize comittee: Why? Why did you give this disjointed, non-sensical &quot;work&quot; the most highly regarded prize on earth? Morrison's poor writing is disguised by the fact that she is black and is writing about slavery. If you polled all of the critics who gave this book rave reviews, I bet that you would find that most of them are white. They are embarrased by the crimes of their forefathers and feel that by giving Beloved a good review, they are making up for centuries of oppression. I read literary criticism for honest, no-holds-barred criticism. The falsified &quot;kindness&quot; that critics have bestowed on Morrison and Beloved makes me not want to ever read another review. A thoroughly unenjoyable work."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Somehow Morrison has gotten a reputation for her &quot;literature.&quot; This is a shame as her abilities are quite limited indeed. This novel is by far her worst and that must have taken some effort. A incomprehensible muddle of stereotypes and cliches written in a style far beyond this author's limited scope."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"I24 was spiteful.\\" More like confusing! Ms. Morrison truly has the gift of confusion and she uses it to full advantage in her novel, Beloved. The story centers around Sethe, an escaped slave who lives an outcast's life in her deceased mother-in-law's house (the aforementioned I24). Her two companions in the beginning are Denver (her 18-year old daughter) and the \\"spiteful\\" ghost of her murdered \\"crawling-already\\" baby. Paul D., a fellow ex-slave from the \\"wonderful\\" Sweet Home plantation shows up, forces Sethe to remember her ugly past, and chases the ghost out. Everything seems peachy until Beloved, an unlined young woman with a thirst for stories, shows up. She hungers for Sethe's attention and despises Paul D. Denver finds something to care for and call her own in Beloved. The tentative happiness ends when Paul D. finds out about Sethe's dark secret which has kept so many away from I24.This book is full of symbols. The dominant symbol is water, which can represent rebirth, baptism, and cleansing. Beloved speaks of looking through the water at Sethe on multiple occasions and Beloved \\"came from the river\\". Beloved can be a symbol because she represents Sethe's unwelcome memories. Beloved makes it easier for Sethe to speak of her past and face it. Beloved also speaks in her chapter of turtles (protection or shields), men without skin (whites), teeth (which can have many meanings, the darkest of which is the teeth of a saw), and the \\"hot thing\\" which could be anything from love to blood. This is one of the good aspects of this novel. You have to grow up and realize that the author won't spoon-feed the entire story to you. It forces you to think outside of the box and question every single sentence and character. After all, if the event/person/thing didn't have any significance would Ms. Morrison include her/him/it in her novel?I enjoyed this book on a simple level. Beloved has a very entertaining storyline, especially with its supernatural layer. However, once I tried to figure out what was going on between the lines and what every word could mean, it became more confusing. I'm the type of person who has to know I'm right. I'm not comfortable guessing something and being content with my assumption. It helps to read this book with another person so that you can bounce your ideas off of each other and draw from your own experiences and beliefs to shape your interpretation of the novel. I would definitely recommend this book to any person who is willing to have both their brains and beliefs scrambled and who can also deal with graphic language and situations."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The painful memories, the dreadful experiences, and the hurt placed inside one's heart. Remembering the past is a thing some do not want to face.This is the challenge that Sethe and Paul D have to face in Toni Morrison's Beloved, awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for Fiction.Set in the late 1800s in rural Ohio, shortly after the slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, Beloved is a novel about Sethe, a former slave who once worked at a slave plantation known as Sweet Home. Along with her daughter Denver, the two women reside at 124, a home haunted by the ghost of Sethe's murdered infant child. Paul D, another ex-slave from the Sweet Home plantation, visits Sethe at 124. It is he who forces Sethe to look back at her past experiences and reveal the secrets hidden within her. One day, a young woman named Beloved arrives at Sethe's home. Believed to be the embodied spirit of the dead child, Beloved's arrival causes chaos at 124. In her own way, Morrison causes chaos in the mind of the reader.Many argue that Beloved is confusing and was not pleasurable to read, and I agree. But this is why Morrison is so effective in Beloved: she allows the reader to experience the flashbacks (known as \\"rememory\\") and the pain at the same time the characters are going through them in the novel. I have yet to read another novel that can make the reader suffer as much as the characters do.Morrison varies her style of writing throughout the book to emphasize the thoughts of a certain character in Beloved. Although most of the novel is written in the third-person view, Morrison writes as Sethe, Denver, and Beloved in these \\"stream-of-consciousness\\" chapters. Sethe's lack of education is easily seen as she rambles on. Denver, on the other hand, seems to be an intellectual young woman who seeks to protect the loved ones she has. Beloved's erratic and haunting section adds to her mysterious appearance.While reading Beloved, one must ask his or herself, \\"is Morrison racist?\\" There are many instances which hint Morrison is attempting to degrade the white race. Take schoolteacher, for instance. The name \\"schoolteacher\\" is not capitalized. Morrison implies that schoolteacher does not deserve respect and is low in social status, but his actions in the book prove otherwise. \\"Men without skin,\\" a reoccurring image from the character Beloved, also refers to whites as being inferior to the blacks. Morrison speaks to the reader as if whites are void of life.Beloved is a well-written novel that reveals the physical and emotional torture slaves had to endure, even long after their release from captivity. However, Morrison's graphic, detailed descriptions of horrific events may be sickening to the stomach for some readers. I was not fond of having to visualize human beings sodomizing cows, nor women bashing their own baby's head against a solid wall. Just for Morrison's magic in delivering this story to the reader, I recommend Beloved for most readers (some may be offended by the graphic images and themes in this novel)."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Is it just me or is this book completely over-rated? America is short on black female authors so we should over praise the ones we do have."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book is precious. Toni Morrison did not win the Nobel for no good reason; you just have to be willing to discover that reason. If you are expecting Roots or The Color Purple, don't bother; this book will throw you. I read it unprepared for it's lightning-sharp observation and non-linear style, but it grew to be my second favorite book of all time (One Hundred Years of Solitude being the first). This woman is a genius. She is single-handedly redefining literature as we know it. She is not a Faulkner rip-off- she is her own category, and it's a great one. I think she's the best thing America has going right now.This book is a puzzle. It IS confusing, it IS hard, and it is like nothing you've ever read. Haunting is the best way I can think to describe it. PLEASE give this book a chance. It will give its rewards in strange and unexpected ways, and it is all worth it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"'Beloved' is a masterful example of literary expressionism. Though the narrative chronology of Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winnner is captivating, the book's towering strength comes from its incredible subtext, carefully forwarded through the poetic arrangement of Sethe's memories. We are not told a story; rather, we are presented a delicate vision which encompasses a story, nestled in its many layers. Those layers, dear readers, are among the most haunting and moving passages in modern American fiction.'Beloved' relates the story of Sethe, an ex-slave whose attempts to live peacefully are ambushed by an inescapable and spiteful past. Morrison is not concerned with offering us a history lesson; we've all read about the facts and figures of slavery in school. Morrison's story artfully delves into Sethe's indelible emotional scars. Her pain is real and immeasurable - this undercurrent turns 'Beloved' into a work of enormous power.'Beloved' is a challenging read. Despite the relatively smooth transition to film recently made under Oprah Winfrey's supervision, 'Beloved's text does not rely on cinematic continuity. Time and space aren't given normal treatments; Morrision explains only what she wants to. The reader is often forced to think, suppose, and question... and I suspect Morrision expects no less from us."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This was my first foray into the world of Toni Morrison. I had heard so much negative press on how completely unreadable &quot;Paradise&quot; was that I was somewhat intimidated about picking it up. A review of the film on Oprah convinced me to give it a try, and I will be forever grateful. This is simply one of the finest American novels ever written. I loved Morrison's style of unfolding the story bit by bit. As you read, you know in a very general way what the basic story line is, but the details are witheld until the author is ready to divulge her secrets entirely. It leaves you breathless to turn the pages. You are literally propelled through this book at a breakneck pace, in all its terrible beauty. The characters are unforgettable. Their suffering is gut wrenching. This is a very visceral book, and it is not for the squeamish or weak at heart. It takes courage and preseverance to read &quot;Beloved&quot;. It is not for the average reader because it goes beyond armchair entertainment. This book was written to impact the reader profoundlly and it does. Read it and weep-then rejoice that fiction as good as this exists!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"See it, smell it, taste it. When you listen to Toni Morrison read this novel you live it, feel it in all it's imagery. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Interesting. Beloved was definitely interesting. I didn't particularly like the book, but Morrison really knows her craft. She paints an intense picture in your head through strong imagery. With her use of imagery she puts you right in the middle of the story. As a result of this, you can feel what the characters feel, confused.Memory is the prominent theme of Beloved and Morrison uses flashbacks to really drive home that theme and play with the readers' minds. One moment you're in the present with Sethe talking to Denver and Beloved or Paul D; the next you're back at Sweet Home or in the middle of Sethe's escape from Sweet Home. Later, you're back where you started. The difficult part of the story line is that Morrison never clues you in on when she makes the switch. This again causes confusion, much like how the characters feel.Even though I did not like the plot or agree with some of the philosophy of Beloved, I do admire Morrison's skill in writing. She plays with many literary techniques like symbolism (Paul D's tin can), and allusion (Baby Suggs feeding the town), and uses them very well to control what and how much the reader knows. Morrison is a very talented writer and I would read more of her books just to study her interesting, challenging, and thought-provoking style.I would recommend reading this book for anyone, but especially those who like challenging stories which force you to think and take a step back and really look at life. Morrison has a talent for bringing our attention to social inequities, and forcing us to come to terms with those and learn from the past. Once again, an excellent book for anyone studying writing techniques."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This should be required reading for every person in the US. She made me FEEL slavery. I walked away understanding slavery in a way I never thought possible. We all think we know what slavery did to those in bondage, but until you read Beloved, you can't possibly understand. She made me understand that slavery affects those in the African American community today. The utter obliteration of the family and of love: how can a people who experienced this ever be able to heal. This is truly the most important book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"124 was spiteful.\\"...Thus begins Toni Morrison's epic, moving, technically astounding novel. And upon reading the opening chapter, the reader will be rendered confused, moved, horrified, and gripped in six or seven pages of fantastic writing. It is impossible to really say that \\"Beloved\\" is the tale of the ghost of a baby, embittered and vengeful, or \\"Beloved\\" is the tale of Sethe, an ill-treated black woman who is too afraid to \\"go inside\\" and face her past. No. \\"Beloved\\" is none of these. In fact, Morrison's novel (if indeed it can be called a \\"novel\\") is written in such a way that it cannot be described as one story. It is a collection of memories, \\"rememories\\", and haunting images, collectively compilled to create a harrowing reminder to the people of today that the slave trade must NOT be forgotten. It must be remembered.But to remember is to move on. And to move on is to forget.\\"This was not a story to pass on...this is not a story to pass on.\\"Morrison's non-linear narrative style plunges the reader into a world of memory. The book is non-chronological and therefore more than a little confusing to begin with, but, on delving deeper into the secrets of Sethe's past, the supressed memories of darker times are slowly uncovered. Aided by impressive language techniques and a unique style of writing, Morrison proceeds to break down the genre of \\"Slavery\\" writing and creates a new, ingenious type of story. By combining the historical elements of a novel about black slavery and the chilling, spine-tingling terrors of a ghost story, Morrison draws the reader in hungrilly, thirsting for our attention and causing us to thirst for more...just as Beloved thirsts for Sethe, acceptance...and revenge.\\"Beloved\\" is more than a book. More than a tale, a fable, or a fiction. \\"Beloved\\" is a memory. A protest against forgetting what is almost already lost. \\"Beloved\\" is spine chilling, heart-warming, and eye-opening. Most importantly, \\"Beloved\\" is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I am not a critic but a lowly high school student, neither bright nor insightful. Having confessed that, I would now like to say thank God I am not a critic because they often have terrible taste, as is the case with this particular novel. It is simply unoriginal.First I was disgusted by the grotesque episodes, but gradually decided they were excusable considering the fact that slavery and everything that came with it was absolutely horrendous. Then I thought I enjoyed Morrison's writing style; it seemed unique, poetic, and not at all as difficult as some make it out to be. The seemingly random flashbacks add to the theme of &quot;rememories.&quot; After a while, though, the style became tiring, even silly. The chapters that appear to be narrated by Beloved are irritating rather then touching, the sudden shifts to stream-of-consciousness are abrupt and unexcused, and most vexing of all is Morrison's lack of point. She obviously has many themes running through the story but does not make any new statements, and everything is stated in an overly dramatized manner. Take, for example, the entity Beloved. Without technically affirming Beloved's identity as that of the murdered little girl, Morrison piles on hint after blatant hint; they become, not merely repetitive, but an insult to the intelligence of the reader. &quot;I get it: Beloved is the crawling already? baby! now please get on with it!&quot; And yet she still tries to make it mysterious by insinuating that Beloved's appearance may be interpreted as a freakish coincidence.I am sure that there is much more meaning in this novel than I have extracted so far, but since just about every sentence seems to be open for interpretation, isn't the reader practically making up the meaning for himself? Why can't Morrison just SAY something? Her symbols (Paul D's &quot;tobacco tin&quot; and \\"red heart\\" - come on now) are often so unexplained and, well, banal, that I want to laugh. I refrain, however, because I am still a lowly teenager and, though I consider myself well-read, I must also be extremely dense to miss whatever sensational and \\"shattering\\" message was supposed to be conveyed through Beloved. Rather than considering the book to be over my head, though, I prefer to say that it is \\"under my toes,\\" and unworthy of any more of my time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"...and so Morrison sets up her novel.Set in Ohio post-Civil War. Sethe is an escaped slave and has been living in Ohio for eighteen years. All that remains of her family now is her youngest daughter Denver and an angry spirit haunting their house. Paul D. whom Sethe has not seen since she escaped from Sweet Home comes along and a series of events follow: each adult begins relieving horrible memories of the past, a mysterious girl who calls herself 'Beloved' appears, and Sethe reveals a terrible incident in her past.With a haunting and unique plot, this book is right up on my favorites list. My above summary did it no justice. I was a bit wary when I began reading it because it was a) an Oprah favorite and I tend to distrust mainstream, and b) the prose style was very unusual. The beginning is a tad confusing but stick with it; you will be rewarded with an excellent story!The flashbacks that Paul D. and Sethe both have throughout the book are excellently done and potray the horrors and hardships of slaves. The presence of Beloved makes up the main plot and you'll be breathless as you begin to learn about her and how she figures into Sethe's life.All-around, I was very impressed with this book. The plot was well-crafted and suspenseful and the characters were very fleshed-out. I will be reading more of Morrison's work in the future."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Having wanted to read this book for several years, I started reading Beloved in the early evening and didn't put it down until I finished. Throughout the book, I was trying to ascertain the purpose/message of Toni Morrison. Was the book meant to merely depict life and times of that era for a post-Civil war slave and to document slavery? Or were there messages of healing, hope and transcendence? These were the questions I kept asking myself throughout my reading. I have to admit I was disturbed by what I found.Certainly the writing was excellent. It held my attention. It was rich with imagery, poetic passages and excellent characterization. Certain parts of the novel were, however, confusing, as the narrative goes back and forth in time. But this to me wasn't as disturbing as the rather one dimensional white characters, the lack of complexity in dealing with a consciousness of people (on both sides of the equation). So, that the white characters are easily hated and the black characters easily understood and acceptable.It seems to me our country (and world) has a long history of oppression - whether of Indians, women, slaves, etc. To me, it would be up to writers to have vision for the future to show the way for some healing, a reframing of the old story of blame and amovement beyond hatred and prejudice - and certainly to challenge readers with complex (more readily human) characters living in a world of predetermined (and unfair to a larger group than just this one) limitations and prejudice.I got stuck feeling maybe I was being unfair to the depiction of a true story. But it seems to me that any individual or group thereof who have not developed self (whether through oppression or their own personal limitations of fear, etc.) will find a difficult path to walk. And, certainly many factions of oppressed people's stories have been forgotten, and I know Morrison wanted to make sure the reality, agony and despair were never forgotten from American history. I understand and commend this voice documenting the story.Still, we can see abuse, beatings, rape and even shaming acts in families, schools, churches - everywhere. I found the questioning of Paul D. about Mr. Garner's calling the slaves of Sweet Home \\"real men,\\" to be one of the signs of a person beginning to find a self. And, I found Sethe's running away to be the hopeful signs of a spirit aware on some level that life can be different.Ok. I know. This was based on a true story but it seemed to me that the novel gave voice to blame and not to forgiveness or even better, to the personal growth, the evolution of soul (or even a nation, like ours has slowly with steps forward and back over time), development of self and increase of consciousness of a people. It is doesn't seem to help find a way beyond.The characters to me seemed to get stuck in their denial of story, just as so many rape victims, abused children do. Paul D. kept his story in the tin in his heart until Beloved. And though his interaction with her was seen to be negative, I actually found the opening of that tin to be his salvation, as how can one go beyond a story until going through it?And that seemed to be the justification of Sethe's killing of her daughter. She couldn't imagine a life better for her daughter. She didn't want her to have to live a life enslaved.Now, I can logically understand this and I can forgive the character her moment of insanity. But if we said she had just had too much and snapped because of the pain in her life, then we would have to do the same for the many others in the world who had a very painful childhood and who chose destruction as a path, no matter what they called it - protection, the desire for that person not to do a certain thing or live a particular life.I thought one of the truly wonderful parts in the book was when Paul D. went back to Sethe (after knowing about her killing her daughter). I also thought the community of women coming to help Denver and Sethe was another hopeful message. It seems to methese two passages were very subtly played out but love and community seem to be a message of possible hope.Overall, I found Beloved to be a beautifully written story that didn't have the courage to take on a message much beyond trusting your own color and to voice the suffering of slaves and the shameful behavior of the group of people in power in our society at that time.To me, anger is certainly a necessary emotion to change a person or a group of individuals life and for the growth of a soul (or group of people) just awakening to personal power and a consciousness of self determination. I commend the book for helping echo that necessary first step but wasn't able to show possible alternatives beyond anger.And, in fact, it seems many (people with a background of oppression such as slavery) have gotten stuck in the anger and are not able to take a step beyond towards a deeper healing and liberation from the past. In fact, the anger gets handed down from one generation to the next."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of 1988, Toni Morrison frees herself from the bonds of traditional narrative and establishes an independent style, just as her characters have freed themselves from the horrors of slavery and escaped from Kentucky to Ohio. Revealing the story of Sethe and her family as they survive the brutality of the farm, only to encounter torments even more punishing than whippings after they escape, Morrison presents scenes in a seemingly random order, each scene revealing some aspect of life for Sethe, her boys, her dead baby Beloved, and the new baby Denver, both in the past and in the present. Moving back and forth, around, and inside out through Sethe's recollections, she gradually reveals Sethe's story to the reader, its horror increasing as the reader makes the connections which turn disconnected scenes into a powerful and harrowing chronology.As the novel opens, Sethe and Denver have lived in #124, a house in Ohio, for eighteen years, refusing to socialize and enjoying no company. When Paul D. Garner, one of the Sweet Home men and a friend of her long-missing husband, arrives on her doorstep and moves in, Sethe slowly reveals her long-buried nightmares, and the two share their stories of the events leading up to their escape. Most haunting to Sethe is the death of her young daughter Beloved, shortly after the escape from the farm, though the reader does not know for many pages the shocking manner of her death. When a ghostly figure who calls herself Beloved arrives at #124, shortly after Paul D., Morrison creates mystery and a heart-stoppingly tense atmosphere when Beloved moves in. As Beloved gradually takes over the household and seems to demand and then possess Sethe's soul, the sorrow which has burdened Sethe seems close to breaking her.The sadism of some slave-owners, the devices used to torture, and the desperate measures some slaves took to protect themselves and their loved ones come fully alive here, the horrors growing as the reader gradually discovers the real source of Sethe's torment. By forcing the reader to make the connections, instead of spelling out details in a traditional narrative, Morrison strengthens the impact of the novel and its brutal revelations. Symbols of water, rain, snow, and ice connect the disparate scenes, and the use of shadows and the ghostly character of Beloved keep the reader on tenterhooks until the action is eventually resolved. A powerful, atmospheric, and shocking novel, Beloved is also a searing indictment of slavery and the damage it has done to the fabric of life, damage that cannot be repaired until it is fully recognized through novels such as this. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is the story of Sethe, a runaway slave in the closing days of slavery, and the people around her - Beloved, the ghost of her dead baby, Denver, the remaining daughter, Paul D, her lover who also escaped from the same plantation in Kentucky, and Baby Suggs, her mother-in-law.The writing is craftful and the imagery masterful. The depiction of slavery and its malevolent effects on everyone is poignant and convincing without ever being maudlin or preachy. What could have been a sad tearjerker is much too real, too convincing, calloused over with the hardness that the characters are forced to develop when everything they love, from their spouses to their children are beaten, raped, taken away, or killed at the whim of the whiteman.But while I can appreciate the story, the structure, and the way it was written, I found it extremely tedious to read. It hangs on the thinnest of narrative thread, and whenever a plot threatens to develop, the scene ends and we find out what happened later as an aside. Most of the 275 pages are dense interior monologues, frequently repetitious, that sometimes degenerates into what seemed like random text.The characters are drawn with detail, each distinctive and real. I feel I could recognize them on the street if one walked past. But they are as closed to us as they are to themselves. While they evoke my sympathy, they never gain my empathy. We study them, we hear them, we even feel them, but we never are them.As an epic prose/poem, Beloved is amazingly successful. Its images are strong and convincing. As a novel, it's a long, tedious read with no payoff. I would recommend Beloved to someone who enjoys poetry. For someone looking for a story, even a difficult one, there are many far more readable."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As a a high school English teacher, I've reread this book about 8 times and have taught it over the years to many students. Although it's certainly a complex novel, it's basic storyline is not hard to follow -- just the narrative style which shifts voices quite a bit. One thing that helps when reading anything by Morrison, but especially Beloved, is to remember that she herself is a classicist. Do yourself a favor and read the Medea myth -- you will suddenly understand 100 times more than you would if you skip it. I would also recommend NOT watching the movie, particularly if you are looking for explanations. Parts were well done, but the book is so rich that it seems mean to lower the dignity of the prose by showing private scenes. It's an incredibly rich and lyric novel with strains of Morrison's rendition of a kind of Magic Realism style. Don't expect everything to be realistic: there are ghosts and half painted characters that cross our normal boundaries of time. Expect to be disoriented at the beginning, but the plot clears up as you go and then you can go back and re-read the opening chapters. A great work of literature which yields more after every reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What kind of mother would deliberately cause the destruction of her own beloved child? This is the question Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner (and probably the greatest woman novelist of the twentieth century), Toni Morrison, explores in her rich, densely-layered novel, Beloved.Set after the end of the Civil War, when slaves were freed by emancipation, but still victims of random acts of violence, the book also serves as a metaphor for the legacy of slavery and asks the chillingly relevant question: Why is the leading cause of death among young, African-American men murder by another black?Beloved's protagonist is Sethe, an escaped slave and mother of four. Her joy at successfully escaping her former master while pregnant and giving birth before finally finding refuge at her spiritually-nourishing mother-in-law's home, vanishes a mere twenty-eight days later.The sight of a cruel white slave owner's hat sends Sethe and her children running to a woodshed where she is forced to confront demons no loving mother should ever have to face.Sethe's demons do not disappear when she emerges from the woodshed, however, and settles down in a small Ohio town. Instead, they remain to both haunt her and help her to understand the violence that occurred so many years previously.Morrison, as skillful a storyteller as ever lived, spins a gorgeously heartbreaking tale in Beloved, and one whose plot is impossible to predict. With a mastery of language given to only a few, this extraordinarily talented author weaves subplot upon subplot and brings each exquisitely created character to life.There is Paul D, another slave who escaped from the same plantation as did Sethe but who has not seen Sethe for more than a decade when he once again encounters her and the two of them contemplate what they hope will finally be a bright future for both.There is Denver, Sethe's daughter, a troubled and isolated teenager whose life encompasses little more than her immediate surroundings and whose social interactions have dwindled down to embrace only her mother and the ghost of her long-dead sister.And then, there is Beloved, the centerpiece of this exquisitely wirtten, lyrically beautiful book.While Sethe appears to embrace a logic that says, &quot;Before the while man destroys you, let me do it,&quot; Morrison, herself, tells us that it is time for us to look beyond the past and move on.Today, more than twenty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, African Americans are, in many ways, worse off than they were before. The question plaguing most black Americans seems to be whether to cast their lot with the whites of the community or to separate, turn inward and seek their own redemption...alone.In Beloved, Morrison uses the character of Ella, one of the leaders of her small Ohio community, to metaphorically explore this issue. &quot;Whatever Sethe had done, Ella didn't like the idea of past errors taking possession of the present...Daily life took as much as she had. The future was sunset; the past was something to leave behind. And if it didn't stay behind, well, you might have to stomp it out. Slave life; freed life; every day was a test and trial. Nothing could be counted on in a world where even when you were a solution you were a problem. 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,' and nobody needed more; nobody needed a grown up evil sitting at the table with a grudge. As long as the ghost showed out from its ghostly place, shaking stuff, crying, smashing and such--Ella respected it. But if it took flesh and came in her world, well, the shoe was on the other foot. She didn't mind a little communication between the two worlds, but this was an invasion.&quot;Beloved is first and foremost a brilliantly crafted and mesmerizing story, faultlessly told by one of the world's most gifted storytellers. It is a story of ghosts--those that haunt Sethe and those that haunt all of us. Beloved is not magic realism, nor does it contain elements of magic realism. Magic realism, by its very nature, requires that the fantastic be accepted as mundane by those experiencing it. There is certainly nothing mundane about Morrison's ghost and her acceptance by Sethe.Although most of the novel's characters ostracize Sethe and blame her for her past, Morrison, herself, does not. Instead, she wisely extends a vision of harmony to the black community that exhorts them to let go of their past, no matter how painful, and move ahead.Beloved and Sethe must, eventually, come to terms with the past and with each other, just as the community must come to terms with itself.In the end, Beloved's protagonists decide on different paths to follow, some of which are quite surprising, although always heart-rending.Morrison, however, remains true to the vision she created in Beloved: those who cannot let go of the past will ultimately self-destruct; those who can respect its lessons and mourn its loss but not feel indebted to right its wrongs, will find themselves endowed with unexpected, joyous freedom."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"You will not only find this novel difficult to put down, you will find it difficult to put out of your head. I have had wonderful--often heated and wildly divergent--discussions of this novel in both my Lit. classes and my bookclub. I would urge anyone who reads this book to seek out other readers to discuss it with--you will probably be surprised at their interpretation of symbols or events in the story. While Morrison depicts the devestating repercussions of slavery, the story is not completely bleak, and it gets even better with every re-reading. Even without discussion, the prose is challenging but rewarding, and the story is unforgettable. Put this novel on your &quot;must read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Many of you who are writing are students, and since I am a teacher, I am rather sad to see you criticizing the book. My students(honors high school seniors)are struggling with it now, and in fact I think some have simply not been reading. This book requires an initial effort on the part of the reader -- it will take time for you to understand why &quot;124 was spiteful.&quot; However, this book (and since I'm an English teacher, I've read many!)is a marvel. It demands an intelligent reader, one who wants to know more, one who has compassion, one who is willing to think about slavery and what it has done -- to individuals, to African-Americans, to whites, to the U.S. culture. There are mini history lessons on virtually every page, as well as new vocabulary, wonderful imagery and symbolism, beautifully drawn characters, and food for thought that should stay with you for a lifetime. If you are looking for a thriller to pass the time, this is not the book for you. If you want to think about our country's past and how it haunts our present, try Beloved."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well, that's what this book is, let's face it. I'm sure giving it a negative review will destroy my ranking, as all the petty people who can't stand to read a dissenting opinion will instantly push the &quot;unhelpful&quot; button, but no work of art deserves &quot;sacred cow&quot; treatment, so here goes.Sometimes I miss the old days when the goal of a writer was simply to tell a story, and the meaning that could then be extrapolated therefrom was due to universal symbols that came from deep within the writer's unconscious mind. With the advent of Freud's theories and modern psychology, writers became more &quot;aware&quot;, and as such, more consciously manipulative of literary elements such as symbolism and psychological depth in their creations. Beautiful works of immense psychological depth and universality have been the main result of this new awareness, but as Ursula LeGuin says, &quot;To light a candle is to cast a shadow.&quot; This new awareness in the modern writer has led to a brand of writing which is so consciously manipulative and heavily loaded with symbolism and double entendre that depth and subtlety are the first things to be sacrificed. It's like being able to see the hands of the puppeteer while watching a puppet show, or the cameramen in the background while watching a movie: the reader becomes aware of being manipulated for the writer's purposes, and the art of writing becomes a game in which the writer attempts to score points by being as &quot;deep&quot; and symbolic as possible. Ironically, the more the writer tries to be deep, the more shallow the writing becomes.Such is what I believe to be the case in Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot;. There is too clearly an attempt to be &quot;deep&quot; through the use of symbolism, to the extent that even the characters are symbols. I could not summon up a grain of empathy for any of the characters, the title character least of all. They are inhuman, fulfilling their respective symbolic functions and nothing beyond that. For example, I found it unrealistic that at the slightest questioning Sethe would launch into long stories of past experiences--it was too obviously the writer's way of grabbing the opportunity to inject more pain, more suffering, more symbols, rather than the spontaneous desire of the character to tell her story. Similarly, I found Sethe's loss of control over her bladder at the sight of Beloved's face to be, in a word, ridiculous...not to mention unbelievable.And let's be real here: Beloved is annoying. As a character she is flat and even vaguely revolting, as a symbol she is overdone. The &quot;poetical&quot; chapters with her and Sethe are some of the most blatant attempts to be deep that I have ever come across--and for that reason they fail utterly. That the pseudo-poetical writing should have won so much acclaim is an insult to those who can truly write poetically and are less appreciated. A combination of repetition, disjointed prose, and heavy symbolism does not make poetry; more often than not it makes bad writing.One of the central problems I had with this book was that it was based so entirely on a symbol: the ghost of Beloved and her coming back from the dead, for the simple reason that this device never rang true. Certainly magical realism has been done before, but that doesn't mean it's easy. In a story which is set in a world which is otherwise the same as ours, it's difficult to suspend disbelief enough to take the &quot;ghost&quot; theme seriously. The fact that all the themes of the book ultimately tie in to the ghost theme lessen the overall impact of the story.Certainly the suffering the characters go through is horrific, but if the reader is to actually feel their pain, the story must be believable and the characters must be real human beings. On both counts this book suffers. The writing does not handle reality on its own terms, and instead plunges into pseudo-mysticism and self-conscious symbols, both of which give the reader license to feel completely detached. The style of writing is itself almost painful to read, so much does it embrace the very worst of modern writing without its good points: almost every sentence is full of symbols, and the stream-of-consciousness style often does not sound as if any effort at all was put into it--as if having an editor would have detracted from its &quot;depth&quot;.This book addresses the noteworthy issue of black slavery, but the pseudo-mystical approach and heavy-handed symbols reduce it to a pretentious prize for pompous academics or a tear-fest for the overly emotional. If you do not fall into this category, you are advised to steer clear."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"When I was first assigned this book for summer reading in my AP English class, I believe my thought was, &quot;Darn.&quot; I did not expect to be uplifted by a story which I had heard described by upperclassmen as &quot;depressing&quot;, &quot;depraved&quot;, and &quot;confusing.&quot; But I was. Morrison attacks taboo subjects with taste, compassion and humanity. Although her treatment of time can become confusing, the reader who endeavors to understand this book will! This is not a light read for an airplane trip (learn from my mistakes, readers! When it's Beloved by Morrison or Pauly Shore in Biodome on the inflight movie...!), but rather a deep and thought-provoking read that requires many hours of somber solitude. There were parts of the novel that went over my head until my English teacher explained them to me, but I don't know if that is because of my young age or the depth of the book. However, you might want to take into consideration before spending money on the book that this is essentially a stream-of-consciousness novel, with many different facets and motifs. The book contains some really graphic subject matter, which is another thing to consider. However, this is what I consider the bottom line: This is a fantastic, although sometimes shocking and confusing, book. I believe that anyone who is mature and really tries to understand this book will be enriched by it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"BELOVED was one of many pieces of required literature assigned to me, in a university course, where we intensively studied broken treaties and equally broken people in global society. Numerous scholars, critics and professors often make this well-known and well-respected novel, by award winning writer Toni Morrison, when the topic of slavery depicted in modern literature is front and center. There is a good reason for that. BELOVED takes a haunting and heartbreaking look at the life of Sethe, an abused, emotionally maimed African-American slave whose own child, Beloved, was taken from her in such a heartless way. This ghost from Sethe's past continues to haunt her in everything she does. It isn't until she has a chance encounter with Paul, also a slave, that all of her demons are truly exorcised from her memory.I would agree that BELOVED is an important piece of literature worth reading, purely because it so acutely depicts the devastation and human cruelty that takes place in spades in the business of slavery and slave trade. Sethe is an example of many women who were truly broken down by their experiences as human beasts of burden. Slaves (African-American men, women and children alike) were reduced to machines (if not less than that) at the hands of evil and violent slave masters. The effects of brutal beatings, rapes and horrid living conditions ravaged an entire population of people whose predecessors have not forgotten the ancestral scars laid on their heads, backs, and memories (through story and continued sorrow). Why then do I only give BELOVED three stars and not five? For starters, there are passages in the book that could have been more compelling. Yes, I know that many Morrison fans will argue with me on this point to the grave. I don't blame you. I just feel that there were episodes in the story that I felt a tremendous disconnect from as a reader. I wanted so much to feel more engaged and connected. Instead, Morrison maintained a heavy-handed distance between her characters and the audience. It was painfully orchestrated, and I found that quite disappointing, since I believe that slavery is something we, as American people, must acknowledge and come to understand in a sensitive way, in order to recognize the historical damage we did a great population of people in this country. We must thank Toni Morrison, just the same, for her efforts to bring this painful part of our history to the foreground of our minds through this novel."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I gave &quot;Beloved&quot; 3 stars because it has a theme, which is always a good feature in a book as far as I'm concerned. &quot;Beloved&quot; looks at slavery not only in terms of physical restriction, but emotional restriction as well. It makes the point that slaves were not expected to have human emotions - especially love. Many times the characters tell of families split up, children lost, until they become afraid to love anything at all, except inanimate things that won't disappear (a tree, in the case of Paul D, a former slave). The book also talks about self-love, self-esteem and worth, which was denied them as well. Paul D oftens muses what it means to be a &quot;real man&quot;.The theme is illustrated in the actions of Sethe, a slave who has run away with her four children. She has been able to keep each one since birth, nurture it and love it. She loves them with all the more intensity because she herself has never really known the love of another person or love of herself. So when the slave catchers eventually track her down, she makes a drastic decision. Sethe knows that her children face emotional death at the hands of the white man, and she decides physical death would be kinder. She kills one of her toddlers &quot;out of love&quot;.This theme certainly got me thinking, as I believe it was true and valuable. But when I stepped back from the book, what bothered me about it was the way it was delivered. The undertone seemed to be dogmatic, intended to arouse shame rather than sympathy or understanding. Reading between the lines, I felt like an ignorant child that was being reproved and educated. The author assumed I was apathetic and ill-informed about what happened during the time of slavery in America, and therefore needed pointing in the right direction. So I found the presentation of the theme a little patronising.Also, the writing was on occasion confusing. Sometimes you had no idea who or what was being referred to, as Ms Morrison tried too hard to sound literary and symbolic. The characters, I felt, were little more than manequins on which to drape the book's message (can't spell, I know). They aroused no emotion in me at all - you would think sympathy for Beloved, killed at the hands of her mother, or for Sethe, forced to make the decision she did. Nope. Not at all. So read this book for the thought-provoking theme, but be prepared to be left feeling a little flat."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Heart -rending throughout and charged with emotion .

I personally view Morrison as a gift from God; though many people priase her for being the first African-American Nobel Prize in Literature Winner, I just have to recognize and silently praise her for being one of the few &quot;real&quot; teachers this planet has to offer.

If you want an easy read that doesn't challenge your mind and cause you to think about the book even after you've put it down, then don't read Beloved. Toni Morrison is one of the most amazing authors I have ever encountered and deserves nothing less than 5 stars for this amazing story about a freed slave's life after killing her child in order to keep her from the &quot;jaws&quot; of slavery.

It made me sorrowful for Sethe. She was a woman trying to protect her children from a horror which no one should experience. I asked myself&quot;would I have made the same decision?&quot; You may ask yourself too. I think everyone should give this book a try.

But that's not how the book is at all. Toni Morrison had to have wrote this book with such thought to be able to connect every thing so well. There were only a few parts that were hard to follow due to the way she didn't write every thing that was happening. Yet that was also the beauty in this book, poetry mixed with a terrifying story line. After I was done with the book I went back and read the first page and just went, &quot;Oh..&quot; In my AP English class, some classmates and I had to do a report on this book and we found some interesting connections with numbers. I recommend this book to all who are thinking of reading it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Let me tell you honestly, the first time I read this book. I hated it. It didn't make any sense to me, (I am sure many of you can relate), and I felt it very bland, not well thought out, strange, bizarre, etc... I did not think I would pick it up again until I got bored.Yes, I got bored, I had nothing better to do but pick up the book again. And that is when I started to see it for what it truley was. The book is NOT about slavery even though people claim it is. It is about the endurence of a human soul through times and tribulations, no matter how perplexed it may become. Pure talent wrote the book, it speaks for itself. Some people are just closed minded not to see the beauty, saga, and tragedy in the novel.For those people who claim that is was to hard to read, look at it this way. I am a ninth grader. Yes, the first time I read it. It was extremly bewildering. This is mearly natural in a book such as this. Only repatintion will make it form and develop its plot correctly.Yes, the vocabulary is difficult, but that does not make a book trash. I know I am going to get skinned alive by comparing Beloved to other books but honestly, think of the Canterbury Tales, and A Mid Summer's Night Dream. Do you honestly understand those books? They were written in English but not the English we use. Just because you can't understand a book doesn't make it trash. It just takes a bit more intellect to de-coded such language and only a true scholar would waste their time decifering the Knight's Tale and not read it over, not understand it, and automatically see it as boring and unattractive.And for those of you who have claimed to read the book in high school, I am a freshman myself so I have apathy for you. It is just a law of nature that if you read a book in school you will hate it. I have not meargerly enjoyed one book I have read from the Elemanatry school to High school. It is predestined that if someone tells you to read a book you will hate it becaue they told you to read it. For the unanswered questions, Beloved would not be Beloved without it. The book is not a guide that is supposed to explain every event in detail, why, when, how, who, and where it happened. That is why it is a novel. That is what makes a novel. Take the book Wuthering Heights, (I know you will skin me for using this comparision again) Was the love affair intended for Catherine and Heathcliff? Or Linton and Catherine etc..... a book is not suppose to go word to word in a shallow repitious manner explaning everything which would eventually dull the pace down to a stiff lumbering stroll. It is suppose to leave you with these questions and make sure everything makes sense to you.The way I see it, this is a book that you either hate or love. You you love it, great. If you hate it great. Its just your personal opinion and I can relate to both sides. Just keep in mind that we live in a society with no original art anymore, (this goes along not with just liturature, but music, poetry, etc...) and we are over stimulated with t.v.'s, computer's, videogames, and such materialist items. Not to say I agree with Oprah but not to down play her either, many people did find this good taste of liturature and I frankly agree with them. Yes, I am just a ninth grader but as a human I can see people's emotions about the book. By that standard, it is a Masterpiece in its own right."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Ms. Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot; is very similar to poetry. Poetry, as a medium, can be very selective in its audience. Some people &quot;get&quot; poetry, while others despise it. So, too, is &quot;Beloved&quot;. Ms. Morrison's novel is dense with beautiful language and meaning. There are passages that are very de-constructive. The reader is left with just bare words, sounds, even.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"A powerful book that resembles putting a puzzle together much more so than many so-called mysteries--you get a glimpse of the completed puzzle early on in the novel, as if you were peeking at the box top before dumping the pieces on the table, then you promptly forget it as you painstakingly examine each piece to try and put it in its proper place. Some pieces you have to pick up and put down again because you don't have enough of the puzzle created to understand where they go. And some pieces you just stare at endlessly, caught up in the vision of this small part of the picture that you might have ignored had you the whole thing in front of you. It is not a new way to write a novel, but Morrison's subject is aptly suited for such treatment.The subject, in case you have not followed some of the literature on this critically acclaimed novel and missed the movie, is slavery and its aftermath. Morrison's goal is the reconstruction of a slave narrative through the form of a novel. While I think that Morrison succeeds in this goal, I found that the novel was not quite as affecting as it could have been, mainly because it is set in 1873 and earlier. The effect of slavery in the U.S. is still with us today and, while Morrison recreates the past, it seems all too simple to dismiss it as the sins of our grandfathers.To return to the method used in the telling, which I was much more impressed by, Morrison's events benefit from the slow uncovering of the facts. Supposedly, the novel grew from a newspaper clipping that Morrison ran across (and the same, I'm guessing, that provides the climax of Part One). The clipping, as mentioned by the characters, was likely intended for the titillation and scandal of the white people who were its likely audience. By recasting the story in the manner which she does, Morrison saves it from its sensationalism and reveals it as the tragedy--for all involved--that it truly was.Finally, regarding the supernatural elements, I have to agree with the critics that link this novel to the tradition of South American magical realism. Why? Basically because the characters treat the fantastic only as another part of life--rather than questioning its existence, they embrace it or deal with it. Their attitude towards it is active. I'm somewhat interested in Morrison's other work, especially something set in the present, to see if this approach to fantasy is contained therein as well."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"\\"Beloved\\" was an intense book. Toni Morrison has once again succeeded with an extremely complicated story, one that most authors couldn't pull off with such ease. The book's main protagonist is an escaped slave by the name of Sethe. Sethe lives with her daughter Denver in Ohio, several years after the end of the civil war. One day Sethe and Denver receive a visitor by the name of Beloved, who doesn't know where she came from or even her last name. The story revolves around the complex relationship that forms between the three women and the terrible secrets that develop. \\"Beloved\\" is definfitely not an easy read, as I even had trouble understanding the basic story. Morrison often goes back and forth in the stream of consciousness and switches the narrator from a third person omniscent character, to Sethe, to Denver, to Beloved. Going back once or twice is a technique a reader will need to develop before venturing into this classic book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As nearly every reviewer of this book has commented, it is not an easy novel to get through. The plot meanders where it will and it can be difficult to even know who is talking at many points. However, there is method behind the madness. There are several extraordinarily moving scenes showing exactly how much slavery was able to cripple human beings emotionally, and also how even freed slaves were not necessarily united in solidarity all the time. My biggest complaint would be the distracting presence of the supernatural, especially at the outset of the novel. Also, it is very domestic, occurring almost entirely at the residence at 124 and focusing largely on the female characters. But select moments are so good that it is easily worth reading the book en toto just to experience them. Probably too difficult for young readers, or readers who do not like to be overly challenged by material. For those that want to put in the work, there is a serious payoff."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Actually, I gave the book 3.5 stars because there were good points to this book. 'Beloved' is very confusing to read as it jumps around, however, it draws the reader in and is compelling. As the book slowly describes everyone, each situation merges with each other opening way for an epic novel.Tantilizing and scary are ways to describe Morrison's intriguing outlook on the lives of slaves. It would have been nicer if not so many stories were twisted into one. When I read, I prefer to drift into a netherworld, not think about what I am reading.This book is good but not spectacular like so many people think. 'Beloved' is a much better read than viewing of the film disaster, however."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This recorded edition has got to be one of the best ever made. To hear the author's prize-winning prose in her own voice (yes, Toni Morrison has a great voice, and is a wonderful actress) is a rare treat. Who better to know how a sentence should be read? The book is a masterpiece. I've listened to it twice, read it in print once, and every time, I get something new out of the experience.A chilling ghost story, \\"not evil, just sad,\\" as the novel's heroine says early on, is interwoven with an insider's shattering view of the slavery experience, and brilliantly carried off. All in all, a triumph, and one of my all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison, you award writing Master!

Through all the circling narrative, we come to know the characters deeply. This novel contains tremendous emotional power that sends chills through your body. The subject of slavery alone is disturbing,and by presenting this subject through the eyes of Sethe,the main character whose life revolves around her past as a slave,gave me,the reader,a better perspective of the life she lead everyday. Morrison creates vivid images of the torture and agony Sethe endured as a slave into the minds of the reader with her riveting content and her unique use of language. This fictional story should be read with an open mind and with no real understanding for the characters' actions. Full of graphic scenes in which Sethe flashes back to her past, you can't help but feel pain in your heart for all the slaves who endured such anguish and abuse.Though the language and content in this novel left me astonished, I found myself getting lost numerous times throughout the entire book. Morrison does not warn the reader of a flashback told through the eyes of Sethe or introduce new characters into the story, so I found myself reading some parts of this book more than once. Morrison requires you to engage in the story, to pretend you are actually there. Overly dramatic and full of worn-out clich&eacute;s, I feel this story has been told many,many times before and while that does not diminish this tragedy,numerous clich&eacute;s do make this novel quite tiresome to read. Personally,the division of reality and a dream sequence does not appeal to me. However,I would still tell everyone to read this novel to form their own personal opinions."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I must say this book might be a powerful novel to others of the same view as Toni Morison. Although I find it intersting as how the book was written (the style) I find it very hard to keep up with Toni Morison in her description of slavry and love. Some details in the book made it intersting, ones that have little meanings but to show the way things are. The book did however, made me think about the life a slave lived back then, which i must admit, i never thought about it. Overall, if you are an excellent reader in &quot;highlevel&quot; novels, I'm sure you will find the book intersting SIMPLY becuase there are so many hidden meanings that I've failed to discover."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well, where do I start? I thought the book BELOVED was rather confusing. It was very difficult for me to grasp certain parts of it. And it was not something that I wanted to read in the first place. Which made it less appealing while reading. The book did not keep my intrest, wanting to read more because there were times when I would be reading and I would fall asleep. If you are going to read this book you'll need patience to better understand what is happening, I would say that you have to want to read it in order to enjoy it. And it would probably help if you read it more than once."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"It's a good thing I watched the movie before reading the book or else I wouldn't have known what the heck was going. I was stranded at a bus station in Philly and \\"Beloved\\" was the only book I had to read to pass away the time. Dull, dull, dull. Torture, torture, toture. I had to re-read each page more than once just to understand what was happening. This book is too long, too boring, and extremely overhyped. It leaves you braindead. I enjoyed \\"The Bluest Eye\\" more than this. Skip this book at all costs and watch the movie instead.

It had many moments of insight, like one only \\"loves small\\", because what one loves could be taken away easily. The main protangonists actually had an OK life under the old master. But freedom that depends on the mercy of other people is not true freedom. Sethe took to the extremes to protect her children because slavery is worse than death. She let Beloved sucked her life away, partly because she saw nothing of value in herself. Her children were her \\"best things\\", while she had been \\"dirtied\\". Another scar from her pervious experience. I can go on and on...But the characters never really reach across to me, as they seemed merely tools to serve a purpose. No, I'm not black.

The movie did nothing to promote or enhance Oprah and/or Danny Glover's acting career. After seeing the movie I do not want to read the book, and I am glad I waited. I went on the suggestion of Oprah. She stating she was able to relate the events in the book to her own life. That statement mystifies me. All I can say is, both she and Ms Morrison have severe psychological problems. The stem core of their problem is of a spiritual nature and deals with the occult. I had to wait until I was 54 years old to see Danny Glover's naked butt. The audience in the theater all responded negatively when he stood up naked, so my feelings were shared by others watching the movie. Not to mention the naked scenes of Beloved; especially her last act where she appeared pregnant and crazy. There are enough films that put blacks in a negative and deragotory light. This film did nothing to educate or depict blacks, as anything but a bunch of crazy fanatics. In talking with others who saw the movie, my feelings were not alone. In fact a radio station in Columbus, OH told its audience to save their money. I wished I had waited. Toni Morrison may be a wonderful and prolific writer, but I personally feel she deals too much with the occultic world and with Satan and his influences on people's lives. We all know Satan is all about killing, stealing and destroying, why help him in his work. The events that transpired could not have possibly occured, I am talking especially about Beloved being reincarnated. To believe any of the movie, even though it is a novel, you would have to be already possessed and need spiritual help. It shows you how much we need the Lord to return and to keep His promise."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this twice--once because I had to read it and once because I had to teach it.

I would not choose to teach it again and I would not recommend it. Maybe something else by Morrison (who I feel is an \\"okay\\" writer, but certainly not an American great) would do.Apparently, some people gush and gaa-gaa over this tome. Had I been the editor in charge or yea-ing or nay-ing it, there would not have been any reviews on it today.e"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved by Toni Morrison is set in the small town outside of Cincinnati, Ohio in the late 1800s. The novel shows some of the horrific events that happened because of slavery. Sethe, the main character, is the mother of four children and a run away slave. When her owner comes to find her and her children all she cares about is saving her children from slavery. Trying to save her children, Sethe kills her oldest daughter. After this event Sethe's sons leave, and it is only herself, her youngest daughter Denver, her mother-in-law Baby Suggs, and her lover Paul D left, until a mysterious girl appears at Sethe's home calling herself by the same name that appeared on her daughter's tombstone.Toni Morrison does a great job in showing you the theme of her novel: the fact that slavery was a horrible thing that caused many unforgettable events to take place, and that many people do not realize the extent of slavery. With the use of metaphors, allusions, flashbacks, symbolism, folklore, magic, and mysticism Morrison's Beloved requires very deep thinking and forces you to take the time to comprehend everything you read. The story line of the novel is very enjoyable, but some of the obscene language used and events described is almost enough to ruin the novel. If you can get past all the vulgarity, Beloved is a great story about slavery, but if you cannot I would not suggest reading it. The novel is very difficult to follow and comprehend, but if you just read the story as it is written and do not try to figure out what everything really means, you will enjoy the book a lot more."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is an amazing book. Reading it is both frustrating and enjoyable. The beginning of the story barely captured my attention as it described 124 and I couldn&#65533;t fully comprehend the events until a couple chapters later, but as I continued to read and attempted to put the past pages of the book together I really started to enjoy the book. The book&#65533;s description of slavery&#65533;s effect on the characters, both physically and emotionally was strong and clear. I am already familiar with the consequence of slavery on its victims but I have never read such a vivid piece of writing that instills such images of what these victims go through as they are deprived of the usual life-teaching experiences. Sethe, who&#65533;s love is shown as the strongest of all black slave women, can&#65533;t help but do what she thinks is the best for her &#65533;best thing&#65533;, which are her four young children. She knows nothing else but to try to kill them instead of seeing them endure slavery as she did.When I learned how Sethe had tried to kill her children and why, I was shocked. It showed how much the blacks despised slavery and to what great lengths they went to stop it from happening all over again.As a student blind of symbolism, I had a hard time deciphering or catching many of them. I was amazed at how much symbolism I could acquire through repetitive reading. Input from peers helped me a great deal in understanding the book through a figurative view.This book is the best educational trip I could ever experience in school. It was interesting, and kept my eyes glued to each page as the pieces of each character&#65533;s lives were pieced together. It may have been very hard to follow, actually one of the hardest books I ever read, but getting to the end without skipping pages is worth the head-thinking trouble."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a masterpiece. It definately deserves the awards it has receieved. It is a perfect representation of just enough mystery, pain, nuances, and intrigue to make a work extraordinary. Morrisons words can be seemingly light and idyllic at first glance, but an deeper look shows plenty of mystery lies beneath for you to discover. Her theme gives important emphasis to the remembrance of slavery and her characters provide moving accounts as well. Ultimately, a magnificent work of genius."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's Beloved is not her best book, but one in which she covers themes and a time period she hasn't written about before. Contrary to some , Beloved is not a novel about the institution of slavery. This is a novel about a woman and her family and the lengths she went through to make sure her children did not endure the horrors she did. This novel is also a bit of a ghost story which brings the supernatural theme into play. I think that Morrison's portrayal of the ghost Beloved was top-notch, making me wonder throughout the novel whether or not Beloved was really real. Although not one of Morrison's best novels, it is a terrifically written, thoroughly enjoyable novel based on a real-life person."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is not an easy book to read and requires a insightful mind to read it. It plays through the settings of slavery and family and the hardships of the times but it's hard to fully appreciate the book especially without understanding every aspect of those times. This novel creates ideas and tickles the curious mind to find out more on the subject or to try to relate today's problems with theirs. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend but to anyone who does have natural curiosity, this book might fit you."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book has made me realize that either I am not quite literate enough or I do not have a mature enough appreciation or respect for great literature yet. Especially after the whole hype on this book because of the movie, I thought it would be great to read, however, I found it to be very difficult to read. Overall, I think that this book will only be appreciated, if it is read a couple times. I guess for you to appreciate this novel, you would have to really understand the time, setting, and circumstances that the characters in the novel at that time were faced with."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I enjoyed reading Beloved. This does not happen much, but I found myself unable to the book down at some points. One problem I had though was that it is a pretty difficult book to read.

I did not really like the structure of of the book. I do not like books that start in the present or close to the present and then tell the past events through stories.

The story itself is very good but I would not recommend this to my friends or anyone else. Maybe when I get older I will appreciate this book a little more but for now I would say this book should be read by the older generation. It really isn't aimed towards younger folks. That is probably why the majority think of this book as confusing. I just would not go to a bookstore and buy this book. Other than that I would say this is a fairly decent book aimed at ages 25 and up. Try it out. You may like it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"As a reader you feel horribly confused throughout this entire novel. Beloved is a realistic fiction novel about a woman's struggles after being freed from slavery. Toni Morrison, the author, makes it almost impossible to understand what's going on. What made this novel confusing was: never knowing who is talking, having flashbacks at odd moments, and having a very local color language.The main character Sethe becomes haunted by the spirit of her deceased daughter and her troubled past. Beloved is a novel about a mothers heartache and if she raised her daughter right before she died. And if not was it too late to fix the past.When I read this book I got lost so many times. Sometimes you have to read things over and over again. Toni Morrison needed to break down her paragraphs into less complex sentences. Most of the paragraphs had too many ideas running through them. With all of these ideas there could be many different interpretations of this book.Don't read this book ever unless you have to. I would recommend reading The Grapes of Wrath any day over this."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is not an easy read. But no work of literature with its scope could be anything but complex. Morrison's prose is beautiful in all its disjointedness, but it is the characters in beloved that I am obsessed with. She has a Doestoevsky like mastery when it comes to populating her novels and this is most evident in Beloved. Paul D, Seth, Stamp Paid, Garner, Schoolteacher, Baby Suggs (holy) have been seared into my conciousness for all time. One could do a good deal of critical thiking about these individual characters for weeks and still be awed by them. For some reason I was intrigued by Baby Suggs (holy) and the scene after the large banquet in which the invited guests turn really resentful. It is probably the most intriguing and memorable scene in the book and culminates in the event around which the work is centered. INCREDIBLE!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison is a genius. Perhaps, those who have written bad reviews of this book are not in touch with the style of writing that Morrison uses in her literature. You don't just 'read' Toni Morrison. The words become a part of you. Her characters get under your skin. Her storylines, while to some may be far fetched, provoke your mind and imagination. I would, however, not recommend this to be the first Toni Morrison book for someone to read. You must first read Song of Solomon, that book changed my life."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"_Beloved_, like many of Ms. Morrison's books, seems to draw either magnanimous praise or slashing criticizm. Rarely, does it seem, has an author been so loved, or hated, by anybody. But if you love Toni Morrison, you probably love her for books like this, which sweep over you like a humid, summer breeze in the south. If you find the plot debatable, or think Faulkner is overrated, don't bother with this, or any of her books. They're not for you. Personally, I think this stands behind only _Song of Solomon_ as her finest hour. The characters get to you right from the start, and the suspense builds throughout. Call her overhyped, call her underpraised, but Toni Morrison is a damn good writer, and this is one of her best."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Noble Prize in Literature for Beloved...I don't get it! The characters are well developed, but the story so far fetched. I could not relate to it. I enjoyed it in the beginning, but disliked it the more I read.

I read Beloved two and a half years ago, and my mind still shakes when remembering the journey. With relatively accessible vocabulary, simple sentence structures, and shockingly deep understanding of a reader's mind, Toni Morrison weaves a story that takes the reader down a vortex to the center of the deepest layer of our selves. In her most remarkable passages, Ms. Morrison solders her characters' shocking, horrific actions with lines illustrating their undeniable humanness. By simply, but honestly placing our most human drives within breathing room of our most hideous actions, She forces the reader not only to feel the characters in himself, but also to acknowledge his own potential for great love/horror/shock/beauty/magnificence. This feat alone makes her a groundbreaking author - the fact that she does this with language that makes you want to shout it aloud agian and again , ...wow."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I've read Beloved twice and I feel it's one of the greatest books ever written. Beloved is not an easy read, but it's an amazing book. Toni Morrison tells the story of Sethe, an ex-slave that killed her child, so the child won't have to be a slave. After a mysterious stranger comes that will force Sethe and those around her to discover the secrets that lie within them and face the past. Beloved is the tpe of read that involves the reader with the character and story. Toni Morrison shows the reader why slavery was such a disgrace and what it did to African-Americans that had to suffer. It's power will move you, It's brutality will shock, and the expierence of reading it will haunt you forever. I love this book and I will reread again along with future generations."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"BELOVED is a riveting, powerful account of slavery that put me as a reader in the place of a newly freed slave... Though I am a young, middle class, Caucasian girl, I felt what Sethe, Denver, Baby Suggs, and even Beloved felt... I understood their actions and the emotions that motivated them. I believe this effect to be a great victory for an author, for people fear what they do not understand... If an author can bring understanding to his or her readers, then they truly have - and give - a great gift."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I liked the book &quot;Beloved&quot;. Toni Morrison worked very hard on this book. She collected most of her information in South America. The States probably destroyed most of the factual documents written about slavery after the Civil War. As a nation, we were probably embarassed that such things did go on. Toni Morrison based this book on a very small article that she had found. The article was about a fugitive slave woman that was found. Rather than let her children be subjected to slavery, she killed them and then killed herself. Most early documents on slavery that did survive passed the Reconstruction of the South down played the creulty in slavery. This article lead her to believe that slavery was much worse than how it was portrayed in the history books. When Sethe killed Beloved, and tried to kill the other children, she wasn't abandoning them, she was trying to protect them from epocolipse that was riding into town on horseback. She didn't want her daughters to be corrupted by some slave master. She didn't want her sons to have their youth taken away from them, they would grow weak and old like an aged gray mule. Anything is easier than slavery, including death. Beloved misunderstood what her mother was trying to do for her. Sethe tried too hard to apologize, in my opinion. Beloved punished her mother far worse than what was nesseccary. Sethe was trying to protect Beloved from a life that she did know. Beloved made her own mother her slave just because of a misunderstanding."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"While it is impossible to compile a definative list of the best fiction of the 20th century, I would have to say that Beloved is one of the greatest literary accomplishments of our times. A deeply complex novel, Beloved should only be read by those willing to be moved by literature. Anyone seeking cheap entertainment or romantic fluff should look elsewhere. Beloved provides no easy answers, but it's the questions that make you think. Questions about slavery, love, and the nature of religion can be found here. And all of Morrison's ideas are wrapped around the most realistic characters I have ever come across. Beloved is, simply put, an amazing gift."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"We just finished reading Beloved, by Toni Morrison in my junior English class. I really enjoyed it, but many of my classmates couldn't stand it, and found it very offensive. I didn't find it one bit offensive because it gave me a totally new veiw on slavery, a veiw which you can't get from just reading a text-book. Morrison did an excellent job expressing how horrid slavery was. She may have used some vulgar language, but it was the only way to get across the point as strongly as it needs to be said. I really enjoyed this, and I am in the process of writing an essay to text on this book, and it is hard, because the book is hard, but what literature isn't. I am writing the paper on the reference to shadows in the novel, and if anyone has any ideas or comments about shadows please feel free to write me! Thanks! If you haven't read Beloved, read it, you'll love it! :-)"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I take nothing away from Toni Morisson's ability to write, she is exceptional. Her style of writing is just not one that I enjoy reading. Beloved's subject matter is important but Morrison's message is so obscured by the sentimentality and ambiguity of her narrative that I feel this is a book written more for Morrison than the reader. I can see why some love it and others hate it. Personally, I found the 'payoff' for the energy spent deciphering this book to be disappointing. Would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Terrible book, confusing, disgusting, disturbing. Very hard to follow. A waste of my time and eyesight. Cliffnotes are at least 1000 times better than the book itself. Waste of paper."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is what annoys me the most about Toni Morrison: she has a very rich, unique writing style, which i love and admire, but I can't stand how she uses it more to showcase how skillful she is as a writer than at actually telling a good story. The story in itself is fascinating; instead of letting it stand on its own merit, Morrison instead wants to drown it with a confusing narrative, with characters that are completely unrealistic and not the least bit relatable (or human), and constantly shoves so much figurative language, symbolism, etc. to the point of nauseum. Why take such a wonderful plot and make it so complicated and practically incomprehensible? Less is more. If Ms. Morrison could have kept it more simple, instead of trying so hard to make it so confusing, complicated, disturbing, and over the top, I could have truly appreciated this book. I really tried liking it, and in general, I try really hard to like Toni Morrison, but every book I read from hers I feel like it takes harder to get through than necessary, considering that the plot is so simple. It aggravates me to no end. After reading Beloved, I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not a Morrison fan. Great, talented writer, but focuses more on her writing style than at actually telling a good story that people can actually follow and understand."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read it in print 4 times. When my book club elected to read this and selected me to lead it, I decided to buy it in audible format to get another dimension to my 5th time through it. Toni Morrison reads, and while she is an amazing wordsmith, she isn't really an audio book actress. So, I really understand some people's comments about it being hard to listen to. I sort of agree with you. If you want to read this book (or need to for school) please start with a print copy. While I found the inflections Morrison brings to the characters SHE created, I don't think that the first time through this book should be in audible form. (also, please don't go see the movie...it should never have been made) While these characters are forever etched into my memory and in some ways, my entire being, if this would have been my first time through Beloved, I may not have liked it. To listen to Morrison's voice after hearing my own interpretations of the voices in my head for so many year, it is a great treat for me. If it has been several years since you last read Beloved and you want to rediscover it a new way, I recommend this version completely."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I listened to the audiobook version with Toni Morrison as the reader. The story was written in a very tedious matter. The content of the story was very disturbing, overall not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Here is a shockingly raw story that could only be told so completely by Toni Morrison's unique brand of lyricism. This book is more than a tutorial on the atrocities of slavery. It is a jagged look at the power of fear, intimidation, guilt, shame, and how we can be haunted mercilessly by our pasts. It is also a story of the redemptive power of love and forgiveness (beginning with onesself). The movie Beloved follows the story line, dialogue, and symbolism almost verbatim. It's a great visual to enhance this book that should be read again and again throughtout the years. I think the reader will be surprised by their burgeoning understanding of this powerful work."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison could possible be the greatest woman writer I have ever read. This novel takes on a different meaning every time I read it--since September, I've been through it and dissected the different parts 6 times---It was life-changing as far as my reading-life because I could feel the longing of a mother for her child as well as the child for her mother come off of the page. As to the infanticide, it was a tough issue but the book was not centered on passing judgement on the act. Instead, Morrison only concentrated on the characters, their inner lives, how they dealt with adversity and with being oppressed on so many levels. Morrison said in an interview regarding BELOVED that she was not concerned with the oppressor, but with the oppressed--what they do with their lives after the tragedies, how do they survive? These are the real questions Morrison grapples with and there is not a neat and tidy ending to the book--the reader is able to engage himself/herself and to come up with his/her own interpretation. I can only say as to the slavery dilemna in the book and the question of what freedom really is: it is the most disturbing, liberating, educational, and moving depiction of the struggle to \\"claim oneself\\" that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well, just finished this book and, as with movies, believes one of the best judges of worth is its sticking-ability. Some books like some movies I can hardly remember after reading, even many that I enjoyed at the time. Lightweights. What could be more meaningful than a book that changes you? Don't think I'll think about those past times the same again (as a white). The idea of slavery, of higher caste in general and what it means. A man reduced to worrying about a rooster smiling at him as a challenge to his manhood.Now, admittedly, it was rough going in parts because it became stream of consciousness off and on, was very confusing to me at first (I read nothing about the book before and did not even know the author or that she was black) and the general background buzz about the book probably caused me to plug on. Don't know. But this I think and it's a high recommendation. It's a sticker."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I often regret how little I was made to read as a teenager, but times like this I am so grateful that I waited until adulthood to read Beloved. I don't believe this book would have touched me half as much if I was not a mother and a wife.I was amazed at my reaction to the words on the page. The authors words are often matter of fact when describing horrific events that it was not until I reflected on them I was brought to painful tears. It has stirred me to think about so many other issues not related to the main subject such as abortion, adoption, my darling husband, being merciful, loving the life before you, our responcibility to our fellow man.This book is well worth your time to read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"At the center of this novel is a house that is infused with the memory of what is too painful to be remembered and what is so important that it cannot be forgot. Sethe and Paul D are people who have both survived slavery though at a heavy cost. Both had to flee their homes and everything that was familiar because \\"home\\" is not completely \\"sweet\\" as its name wishes to make it but then again it is not all sour. Both have been raped. Now, together, they are trying to find a way to look to the future. Paul D is constantly pressing to this end in his naturally patriarchal way, but he is stopped in his progression to make a home by a spiritual invocation that is nothing less than a living memory: Beloved. The make-shift idealistic home is not a proper enclosure for memories that are so terribly large. Lost somewhere in the middle is Denver who has been raised on the retelling of these memories. Through her a process of recreation takes place that elevates the memories of her mother to a present time through oral storytelling. Beloved subjects all the characters to a trial that forces them to look at the past that they alternately avoid and wallow in.The true power of this novel is created in the skilful way it is constructed by Morrison. Never fully in the past, never fully in the present and never looking through just a single pair of eyes. The reader is shifted constantly through time and perspective in a way that makes you feel you are really experiencing the chaos and painfully disordered lives of the characters. You may feel at first what a lovely thing it is that this baby has returned to her mother to create a second chance for them all, but she turns out to be a troubled presence though not an entirely sinister one. The community that rises together to expel her do not have bad intentions, but their intentions are not pure. This is the deep complexity of the novel because the characters are trapped in these paradoxes of aspects to their past and identity that are not all good and not all bad, but work against each other to make existence a painful thing to live with. Somehow, through this, the characters are expected to construct a life for themselves that doesn't let itself be clogged by the onslaught of a difficult past. This is the message for the present day readers who find it so easy to forget and need to find a way to live with a painful awareness of what really happened in our history."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In a discussion I had recently about this novel, Morrison's 5th, we were considering whether or not it deserved the acclaim that it has received. I personally did not like this novel as much as some of Morrison's other works. Perhaps I have been reading too much Morrison (is that possible?) but I really believe some of her other works deserve more acclaim than Beloved. Morrison is a wonderful writer. She is a true master at her art, but when Beloved was released she was at the top of her popularity. Is it possible that it was her critical acclaim and not necessarily the book that won her the Pulitzer? Thank goodness we have women to write as Morrison does, but I wouldn't say reading Beloved alone can give a person a true appreciation of her complexity. It's a start, but a truly interested reader should not stop there."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is an amazingly confunsing and thought provoking tale of slavery in America and the struggles that surrounded this dreadful institution. Toni Morrison presents the reader with a compelling portrail of slavery and the triumph of the human spirit. In writing this novel, Morrison allows her audience a chance to see the human side of the slaves and compells the audience to become one with the slaves, vicariously through her words."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a unique novel in that the events do not take place chronologically. The story is told through flashbacks and often confusing dream sequences, especially from the point of the main characters, much like Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club. The story takes place during the age of slavery and the story revolves around Sethe and her troubles. I felt that this book was not an easy read, and through all the flashbacks, memories, and nightmares it was sometimes hard to distinguish what was real and what wasn't."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morisson's novel Beloved is filled with bittersweet emotion. How eloquently expressed is the torture of a mother's love and the pain of slavery. The picture of Sethe's love and life is so fully painted, that we can taste her blood and sweat. Those who have never experienced the degradation of slavery get a glimpse and its sinister reality. Toni Morrisson's Beloved is genius."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is one of the strangest stories I have ever had the ability to read. It starts in a very disturbing manner with the story of a slave woman who kills her child to protect her from the life the child's mother was forced to live. Her daughter then comes back from the dead to be with her. The story is a wonderful dipiction of the social distruction that can be caused by slavery. It is very well written and the author has a wonderful and unique stile."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I thought this novel was very good. IT shows a lot about the difficulties that slaves went through. It was confusing at first, i had to read a couple chapters over a couple of times to fully comprehend it. BUt as you read, you can see that the author does a great job. It's one of those books that touch you. For a better understanding see the movie. My advice is to see the movie first..in order to get some background data and then read the book. Try not to read the book before seeing the movie..you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I THOUGHT BELOVED WAS A WELL WRITTEN BOOK. IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON BUT ONCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY INTERESTING. BELOVED INCLUDES THE STRUGGLES WITH SLAVERY AND THE WAY FAMILIES HAD TO SUFFER. I DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE BOOK UNTIL I TALKED IT OVER WITH MY CLASSMATES. I HAD TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE STORYLINE BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T I MISSED SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Well having read this book twice I should have nothing to say. But on the contrary. I believe that this story is one of the best that I have read about slavery and the struggles. Morrison depicts true human nature and has vivid descriptions of her ideas. I do not believe that Oprah should have made a movie about this book because there are a lot of things that might not be understood from the viewing of it. But when you read it you are there in the shoes of every character feeling thier pain and sorrow. I feel that this book has given me a larger perception of the world and the cruelty and chaos that emits from this earth."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved gets my nomination for the most overpraised work of literature in recent years. P.C. or not, I question whether the work would have received a fraction of the accolades had it not been written by an otherwise very talented African-American woman, but admit it: Beloved is ponderous and rather dull. One can sympathize intensely with the suffering of the type of people portrayed without agreeing that the book is particularly entertaining. A must-read only for those who feel they &quot;must.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I first pulled Toni Morrison's book off the shelf of a used bookstore and thought -- I'd really like to read this. Then in getting busy, I had forgotten I had it, until the film was released. By that time, I had forgotten anything I ever knew about what the story was about. So I went to the film as a virgin, and was emotionally, intellectually, and virtually completely pulled into a story so intense and touching, that I have now found it hard to escape. I am back to the book (which I bought again, not knowing for sure where the original book was). I feel like Beloved with her candy and sweets, I can't get enough, and each time I think about it (which is several times a day) I understand and feel more. What a tremendous writer Ms. Morrison is -- unbelievable. And I must say that Ms Winfrey's dedication to doing the film version appears a pure and sincere as I have seen under the circumstances. Anyone who can play that role has a lot of unstated feeling and depth we will unfortunately never know. I look for ward to the audio version, with Ms. Morrison, and Lynn Whitfield as being yet another venue I can explore with my loving obsession. Thank you, and...BRAVO ALL!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book shows just how vain mankind can become. It demonstraights that if we as a people, are to servive on this world we must work with each other. We nor can anybody think that we are beter than someone else just because we don't understand them, because we have not took the time to learn about their culture. This book shows how anybody in this circumstance would act and even feel, It does not matter what color you are. We would all act the same way. If we the people in this country want to progress and move foward, then we must learn from our past mistakes and change. This book makes it clear that the first step is to understand each other, not to put someone down just because we don't understand them. We must communacate with each other, learn about each other, and togsther strive to build a better future for everyone. That I belive is what Toni Morrisn Is trying to say in this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I enjoyed reading Beloved. This does not happen much, but I found myself unable to the book down at some points. One problem I had though was that it is a pretty difficult book to read. However, it was deeply emotional and was one of the most orginial stories i have ever read. I respect that a lot in books. Read Beloved, because you are not going to find anything else quite like it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I thought the book was very interesting. I did not really like the structure of of the book. I do not like books that start in the present or close to the present and then tell the past events through stories. I thought that the storyline was very interesting though. The fact that the book was a little vague in some parts made it a little difficult to understand but also gave the reader something to think about and figure out. Overall it was a fairly good book with an interesting concept."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book definetly contains alot of atmosphere. You truly feel the pain and fear that the characters are feeling in the novel. However, I never really got into the novel, but that was probably because the mixture of family and slavery did not interest me. The characters are well developed. The voices of the characters are highly impacting. The emotion in the voices and the story is also something most readers will enjoy in this book. The book is not exciting, and it is not an absorbing page turner. The storys leave little to the imagination and don't contain much action. This is a book for somebody who wants to study human emotion and the horrors of slavery."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"What were some of my reactions to this book? Well at first I really didn't like it, because it confused me alittle. but once I got into it I kind of started to enjoy it. Really like how they had the ghost in the book. I thought that it was cool because it was Denver's baby. The book kept me interested in the middle. At the begging I thought about getting a new book, because it was a such a slow start. I guess that overall though that I would recommend this book to someone. But they would have to stick with it. Thanks for your time!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Tony Morrison's Beloved isn't a quick read. It isn't a book one canpick up and put down sporadically, once you're in, you're in. The tale begins with the history of 124, a small house inhabited by Baby Suggs and her daughter-in-law, Sethe and her children. Sethe and her children made the perilous journey to freedom, which lasted a glorious twenty-eight days before the bounty hunters come to reclaim them. That's when the real story begins.... It takes you on the journey of Paul D., the only man strong enough to love and accept Sethe with all of her history. The reader is introduced to the joy and strength of Baby Suggs and the devotion of Denver, the surviving daughter. This is a story of the human heart, sometimes joyful, mostly painful, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved- Though I'm not thoroughly complete with the book, I feel the book is very interesting but wouldn't be for anyone without an imaginative or open mind. Because you can become lost in the book, at times from different places the story likes to pick up, there's a plenty of flashbacks which cause you to lose track in the story. The characters place a strong appeal to the story, whom draws you into the book. I would recommend this book to someone who has an open mind wouldn't think the phenomna is possible in the book. This book is not to long but it has a strong story. The story is nice and strong but it doesn't bore you with sub-stories, some of the flashbacks are pretty ok as well."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The book BELOVED was very well written the style Toni Morrison used was confusing at first, however became a page turner the second time around. The book may have been more effective if it was a little more plainer to read. Sethe one of the main characters encapsulates the slave mentality to a tee! Each step Sethe made was felt by the reader.The role of Paul D was the perfect complement to Sethe, he represented the life she could have had. In conclusion: OUTSTANDING!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The person from Moscow who reviewed this book obviously misunderstood the most important idea behind the story. Beloved didn't return from the dead because of love. She was borne out of the deep guilt that Sethe indured each and every day of her life."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I thought it was a very well written book that can be extremely disturbing and yet very intimate. It will bring out emotions in you that you did not even kow that you had. Though it was hard to follow, it is possible to understand and I recomend that everyone reads it at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I decided to read Beloved as part of a personal campaign to improve the &quot;quality&quot; of books I was reading - or at least to seriously broaden my horizons. I must admit I approached it with some trepidation. I thought that Toni Morrison would be difficult to read, too female-oriented or just plain boring.Of course, as with all great writers, she's nothing of the sort! The language is really beautiful and poetic. The characters in this, what amounts to a ghost story, are extremely well developed. Toni builds the story, eaking parts of each character's history out - leaving us guessing, wondering, wanting more information. At first this can make for some difficult reading as it's not entirely clear in the first chapter just what is going on. But stick with it, it will pay off in the end."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I wrote essay after essay about how wonderful this book is for my college English class this past semester. It's is incredibly hard to understand, but that is what makes it such a good read. The layers that Morrison provides makes you really think about history, about the past, and how lucky you are. If after reading this book you don't understand it, I suggest heading to your local library or the internet, finding some books and articles where Toni was interviewed about this book, and really discovering how many symbols overlay other symbols. It will leave you gasping in amazement, in horror, and reach into the depths of your soul. I have gone back time and time again to read a passage newly illuminated to me. One of the most fabulous books of our time that will be a classic, standing strong beside the likes of Plato, Erasmus, and Dickens."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a powerful story about a former slave, Sethe, and her struggle to overcome her past. Sethe's past haunts her and forbids her from ever leading a &quot;normal&quot; life. Ever since Sethe escaped slavery she and her daughter Denver have been trying to live a &quot;normal&quot; life in Ohio. Many years earlier Sethe murdered one of her children, a girl, so that the child would not be sold into slavery. In the house that Sethe and her daughter live in a ghost disrupts their lives. Sethe and Denver believe that that ghost is Sethe's murdered child. Later in the story, a young woman shows up at Sethe and Denver's home. The young woman goes by the name of Beloved. Sethe and Denver take in the young woman and she stays with them. It is not until later in the story that Denver figures out who the girl is, but she does not know exactly what the young woman wants. The girl causes many disruptions in the household. Sethe's past is mainly told through flashbacks that take place throughout the novel. Toni Morrison avoided using &quot;flowery&quot; words to describe events in Sethe's life. By doing this, she makes the story sound very realistic. Beloved is the most unique book that I have ever read. Just when you think that you have figured out the story another twist occurs in the plot.

This was and is the first time I saw a supreme majority of students become engrossed with a single book without any complaints, other than &quot;That part was confusing&quot;.The key to this mind-shattering book is understand one thing: time is relative. Back, forth, back again, to the future, and all the way back. Things echo over the course of &quot;Beloved&quot;, like time, pain, and the seeds that grow from them when they grow wild and are ignored. (that last part was a hint in understanding it, to let you know)"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book artisticly shows the horrors of slavery and the culture that came from it. In flashbacks you see a lighter side of slavery mixed with the poingent heavy side. 124 was alive with people, escaped and freed slaves. Their culture and their lives revolved around their family, their freedom, and the spirit the church brought on. Morrison shows the desperation of the slave situation by writing about how a mother would kill her own children in order to keep them from going through slavery. A powerful and masterfuly writen novel."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was one of the most amazing books that I have ever read. It pulled on my soul and made my heart skip a beat. The main character of this story, Sethe, is such an amazing character that you both hate and relate to her situation at the same time. An ex-slave that escapes with her three young children to safety, Sethe, is amother that I believe anyone can blieve in. When her ex-owners come to bring their \\"property\\" back, this amazing women actually kills one of her children and tries to kill her other three in an atempt to save them from the horrid life of slavery. Although it seems very difficult to relate to such a gruesome crime Toni Morrison makes you feel that you would do the same thing in an instant for your own child. And whem you thought that this was all that you could take the baby that Sethe illed come back as a ghost and you can't figure out why. I kw it is a little hard to believe in ghosts and such things like that, but Toni Morrison does a tremendous job describing the unthinkable ad crazy life of this woman,Sethe, and her children.

Though the general theme of the book became clear about midway, most of the fact presentations were disjointed and unclear.

The author really should have considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages. I wouldn't recommend this book too highly to anyone, and as far as Oprah's recommendations, I haven't yet found one worth it's salt."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Rough and not to easy to read, another fine work from Toni Morrison. A way becomes many, a house hunted becomes the residential place of our guilts and pains. One of Morrisons more complex novels, she takes us with no mercy but with sublime beauty towards the inner senses of a lost soul.Every single soul that lives a live charged with uncertainty and no peace. I want to transcribe one of the most beautiful lines i ever read: &quot;Let your mothers hear your laughs&quot;...&quot;let the grown men come&quot; &quot;let your wives and your children see you dance...&quot; Finally she called the women to her. &quot;Cry&quot;, she told them, &quot;For the living and the dead.

Some people seemed to find the video confusing, but of course the book is the whole story, and answers any questions you may have had from the video. Anyway, WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. What a beautiful, awful, powerful story it is. It made me look with awe and respect at the next beautiful black face I saw; awe at the strength they have despite the history they carry. Everyone should read this book AND see the video. Thank you Ms. Morrison; and thank you Ms. Winfrey, from the bottom of my heart, for a truly thought-provoking experience."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Morrison writes lyrically with a style that seems effortless. Truly worthy of a Pulitzer, unlike others labeled with those prizes which seem to be doled out haphazardly at best. All the characters are believable, fallible, and lovable. The movements from one p.o.v. to another are seamless and gentle. The setting is painfully honest and wrenchingly defined. My only problem is that now I feel overcome with a sense of communal guilt for every injustice foisted upon all mankind. This is the first of Morrison's books I've read. All my friends, buy your own."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The first few chapters were hard for me to get into because they jumped from past to present back to past again without a lot of the preparation or transitions you find in many works of fiction. But I decided to persevere. I'm glad I did.I empathized with Sethe when I read that her baby had been murdered and that Sethe had traded the use of her body for her daughter's headstone. But I began to really understand Sethe, empathizing with her even more when it was revealed that she had murdered her baby, and tried to murder her other children, because she wanted to keep them from the &quot;soul murder&quot; of slavery--the kind of murder her own soul obviously didn't survive.Far from condoning infanticide, Ms. Morrison amazingly managed to make the murder understandable while still showing the terrible effects that Sethe's act had on the rest of her life and her future relationships--including her relationship with her surviving daughter.Although I will admit there were a few passages I didn't quite &quot;get,&quot; overall the raw lyricism of this book's language stunned me, offering phenomenal insight into each character.To me, this book is about more than the effects of slavery--although I have yet to read a more moving, insightful account--it's about the basic human need to keep the depths of our souls inviolable."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison once again presents us with one of the finest examples of writing in recent history. She is one of our few authors who instills meaning into every single word and punctuation mark she puts on paper. This story is a window into the horrible depths to which a mother will go to protect her children. It also provides a very personal account of the consequenses of slavery, which many people in modern society tend to overlook. Miss Morrison will not allow us to do so."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book is one of the most important books ever written, in my opinion. It will change you. My heart aches for these characters. I so long to go back in time and protect them."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's works of literature are not for the average person. Her use of literary techniques are incredibly brilliant and if not for the advanced Literature classes I have taken in college, I would not \\"get it\\" either. I have read The Bluest Eye 3 times and Beloved twice. She is my favorite author by far, but do not pick up one of her books and expect to be entertained. The literary techniques she employs are quite effective in bringing to life a very powerful subject and no one does this better than Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"My biggest complaint with this book was the formatting that was used for the Kindle Edition. Instead of breaking it down into three parts with individual chapters in between, they chose to split the book up into three chapters.

(who were at Sweet Home together). The story is told in a chaotic mess of poetry, memories, and present day action that ends presenting only more mystery. Many parts of the novel however, seem too gruesome. Although the descriptions are of slavery and slavery deserves to be seen for what it truly is, Morrison could have left more to the imagination. Overall though, I enjoyed the novel and all it represented."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a novel by Toni Morrison. The plot follows Sethe, an escaped slave living in post civil war Ohio, with her daughter Denver. They are visited by one of Sethe's old friends, Paul D, and a stranger who goes by the name Beloved. Sethe is haunted daily by her past, which takes the form of a ghost, until Paul D arrives. When he comes to stay, every fear of Sethe vanishes until the arrival of Beloved, a mysterious girl who reminds Sethe of her dead daughter. As the plot progresses, Beloved slowly moves Paul D out of the house and then terrorizes Sethe and Denver. I enjoyed the ending of the novel; however, parts of the novel confused me.The most confusing part of the novel is Morrison has one of the characters named \\"Beloved\\". She also uses a sentence, \\"Be loved\\". \\"Beloved\\" is when a person is greatly loved by or held in high regards by someone; however, to \\"be loved\\" means to feel acceptance or closeness. Morrison also talks about various types of love in the novel; (1) a mother's love to her children, (2) the love of one's siblings, (3) the love that is shared between friends, and (4) the love felt between couples. Most people my age have yet experienced all these forms of love. This brings another question to mind, why would she mention all of these types of love when most people won't understand all of them? So with all of these thoughts of love in the novel, it is extremely difficult to pin down the meaning to Morrison's \\"Beloved\\".There are many literary techniques used in Beloved; one of these is symbolism. There are several examples of this with words such as \\"tin can\\" and \\"turtles\\". A \\"tin can\\" in someone's chest can be a harden heart. A \\"turtle\\" has a hard shell, which can represent a shield or fortress, protection from the world. All aside, Toni Morrison does an excellent job at her craft, yet will confound an inexperienced reader such as myself."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I believe the book Beloved by Toni Morrison was somewhat interesting. I had to expand my mind in order for it to be interesting. The setting was believable because of the story having to do with slavery. You have to have an imagination to set the big picture. The plot was believable for that time period that the book was set in. In my opinion I relate to the characters in no way, shape or form. This book would be good for a teenage reader wanting to expand his/her mind. Read it. It's great."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I did not enjoy this book. Try The Color Purple instead."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Yes, Toni Morrison is an American icon. And I'm probably blaspheming when I say this, but the audio tape of BELOVED, which I tried playing as I drove to and from work, is a menace to society. I had to turn it off--could have killed someone else or myself. I found it that hypnotic. Morrison's voice is sort of a forced whisper. Dare I say a monotone? The story itself is all right, but I found it rather uninspired. Obviously the author has an axe to grind about the way African-Americans were treated in the days of slavery (whom among us wouldn't, especially those of African heritage?), but I thought the artifice of using a ghost as a means of addressing the evils of slavery rather far-fetched. In a lot of ways, I think it detracted from the harsh reality that caused the apparition (a child who died as a result of the sick practice of slavery), to exist in the first place. I don't mind a plot with twists and turns, but this book takes forever to get anywhere, drags us through countless descriptive brier-patches, over a virtual nine-man's morris just to arrive at a point we can see before we start the circuitous journey.I like poetry as much as anyone, and admire the judicious use of it in a novel, but hour after hour of it, especially whispered at the listener with little variance of tone or pitch, is better off played at bedtime as a substitute for counting sheep than in a moving vehicle."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book is beautifully written and has a powerful message.

There is no subtly in this work, and she often is too indirect when she needs to be direct, and too blunt when she shouldn't be. To compare her writing to that of Garcia-Marquez is to the the later a grave injustice."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Ghosts, slavery, murder, and a woman battling her past. Toni Morrison ties all of these elements together into the mosaic called Beloved. Morrison's work flourishes with literary techniques that bring the story to life, but occasionally throw the reader into a spiraling confusion because of its occasional anachronisms and chronological imbalances. The intertwining story gets under your skin and tempts you to ponder thoughts and issues Morrison illustrates through factors such as symbolism or her own personal style. Brilliantly written, Morrison unveils the life of Sethe, a woman haunted by her past of slavery, hardship, and murder. Ohio, plagued by post-civil war corruption and graft, is where Sethe tries to raise the remainder of her family in 124, a structure haunted by the ghost of her child. The child whose throat she slit in order to prevent her from enduring the same torture of slavery, the child for whom she exchanged ten minutes of sex to give a decent title on her grave stone, the child who comes back to poison and corrode Sethe's own being and destroy her hope. Symbolism erupts in constant allusions to Sethe's enslaving past and her memories of the trials she endured. Just the simple task of describing Sethe's wedding dress becomes a maze of symbolism to the difficulties of the past. Sethe, determined to have a different dress on her wedding day, searches for scraps of fabric which could be borrowed to creatively construct a dress that only would have to be taken apart and later returned. &quot;Now the back was a problem...I couldn't find a thing that wouldn't be missed right away&quot; but finally a piece of mosquito net used as a jelly strainer was sufficiently allotted for the task. This refers to Sethe's life and her struggle for escape from the monotonous torture of slavery. Her bits and pieces of experiences and tragedies were not even her own but merely lent to her, forcing her to suffer and learn about hardship. Her past, a time of monotonous torture which she tries with her utmost might to cover up, puts all her efforts to no avail as she cannot hide a past which will always be visible despite her attempts to disguise it. Another evident symbol is Paul D's tobacco tin, which he uses as a prison for harboring his own past. He does not want to remember the hardships of the slavery he endured so he keeps all of his memories locked away in his tobacco tin, rusted shut, forbidden to be opened. He &quot;never worried about his little tobacco tin anymore. It was rusted shut.&quot; However, it is in the weak moment of Beloved's seduction that his guard is let down and he gives in. When he calls her name, he doesn't hear &quot;the whisper that the flakes of rust made...as they fell away from the seams of his tobacco tin. So when the lid gave he didn't know it.&quot; He couldn't prevent his past from resurfacing, and because of his carelessness in such a needy time of strength, his past was brought to his attention, forcing him to realize his mistake. Yet another aspect highlighted in the book is Morrison's personal interference in the plot of the story. Upon reading certain selections it can be assumed that the author may incorporate some sense of bitterness toward whites because of the savage acts used against the descendants of slaves. The mere fact that Baby Suggs, in her days nearest death, would lie in her bed and contemplate color, is just one fact that may (or may not) depict Morrison's bitterness toward whites. &quot;Winter in Ohio was especially rough if you had an appetite for color.&quot; A winter's white snow was not sufficient for satisfying Baby Suggs's craving for color. And an even clearer example is in Sethe's reminiscence of Baby Suggs's words: &quot;There is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks.&quot; Still, these could be exaggerations or coincidences, two of many throughout the novel, but each reader has the freedom to his own judgment. After reading this work of implausible conviction, a deep impression sets in on its readers. An impression so strong, our focus on certain issues such as slavery and freedom, living and letting go, may be dramatically altered."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The book was exactly as described and what I needed.

But the story is the thing - and it is really something!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"BOOK REVIEWBELOVEDToni Morrison's Beloved, is a well-written book. It takes place shortly after the Civil War. It is a story of slavery and love, and how they affect you. Events in the story make you think about how hard life is for a black person.Sethe is one of the main characters in the story and she has a lot of things going on in her life. She has had a hard life of slavery and memories that haunt her. Sethe has a lot of emotions bottled up inside of her that she tries to forget, but she can't seem to let go of the past. She kills one of her children because she loved it so much. She thinks about her murdered daughter a lot. That event is one of the times when you have to ask yourself, was it out of love or was Sethe just crazy.Beloved comes back to life and that is when things really start to change. Denver, Paul D, and Beloved admire Sehte. Whenever Sethe Spends too much time with just one of them, the other two get jealous. Sethe, Denver, and Paul D are suspicious about beloved. One day Denver realizes that Beloved is her sister that Sehte murdered. Later in the story Sehte slowly starts to realize that Beloved is her daughter and she gives up everything just to please Beloved. Sethe get sick and weak because of all the sacrifices she makes for Beloved. Sethe starts to forget about Denver so Denver goes out to get some help from people to try and save her mom. One day beloved disappears and no one knows what happened to her. You have to wonder to yourself, is Beloved real, or was she a ghost to get revenge on her mother for murdering her.The book is well written because sometimes while you are reading you can actually feel what a character is feeling. For example, when Sethe has all her flashbacks she gets confused and the author wrote the book so you would get confused with her. After you read something you would have to go back and read again to try to understand what is going on. You would relate to how she was feeling at the time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's Beloved, with its forcefulness of the descriptions of actions and events, takes the novel into a deeper understanding of a world in which our lives are not our own. Beloved portrays a former slave through the struggles of life during slavery and post-slavery. Sethe, who manages to avoid the cruelty of slave life, lives it with the memories of the past. With the novel told in bits and pieces of memories, disoriented, and confused thought of Sethe. No longer bound under the cruel, overpowering \\"Schoolteacher\\" from the \\"Sweet Home\\" plantation, Sethe however is still a slave to the images of the past.The existence of slavery creates a disturbed and disputable moral issue of the novel. The questionable action of Sethe murdering her daughter Beloved as to protect her from the outside world of slavery sets the idea of how cruelly they were mistreated that would lead to killing their own child. This makes us think, \\"How much can a person love another to have them kill?\\" Sethe may be portrayed as a mother who loved too much or a slave that has just gone crazy. Either way, Sethe has kept her children away from slavery, but she, on the other hand, is still coping with it.Like a flood, Sethe's emotions and images of the agonizing, unforgettable past comes all at once, rushing to her, in which she has no control over. With that, the intensity of all the tortured events they faced are surfaced to the top, which forced her to relive them. The presence of Paul D, who has a rusted metal box for a heart, and Beloved allows Sethe to open up and tolerate through the memories.With the issue of slavery, the theme of anger is dominant throughout the entire novel. With the many losses of lives in the novel, it's no wonder why the characters face many angry emotions. Anger may be seen in the author in how she portrays the white characters and black characters. Morrison places the whites on a pedestal and is delineated with calling them \\"white trash\\" and \\"freaks\\". Their actions towards the slaves are inhumane. It depicts what little or no respect they showed towards the slaves by beating them and treating them like a \\"piece of property\\".Even with the end of slavery, they were still treated cruelly with having to be served last. Although Morrison does characterize whites as being ruthless, she also shows hostility towards the black community by having them be angry and jealous of Sethe because of what they have. The scars on Sethe's back in which she received from the slave owners are shown on a cherry choke tree. The lines of the tree symbolize the struggles of slavery and the scars that are created.Morrison's Beloved creates a powerful impact on how slaves were represented. The novel produces a better understanding of the issue of slavery through the lives and emotions of the slaves."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. Romans 9:25Toni Morrison's novel Beloved is powerful and bold. The novel tries to explain the horrors of the institution of slavery, and the horrors that lived on long after slavery was dead. This novel has a brilliant purpose, but that purpose is overshadowed by the vulgar and grotesque sexual actions constantly being displayed in the book. The novel is about an ex- slave woman named Sethe, the protagonist of the novel, and her struggles to escape from slavery and keep her children from becoming slaves themselves. Later the hidden struggle between beloved, one of the antagonists of the novel, and Sethe emerges and is clear to the outside reader, while it is oblivious to the latter.The novel is set during the reconstruction era in a small town outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. Through the use of flashbacks, brought on by Paul D, an old friend of Sethe's and another antagonist in the novel, the author lets us visit Sethe's past life and learn what she went through while she was enslaved. The horrors of Sethe's life, past and present, are also conveyed to the reader through the author's use of symbolism, foreshadowing, mysticism, and other literary devices. This book is a challenging read, and is not easily understood, but if the vulgarity and grotesqueness are overlooked, then this is a captivating story about the little known horrors of slavery."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"No boys and girls, this is not DR. Seuss. The words don't rhyme, the pieces don't all fit together, and sometimes you will feel like you've been spinning in a chair and you've come to an abrupt and dizzying stop... but read on. Morrison is not for people that have no sense of a world beyond the superficial.Her characters are spirits , souls and the essence of a person. Her plots consist of the numerous forces acting upon the root of their beings. When you read this book it is almost like awakening from a dream. You think some of the memories were weird, unusual, and hauting, but you get the point that they were making. Beloved is the story of a woman who had lived the life of a slave in America. Morrison treats Sethe like a real person, with a spirit and love interests, and sorrow and hope. She kills her child so that the baby will not have to endure the life of a slave. Though some understand her motivation, the baby does not. This book raises the question, what would you do if you knew you're child would suffer a life time and you could do nothing to save her? Would you kill her, or allow her to live in a misery that is hardly bearable for you? This child wants to drain the life out of her mother in compensation for her own. In the end, there is a battle between Sethe's two daughters for her life. Morrison has touched upon a concept that I don't believe any other author has, and she'll take you on this mystifying journey between the many dimensions of life and death... if you're game.Yes children, this is what Pulitzer Prizes are made of. This book possess the ability to move your mind, imagination and spirit with ink and paper. It is indeed amazing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After all the hype surrounding this novel, I was excited to read it for a college English class. However, after finishing the novel I am sorry I ever opened it. The story is intriguing but Morrison's writing is atrocious. The book is 275 pages long but any competent author could have written it in less than 175. At times her writing takes the author into a stream of consciousness that leads nowhere but to infinite sentence fragments, haziness as to who is speaking, and a headache. When speaking about African American writers, Hurston is worlds above Morrison."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I'm always trying to read books that are hailed as good, hoping to enjoy them as much as everyone else does. I'm sad to say that this book didn't agree with me. This isn't to say that it isn't a good book- after all, this review is just my opinion.Much of the book confused me because the book went back and forth in time in paragraphs. On one page, the first paragraph would be twenty years in the past, and the next paragraph would be five years in the past, and the third paragraph would be in the present. (by present I mean late 1800's).Sometimes even in one paragraph the story would go through several different events over several different years. This confused me to the point where I had no idea what was going on! So I didn't enjoy it very much. But oh, how I wanted to! It seemed like it would be a book I would enjoy."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was an exhausting read paragraph after paragragh I neither followed nor figured out the story and only did so by reading reviews. My ancestors were house and field slaves in North Carolina, and I have heard many tragic, and triumphant stories told in plain, lyrical, straightforward English; they wanted you to understand and remember their stories, so you could repeat and document them. I would like to know what was Toni Morrisons point for writing Beloved ."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of 1988, Toni Morrison frees herself from the bonds of traditional narrative and establishes an independent style, just as her characters have freed themselves from the horrors of slavery and escaped from Kentucky to Ohio. Revealing the story of Sethe and her family as they survive the brutality of the farm, only to encounter torments even more punishing than whippings after they escape, Morrison presents scenes in a seemingly random order, each scene revealing some aspect of life for Sethe, her boys, her dead baby Beloved, and the new baby Denver, both in the past and in the present. Moving back and forth, around, and inside out through Sethe's recollections, she gradually reveals Sethe's story to the reader, its horror increasing as the reader makes the connections which turn disconnected scenes into a powerful and harrowing chronology.As the novel opens, Sethe and Denver have lived in #124, a house in Ohio, for eighteen years, refusing to socialize and enjoying no company. When Paul D. Garner, one of the Sweet Home men and a friend of her long-missing husband, arrives on her doorstep and moves in, Sethe slowly reveals her long-buried nightmares, and the two share their stories of the events leading up to their escape. Most haunting to Sethe is the death of her young daughter Beloved, shortly after the escape from the farm, though the reader does not know for many pages the shocking manner of her death. When a ghostly figure who calls herself Beloved arrives at #124, shortly after Paul D., Morrison creates mystery and a heart-stoppingly tense atmosphere, when Beloved, too, moves in. As Beloved gradually takes over the household and seems to demand and then possess Sethe's soul, the sorrow which has burdened Sethe seems close to breaking her.The sadism of some slave-owners, the devices used to torture, and the desperate measures some slaves took to protect themselves and their loved ones come fully alive here, the horrors growing as the reader gradually discovers the real source of Sethe's torment. By forcing the reader to make the connections, instead of spelling out details in a traditional narrative, Morrison strengthens the impact of the novel and its brutal revelations. Symbols of water, rain, snow, and ice connect the disparate scenes, and the use of shadows and the ghostly character of Beloved keep the reader on tenterhooks until the action is eventually resolved. A powerful, atmospheric, and shocking novel, Beloved is also a searing indictment of slavery and the damage it has done to the fabric of life, damage that cannot be repaired until it is fully recognized through novels such as this. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a book that could never be concrete. The characters are so alive inside the pages of Beloved that they themselves sneak around the pages taking different shapes each time you read.Because of this you can never really trust what the characters have to say, and I think Toni morrison intended this. She gave us detail and we are the ones that make the judgement, we decide on who is telling the truth.I think one of the best features of this book is that it is written like a piece of jazz music, and when Paul D mentions in the book that he has seen/experienced things he could only talk about through song, I think that emphasizes how tragic and severe slavery was as Toni can only speak of it through the syntax and beat of jazz music. This book is not for closed text readers, it is so far beyond ambiguous that you nor I could say exactly what was happening, Who is beloved? I don't think we are supposed to pin down her character, she is sethes dead daughter, she is the girl from the man's basement down the street, she is the embodiment of all african slaves alike. She is not one but all at once, you can't control who she is, she runs like water as do the rest of the characters."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Having seen part of the movie on TV, but never able to catch the whole thing but wanting to, I had high expectations for this book. I eagerly checked it out of the library - only to be disappointed thoroughly. For the most part, this book was extremely boring and at times hard to understand. It took me several readings to finally get the ending, and even then I was puzzled. To put it bluntly, it was just too weird for my tastes. I certainly don't understand how this book could have possibly won a Nobel. And I certainly hated Sethe, who killed her child to spare her a life of slavery and racism. Don't get me wrong: I am not a racist and I believe that slavery was the darkest point in American society and history. But I can't believe a mother would actually kill her own baby due to slavery. Just one of the many things I can't believe or understamd about this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was terrible. I haven't read any of Toni's other books, but I didn't like this one at all. For one, the whole idea of a &quot;ghost-child&quot; coming back from the dead and being totally accepted by a family, no matter how much they missed this person, is a little looney. Perhaps this is only because of what I expected of the book. I don't have a problem with ghost stories at all, but it doesn't even tell how Beloved &quot;crossed over&quot;, why she disappeared at the end, or what she even came back for. There was also a whole lot of gibberish, and incoherant babbling that made no sense whatsoever. Some things that were repeated over and over (i.e., &quot;dead man on my face&quot;) never got explained. The constant crouching, and the &quot;bridge&quot; were also never expanded on. The only positive thing that I can come up with that came in this story was that Denver went from being so selfish to trying to help Sethe. I would consider reading other books by Morrison, but I just didn't care for this one."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"When it came to my A' Level year, we had a choice of texts.. this, or Ian Mckewan's A child in time, unamimously the class voted for McKewan over the objections of our 'right on teacher' (who would inform us that she stayed in gay hotels just so we'd know how liberal she was)This is a mess of a book, but because it's about slavery and nobody is allowed to knock books about slavery, it gets all these plaudits. It's a terrible read. It plods along and switching tenses and times so often, you'd think you were tripping.I consider myself fairly intelligent, I'm not a genius, but I pick up things relatively quickly, however, our teacher had to tell us the point of this book as no-one in my A Level class got it. Perhaps it was the turgid, moronic dialogue. Or the masses of memory..

Whereas twenty or more years ago, High School Students may have been assigned The Great Gatsby or The Sound and the Fury, they now get Beloved. My copy belonged to an Ithaca High School student. I wonder what she thought of this story of ghosts, slavery, pain and partial redemption?Beloved has curious plot holes. We know what Sethe does to Beloved, and she somehow injures her other children, but the extent is never made known. What did she do to the boys? The plot just glides by it. And why did Sethe cross the Ohio River only to \`hide' at her mother-in-laws house, Baby Shruggs, when that would be the first place slave catchers would go to retriever her? She doesn't even try to hide, but is out in the open for all to see. The characters in this novel are very adept at saving themselves, and very clever, so this move makes less than no sense --- it just reminds the reader the Morrison is writing a novel and wants to give us a message, even at the expense of common sense.Regardless, Beloved is a masterful work. Morrison gives a lyrical quality to many passages, taking the reader to places that are hard to pin down in terms of concrete reality. It is a timeless world of myth and legend, rendered into a prose which is very much near poetry. She also shows how the \`colored' community of Cincinnati helped each other, relied on each other, even in difficult circumstances (or rightly because of them). The legacy of slavery and the Civil War was families broken apart and scattered around the country; in the wake of this, community filled the gap in helping individuals, even strangers.Ultimately, Beloved is a novel about how human suffering can be elevated through the help of others. Even the legacy of slavery can be mitigated by simple kindnesses."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I loved this book so much I recommended it to my sister, who prefers to read medical thrillers.

What terrible agony and depth of emotion and Morrison brings it all to light, slowly and painfully in a stream of consciousness manner.

She killed her baby.[No, not the one she was just pregnant with, another] Well, this child comes back to life and tries to kill Sethe.

Once over this initial hurdle, &quot;Beloved&quot; quickly became one of my most loved and most hated books. Toni Morrison has created a novel which questions human and social values, evoking sympathy and compassion in all of us. The way the characters are treated by other human beings and by society in general is so horrific, that we can only give them sympathy. The characters become closer to the reader by their narration in &quot;the stream of consciousness&quot;, but at the same time distanced by todays society's lack of understanding with their situation. We are not intended to empathise with them as the story is not one to be kept alive.

And am I glad that I did! It is her best work. The characters are three dimensional and wholly human.

Beloved is a true masterpiece! A unique story into the hideous crimes of slavery and their effect on the enslaved! This novel reopens everyone's slavery wounds regardless of race. Unlike many novels, Beloved offers personal healing in us all. As the main character Sethe revists her past, you will cry her tears and feel her pain. Only after &quot;rebirthing&quot; the daughter that Sethe, herself, has murdered(and at the same time saved from the treacherous claw of slavery), can Sethe be at ease. As Sethe finds her inner peace she invites the reader to share in her joy. Morrison has turned an extraordinary woman into a universal symbol of heroinism and self preservation. Sethe's triumphs are transferred to the reader making Beloved a truly enjoyable book to read and re-read throughout the years. Beloved is not the typical touching heartache novel.

The characters were portrayed beautifully, with Morrison's uncanny talent to describe. The flaws built into each character made the book unbelievably realistic, while the magical appearance of Beloved was amazingly surrealistic. The protagonist, Sethe, while an all-loving mother, is nevertheless too excessive in her love. Paul D, while sincerely loving Sethe, is still a sexist. Baby Suggs, although a caring community leader, spends all day lying on her bed after the &quot;misery.&quot;Other than the successful depiction of the various characters, Beloved is filled with many flashbacks, impeccably told. I gained a new understanding and also a different perspective on the postbellum era. Morrison has really done it this time, creating the masterpiece which haunts and delights at the same time."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read the reviews of those who gave this book one star and rated it horrible etc. If you read a book because you're Supposed to, forced to, you're bound to come to it sullenly and find it bad. This book is not for the superficial or the shallow-minded. It's for people who care about the world and people and life, our past and how it affects our present, our future.To take a highly sensitive issue like slavery and tackle it in a novel is a huge task and Morrison has done it with so much sensitivity and care. Simple words, complex emotion, ane excellent work. Worthy of great respect."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"this book is a mess, it is overly dramatic and full of worn-out cliches. I feel this story has been told many, many times before and while that does not diminish its tragedy, it does make it quite tiresome to read. I personally cannot see the beauty of the half-reality, half-fantasy premise. However, I would still tell everyone to read it themselves and form their own opinions. Just don't feel the need to finish it as it is the same thing over and over again."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of Beloved, Toni Morrison's best known book. Although the book was disturbing, it helped give me a better idea of the true horror of what slavery was really like.Morrison foccuses around Sethe, a former slave living with a terrible secret. When a young girl named Beloved appears mysteriously at her house, 124, Sethe must examine what really happened all those years ago -- and the causes, mainly slavery, that led to tragedy.Beloved includes sex, murder, violence, images of slavery, and many other aspects that are disturbing and depressing. However, I did not feel like Morrison was using description just to shock; her point, that slavery continues to affect people long after it was abolished, is certainly true.Morrison's writing is almost flawless, her literary techniques mind-blowing without being overdone, and her point complex and layered. I only have one warning: don't read Beloved before bed, because it was so good that I got nightmeares."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In a word....breathtaking. This book is so powerful and so devastating on so many levels. I read this in college, years ago, and reading it again I was amazed at how much I missed the first time. So much symbolism and character development wrapped up in a truly harrowing ghost story. I felt like I was there with the characters experiencing all the horrors they were going through. Incredibe.I can see how it would seem tedious and hard to understand for people whose sole literary experiences are the NY Times Best Seller formula-driven romantic thrillers you find on a supermarket shelf. If you never aspire to read anything deeper, then yes you won't like this."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Deeply moving, enchanted telling. The story of Sethe, escaped slave who settles with her mother-in-law in free Ohio, only to face demons of the past and present, demons of her own making and others thrust upon her, her freedom burdened with the chains of these spectres. Sethe is stunningly well made, her past and present drawn with clarity and light that betray the closed-ness that having been a slave imposes on her. With the exception of a brief passage of her in the first person, knowing what she's thinking and feeling must largely be inferred from her actions. Her famous quote, \\"thin love ain't no love at all\\" shows us well the place of Sethe's thick love. There are surely chilling aspects to Sethe's story, things she does, things that happen to others. These incidents are crucial to the story, explaining who Sethe is and why and how she comes to be so. The portions that seem to challenge credibility or reality are just as vital. The supporting characters, Paul D, and Denver most particularly, but obviously also, the title \`character' Beloved (read it and you'll understand the unique need to say \`character') as well as fellow blacks and the whites with whom they interact or interacted only serve to improve Sethe's story and this fine work. For this reader, Beloved transcended my normal need to have a character to relate to. As an indictment against slavery, it is powerful, indeed. Surely Beloved is worthy of its Pulitzer Prize and Morrison of her Nobel for Literature."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Wow. I can't believe I lived this long without reading Toni Morrison. She is amazing, and this book is absolutely exquisite. It's moving, beautifully written magical realism, very truly American in the best possible sense of the word. I adored this book and was very moved by it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The first time I read this book, I despised it. So I was not too pleased when I found out I would have to read it for another college course a few years later. Well, when I read it the second time, I enjoyed it more. It made more sense, and it was easier to figure out. I think this is one of those books that need multiple readings to get it completely. I also found more meaning in it when I read it looking for human rights violations for a human rights course rather than just reading it for a literature class. This book really is very powerful and gives a very strong message about the long-lasting effects of slavery on the human body and mind. Still, not my favorite. I will not read it for a third time and I refuse to like it on a personal level."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Sad - SAD. I mean, I'm sitting by the fireplace at 1am and I'm sobbing sad. To be clear, I was sobbing not because of the sadness of the book, but how at the end Morrison RELEASES the sadness. The writing was amazing. The imagery was perfect. I can't imagine she could ever write a better book. This is a book that belongs on the shelf next to other great American novels exploring race like:To Kill a Mockingbird,Uncle Tom's Cabin,Native Son,Invisible Man, andThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Mesmerizing. Passionate. Excellent. Flawed. These are some of the words I see describing Toni Morrison's novel Beloved. What I do not see is recognition that what is seen as the author's flawed, imperfect style is, in fact, the African storytelling style. In her case, the medium is the message. Ms. Morrison's voice is the voice of Africa. This is a living narrative, enriched with the rhythm of a land that speaks in the heartbeat of this novel's characters. I read similar reviews of Ms. Morrison's other novels. I can sense, through the rich language, the song of hot days and richly dyed cloth torn in the teeth of slavery and exploitation. The words slide smooth to the bone, awakening the smells of confusion and grief and despair accompanied by the hope of a new day for healing. Slavery appears in many forms and disguises. The terrible wonderfulness of this book is a walk in a shared history and culture. We are all children of the dark skinned mother. She remains alive and strong in Beloved, and keeps the remembering alive."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is one of the best books every written in the english language. OK, you may already be able to tell that I love Ms. Morrison, not just because all of her stories and characters are so vivid and alive, but because she loves words. She uses words in graceful harmony on every page of this story. Beloved is an involved tale that grabs you with its lyrical prose and magic. It is a tragic tale that is not easily told, but Ms. Morrison does it HER WAY. And let me tell ya, if you are patient and like detail in your reading, this story is a feast. Beloved is not an easy book to get into. I had to read it twice to understand and enjoy it fully, but once you do, the story will haunt you with imagery for days after you finish reading it. I simply love Toni Morrison for writing Beloved. God bless her...smile...I highly recommend this book for people who enjoy a good story told in a crazy, wonderful, lyrical, magical way that you have to think about...it's tough stuff, but if you get it, its yours forever and a day...smile..."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Each whitepeople should be made to read this book until he vomits and cries. This is what whitepeople did to black people--they stole their souls, took color from their eyes. . .If this book doesn't break apart your heart and scar up your soul, you ain't human."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"If you've never read this book before, you should prepare to read it more than one time. If you have read it, read it again. Morrison's prose is so powerfully constructed, so poetic and gorgeous, that it deserves to be one of those books you wear the cover off of. One of the most difficult sections is the &quot;middle passage&quot; part-- I had no idea what was going on in there, but once I got it, boy did it make sense why Beloved was so angry.This is a classic-- it should be taught with the other Southern books of the canon. It's definitely on my top 50 list of all time, and it's for the writing, for the plot, for the characters and for the creepy ghost story feeling it gave me in the end."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I love &quot;Beloved&quot; by Toni Morrison. This is one of the best books that I have ever read. Besides watching the movie, reading the book, and reading the &quot;CliffNotes&quot; to the book. I find this book to be one of the most powerful of our time.I can understand why Oprah Winfrey, decided to make this book into a movie, because this book whispers volumes! I applaud the movie and I truly believe that it was beyond excellent -- it was phenomenal!I love all of Toni Morrison's work, but whenever I read &quot;Beloved&quot; or watch the movie. I am overwhelmed by the quality of strength and overall creativity that it took to create such a fascinating piece of literature.It is hard for me to put into words exactly how this book has changed my life. But I suppose that the unbending strength of Sethe and Denver's eventual acceptance of herself despite all that she endured allows me to focus on those things that are of good within my own life and to love, learn, and experience the challenges in life with courage.Thank you Ms. Morrison you are totally awesome! I love everything that you write. What a wonderful inspiration you are to all women who desire to write and publish literary masterpieces who strive to keep on keeping on!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Overpowering and heart-wrenching, this tale truly displays compelling and bone-chilling language and dialogue that stays with you throughout the entire book. Through all the circling narrative, we come to know the characters deeply. This novel contains tremendous emotional power that sends chills through your body. The subject of slavery alone is disturbing,and by presenting this subject through the eyes of Sethe,the main character whose life revolves around her past as a slave,gave me,the reader,a better perspective of the life she lead everyday. Morrison creates vivid images of the torture and agony Sethe endured as a slave into the minds of the reader with her riveting content and her unique use of language. This fictional story should be read with an open mind and with no real understanding for the characters' actions. Full of graphic scenes in which Sethe flashes back to her past, you can't help but feel pain in your heart for all the slaves who endured such anguish and abuse.Though the language and content in this novel left me astonished, I found myself getting lost numerous times throughout the entire book. Morrison does not warn the reader of a flashback told through the eyes of Sethe or introduce new characters into the story, so I found myself reading some parts of this book more than once. Morrison requires you to engage in the story, to pretend you are actually there. Overly dramatic and full of worn-out clich&eacute;s, I feel this story has been told many,many times before and while that does not diminish this tragedy,numerous clich&eacute;s do make this novel quite tiresome to read. Personally,the division of reality and a dream sequence does not appeal to me. However,I would still tell everyone to read this novel to form their own personal opinions."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison is considered to be one of America's greatest writers, and she has quite rightfully won both the Pulitzer and the Nobel Prize. \\"Beloved\\" is a troubled, complex, and powerful novel. And as always, Toni Morrison's prose is beautiful, subtle, and unique.\\"Beloved\\" is set after the end of the Civil War. It is the story of Sethe, a woman and mother of four, escaping slavery finding her way north, to Ohio. Here she settles with her teenage daughter, Denver. Their house is haunted by a ghost. It is the spirit of Sethe's dead baby girl, a baby which Sethe killed many years ago... Morrison is a masterful storyteller, but nevertheless, expect to be a little confused in the beginning. Just continue to read - you can always go back and re-read the beginning later. The way this book is written with all the back and forth in time, we get to know the characters quite well, to the point that you feel that they are old friends of yours.I have to admit to that although I think, \\"Beloved\\" is a great read, I don't think it is her masterpiece (I think that \\"Song of Solomon\\" is her best novel) but \\"Beloved\\" is certainly worth reading!!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book came to me highly recommended. I found the plot interesting, but the writing torturuous. The authors attempts to portray the dream state left me often confused. The friend who recommended the book claimed it was because I was a man. My daughter, who agreed with my take says that is not the case. Oprah loved it!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This well written piece of literature by Toni Morrison is truly one of her best. The novel revolves around a tired old slave name Sethe and her consistent slave memories. Each character in the novel goes through a developing stage, which consists of reliving the past and facing their utter most fears. Sethe, Denver (her daughter), Baby Suggs (mother in Law) and Paul D. (Sethe's new acclaimed lover) are all faced with the troubled spirit that dwells in their house. But it is Sethe that is troubled the most. For the baby's endless spirit was her daughter's, which she had killed many years ago.Morrision uses great descriptive words that hold the reader in an imaginary world, making the characters appear real. Each chapter ending leaves the reader wanting to read on. Morrision uses this writing technique quite effectively that entices the reader.This novel not only involves America's shame of black slavery, but also includes the feelings of the slaves themselves. If you are interested in slavery this novel is one for the reading. One cannot help but feel a connection with the characters and their hardships. Morrison accomplishes this and much more quite superbly making this novel one of her very best."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Set in post-Civil War Ohio, Beloved focuses on the life of Sethe, a mother of three and a slave. Out of love for her family, she runs away from her owners in pursuit of a better life and a future for her children, but when she is caught, she makes the decision that death must be better than the life of a slave. &quot;Out of love&quot; she tries to take the lives of her children, succeeding in only one. This decision comes back to haunt her as Beloved, the ghost of her baby daughter. In this novel, Sethe battles with guilt put on her conscience by Beloved and is willing to lose everything to regain the love of this lost child.Toni Morrison has beautifully constructed this rather unique story of maternal love. She has a captivating style that is both heartwrenching and uplifting. Her creative use of flashbacks and changing point-of-view unfolds this story in such a way that it relentlessly grabs and pulls the reader along. Also, through Beloved Morrison reminds us, though useless to combat the past, the present must be embraced."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I think this book is wonderful and it you haven't read it you should. I had to read it for a class assignment but I'm glad that I did. This book is great for anyone who wants to learn about African-American slave culture or anyone who just wants a good book to read. It shows the injustices and though choices slaves were confronted with everyday. The book makes you thankful for all the blessings you have in your life. So next time you're bored and need something to do before you reach for the TV remote, reach for Beloved."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is the third Toni Morrison novel I've read, and so far, it's the best. I've read Paradise and The Bluest Eye...but I've fallen in love with Beloved. Usually, I read through a book quickly...more quickly if the author hasn't captured my imagination. With Beloved, I find myself slowing down, reading a chapter at a time, savoring the beautiful language and the intricate way Ms. Morrison uses language to show us the lives and desires of each character. More than being a chronical of slavery and its aftermath, Beloved gives us the heart and mind of those who experienced it and what they did to survive. This is truly an amazing book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's Award Winning novel Beloved can be compared to that of a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle. The reader is required to put it together in-order to understand this novel. From the beginning of her novel Morrison confuses the reader throughout the story by randomly throwing different pieces of the puzzle (story), only to confuse the reader. As the story progresses, the literary puzzle is soon revealed to the reader. But this book is no ordinary puzzle. It is one that requires great skill to put together. I was required to read this piece in my AP English class and I could not link fragments of the book from the very start. There were times when I thought I had pieces of the story connected together, only to realize that the pieces were not of the right shape and size. Like the time when Paul D. was first introduced in the novel. This character just popped out of nowhere and throughout this chapter of his appearance it was never mentioned who he was and why he was there. At first I thought that Paul D. was there just to trouble the women by always bringing up the past and trying to hit on Sethe. But as I progressed through the story I finally understood who and why Paul D. is. He was a former slave and his role in the book is important to Sethe. Another example of \\"puzzling\\" parts is when Sethe talks of a tree growing on her back. This will definitely confuse the reader. I won't tell you what Sethe is talking about. If you want to know go and purchase or borrow the book and find out for yourself. I don't think this book is a very good book at all but I would recommend it to readers that want a good challenge. Morrison style of writing is too hard for me to comprehend. This book made reading a little easier for me because this novel is very complexed."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This novel was rated by the New York Times as the best American novel of the last 25 years and has been accorded the status of a classic great American novel. This amount of hype, Morrison's iconic status, and the difficulty of the book can cause a great amount of skepticism in the reader. One wants to hate the book and toss it aside.It took me quite a while to warm to the book, and I did almost toss it aside at points. It is not an easy read. Morrison could have structured her narrative in a more readable way, but she deliberately chose not to. The story of the runaway slave-mother's tragic loss of her daughter is too painful to be told in this fashion. So it's done episodically, with flashbacks, and with the device of the sudden appearance of a stray girl who is taken in as a new daughter with growing suspicions as to her being a reincarnation.There are very good reasons for Morrison to tell the tale in this fashion. The events of the slave era, after all, exist only in racial memory, and a 21st century reader can best approach the horrors of the times by peeling back the layers of memory. This is exactly how Morrison tells her story, and it does resonate. Also, it is apparent that Morrison is skilled in the oral traditions of a culture that didn't tell legends in a linear manner.So, the reader has to put aside his/her frustrations with the difficulty of this approach and appreciate the writer's need to tell the tale in this fashion. And it helps that the story becomes a lot clearer as you slog through the narrative.Morrison's language is quite remarkable. It is at times poetic. She can capture the character and look of a person in a few striking sentences. It's really some of the best writing I've read for some time.So, the book does live up to the hype. It's a classic work that has to be re-read and that probably has to be studied in a literature class to appreciate fully.I heard one critic say that this was the book he'd bring to a desert island. No way. It's not the kind of book one falls in love with. And for me, I connect better emotionally with Banks' and Oates' novels as well as O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried.\\" I'd probably rate those books as better than Morrison's in a contest to name the best American work of fiction over the past 25 years. Still, some of Morrison's characters, particularly \\"Paul D\\", are unforgettable and quite attractive. But in the end, I can't fall in love with this book any more than I could fall in love with \\"Ulysses.\\"The book is a must-read for those wanting to be literate in recent American fiction."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"_Beloved_ is my first Toni Morrison book. If this is any indication of her skill as a writer, I will certainly be reading more by her. Initially the book is confusing, unsettling and leaves the reader with many questions - this is intentional, as Morrison wants us to experience the dislocation and chaos that was the daily bread of a slave in the mid-nineteenth century. Stay with it; the struggle is richly rewarded._Beloved_ on the surface is the story of Seethe, a runaway slave, haunted by her dead daughter. As the story progresses, each character we encounter has a secret of their own that they are coming to terms with (or are trying to hide.) Gradually the questions raised in the first 50 pages are answered and order made of the chaos, as the rich interconnectedness of the characters becomes apparent, and their secrets are exposed.Slavery plays a large role to be sure, as Morrison shows the scars the institution left on both African - Americans and whites. But _Beloved_ is also about forgiveness, leaving the past, and coming to terms with past wrongs. These themes are masterfully woven through the perspectives of a wide cast of characters, each wholly unique and human. I am also dumbstruck with Morrison's way with words - at times poignant and touching, elsewhere horrifying and shocking, reading this book was an emotional experience. Only a handful of authors can make that claim, in my opinion, and Morrison is one of them. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Following the path of this book, relating to Sethe's tragic life, and witnessing the horrors of the times, make this book a raw and real telling of a story that needs to be heard. This book could be the story of a million strong women born into horrific times. By sharing the sorrow of her story, we can heal the wounds of history."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In Beloved, Toni Morrison provides an account of the life of an African-American woman who experiences slavery and then the racism of a hostile white society in the North. Sethe, the protagonist of the novel, escapes from slavery to rejoin her mother in law in Ohio. But even in the \\"free\\" North, slaves can be found and returned to their masters, and the vulnerability of Sethe and her children leads to murder and a haunting.Morrison depicts white society as evil, and in her novel refinements like the law and education mask but do not change its racist nature. Some of her white characters are psychopathically violent; others, like a pair of abolitionists in Cincinnati, are more benignly racist. The only white character that Morrison portrays sympathetically is a disturbed white girl, utterly alienated from white society, who saves Sethe's life after she escapes across the Ohio River and helps her deliver her baby. In contrast, Morrison's black characters demonstrate loyalty, spirituality, and perseverance as they negotiate the obstacles arranged for them by a hostile society.This novel effectively arouses a sense of horror and abhorrence in the reader, but its depictions of sexual assaults, torture, degradation, and more mundane forms of cruelty make it an exceptionally unpleasant book to read. Morrison's voice is a powerful one, though, and I would imagine that this book will continue to reach a wide audience."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I had to read this book in a college literature class. It was not a book I would have choosen. I didn't like reading the book because it has a lot of sad and painful events that occur. 10 years later I picked up the book again and thought I would read it to see if I still had the same feelings about it. While it still isn't a feel good book I do think that the book is well written and easy to understand. I think that Toni Morrison did a great job in telling this story."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Setha was a runaway slave from a place called &quot;Sweet Home&quot;. She was suppose to meet up with her husband Halle that she never found. She excaped to Ohio to stay with her mother-in-law Baby Suggs, and her other three children. Setha loved her children unconditionally and did everything possible to keep them out of harms way. But when &quot;School Teacher&quot;, the slave owner came to claim Setha's children she did the unthinkable.The novel was powerful and it showed how much love a mother can have for her children. I don't agree with the things she did but she wanted better for her children other than slavery.She wanted them to be in a better place. She did what she did out of love no anger."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved by Toni Morrison is a colorful novel often filled with revolting imagery. Morrison uses powerful words of imagery so that the reader can empathize with the horrible treatment of slaves. In this book, the main characters are haunted by their past lives of slavery. The dehumanization leaves the reader with an unsettling feeling.Morrison also uses a lot of racist slurs and ideas in this novel, to implement the idea that slaves were property. Slaves were called [derogitory names ] and treated like creatures. Due to all of the racial slurs and ideas in this book, it would be easy to generate the assumption of Morrison being racist; however, she uses racial slurs and ideas to present a historical view into the actual conditions of slavery before and after the Civil War.Although the reader may be repulsed by certain parts of the novel, this repulsion is necessary. Morrison does an excellent job of writing a novel that greatly impacts its readers. The novel is very educational in a historical sense. The words and imagery in this novel force people to look for racism in their own lives, just like the characters in Beloved who were forced to deal with the effects of racism in their lives."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I think that Toni Morrison has struck gold with BELOVED. It is a novel filled with the stench of things not forgotten. I was enriched with the beauty of her words and the aura of simplicity about Beloved.We all must face our demons in life at our own time and when Sethe finally had to face hers, it came at a time when she was most vulnerable. When she started having feelings for Paul D. We are at our most vulenerable when we love.Read the novel for yourself and all of those with a negative vibe about the book, must learn patience. There is a great reward in reading Beloved. You must sample the entire piece of pie before knowing all of its ingredients."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I would never have finished this book if it was not a prescribed text on my literature degree. This isn't to say its bad. When you actually know whats going on it is a moving account of American slavery. I think it depends of what kind of reader you are. If when you read books you value the challenge of an author who is providing a text which will infuriate and confound you at times, then you will appreciate this book. On the other hand if you believe (as I do) that the is nothing clever in writing a book that is non-linear to the point of spoiling your enjoyment, then you should stay away unless you have a deep intrest in the subject matter. Saying this on completion the is a perverse pleasure in finishing a book like this and no doubt repeat readings of this book will be more enjoyable as the reader knows whats going on.I'm glad I read it and some of the writing is excellent. I just know I wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't had to. Worth it if you've got the patience."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I'm sorry, but I couldn't get past the first chapter. It was dull, hard to understand and the characters were making no impressions on me. How does a book like this win such a great prize? Yes, Toni Morrison is a great author but really, why this book?"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's Beloved ia a captivating yet confusing book. She takes you through a maze of questions and leaves you to ponder and predict their answers. She is an incredible writer with many different talents. She chooses every word for a significant reason. Her style is astounding and is probably on of the best I have ever seen. Beloved is a very interesting story and forces the reader to reread pages in order to gain a full understanding of the book. Morrison has worked very hard in producing a well-written novel.Beloved opens the story with the sentence,&quot;124 was spiteful.&quot; 124 is the house where Sethe and her daughter, Denver, live. A baby ghost, Sethe's daughter who she killed, is haunting house 124. Sethe, being a former slave wants nothing more then the best for her children. In a flashback, we discover the many secrets that Sethe does not want to face and the hardships she has overcome. She looks to a friend and lover named Paul D for comfort and advice. Paul D serves as her confidant. He is described as the type of guy women could cry to. In the difficult days of slavery, Sethe sees the danger that her children are in if they grow up. She wants to subdue their sufferings by taking their lives. She is successful in taking the life of one of her daughters. Beloved, a reincarnation of her dead daughter, comes to live with Sethe and allows her to deal with her past.One of the major themes in this story is memory. Sethe's memories are things that haunt her and will continue to haunt her until she decides to deal with her past.Beloved causes many problems within their family but she also is the most important person in the book because she causes each character to change.Morrison's writing is described in chunks and pieces where the reader has to search for understanding. She leaves you with many unanswered questions like, whether or not Beloved was a real person. This is the most interesting question in the book, yet I still have no answer. This is why Beloved is such a great book to read. It makes you think and allows you to acknowledge her incredible style of writing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Now a motion picture and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, this story is the view of Faulkner's South from the other side of the railroad tracks. Like most classics it deals with history, trauma and healing, survival and memory. The main character (Sethe) is, as usual in a Morrison book, a Black Woman writ Big with conflicts with her past, with the slave society she was born into, with the crossing to freedom, and with the birth of her infant daughter whom she kills rather than surrender to the slave masters. Whether that daughter returns as a ghost or not doesn't matter much. My feeling is that everything, or almost everything, about Beloved is explainable without supernatural intervention. Advice: Read this for the poetry and the insight into black culture and for the reduction of slavery into one woman's poignant story. Then suffer through the movie. Then reread the book and appreciate it for what it really is: A redemptive work of art."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"That Beloved is a difficult read depends on the ability of the reader. Still, many good readers find Beloved difficult to follow. However, after much patience, its clarity finally comes full circle. I think for Morrison to hear that her story Beloved is dark, disturbing, crass and confusing, is justly satisfying. That her writing is consistent shows that her style is intentional rather than incompetent. Her characters are confused, lost, sick, and beleaguered. It's as if she is literarily attempting to put her reader in a similar state. Understanding this, the flashbacks, sudden changes, twists and turns among her characters can be read with patience. It is a symbolic work in part, the characters, and the style of writing.I don't think it is a mandatory read, but it does address two fundamental positions in the American dialogue of race relations.The first is that America has still not reconciled itself with racism and slavery. Even though laws have been written, amendments passed, and equality promoted, this does not answer past injustices. The pain and hurt run too deep, and the injustice felt by descendents of slavery calls for more. The gap is still too wide.The other position accepts the fact that racism and slavery were ugly and horrible and that there is no excuse good enough for what happened. To understand it like those who suffered it is impossible. However, laws have been made, amendments have been passed, equality is promoted, and change has come and is still coming to pass. The nation dawns a new day and should not live in the pass, but look to the future.Aside from whether one thinks the book is a good one, or a poor one, it gives one an understanding of those who are proponents of either these two positions. One may find the book lends it self more appropriately to the first, but not entirely."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is the most powerful of all Morrison's books, it brings African American culture to life without painting it white for anyone's benefit, nor does it attempt to make readers of any creed or colour uncomfortable. It does not preach but opens a door. If the reader can susspend disbelief the enter Morrison's world they can only leave enriched by a greater understanding of the scars and culture of the African American coming to terms with the changes as slavery begins to come to an end. The characters are vivid, the storyline entrancing. Just one word of warning... don't watch the film!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is indeed a masterfully written novel--the composition is excellent, the prose is beautiful, and the characters are well-developed. However, the imagery and symbolism that is often used (and more often overused) is at times hard to stomach. The story, while very intriguing, is often hard to follow and is very often so gratuitously...well...I guess &quot;disgusting&quot; is a good word for it...that the reader is often tempted to skip chapters of redundant shock-imagery.Nonetheless, it is still a good read. You might be thinking &quot;How exactly can it be so good and so bad at the same time?&quot; Well, I have found that many novels can be very taxing to the reader, and sort of gives you the sensation of being hit by a train. But after you read this sort of novel, you're quite glad you did. That's Beloved in a nutshell. Don't read this book if you want to be entertained. Read it if you want to be bruised, sickened and greatly disturbed."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a dawdling tale about Sethe, a former slave haunted by her painful past, and the challenges it took for her to live a normal live with her daughter, Denver, and her live-in boyfriend, Paul D. The story hits the ground running in the beginning, by telling the eerie tale of an aggravated and revengeful ghost, but quickly slows to a snails pace. Although the book uses descriptive language and imagery, it lacks gripping action and plot, while confusing you with arrantly placed flashbacks. Some characters are randomly mentioned, leaving you wondering until they are explained later in the book. Toni Morrison, the author, uses an extremely odd writing style that is hard to follow, forcing you to turn back and read the same passage numerous times, until you finally understand (or don't, but move on anyway). Beloved is not a novel you can enjoy. If you crave a story that will keep you hooked, interested, and on the edge of your seat - or even simply a novel that will keep your eyes open, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I just couldn't get into the story. It seemed to drag on."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Ghosts, slavery, and inner torment which goes beyond words, these are only a few of the topics addressed in Toni Morrison's Beloved. Although a tough read at first, the unique story telling style really makes this novel standout. You'll hear that Beloved is confusing, hard to understand, and strangely different. If you'll let this scare you off then stop reading this review now and go find another typical slavery text that is little more than a documentary. However if you're not afraid of something new and original, continue on as Beloved is one of the few great books told by the human spirit. In the beginning of the story you're introduced to 124. The haunting of this infamous house is a part of the greater story of the character's lives. Living in the house are Sethe, Denver, and Baby Suggs. All were a part of the peculiar institution of slavery but are now trying to live as free blacks during the ante-bellum period. Not staying on one idea too long, Morrison brings Paul D. into the story. Paul D, a former slave who used to work at Sweet Home, a plantation, with Sethe, brings with him memories of a past that Sethe spends her life trying not to remember. As emotions and memories are stirred up, the plot begins to unfold. The lives of the characters are told through their memories, and Morrison's style of writing creates a feeling of confusion and struggle with these ideas in the reader similar to what the characters are feeling. By doing this she pulls you into the story so well because you feel what they feel. Soon the harsh reality of the memories is coming from everywhere. You hear of a dead baby, murdered, by her own mother? Then the haunting of the house stops with the appearance of a strange girl who calls herself Beloved. Beloved, the same thing Morrison carved into her unnamed dead baby's gravestone. Paul D, now living with Sethe, has bad feelings about the girl and the events keep building to the unexpected conclusion. Morrison has created a powerful piece of literature that addresses powerful topics. Sethe says \\"the future is only a matter of keeping the past at bay.\\" She has grown up in the horrible world of slavery and now must live as a \\"free\\" woman. For Sethe \\"living\\" is nearly impossible and the future unthinkable. Paul D is truly the catalyst needed in Sethes life. \\"Me and you [Sethe], we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow.\\" These words from Paul D illustrate his attempts to not only free himself from the \\"chains\\" of the past but free Sethe as well. Constantly the characters are asking themselves and each other what it really means to be \\"free.\\" Baby Suggs was bought out of slavery with everything broken but her heart. This is another example of Morrison using the lives of the characters to display the horrors of slavery. Each character deals with this idea in their own way, which plays out interestingly. Morrison has also made a strange attempt to write with the voice of the dead. The chapters written from Beloved's point of view are sporadic and jumbled together. They almost sound poetic but the words and verses have little meaning to the reader. For instance, who are the men without skin? Why is she trying to join with a smiling face? What is a hot thing? These chapters were obviously written with good intent but they really seem to have little meaning and actually cause more confusion to the reader than necessary. Although the book is overall enjoyable, the ending is a real let down. After struggling through a couple hundred pages you're expecting everything to finally come together at the end. Obviously, that isn't Morrison's style; instead she leaves you confused and with unanswered questions. What becomes of Paul D, Stamp Paid, Beloved, Denver, and Sethe? All the lives you've been following so closely and all of a sudden the story ends and you're left to imagine, \\"what now?\\""},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved was a touching story that shows how much an individual will sacrifice for love. Although the book jumped from past to present, Toni Morrison did a great job guiding the reader beyond satisfaction. She described the stories that slaves had to live realistically. This book gave me more knowledge about the historicial period that was filled with racism and hate. It made me sypathize for those individuals who had to face the dark sides of life, as well as admire their bravery of being able to put the past aside and still live looking forward optimistically to the future."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Brilliant, hypnotic, beautiful, confusing, and frustrating. These are all things a reader may associate with Toni Morrison's novel Beloved. But how can so many extremely different views be given to one novel? A reader will encounter all of these different feelings as he reads this novel, which will most likely come in an order. This is not a novel for a reader who needs to have a threaded plot which can be easily connected. The style that she uses is new, and requires patience on the reader's part. Morrison uses very impactful imagery and metaphores in the story which requires very critical reading in order to comprehend the depth. The everlasting effects of slavery that scars the human soul are picked apart by Morrison during the story. Furthermore, she explores how one can never truly be free once a horrible experiece has scarred your life. The feeling the reader will have for the story will come as he comprehends the novel. At first, the novel is very frustrating and confusing due to the constant &quot;jumping&quot; Morrison does from past to present and the constant changing of views during the story. Her style is very hard to flow with, as it seems to be broken apart and pieced back together wrongly. When you finally feel that you are getting in touch with a character and starting to understand what is going on, the point of view is suddenly changed, or you may find yourself suddenly in the past. The large gaps within the story are finally filled in much later, when you may have already forgotten about it. Questions you may ask in the beginning like: &quot;why did Sethe kill her child and try to kill the others?,&quot; or &quot;who is Beloved?,&quot; are finally answered toward the end of the novel. Although very difficult to understand, Toni Morrison's style in the novel is very clever and hypnotic. You only fully understand how Morrison's style in the book is being used after you understand the plot and how she comes across telling it. Also, the plot and style are so closely connected you are able to see the plot more clearly if you understand the style. When the reader is done with the novel, he may finally understand why Morrison used the style of cutting back and forth, from past to present, in her novel. The reason for this is: the whole novel is about memories, and how those experiences which have scarred Sethe, plauge her soul. Everything that happens in the book, acts upon a character as a stimuli, triggering memories back to the horrible days of slavery at Sweet Home. This style also brings us the theme, which is &quot;you are never really free of slavery,&quot; because, the memories and fear, stay with you forever. Toni Morrison fully explores the lasting effects slavery has upon the human soul. Those effects are the theme. Those memories of slavery which scarred Sethe's life, forge her future. Sethe was never able to move on with her life and forget the memories. Ultimately, the hardships that scarred her within caused her to kill her children. When she saw those white men coming to 124, all those memories buried deep within the chasm of her heart resurfaced and the fear she had once experienced at Sweet Home returned. She killed her children, because she never wanted them to experience the horror she had to endure. These events would stay in her memory and haunt her for the rest of the story. The experience of slavery led to chain of events which ruined her life, because she was not able to leave the past in the past and move on. The brilliance of her novel only comes to life when you have read her story very critically. Although you as the reader may be tempted to pass by parts of the story you do not understand, if analyzed critically, those sections may lead to the most critical and interesting imagery and metaphores in the story. One such event is the two turtles coming out of the river. &quot;The gravity of their shields, clashing, countered and mocked the floating heads touching.&quot; The shells of the two turtles keep them away from each other even though they are trying to be with each one another. Their shells are the sheilds people put up in a relationship to keep themselves from being hurt. Because of past experiences, people are afraid to give all of themselves in the fear that, when they are fully exposed, at their most vulnerable, they will be hurt. Even though they love each other, their past still controls their future. This novel, to me, included all that has been stated in the preceeding paragraphs. It was frustrating and confusing at first, when the plot and theme could not be made out easily. Her style confused me, so I read on without thinking about anything else. Only toward the very end, did almost all of the pieces come together. Only then, could I look back and see all the imagery and metaphores I missed. After enduring the novel as a whole, when I looked back upon it and finally understood the style, did I think the book to be well done and planned beautifully."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I just finished reading this book for my English 10 GT class. My first reaction to it was that it wasn't that good. I was very confused on many issues. I thought that there were a lot of open ends. But, I asked my teacher what Beloved symbolized, and she said &quot;Freedom from slavery&quot;. As soon as she said that, all of the open ends immidiatly closed and the pieces fit together. But I find it frustrating not being able to understand what is going on while I read. It changes the effect of the book. It was very sad, though, reading about what the slaves went through, and some still are (though - thank your God not as many). Over all - a good book"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, a book written by Toni Morrison, truly is a fascinating piece of literature. Throughout the book, Morrison truly depicts the reality of slave life in the 1800s. Sethe, the main character, Denver, Paul D., and the ghost (Sethe's dead baby) Beloved, work together to mix a fascinating ghost story filled with action and suspense, with a story showing the life of a group of slaves on the Sweet Home plantation. The story of Beloved unwinds slowly and methodically with much detail and imagery. Personally, Beloved is a wonderful story which I hope you read. You too will experience the satisfaction of a truly extraordinary piece of literature."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Tony Morrison's Beloved is the type of book that separates the readers of serious literature from the readers of escapist fiction. In this masterpiece Morrison has successfully created a magical world where every seemingly trivial detail serves to convey a larger, deeply meaningful theme. Unfortunately, some readers were unable to grasp Morrison's masterful work and went as far as to disparage her writing skills. Sadly, it is obvious that those readers either have some blatant prejudices against the author, or they simply have an aversion to literature that forces them to think. After all, I'm certain that countless \\"readers\\" would proclaim that the works of Grisham, Crichton, and Steel are better than those of Hemingway, Dickens, and Chaucer. I guess this kind of inadequate assessment of literature is what Alexander Pope had in mind when he wrote on his \\"An Essay on Criticism\\" that \\"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I do not believe that I have ever been as moved by a piece of writing as Beloved and as a English Literature student that is no mean feat. Those, and as I see there are a few of you, who believe that the horrors which African-American slaves were subjected to are 'insignificant' should firstly be ashamed by their ignorance and secondly stick to reading the second class 'literature' that they are so obvoiusly used to. Beloved touched my soul and its words, I believe will haunt me always. This is the first of Morrison's works that I have read but it will certainly not be the last."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"While technically this book has a Pulitzer and Nobel prize, I did not find it to be one of the more entertaining works that I've read; but I suppose there is a difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot;. The lack of pleasure I derrived from this book may be partially due to the fact that my 11th grade Honors English class has spent the last 3 months reading and overanylizing every sentence of the book. While I probably would have enjoyed this semi gothic horror story under other circumstances, I did find the characters to be almost simple in their complexness. Never the less, it is a great book if your into the &quot;ex-slave ghost come back from the dead to haunt her family&quot; sort of thing. I guess that what I should be saying is that this book was just not my cup of tea. And HS english students beware, if your english class is anything like ours, all of the pleasure and joy that might have been derrived from reading this otherwise semi-entertaining book will be gone by the time you have finished."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is one of the best books I've read, but like many of Morrison's books, you have to read it very thoroughly to catch all the elements that make it great. I would suggest it to people who enjoy deep reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"With a BA and an MA in English, I have read a few books in my time. Beloved is among the most haunting and substantive novels I have ever studied. I was lucky enough to read it in a graduate seminar, and it has remained in my consciousness ever since. It is a beautiful, devastatingly haunting story. Morrison once said, &quot;People tell me, 'Your novel is on my bed stand.' I don't want books to be what people dip into before they go to sleep.&quot; Beloved is disquieting and that quality is its great strength. If you want light entertainment, read John Grisham."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Haunting. Gripping. Magical realism ... by whatever name, the events at 124 will never let you go. This book is about what it means to love, and a full recognition that both apathy and hate are love's opposites. Richly textured, this is a moderately challenging read ... but worth it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison, once again, manages to create a very powerful novel. Although Beloved is slow at parts, there are enough excelllent characteristics present to grasp your interest. The characters are all incredibly well-developed, and a reader can definitely sympathize with Sethe, and the dramatic decision that she makes. It is a good portrayal of the time period, a women's limitations, and an African American's limitations."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I might get in trouble responding to this review, but... I have a problem when someone goes on and on bashing a masterpiece such as Beloved. Yes, the characters might show ignorace. But when you are a slave, of course you would be ignorant! You never went to school! Now look, people have a right to their opinion, but when they suggest that Toni Morrison should be taken away her Nobel prize just because one reader didn't like it, I have to say something. As for the book... the lines that haunt me are: Beloved, you are my sister, you are my daughter haunt me. For those lines, Ms. Morrison deserved all the prizes she got for the book. And if you don't agree with me, write your own book and see how easy it is."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"BELOVED is, without a doubt, the most incredible, intriguing and intricately written book I have ever read. The plot is beautiful and the descriptive language makes the book come alive. Bringing home the horrors of slavery, Morrison's use of technical language is extremely complex and makes the reader think.Admittedly, it is not a book for those who just want to read for five minutes before they go to bed; you have to be on the ball constantly to understand where Morrison has put you at each change of scene. But for the intellects amongst you this book will stun you, educate you and enthrall you.As I said, this is the classic of the twentieth century - the book that people will read in a hundred years time and say ' that is an amazing book'. Okay. I'm done now.Toni, if you're reading, you are the best living writer."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I first read Toni Morrison's book in 1988 after it had won the Pulitzer, I must admit when I first read it, I hated it, I did'nt get it at all, since that time I read other books by her and thought they were great, so I decided to read Beloved again, I'm glad I did, I paid closer attention to the plot and the charaters in the book, and I was very much surprise, It was emotional and so totatlly tragic, that it moved me to tears, I could understand Beloved's outrage, I have alot of compassion and understanding for the ghost. Slavery was not the issue here, at least it was'nt for me, it was about a life being taken, and the events that led up to that death, Morrison is a gifted writer, can't wait to read her next book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this having already read 'Sula', and expecting something quite similar, however 'Beloved' was a quite different experience. It describes horrific events in such a frank fashion that at first read the reader does not absorb the full extent of the horror. I loved having to work at it, piecing together bit by bit the total story, reviewing it in my head, and adding up the parts that hadn't fitted before. It was an amazing read, but I have to say that I probably will not read it again."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison's portrayal of slavery in BELOVED, is extraordinarily thought out. Sethe's battle with her guilt consumed conscience, caught the reader's interest. Beloved's symbolic nature, demonstrated the ideas of slavery, love, and hatred. Paul D and Mister's relationship was awe-spiring of what went on in the mind of a man who had life changing experiences. All in all, BELOVED was trully exemplary of what a slave-based novel should be."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After reading some of the customer reviews for this novel and for Morrison's most recent work, Paradise (which is, by my estimation at least, a noble failure,) I find myself dumbfounded. Alright, the book is difficult. It is not Tom Clancy, Danielle Steele or John Grisham (hacks all.) Morrison--drawing on the tradition of Joyce and Faulkner--reveals the layers of her extraordinary tale in a stream-of-consciousness style that seems to drive the TV generation to absolute distraction. What she is doing here is called writing. She is not creating film-ready scenes or artificially pumping up chapters with tacked-on cliffhangers or easy-to-swallow editorial commentary. She is forcing us to think, to inhabit her world, to reach into ourselves to understand the primal urges that drive us to both acts of awe-inspiring kindness and horrific cruelty. For that reason alone, this book is a literary treasure, something to stand alongside anything in the so-called canon. The fact that some readers find her use of graphic imagery and &quot;lewd&quot; sexual encounters too unsettling to get through does not mean this book is flawed--indeed, such details, as painful and grotesque as they are, are necessary--this is a story about slavery, for God's sake, not some airheaded romance or summertime beach book. While some critics have made intelligent, well-conceived arguments against the novel's distanced narration and overall premise (is she a ghost or a real woman?,) reviews which trash this masterpiece because it is too hard or too graphic or too Afrocentric are just plain worthless. Morrison is an artist. She is not willing to compromise her storytelling or her politics to appeal to the masses. They already have their condescedning, commerce-motivated no-talents to facilitate their desire for non-caloric &quot;pleasure reading.&quot; Meaning is what Morrison is about. Beloved is her grand statement, a work of genius that leaves just about every other novel in recent memory in the dust."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is the first book by Toni Morrison that I have read, and I was very impressed. Not only is the subject matter extremely interesting and enthralling, but Morrison's writing style is absolutely wonderful to read. A great tale is told with a very heartwarming ending. I would definetely reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book brings the style &quot;magic realism&quot; to it's epitomy. Read ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE if you liked this... This book IS complex, it IS overpowering, and it IS AWESOME!!! I am in high school, and I read it by choice and loved it. I think it's one of the best novels in the English language. Morrison's style is unequaled, and her voice is too. I would also suggest SONG OF SOLOMON, but she is so talented that you can't tell the same person wrote them both. She is an actress with a pen. No wonder she was the first person EVER to be escorted by the king of Sweden when she won the Nobel. BRILLIANT."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I received Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ as a Christmas gift. I started reading it that night and couldn't put it down until I was finished late the next day._Beloved_ explores the complicated relationships among a group of post-Civil War Blacks, and the disturbing consequences of forcing people to live in inhuman conditions. At the heart of the novel is Sethe, an escaped slave attempting to recconcile the brutality of her past--a brutality many feel she was partially complicit in, and a past that literally haunts her.Morrison's techniques are, thankfully, subtle--the subject matter is so disturbing and controversial that to write the story any other way would seem insensitive. Morrison's approach gives us the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; of a situation or character and leaves the reader to draw her own conclustions.The result is a masterful, unbiased portrayal of characters so vivid and multi-dimensional the reader is sorry, if relieved, to see them go. The tale is horrifying, appalling, harrowing, but it is also a testiment to the strength of the human spirit. It explores the atrocities human beings are capable of committing, as well as the strength of resistance. What makes _Beloved_ so gripping is the blurring of the seemingly distinct lines between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot; The reader struggles with his reactions as the characters attempt to reconcile their own."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is without a doubt, the finest book I have ever read. Not only is the story captivating, but its language is rich and poetic. It manages to combine the qualities of a great novel with a captivating story--something which is exceedingly rare. Beloved is not difficult to read but it is exceedingly complex. It is full of the symbolism of Christianity, which Morrison incorporates in heterodox ways throughout the novel--the arrival of the horsemen (Apocalypse) to a Eucharistic vision of the death of the baby whose blood is consumed by Denver and who is &quot;eaten&quot; by the teeth of the saw. It is a deeply psychological novel as well--Baby the superego, Denver the emerging ego and Beloved the demanding id. This was a great book about slavery and women, but it is so much more than that. I could not put it down nor could I stop thinking about it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a very involved book. It has twists and turns to it that make it exciting. It captures your attention. Toni Morrison is a very good writer. She puts excitement into her story and tells things that happened in the 1800's that a lot of people did not or may not have known about. All in all it is excellent."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"The novel allowed you to view slavery and the life afterwards through the eyes of an ex-slave. This novel moves you because of the vivid pictures that Morrison paints in your head while reading about the experiences of slaves on a plantation and their struggle afterwards. The way she writes is not vulgar;however, and allows you to interpret it as you will. After reading the story, I am a little more sympathetic towards the times of slavery. Even as an African-American I still think that I can constantly be made more aware of what happened during that era."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison is definately an extremely talented woman.Her writting style and technique is unlike anything I've read before.Although the book could get somewhat intrict in the thought and description I never lost interest.Since I was reading it for my senoir English class it was easier to understand some of the more difficult symbols scattered throughout the book. i wouldn't recomend Beloved for anyone looking for entertainment, rather you should read it if you are looking for a deeper meaning in slavery. Morrison captures the thoughts and emotions of the characters so well, you almost feel it yourself. I have to admit the mere idea of slavery was often just that, an idea. I never fully understood how aweful the slave experience must have been, not until now. I was more than moved. Morrison was able to bring the words off the page and into my soul. I am changed."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Personally stories in the slavery time period have never interested me all that much. But I enjoyed Toni Morrison's symbolize,writing style and word usage. Some of Beloved's incoherent babbling was interesting yet unsettling. The book focused on all of the individuals lives and not just centerlized on on person. These characteristics made the book more interesting. As I said before I enjoyed the writing but not so much the subject matter."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I personally think is one of the better books I've read especially at school. It was an excellent depiction of what is was like to be a slave.The agony they experienced came to life with her vivid description of the characters and events of their past and present. It gave more understanding to their history than any history book could ever do!! I really enjoyed how Morrison left things unexplained in the beginning and slowly made it clear. It forced you to remember back to what you had read before.The storline itself was excellent. I also enjoyed the fact that all of the slaves stayed together after they left Sweet Home, and were able to share their livess with one another.I only wished that Beloved would have been able to with the family she had lost at such a young age. It was powerful in every direction that it went. I really enjoyed it!!!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"&quot;Beloved&quot; was my first Toni Morrison book ever, and to be honest, I was greatly surprised by her writing style. The way that she writes, her style, is very different from previous authors I have read, and I like it. This novel was one that helped me understand how slavery affected real people. It made everything more personal, unlike the numbers in history books. I'm not sure that I had a specific favorite part in the book, though I did enjoy reading about the life that Halle and Sethe had had together before they split up. I'm not sure if I would ever have read this book unless I had to in my 12th grade AP English class. I'm glad that I read it, though I didn't like all of the book. I hope everyone learns something when they've finished reading, like I have."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"&quot;Beloved&quot; wasn't exactly how I expected it to be. I thought that it would just be another story about a haunted house and a ghost. It turned out to be so much more than that. I guess I never really realized what the Africans went through as slaves. Some parts of the book were so vivid and gruesome. It really opened my eyes about how these people were really treated. The book was very well written. Toni Morrison did a great job of detailing things in such a way that they seemed real. It was one of the best fiction novels I have ever read. I would definately recommend &quot;Beloved&quot; to anyone who is looking for a dramatic, eye opening novel."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"From the first page of the book, to the final words, &quot;Beloved&quot;, by Toni Morrison is a book that I found impossible to put down. Once you open the book, and start reading, you are pulled into the lives and times of Sethe, and the other characters in the book. The only parts that I didn't understand were the parts when Beloved,herself was speaking. Being that she was speaking of a different place, a place that noone has been to to explain it, it is understandable to me that those parts were confusing. The best part, in my opinion was the end. I loved the book, but the way that the last chapter was written was what made my opinion soar. The story was desturbing, but it also made me think of what the slaves really went through. as Toni Morrison said, &quot;It was not a story to pass on.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was really complicating when I first started out. I found it difficult to understand exactly what was happening. But Toni Morrison had a unique way of bringing the story together. It was like putting together the pieces of a puzzle. I liked that. It made me pay attention to what would usually seem like a minor detail. Toni Morrison's way of describing things were good too; crawling already baby, men without skin. It was different and made me think. I also found myself thinking differently about the whole slavery issue. Ever since I was young I've had the same feelings, but this made me understand the horrors that slavery was really about. The one thing that I had trouble dealing with was the fact that Beloved came back as a person, I just find that hard to grasp. But Morrison doesn't really give you the option to agree with it. It's the way it is, matter of fact."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"After reading Beloved I would have to say that it was truly one of the best books that I have ever read, and perhaps the best that Toni Morrison has ever written. My favorite part was when Sethe, Paul D, and Denver all went to the carnival together. It created such a warm picture and really gave me hope for the direction of the book. My least favorite part was the chapter in shich beloved was speaking about the other side where she had been. It was very unclear, and I feel that properly understand it you would have to talk to Toni Morrison personally. Overall though I would again have to say that this book was tremendous, regardless of any unclear parts."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved has been on my BEST book list for years and I return to its wonderful passages for sustenance. The horrors of American slavery which was sanctioned by the US constitution impacted African Americans both physically and emotionally. Beloved allows one to feel the pain of Sethe who realizes that death is better than slavery. The sugary images of slavery as depicted by whites which showed happy Negroes with no desire to be free was a lie. Enslaved Africans always wanted to be free and over 100 US laws had to written to suppress, oppress and repress those dreams. Toni Morrison does a wonderful job of showing how the psychological effect of slavery can transcend generations. The fact that true freedom is in the mind not the body is evinced through Sethe's final emancipation. I cling to Sethe for she embodies the strength of African American women who continue to survive the present horrors of life in the USA."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I agree with the review by Ilana. Beloved is overrated and has been the vehicle by which English teachers from across the country have turned students away from reading. One of those indecipherable books that English teachers thrive on finding hidden meaning where none exists. A muddy piece of writing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"To read a book like Beloved is bewildering, for it requires immersion into an institution so depraved, so removed from the human experience that the main character's actions seem terrifyingly fantastic, as do their supernatural consequences. But Morrison doesn't expect us to fully understand the story, at least not in a single reading, only to experience it and to feel the same frustration and terror her characters feel. She doesn't attempt to explain or unravel slavery; what Morrison does is merely show it to us, not from the circumspect historical perspective, but from the perplexed individual experience. Admittedly, the structure of the novel is dreadfully confusing, but Morrison is making a statement here: See if you, any of you, can get your bearings in this world where the ultimate expression of love is murder.To further complicate things, Morrison doesn't prepare us for anything, particularly the elements of magical realism. Instead, she delves right into a ghost story. But realize that the supernatural is not only accepted as realistic in the African tradition from which these characters were uprooted, it is welcomed. Baby Suggs holy remarks that having a ghost is nothing extraordinary. She tells Sethe to be glad the spirit is that of an infant's and not a full-grown man.I must concede that even with the advantage of first reading this novel in college, with the added wisdom of my professor, Beloved was still a bear of a book to read. Shifts in voice and point-of-view baffled me, particularly the section in which the voices of the three women merge. The story does not offer itself up easily, but neither does the subject of slavery itself. Neither is linear, at least not to the individual memory, which moves in and out and often overlaps or reinvents itself. This is what Morrison calls rememory.In spite of the difficulties, Beloved is a story that every literate person should undertake. Morrison's lyrical prose is nearly reason enough to recommend it, but for the student of literature, especially, the book should be teased apart and combed for the multiple layers of meaning. I've personally looked at the symbolism of trees in the story and felt I only scratched the surface of what Morrison so masterfully weaves into this relatively short book.The basic plot was borrowed from the true story of Margaret Garner, and though it is certainly the unique female chronicle of slavery, of having children &quot;rented out, loaned out, bought up, brought back, stored up, mortgaged, won, stolen or seized&quot; (23), the book is also a painful examination of the male slave's experience, as seen primarily through the character Paul D's eyes. In many ways, the stripping away of hardwearing manhood is even more poignant than the demoralization of women. A rooster named Mister, which walks about freely on the plantation, mocks at the male slaves, who, though sexually depraved, manage to refrain from raping Sethe, the only woman among them. For me, this section of the book was the most painful to read. In another section, Paul D. says to Sethe: &quot;A man ain't a goddamn ax. Chopping, hacking, busting every goddamn minute of the day. Things get to him. Things he can't chop down because they're inside&quot; (69). Who but Morrison could say so much with so little?Beloved is a horrendous, beautiful book too intricate to absorb in an isolated reading. It's one for the collection, to take in slowly. Don't give up on this deservedly acclaimed work of art."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"In a lonely house on the edge of town, Sethe, a runaway slave, lives with her daughter, Denver, and a myriad of ghosts. Only one actually makes its presence known, a baby daughter, killed many years earlier, who dumps bowls, throws things, and makes handprints in cake icing. But Sethe's mind is haunted, also, by the ghosts of her past. There is her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, whose life is forever altered when Sethe makes a horrible decision one fateful day; Halle, Sethe's husband, who didn't meet her in the cornfield to run away like he'd said; her mother, whom Sethe saw hanged for a reason she never knew; her sons, Howard and Buglar, who ran away and never returned; and perhaps most importantly, the ghost of herself, the Sweet Home girl whose precious mother's milk was stolen away the night Schoolteacher and his nephews chose to use her for sport, an experience so unspeakable, it culminated in Sethe's act of desperation in the cold house.When Paul D arrives unexpectedly, he breathes life back into a house long dead, and hope back into a woman whose indelible emotional and literal scars have forced her long ago to dispense with wishful thinking. When a second unexpected guest arrives, Beloved, Sethe, still entertaining ideas about how even she can build a life, with Paul D and Denver, doesn't pick up on the uncanny aura surrounding the strange girl; her name, her new shoes, her difficulty walking, her knowledge about details of the past she could not possibly know unless...she was a part of the past...Through poetical prose that evokes magical imagery and the horrific truth of slavery, Toni Morrison creates a riveting story. She takes admirable risks in writing technique, such as stream of consciousness and dialect, and though at times it is hard to follow, like a maze, it is well worth the effort, when the labyrinth opens up on a field of enchanting enlightenment. Morrison relies on beliefs of folklore like, \\"people who die bad don't stay in the ground,\\" and facts of history surrounding pre and post Civil War times to weave in and out of past and present, imagination and reality, thought and conversation.There is so much underlying the surface of this story. It is not just a ghost story or a romance, though both those elements are present. It is a story so overwrought with devastation that sadness is almost a character itself. But it is also a story about the strength of the human spirit. Through sheer determination, Sethe escaped death and made it to Ohio, and it was determination again that would not allow her to let her children suffer an existence like hers had been. When her determination falters, usurped by the demands of Beloved, it finds a foothold in Denver, who overcomes her fears of leaving the vicinity of the house. She takes comfort in a vision she has of Baby Suggs telling her to accept what she is afraid of, to \\"know it and go on out the yard.\\" Denver does, resolved to do whatever necessary to prevent all that is embodied in Beloved - cruelty, sorrow, and anger - from finally and absolutely overtaking her and her mother."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"A mother's act of love, by all conventional measure horrendous, is the source of conflict in Toni Morrison's Beloved. Determined to protect her children, Sethe does the unthinkable--an act which poses serious questions in terms of morality. Her actions create nearly unbearable consequences for not only herself, but her teenage daughter Denver as well. Their home, once filled with love and constant companionship becomes inhabited by the spirit of an angry baby lamenting her premature death. Strangely, the dead baby holds so much control over Sethe and Denver, and succeeds in making them miserable and nervous, even from the other side of the grave. Skillfully, Toni Morrison enters the realm of the super-natural, transporting her reader to a lonely house where strange visions, inexplicable occurrences, and constant terror are commonplace. But somehow, in the midst of these unusual and frightening events, Beloved maintains a power of meaning and sense of reality.Unusual events are the driving forces behind the novel's success. Beloved's return nineteen years after Sethe held her in her arms as a baby is a major turning point in the novel, as Beloved has power over everything that she wishes. Beloved's control over Denver and Sethe raises so many questions in terms of what she is capable of. Her physical presence alters the dynamics of the family so dramatically that Denver, Beloved's sister, must intervene to avoid certain harm. Beloved's strange presence introduces an entirely new element to the novel, as the reader unravels the mystery of her origin and purpose.Another level of Morrison's storytelling power relates to a recurring theme. Interspersed throughout the novel are references to Sethe's uncontrollable \\"rememory.\\" These are the memories that Sethe feels obliged to carry, even though they cause her great pain. For whatever reason, she feels the responsibility to keep them alive. In her dedication to thepreservation of these memories at whatever cost to her, Sethe is immediately established as a loving mother tragically consumed with love for her children. She seems unable to control herself any time that her kin are involved. She wants so desperately to be a family, or at the very least, she hopes to create one. It is only through Beloved's return that Sethe is able to feel relief about the decision that she made so many years ago and finally let go to the most painful parts of her rememory. This powerful creation allows us access to the source Sethe's secret sadness.Morrison's work is truly masterful. Her characters are complex; existing just beyond that which we know and understand. Exposition is beautifully executed, providing a base for the complicated story of Sethe and Beloved. The narrative is, like the story itself, a model of creativity. The voice changes from an unidentified third person, to Sethe, to Denver, and then to Beloved. The effect of this switch could be achieved in no better way, as Morrison conveys the common goals and concerns of each character. All factors combine to make Beloved the picture of good writing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a challenging book that tests the reader's knowledge and capabilities to comprehend and master the not-so-clear chronological order of events. If you couldn't follow that sentence, then don't read Beloved. It is a powerful book, written in a distinctive style that some might consider &quot;choppy&quot;. However, that is where the beauty lies. This book makes you think. Some of my colleagues think that Morrison has too many hidden meanings and messages in her storyline. That also adds to the beauty of the book. Any idiot can write a story..once upon a time....etc. it takes more than that to write something that is the caliber of Beloved. Those who think that it is confusing, true, true. Those who dislike the book BECAUSE it is confusing might want to rethink their reasons. Beloved is a moving story about slavery, freedom, spirits, guilt, and love. It is the setting that makes the book so powerful, the era and end of slavery. Some criticize Morrison for writing about slavery itself, as if the subject should just curl up and die. No, it shouldn't. We sense that they are touchy about the issue (or else why sould they want to censor it) and that adds to the book's power. It plays with our sense of morality, it makes us feel uncomfortable. That is what a Nobel-prize winning book should do. It should leave a footpring on our life, not blow away like a wisp of smoke."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a beautifully written novel. It's amazing how Morrison can make you feel all the pain, sadness, anger, happiness, and most of all, the confusion that the characters feel.Though the writing was exceptional, I found the content to be grotesque, and I admit that some parts were too graphic for my taste. Though some people may like reading books like that, I didn't. I suppose it's because I'm not used to it. I know that even though I didn't like reading it, things like that still happened.Morrison pushes controversy to the limit by putting a good spin on a heinious crime. Though she never supports nor criticizes Sethe's actions, you get the impression that Morrison approved of Sethe's decision to kill her daughter. Sethe, after all, is the protagonist.Morrison is excellent at what she does, and though I didn't love the book, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"At first, this book was addicting. Halfway through, new characters and themes were introduced without ample explanation, leaving me wondering &quot;Did I miss something??&quot;. I may have indeed missed something. Perhaps I lack the intelligence needed to understand this book. The parts I did understand I found were quite poignant and mysterious. I'm currently struggling through the last 60 pages or so. I skim-read the last page and I know it's poignant, but the journey there has been long and confusing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Set in post-Civil War Ohio, BELOVED focuses on the life of Sethe, a mother of three and a slave. Sethe decides to run away from her owners hoping to find a better life and future for her children, but when she is caught, she makes the decision that death must be better than the life of a slave. &quot;Out of love&quot; she tries to take the lives of her children, succeeding in only one. This decision comes back to haunt her as Beloved, the ghost of her baby daughter. In this novel, Sethe battles with guilt put on her conscience by Beloved and is willing to lose everything to regain the love of this lost child.When I started reading this novel I soon realized that this was not going to be an easy one. Morrison's style of writing is quite difficult, she jumps back and forth in time without warning. However the flashbacks she uses represent the things that have helped to form the characters. I think that Morrison wrote this novel like a puzzle. Throughout the story, she would give bits and pieces of information to the reader and would leave it up to the reader to put those pieces in place. This style is at the same time the most frustrating, and the most rewarding part of the story. I constantly found myself flipping back and forth through the pages trying to make sense of what Morrison was trying to tell me. I have never read a book with this style of writing before so this made me stress and get frustrated a lot. But, when the pieces finally started to come together, I felt proud that I was able to do so. It's hard to judge Morrison's book. Judging it would have to depend on an individual's opinion. If I had to choose, I would likely not read another book by her again. Don't get me wrong, Beloved was a fantastic book. I just don't like to have to constantly keep flipping back and forth because it starts to get annoying. One positive thing about Morrison's style is that she was able to keep the reader in the book and always have her asking herself questions. The content of the book was excellent. Morrison described her characters well. I really got to know and understand the characters. Morrison's descriptions of her scenes really painted pictures in my mind. The story itself about how Sethe, the main character, killed her baby girl to protect her from the hardships of slavery was shocking. How can someone kill their own child in order to protect them from the undetermined future? Was Sethe a murderer or a hero? This and other bad memories of slavery were in Sethe's mind constantly. The quality of Beloved is based more on the reader's opinion then anything else and if one is not very good at \\"reading between the lines\\" this book is very confusing and requires a lot of re-reading."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is indeed an important and meaningful novel.With a very unique,personal,descriptive prose Morrison tells a story that weaves the reader through the characters history,back and forwards in time,revealing piece by piece the motivations behind the events the reader gradually learns of.While some may not appreciate the finely layered text with all its intricacies(Education students perhaps? ),which requires something of the reader(see brackets),when one becomes involved and absorbed the reader is richly rewarded.Noteworthy is Morrison's ability to deal with a subject-emancipation,slavery-that has been covered from so many angles,in so many ways.The characters are clearly defined and the reader can personally empathise with their ordeals,evoking a real response on a sublect that could have been either trite,stereo-typed or powerless.Simply to write a novel set against slavery,in 1987 and have it so moving and so individual is an outstanding achievement.Highly recommended for the discerning reader."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is the sort of book that lingers within your mind long after you finish reading the last page. Beloved is a puzzle-read. The pieces slowly form a picture---sometimes even a blurry one. It is not an easy read, but is a challenging one at that, weaving together a host of complex details and a magnitude of emotions.I had to read several passages in their entirety several times to truly grasp their contents--basically because the story line is difficult to fathom. Sethe's sufferings and pains, her dillusionary visions, her emotional sacrifices, and her never ending ability to love are so forcefully explicit in Beloved.The mind is a labyrith of ideas. The heart is a labyrith of emotions. Beloved is a labyrith of both."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved contains a subject that Morrison has not dealt with before: slavery. While the novel has been controversial, Morrison has been honest and unflinching in her look at the effects of slavery and a mother's love for her children. Beloved certainly deserves the acclaim it has received. However, I do not believe that this novel is Morrison's best.As someone who has read five Morrison novels in the past four months, perhaps this review won't be completely fair. Beloved is well-written and original, but I am not sure that it lives up to it's reputation. I am well-aware that if a person were to pick up any Morrison novel, they would probably read this one first. But I also hope that they would read her other works after. I do think that this is a terrific novel, but I also think that her other works deserve just as much acclaim, if not more."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison is an incredible writter of our time.

But it will pull you in and absorb you, if you let it. It is a book that you should just let flow over you the first time; let it make sense of itself as it unfolds, don't try to force it into place. It was one of the most moving and tragic books I have ever read. I devoured this book and was terrified when the movie came out; this is not a book that can easily be put on the big screen. Don't read this book because Oprah said to or because you saw the movie. Read it because you delight in Morrison's language and you want to hear the moving and torturous story she tells."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved is a beautifully written story about the horrors of slavery. This description barely scratches the surface of Toni Morrison's enchanting yet confusing tale of slavery at its worst. The novel mainly tells of Sethe, a freed slave that is struggling with her past. A past that she desperately is trying to forget in order to move on and protect her daughter Denver, the only of her four children that has remained with her. The others, Howard and Buglar, had run away from the ghost of Beloved, who was murdered by Sethe's hand. This little amount of information alone is not made known to the reader until after the first few chapters, where the story finally starts to take off, but in too many directions. Morrison's style is as complicated as the story line of Beloved and is as branched as the scar on Sethe's back. It is as if Morrison just wrote down what came to her in no particular order. There are many different &quot;mini&quot; plots going on at once, such as Sethe's and Paul D's stories, which makes the reader confused. It is especially confusing when one chapter talks about Sethe and the next chapter tells of Paul D's chain gang, mentioned chapters before. More so, Paul D's and Sethe's voices aren't the only ones in the book. The story changes points of view many times from Sethe to Paul D to Denver, Beloved, Baby Suggs, and even Stamp Paid. Baby Suggs is dead and Stamp Paid is not even a main character; yet we know more about him then we should, while we know less about Beloved and Halle, important characters in which Morrison leaves us guessing about. What happened to Halle? How did Beloved come back and why? These are just two of the unanswered questions Morrison fails to answer. It is not as if there were no opportunities to answer these questions. In fact the story is so full of flashbacks, that it is at times hard to tell the difference between past and present. Sure, Morrison's style keeps the reader waiting for answers and anticipating to find out what happens or happened, but at times in leaves the reader surrounded in confusion that makes the novel frustrating. Adding to the frustration and beauty of Beloved is the heavy symbolism Morrison uses. Every page seems to have something with a double meaning. Readers are forced to read between the lines and to try and figure out what they mean and how important it is to the story. Trees are used often in Beloved to symbolize barriers such as those between Sethe and Paul D, Sethe and her past, and Denver and the world. Similarly, the turtles trying to mate symbolizes the barrier between Paul D and Sethe, which is the past. Beloved herself could symbolize the past, due to her causing Sethe to speak of her memories which she rather forget. All this symbolism adds to the richness of the writing in Beloved, yet can annoy readers. Trying to find the meanings of all these symbols can be disturbing, leaving you wondering if you caught on to what Morrison intended to imply. I had a love/hate relationship with Beloved. Overall, I liked it more than I hated it. It was more than just an angry slave story. The characters were realistic, I sympathized with Sethe, but I don't think killing her child was the right thing to do. I felt sorry for Denver and her loneliness, and I could not believe that Paul D. could sleep with Beloved and not tell Sethe. The story, although most times confusing, paid off in the end for me. I got a satisfaction when I put all the pieces together and understood most of the story at the end. The slavery, the escape, the murder, the haunting, the return...it makes better sense when you have read everything and can put it in order. Of course , not everything is summed up perfectly. The last chapter is a loss to me, and the chapters with Beloved's point of view is too confusing; punctuation and complete sentences would have helped to make it clearer. Also, I would have liked to see what happened in the future with Sethe, Paul D, and Denver. I think ending the story with a bright hope for the future would have been good since it was filled with the horrors of the past. I would recommend this book to those who are tired of the regular style of writing and who enjoy stories about slavery and human struggles, but be prepared to be frustrated; this book is not for the impatient."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This is a book about a woman who killed one of her children to keep them from being a slave. (Why did she kill that particular child and not the others?) Later the child comes back, fully living in adult form because of how much they loved each other, or something like that. Get out of here. That's so ridiculous I can't even suspend my disbelief. The mother and the revived ghost-daughter end up being co-dependent and obsessed with each other, and some other drama ensues. The grammar is purposely very poor and some of the chapters were done entirely in poems with a lot of symbolism that didn't really fit into the story, and seemed to be there just because of how it sounded.There were some good parts to the book, like some of the characters and the talking about the past, but I really think this book is highly overrated, and I'm someone who loves to read; classics, modern books, junk books, you name it. I'm going to be very controversial and say that whatever judges decide books are \\"great\\" have a bias: if a black person writes about slavery, the book is automatically considered a classic, just because of the subject matter. (And maybe it's like this with other historic horrors too.) Well I'm sorry, but I still think a book needs to be well-written, regardless of the subject matter. To Kill A Mockingbird was an excellent book about racism, and Amy Tan writes a lot of great books about the lives of Chinese immigrants. These books are about heavy subjects, but the writers actually took the effort and told a real story with a strong plot. I'm sure there are also great books about slavery and that I will find them, but this a mediocre book that just happens to be about slavery."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I was lucky enough to read this book before the movie came out and i was glad i did.

In this incredible book, Morrison paints a picture of the end of a woman's slavery and the ghost she carries with her. Definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Getting at the intimate damage slavery did to each slave's psyche is the heart of \\"Beloved.\\" Most of the slaves in the novel live at \\"Sweet Home\\" where the Gardners treated them well, even letting Baby Suggs gain her freedom. But eventually, the Gardners are no longer in charge and the slaves no longer enjoy the same treatment. But whether treated well or not, the threat of being sold off, of family members being separated and women raped is always present.Beloved as a character is such a leap of faith and she could easily have been ridiculous or obvious but she is neither. And it is because she works so well as a character that the novel holds the sorrow of slavery as something felt from the inside rather than viewed from afar. No matter how many times you read about the beatings, the break up of families, the horrendous treatment, those factual representations can't convey the damage and destruction done inside each and every slave simply for being a slave. Those factual representations suggest, probably unwittingly, that if bad things weren't done to slaves then slavery wasn't so bad for those individuals. Morrison by focusing in \\"Beloved\\" on the psychic damage done to each and every slave, of their being a commodity rather than a human being, gets at the true horror which is how each slave was ripped apart and denied the very qualities that allow people to succeed in the world with their dignity intact. There is no dignity in slavery and \\"Beloved\\" makes it clear that without that, humanity is disgraced and demeaned."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I can't accurately describe how deep this book was. As a female, this book just felt so genuine and well written. Morrison's descriptions of the supernatural make them seem very real. You really have to read it for yourself (and make sure you finish before you judge it!)."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved, written by Toni Morrison, is a well-crafted, beautifully written piece of work. The tale immediately captures the reader by beginning with the line \\"124 was spiteful. Full of baby's venom\\" (Morrison, 3). Morrison draws the plot by starting with the incident of Sethe's, a freed slave, daughter's death. Sethe and her daughter Denver, color the pages, dealing with the literal haunting of the baby, the arrival of Paul D, a man who worked on the same plantation, and the found girl, Beloved. The novel takes place shortly after the Civil War's end, initiating the release of slaves. Sethe, her daughter Denver, Paul D, and the rest of Sethe's children, among others left the same plantation, Sweet Home. Sethe is constantly haunted by the things she has been faced with and the images she has seen, walking away with a scar shaped like a tree whipped into her back representing the mental pain she has endured. With the introduction of Beloved's character and Paul D's coming back into her life, the journey does not stop for Sethe, bringing about more problems, with a supernatural force. Beloved represents the spirit of the dead baby in the novel, and Paul D's character brings back the past for Sethe making everything real again, finally when she thinks that she has found love again, Paul D finds out the secret that Sethe has been hiding. The novel is a beautiful tale that never lets up. Morrison does an explicit job of holding the reader in and commanding their attention with her elegant and raw writing."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Dealing with the past: In the most abstract, non-contextual, sense, Toni Morrison explores the issue of dealing with the past. Beloved is a story about former slaves. From here, you see the destroyed identities these characters have due to slavery and their own inability to cope with the past and past actions. It inhibits one to form a coherent self-identity, thus an inability to learn how to deal with traumas and go forward. Lastly, there is something to be said about community. Community is needed. It provides solidarity, the connections that people need for social support, whatever it might be. Sethe's past actions cut that support from the community. However, the community is also at fault for their view of Sethe and Baby Suggs. Both sides eventually reconcile and that is what Morrison explores. Dealing with the past: You must reconcile what has happened with what is happening in order to have a better feature. However, you cannot do that without knowing what has happened. This is what the character Denver represents, someone willing to ignore the past and thus unable to reconcile herself and her current situation. When she is confronted with knowledge of the past and learning what has happened instead of ignoring history, she starts to reconcile her family with the community.In turn, the community begins to reconcile with the residents of 124 and make up for their past mistakes Make no mistake though, this is about the destruction slavery has caused and while sad and depressing, the end provides an idea of hope: That eventually we can reconcile what has happened with what is happening and build a better future. Lastly, I applaud Morrison for her use of the supernatural. Whether drawn from African Culture or use of Christian Symbolism, it adds to the story because it implies there is something greater than ourselves that will make us confront that which we do not want to confront."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"January's book club pick!

This novel is based upon a true story of infanticide and slavery. This book is full of gothic elements and acts of terrible violence. Sethe's present and past have caused her to be abandoned by the community. Sethe escaped from the farm \\"Sweet Home\\" with her four children, but after only twenty- eight days of freedom she was captured by her old master. Rather than allowing her children to be returned to slavery she attempted to kill all of them, succeeding only in killing the baby girl \\"Beloved\\". After her master decided that she was no longer fit to serve, Sethe was released to raise her three remaining children at 124. Beloved's ghost began to haunt the house causing Sethe's to sons to flee after encounters with the ghost. Sethe's busy career as a cook didn't allow her to spend time with her daughter Denver. Denver the only one left in the house is eighteen years old and terribly afraid to even get up enough courage to leave the yard. All of the characters of this novel, are former slaves, children of former slaves, and suffer a troubled relationship to their own past.

Mesmerizing style of writing with the story-line weaving in and out, back and forth through time and location. That loose time thread sometimes makes for confusion in the reader's mind - as indeed it confuses Sethe, the protagonist with a deep dark secret that loosened the anchors of her mind.The story begins with hints (well, more than hints) of a dead child, a ghost, a runaway slave, and all the horrors associated with those issues. But the writing, Oh, the writing! It reads like poetry, words wrapping around images, caressing them from all angles, shaping them like wet river clay into the precise phrases needed to reshape the structure and flow of the story.Parts are so graphic that it becomes difficult to continue reading; parts are so touching that rereading is desired; parts are so lyrical that they just flow along like a slow, sultry river in LouisianaAnd most readers don't quite see the end coming till it's right upon them. There are a bazillion hints as to what's really behind Sethe's often inexplicable words and actions and memories, but they are leaked out one by one, like slow drips from a leaky faucet. When the truth comes, spelled out in screaming letters, it's still a shock.Mandatory reading on many levels: history, literature, style of writing, and message."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book artisticly shows the horrors of slavery and the culture that came from it.

That is not the case with &quot;Beloved,&quot; which won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Renowned author, Toni Morrison, writes powerfully affecting prose about slavery and its aftermath, drawing you in and holding you from first to last page. This novel is aging well, and deserves ever more readers.The tale revolves around Sethe, all she has felt and witnessed and does not want to remember. These &quot;rememories&quot; come out piecemeal during the early years of the Reconstruction era, when Sethe and those who slaved together at Sweet Home farm are freed, dead or missing. &quot;To Sethe,&quot; writes Morrison, &quot;the future was a matter of keeping the past at bay.&quot; Supressed memory, too painful to retrieve whole, is forced to the surface bit by bit, by circumstances that keep the story flowing.Sethe escapes Sweet Home before the end of slavery and gives birth to her daughter, Denver, en route to the home of her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, in Cinicinnati, Ohio. Loneliness pervades the lives of Sethe and Denver, after Baby Suggs's death, until two people show up unexpectedly to unravel their self-imposed isolation. First Paul D, a former slave from Sweet Home arrives and captures Sethe's affections. Later the eponymous Beloved, a mysterious young woman who befriends Denver and comes to dominate the household.As the details of the past acrue for both Sethe and the reader, we come to understand the full measure of pain and burden that has shaped this woman and those she loves. Her heart, body and soul, formed in the cauldron of slavery, are permanently scarred, and drive her to the terrible deed at the center of the story.In &quot;Beloved,&quot; Morrison has created a North American version of the mystical realism style for which South American writers are acclaimed. The physical world is animated, ghosts are real, and nature is a character, particularly through the eyes and hearts of Paul D and Baby Suggs. Morrison weaves a rich metaphysical world that recalls Michael Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient,&quot; particularly in the way she captures a haunted mind, roving different parts of its past, all the while suffering physically in the present. In syntax and rhythms that are never heavy handed, we enter a world full of folk wisdom, and an abiding and fulfilling intimacy with nature.Many know of the horrors of slavery--including branding, whipping, seperation of families, rape--a world where, as Morrison puts it, even a rooster has more selfhood than a black man. This story dryly chronicles those horrors, and shows us how intrinsically Sethe's and Paul D's ability to survive and love are shaped by their emotional and physical scars.This heart-wrenching tale should be read by all Americans, not because it would be good for them to understand this piece of our history better, but because of Morrison's unforgettable characters and powerfully poetic prose."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This symbolic story provides it readers with a keen sense of slavery and its' affects. With vivid images, Morrison reincarnates Beloved, a daughter of Sethe, an escaped slave, who was killed 18 years prior the main story line. Throughout the novel, the reader gets the sense that Sethe has been living with guilt. It is until Beloved's arrival, we actually find out why. Born into slavery, Sethe realizes that she does not want her children to face the hardships she faced. In effort to give them a better life, she decides they are better off dead than alive. Successful with taking the life of only one child, Beloved, Sethe tries to convince herself that she is right. Through out the rest of novel, readers are engaged in the thinking process of Sethe. We learn why and how copes with the presence of her daughter. Readers are also in engaged in the new relationships Beloved has created with Sethe, her younger sister, and Mr. Paul, a friend of the family Readers are have the opportunity to view slavery from the perspective of one who was enslaved. We are captured into Sethe mind and thoughts, which encourages the justifications for her taking the life of her daughter. Through powerful imagery, we feel the pain Sethe has felt. Readers are also persuaded to think about who does Beloved represent. Slavery, sexual abuse, discrimination, and sibling rivalry are appropriate discussions. This novel is suitable for readers who can critically engage in topics mentioned above."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved the book was my fifth read of Toni, at this point it was a little easier knowing her better, but still I think she had gone a level better than in her other past works. Beloved depresses you terribly but you want/have to read on, its an emotional journey that is more important to one especially when you are black, because then it affects you in a way more direct. Even though it set in the 1800s, it is a story that transcends time limits. The poetry mixed with the story is striking and so relevent. I think you must love Toni as a writer/link between minds that think/feel alike to understand and appreciate what she has tried and to great degree achieved to do with 'BELOVED'. Which is not just the name of the ghost-child."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Forget Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover. To truly appreciate the beauty that is Toni Morrison's Beloved, you must read the text itself and submerge yourself within Morrison's wondrous web of poetic prose. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the film adaptation of this book; enough critics have praised its success as enough critics have panned its failure. But after finishing this book, only a few hours ago, I remind myself of the staying power of words on a page. And, boy, does Morrison pack a punch!Beloved tells the tale of Sethe, a beautiful runaway slave, who lives alone in a haunted house her daughter, Denver. Eighteen years ago, Sethe escaped from Sweet Home, a fairly pleasant place to live under slavery, all things considered, until the schoolteacher came along. Then, fearing for the lives and futures of her children, Sethe takes them and runs. Sending her two oldest sons ahead with her nine-month old daughter, the very pregnant Sethe follows behind.She delivers her baby just before she arrives at her mother-in-law's house in Ohio. For Sethe, however, freedom does not come easily. While she may have run away from her master, she cannot run away from her past. Unable to reconcile the crime of infantcide in order to save her daughter from a life as a breeder, or worse, Sethe is shunned by the local town and lives only a shell of a life, haunted by the baby ghost of the already-crawling? daughter she murdered years ago.Paul D chases the baby ghost away. One of six Pauls at Sweet Home, Sethe welcomes him into her home and bed, grateful for the comfort he represents of the past. Her husband long presumed dead, and her mother-in-law literally so, Sethe has nothing in her life except her work as a cook and her moody, selfish daughter.And then Beloved comes, wearing a pristine, white silk dress and new shoes, her hands and feet bearing no callouses from work or age. She appears to be a young adult, confused and lost in her environment, with no memory of her past and no desire for a future, save to be a part of Sethe's life. She knows things about Sethe and even sings the lullabye that no one but the children would ever know. Beloved is Sethe's dream-come-true: the living, breathing representation of perfection, with clean, shiny skin, soft, curly hair, and beautiful eyes. To Sethe, Beloved is also an innocent lost, much like her youngest child, Denver, one who must be protected, nurtured, and saved. In doing so, however, Sethe becomes prey to Beloved's passionate desire to consume her long-lost mother.Yes, indeed, it's true. Beloved is Sethe's dead daughter, come back to haunt her. I spoil nothing by mentioning this. It's fairly apparent in Morrison's work that Beloved is Sethe's daughter. Yet it is how Morrison deftly, creatively, masterfully unfolds the tragic mystery of Sethe and Beloved that makes this work so memorable. Or, as Morrison might describe it, rememorable. In any case, Beloved's appearance is at first joyful for Sethe, and then the horror sets in.What happens? Well, I'm not one to spoil that sort of thing... you'll just have to read the book. Can you watch the movie instead? Only if you really want to miss one of the most masterful works of literature ever produced. Really, I'm serious... Beloved is exceptional. When I closed the book after finishing the last page, I was near tears and emotionally exhausted, yet I felt something uplifting beneath it all. Perhaps, like Sethe, like Denver, like Paul D, and even like Beloved, you can, too.Now, could you live with yourself for missing something this special?"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Very few writings have provoked me to an extent where even months later they cloud my thoughts. However these works generally revolve around one person, Toni Morrison. After reading each of the six novels, I felt as if the inside of me had been ripped apart. But the novel that wields her weapon most effectively is Beloved. Mrs. Morrison conveys the anguish of sixty million slaves in the space of its few hundred pages. But she does it without preaching; not once does she blame anyone. Instead her magic lies in the realistic pain and suffering relayed by the main character, Sethe. I felt so helpless as I was reading, angry at myself for not being able to do anything. Each time Sethe was hurt, I would flinch. I felt humiliation when she was called an animal, and fear when her owner came after her. Beloved's power lay in this ability to reach beyond the material pages of the book. It raised awareness in me of what enslavement creates. It taught me how powerful love can be. I know that I will never truly understand nor feel the amount of pain the slaves did, but Beloved shed light on what I had not seen before."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"This book was actually supposed to be one of the books for a class I cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. It was also listed as one of the best American novels of the past 25 years...so I kept it even after canceling the class. While it was an interesting story and a thought provoking read, I had a hard time with this book for a few different reasons.Writing StyleThe narrative was written in a close third person following very closely alongside the minds of a few main characters, Sethe primarily but also Denver, Paul D and some other characters who showed up later (Stamp & even Beloved herself). The voices used were likely fairly authentic to the voices of mid/late-1800 recently freed slaves in America. The grammar was a little mixed up at times, but generally very understandable.The grammar wasn't as difficult to follow as the actual style of the voices themselves. Often, I was caught in a sort of stream-of-consciousness type narrative from one of the characters. Being pulled that far inside the character's head made it difficult for me to keep my bearings or perspective clear. The roundabout way subjects were treated left me confused and really slowed down the reading for me while I tried to keep the message straight. I'm not sure if this disorientation was intentional or if it's my own personal distance from this type of character that made it hard, but that was my primary complaint with the book.Characters, Setting, Tone, etc.The characters were well created and very alive to me, especially as the book progressed. Even though the 'stream of consciousness' writing hung me up a lot, it also helped me get to know the characters better. I felt like I understood Sethe and Denver much better after getting into their heads.The settings fluctuated back and forth for me...sometimes they felt extremely real and vivid and other times they felt very flat and clapboard/2-d.My biggest complaint with the characters and the setting was that I often lost site of the fact that this was set in the mid-1800s in a post-civil-war/abolitionist nation just rising out of slavery. The tone of the novel was often the largest element, and that tone often didn't ring \\"post-civil-war\\" to me.Again, it could be my distance from the subject but many times through the book, it was almost a shock to be reminded that these characters had just recently been living on a plantation as slaves. Most of the time while I was reading, my mind conjured up a more contemporary setting...people living in a poor borough in the 1900s, perhaps even the late-1900s.Maybe that should be a compliment to the story rather than a detractor...it shows that this is a Timeless sort of tale that could easily happen 150 years ago or last week.ThemesThis novel presented a number of strong messages.The racial message was naturally there loud and clear. It came as a strong reminder of the horrific reality that was slavery in the U.S.A...and the racism that followed after abolitionism...and even today. I loved the line where Sethe comments that she has her freedom now, but she's still not free.That sense of freedom leads into another major theme, that of Identity. Sethe and these other ex-slaves are trying to redefine themselves in a world that has chewed them up and spit them out. Beyond the slave reference, Sethe and her family have an added stigma because of Beloved. All of the characters come face-to-face with their own identity (or lack thereof) and have to take major actions to determine what they want to become.The other major theme that struck me was that of Family and of relations within the Family. Most of what Sethe did was for her family. She was driven to escape slavery to protect and provide a better life for her family. She ran with her kids in tow to the tool shed when the white authorities came, because she had to protect her family. She went to prison for her family. She lived alone and stigmatized in a haunted house in an effort to keep her family whole. And yet, her actions also served to drive her family apart. Her sons leave as soon as they feel physically capable of doing so. Her remaining living daughter Denver is totally estranged and practically ignored by her. Going back to the \\"identity\\" factor, Sethe hasn't really learned how to be a mother and has to learn what it means to create a family in the world she's living in.OverallOverall I had a hard time with this book. It was a very slow read for me, often talking itself in circles and leaving me confused. Still, I found the story very interesting and thought provoking. I felt awful for Sethe and her family and for the trials they had to endure. Even though, as I mentioned above, I felt that the 'slavery' theme often got overshadowed, I was still struck by the awful fact that slavery did exist (still exists some places in the world) and just how awful it was. Even the \\"good\\" slave owners (of \\"Sweet Home\\" where Sethe ran from) were despicable and made me shrink in shame.It was a good book, but hard to read. I don't know how good the movie was, but if it's true enough to the book, I might recommend watching that rather than trying to push through the book.Still, it's worth reading if only to get a new insight into the world of slavery and racism that raged (and still lingers) in America and the world.***3 stars"},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Written about slavery and post-slavery travails and the impossibility to enjoy new-found freedom, the horrors experienced by the family of Baby Sugg - most particularly her daughter-in-law, Sethe, and her granddaughter, Denver - lead us to cry for each and their Beloved.To anyone who has not read Morrison, I give one warning: her topics are very depressing. But, her writing style is not. Therefore, she manages to capture your attention in reading about horrible events and opens your mind to things which we ordinarily do not read about or learn: for instance, after majoring in American History, I learned for the first time in this book that black men would be punished by having a tack put into their mouth at which time their mouths became deformed, tongue dried to the point of needing weeks to repair, and became mentally humiliated to an unknown degree.There is a bit of Stephen King in this book - an apparition with the single name of Beloved returns to the family. To avenge? Or, to love? Or by her love is she an avenger? In any event, this character speaks few words but influences Denver and Sethe immensely, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.One force which seems to wrestle sanely in the insanely cruel world of slavery is Paul D. After having experienced worse tortures, mental and physical, than most others, he maintains a balanced perspective. He is the ballast to Sethe's tumultuous inner conflict. Sethe, we learn, experiences a \\"Sophie's Choice\\" situation which others view with disdain, but which we learn to understand. Even though we may not agree to the same, we understand. Morrison explains to us why good people can perform bad acts. In most simplest terms, she writes their reason of being good people that do bad things is, \\" That anybody white could take your whole self for anything that came to mind. Not just work, kill, or maim you, but dirty you. Dirty you so bad that you couldn't like yourself anymore.\\"But, those who had been slaves sought to protect their young - those who would be born free or became free before their memories jelled - from having this white-man manifestation of hate for self.Strong topic. Strong delivery. Unique writing style. Great novel. Deeply touching. Deeply depressing. Probably, one of those never-to-be-forgotten works which you will remember for years after you turned the last page."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"I read this novel, because somebody voted it to be the most important American novel of the last quarter century. I like to have my own opinion about such things and hence I had to see for myself. I had to fight some negative expectations: I had not managed to like Morrison's Jazz at all, despite being a jazz fan. I found her narrative style just annoying. It ignores what you, the reader, can possibly know about the protagonists, and forces you to postpone understanding. Not a nice treatment of readers.At that time I did not like TM's way, but now is different.With Beloved, it also took me some time getting into it. She does have her particular and peculiar narrative style. It does not come easy. The difficulties may not seem really necessary.Forget about that.This is one powerful story and it is powerfully told.You may have to read it twice to get it completely, possibly. Do it.Morrison's language is strong and captivating on the microlevel. You get caught into the different sub-plots and stories. You see the people in the story.On the macrolevel, you have to accept that some things are not clear, for the time being. O.k., as I said, read it twice.I see no need to repeat the content summaries, that has been covered. Let me just emphasize my complete agreement with the positive reviews of Beloved. One item I would like to emphasize strongly: I have never read a book where I felt so completely \\"othered\\". This book is entirely focused on black experience. Whites are the others."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Toni Morrison could possible be the greatest woman writer I have ever read. This novel takes on a different meaning every time I read it--since September, I've been through it and dissected the different parts 6 times---It was life-changing as far as my reading-life because I could feel the longing of a mother for her child as well as the child for her mother come off of the page. As to the infanticide, it was a tough issue but the book was not centered on passing judgement on the act. Instead, Morrison only concentrated on the characters, their inner lives, how they dealt with adversity and with being oppressed on so many levels. Morrison said in an interview regarding BELOVED that she was not concerned with the oppressor, but with the oppressed--what they do with their lives after the tragedies, how do they survive? These are the real questions Morrison grapples with and there is not a neat and tidy ending to the book--the reader is able to engage himself/herself and to come up with his/her own interpretation. I can only say as to the slavery dilemna in the book and the question of what freedom really is: it is the most disturbing, liberating, educational, and moving depiction of the struggle to \\"claim oneself\\" that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Beloved","review":"Beloved. A book about slavery? Or a book about life? Morrison brings to life the struggles and pains of slaves through the lives of her characters. She creates a story filled with imagery, clearly depicting their struggles and giving her readers a deeper understanding. Morrison's style of writing forces a reader to read on and solve the mystery of Sethe's past. The book Beloved has a unique style where its details are revealed to the readers one after another. Morrison uses a &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; type of writing where details of the story are given to the readers piece by piece. As the story progresses, it is the reader's job to slowly piece the puzzle together, leaving a clear picture of the whole puzzle at the end. This style of &quot;putting the pieces of a puzzle back together&quot; is a great example of how Morrison illustrates the life of a slave. A person's life after entering slavery is filled with struggles and pains, resulting in a life that is literally shattered into pieces. After freedom, this person must then put back the pieces of his life together and find his true self once again. Not only is this true for slaves, but for anyone who has had to overcome an obstacle in his life. In addition to Morrison's style, Morrison's use of imagery clearly shows the struggle that not only Sethe has had to overcome, but slaves and people in general. For example, Sethe's wedding dress. In the novel, Sethe describes her dress by stating, &quot;the top was from two pillow cases...the front of the shirt was a dresser scarf...old sashes...(59).&quot; Here, Sethe's struggles are clearly depicted. The pieces of different materials are good illustrations of her life and how she tries to piece it back together; however, Sethe also states, &quot;Now the back was a problem for the longest time (59).&quot; The back of her wedding dress represents Sethe's past and how when everything is finally over, Sethe is having the hardest time overcoming it. Another struggle depicted in the story is the struggle that Paul D and Sethe must overcome. Morrison writes, &quot;The embracing necks--hers stretching up towards his...No height was beyond her yearning neck, ...the gravity of their shields clashing, countered and mocked...(105).&quot; The shields of the two turtles signify the barrier between Paul D and Sethe. This is how Morrison depicts the yearning and struggle they have to overcome. Equally important are the themes Morrison tries to convey in her novel. Morrison covers various themes, but one theme is the issue of power relationship. For centuries, power relationships are one thing a person will always come across. In Beloved, Morrison focuses on the power relationship between master and slave, white and black, and between husband and wife. One example where Morrison shows the power relationship between master and slave is between the Schoolteacher and Sethe. The Schoolteacher separates himself as superior and slaves as a sub race, as shown when the Schoolteacher tells his nephew to list Sethe's animal qualities (208). However, after the Civil war, the master and slave relationship changes to white and black relationship; still, with the whites having more power over the blacks. Furthermore, by showing Paul D is the only man to get Sethe to let down her guard a little and the only person who could drive out the spirit, Morrison is able to illustrate the power relationship between husband and wife. However, in life, no matter where anyone goes, there will always be someone you must answer to, meaning no one is really ever free, except within his self. All in all, Morrison uses a style of writing, which is able to keep her readers on their toes throughout the novel. She creates a novel so compact with detail that it seems almost overwhelming and unbelievable, but quite relevant. Although, Beloved may seem favorable to blacks, especially former slaves, Morrison covers the issues of struggle, pain, and love. Morrison creates a story everyone can relate to in one way or another; so, not only is Beloved a book about slavery, but it is also a book about life and what everyone must go through."},{"Title":"Healthy Heart One Dish Meals (Today's Gourmet)","review":"In skimming the book through the eyes of someone who just had quadruple bypass surgery I was furious.

The book itself is an insight into a part of the world outside conventional view. It is a window into the life and experiences of Guerillas who own this strip of no-mans land.I enjoyed the authors style and story, I loved Columbia on my visit and this book reminded me why - the natural beauty, the lawlessness, the adventure.

Overall; good item, not great shopping experience."},{"Title":"Furniture","review":"A few months ago, I found this book while browsing through the shelves at a local bookstore. The fantastic pictures and descriptions in the book ignited my interest in furniture history. This is not a how-to book, but if you want an understanding of the details that are characteristic of particular furniture styles -- as well as some background on the historical, political and social forces that influenced these designs -- you probably won't find a better reference manual.The book covers furniture from around the world over a 3,000-year period and includes over 3,500 excellent photographs and illustrations. Regardless of your interests and tastes -- from Chippendale to Capellini or Newport to Newson -- you'll find examples and information on styles, history and biographies that will broaden your knowledge of furniture development.Furniture has twelve chapters, covering styles from the ancient furniture of Egypt, Greece and Rome to European styles of the 17th to 19th centuries. There are also chapters on Chinese, South African and American furniture, as well as a discussion on contemporary designs and directions. Each chapter opens with an historical overview of the era being examined.For each era, there is also a timeline of events that helps the reader understand factors that influenced each era's furniture designs and materials. The historical discussion in each chapter is followed by a section called \\"Elements of Style,\\" where that era's prominent stylistic details are thoroughly examined, followed by examples of magnificent manifestations of furniture in different countries. Within each style, Miller presents the reader with an ongoing understanding of how the three basic furniture forms -- chairs, tables and case pieces -- evolved and who the influential makers were.The appendices of this book are also noteworthy. They include:* Anatomy of Furniture. Contains descriptions of many common furniture elements such as plinths, friezes, escutcheons and cross-banding.* Useful Addresses.A listing of museums, galleries and historical buildings around the world.* Further Reading. An extended list of books and publications on the subject.* Dealer Codes. A list of identifying codes for dealers and auction houses that have been involved in the selling of many of the pieces featured in the book.* Glossary. A six-page section containing valuable, concise definitions and descriptions of important furniture terms.* Index. A well-cross-referenced index to individuals, countries, styles and furniture types presented in the book.In short, Furniture shows in brilliant photographs and scholarly research how historical and social events influenced furniture development. This will be an excellent addition to your reference shelf or, better yet, a well-read and often-referenced display for your coffee table.. . .

(Warms a teacher's heart!)The book contains elegant photos of furniture only found in world famous museums. Judith Miller has given us an up-close and personal look at seldom seen antiques, as well as more current pieces. Even the dedicated student would have had to spend years visiting select museums for just a peek.

The Viet Cong actually promised hefty bounties for the dogs. In between battles and patrols, they were great companions for the soldiers. During the war, there were about 10,000 handlers assigned with their faithful canines but there was no homecoming for the dogs - they were left to fend for themselves or be killed in combat (or ending up on a Viet Nam menu). The book listed the handlers and dogs killed in the war - one handler was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in Hau Nghia Province in 1969. These parts of the war needed to be told and Burnam did a good job in letting us know. For any dog owner, this is a good read but be ready for sadness in several chapters."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"\\" A Soldier?s Best Friend\\"is about John Burnham\\"s experience as a Scout Dog handler for the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam. This review drops the \\"Master Sergeant\\" from his name because he writes as a \\"short timer\\" enlisted man, not as the career non- commissioned officer he became. SBF is a 3 -part tale. The lst concerns the author?s original tour in Vietnam as an infantryman with the First Air Cavalry Division, known to vets as \\"The Cav\\". He is wounded, medevaced to Japan and reassigned to Okinawa. Thanks to the vagaries of the Army personnel system, he is assigned as an \\"OJT\\" guard dog handler around a Chemical Warfare dump. His time on that island is the 2nd segment. The 3rd part concerns Burnham?s return to Vietnam-after he re-enlists for another combat tour to get away from the chemical dump. (Stranger things have happened! This reviewer knew a guy who reupped for the 173rd Airborne in Vietnam because he was miserable in Wurzburg, Germany!) Burnham becomes a Scout Dog handler with the 25th. A handler and his German Shepherd almost always walked point in the field. They were the lead in the line of march and therefore highly vulnerable. Scout Dogs searched for trip wires, mines and other booby traps, injured GIs and sensed Viet Cong laying in ambush. They saved thousands of Americans casualties. The author himself acknowledges that without his main dog, Clipper, he would be another name on The Wall in Washington DC. This reviewer has not read a combat tale where I felt as close to the ground as in SBF. The author has a very simple and direct style that takes the reader right to the core of a patrol. I loved the recounting of Clipper zigging left, zagging right, dutifully leading a platoon around a series of booby traps. Small wonder that handlers said they felt safer with a good dog than another GI! SBF ends sadly as Burnham is forced to leave his buddy Clipper behind in Vietnam. Their final parting is wrenching to read. Unlike the Korea and WW2 conflicts, the US military forbade repatriation of dogs when a handler's tour was over. They were left behind for the \\"duration\\" or until they were killed. Their fate had to be cruel as Vietnamese regarded dogs as a source of food, not pets. The Appendix lists the 288 dogs killed in action as well as the 285 handlers who made the ultimate sacrifice. SBF is highly recommended for its' very personal look at one soldier's combat experience. It is further recommend for yet another unique look at the Vietnam War that affected so many of us. Just when one thinks he has heard every Vietnam story possible, along comes a book like SBF to show that he hasn?t. If the book has a weak spot, it is a common one: NOT ONE SINGLE MAP! Why do publishers constantly make this omission? This merits a reduction in rank for SBF from 5 stars to 4. That complaint aside, SBF rates \\"Number One\\""},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"Burnam's book was both informative and exciting to read. I initially picked it up because it was such a unique subject.The book is seemingly broken into two parts: Before the Scout Dog assignment and after. I thought that it would be dry getting to the Scout Dog portion. Not So! Each page is filled with an honest look at Vietnam as experienced by a young kid from the Mid-West. Not to ruin it for others, I won't mention them here, but there are several portions that are a hoot and some that are hard to read -emotionally. Burnam holds nothing back for sake of posterity or politics. He explains the military use of dogs in Vietnam and -sadly- the result of their service in how the U.S. Government chose to view the dogs and 'release' them from service. I've read several books about Vietnam and this has been the first one that has given such an honest view of a fairy unknown(to the general public) portion of the military's arsenal. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"I found this book by accident on Amazon and was surprised to see in the excerpts a Lieutenant Fenner. I was more surprised that it was my father. It has been a wonderful experience to be able to read someone else's impressions of my father during that period of his life. We are both reading the book and it has been amazing to listen to him remember his time with the 44th Calvary. He told me about the bakery and then 2 chapters later I was reading about it."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"I'm a child from the Vietnam War and my parents are still together to this day. I've always been very interested in their history as my Dad served three tours in 'Nam and my mother was born there. I recently attended a 173d Airborne Reunion and talked to a scout dog handler. Since I formerly trained police K9s and still train my own, my interest was completely taken with scout dogs. I ordered most of the books I could find on the subject! This book touched some sensitive strings due to my family history but I could not stop reading it. The author talks about his experiences and writes them down in a way that made me feel like I was there with him. At times it was horrifying! This book is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone interested in how dogs work with the military because it provides an inside view on how the young men handled their dogs and the sad experience of leaving the dogs behind."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"If you love dogs and enjoy reading about working dogs then this is the book for you. It tells of a story of military working dogs and there handlers working together in some harsh and dangeruos conditions, I enjoyed the book very much and would highly recomend this book to you."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"The author is NOT a great writer. But he lived the story and the book rings true to me, a fellow dog handler in Vietnam in 1968. Although his experiences are obviously not the same as I had, he captures the essence of the times, the place and the emotions. I recently odered extra copies through Amazon.com to give to each of my kids so they could get a glimpse at what those times were like and the small part I played in them."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"Great insight of how the dogs and their handlers bonded.On the flip side it is sad how are military just abandoned them like used equipment when the war ended."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Best Friend: Scout Dogs and Their Handlers in the Vietnam War","review":"I was anti the Vietnam war, but felt embarrassed by the way we treated the 'returning.Veterans.

What a fascinating inside view from the front lines in Vietnam. One could not even fathom what it was like. The author not only tells you what happened on his missions (before, during & after his time as a scout handler) but he shares his thoughts & feelings as well. The bond these Soldier's and their faithful/hard working scout dog's is incredible. Dogs have served in WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, Bosnia, Afghanistan & Iraq, serving many different duties for the U.S.! With their keen sense, these dogs have saved countless lives, being rewarded in love & affection alone/their loyalty to their Soldier handler. Can you believe at some point these brave Scout dogs were considered \\"Expendable Equipment\\" and left behind. Thankfully things have changed & they are able to be adopted back in the states by their Soldier, their families or to a waiting list of people wanting to adopt these courageous dogs. The author (MSG USA RET.) was forever touched by his time as a Scout Dog handlers that he is now the founder, exec director & fundraiser for the National War Dogs Monument project in Washing, D.C. This was such a touching story of just one man's time during a war. Thank You to all our Brave Servicemen & women (with 2 & 4 legs) for serving our country."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"Background (why you might care what I think): I love/live to cook without deadlines and time limits, but I am also extremely busy, so I finally bought a slow cooker to save time, sure, but also to time-shift my prep time, so that my family could eat Boeuf Bourguignon on Wednesdays, at 7pm, without also having to go visit their daddy in the psych ward at 8pm.All of the slow cooker books I found at first called for (always): frozen vegetables; (often) cans of soup; (far too often) \\"liquid smoke.\\" Sure, I tried them, and some were certainly teenager-pleasing, and weirdly interesting in their own way, but I would prefer a little less convenience in exchange for more authentic recipes.So, this book delivers exactly that. As I write, my family is collapsed in a heap after GORGING on Ms. Brody's bourguignon. It took me a full hour to prep, but next time I'll save 20 minutes and considerable mess by browning the meat before marinating (I'll also double the recipe!) Over time, I'll doubtless make other changes until I get the recipe exactly the way I want it, but that is true of any recipe in any cookbook. Too many duck recipes? This is a cookbook, not the Constitution! I've made two of the duck recipes so far, with no sighting of an actual duck anywhere, and I've been delighted with both.So, this is a nice little book, full of welcome ideas. However, when one can get (say) 400+ pages of Daniel Boulud for about the same price, it becomes a rather expensive, slim volume. I have lived with it for a month now, and I am nonetheless quite happy with it. What follows are some of my further observations:The &quot;Pantry&quot; section is excellent, probably the core of the book. The black bean and chickpea recipes effortlessly deliver fresh-cooked beans ready for use in anything. For example, the total working time to transform a pile of raw chickpeas into an catering-size vat of hummus is about 15 minutes.The infused oil recipe is a bit hit-and-miss. However, the idea itself is great. The addition of an oil thermometer and a partially-closed lid quickly transforms the cooker into an accurate scientific apparatus, capable of very precise, effortless infusions. Try infusing olive oil with lemon zest next time you need your senses stimulated (then use the oil in a bread recipe, next time you need your whole house stimulated :-)If your cooker is big enough (oval, preferably) The lamb stew with potato and feta crust can be economized and much improved by using a well-trimmed 1/2 leg. Let it cool when done, then shred the meat off the bone by hand.The Chicken Merlot with Mushrooms is wonderful, with the mushrooms still crisp after cooking for 4 hours. Rather too much liquid, though (true of many of the recipes here).The Morroccan Chicken with Prunes &amp; Couscous is my favourite so far, but it would better served with plain couscous and a separately-cooked side dish, as the flavour is otherwise too intensely uniform.Only one significant gripe (apart from the price): The layout designer sometimes sacrificed utility for artsiness, unnecessarily spreading some recipes across three pages, with little or no indication that there is more to come."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I am a working mother and a relatively accomplished cook who bought this book with great enthusiasm and I have been moderately disappointed. The &quot;Pantry&quot; section of the book is really useful, and I have made several of the recipes with wonderful success, but the rest of the book falls short of the standard set by her introductory chapter. Many of the recipes are clearly not written with the needs of a working person in mind (ie recipes that cannot be assembled the night before or require alot of prep work), which is an inconvenience I would gladly tolerate for a tasty meal, however, having made 4 or 5 of her recipes now, I must admit I have been at least a little disappointed with all of them. I have also used Donna-Marie Pyles &quot;America's Best Slow Cooker Recipes&quot; and have had much better success, both in terms of taste and convenience."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"When you think of \\"slow cooking\\" you might imagine a full day of cooking, yet really with slow cooking, you can get out of the kitchen for most of the cooking time. The most delightful thing about slow cooking is that you don't have to worry about burning something on the stove top and you can hardly ruin a meal even if you let it cook way over the suggested cooking times.Evenings are fun times to use the slow cooker to make a stock. Often in the past, I found the cooker invaluable for making chicken stock while I was happily sleeping. With Lora's new book, I finally learned how to make a delicious vegetable stock. She recommends roasting the vegetables first and this adds more intensity to the stock. You can roast the vegetables, then toss everything into the slow cooker and then head off to bed while the cooker does all the work.You will find recipes for chicken and vegetable stocks in the pantry chapter. I highly recommend you make these stocks for the recipes. A powdered or base stock does not do the recipes justice. If you are vegetarian, you will enjoy the fact that you can substitute a vegetable stock for the chicken stock in many of the recipes.One thing I noticed with some of the recipes was the times seemed a bit short. I would take the times that say \\"2 hours\\" with a pinch of salt. I doubled those times and the recipe worked much better. I also found you could leave the stock on high heat all night and let it go way over the recommended 6 hours. I left the vegetable stock in the cooker for 10 hours and it was even more flavorful.Before you start a recipe, check to see if you have to make another recipe first! If you need to make a recipe for \\"Duxelles\\" before making the stuffed mushrooms, Lora gives you the page number. You don't have to stand in your kitchen staring at the page and wondering where you are going to find duxelles (dook-SEHL). You simply turn to page eleven and see that in fact, you are only making a thick paste used to flavor sauces, soups and other mixtures. It is just mushrooms and shallots and Lora shows you how to make this paste in the slow cooker.Many of the recipes are gourmet, but that is what makes cooking fun. Lora used to work in a French restaurant and it shows! There is also a definite Italian flair to many of the recipes. In the recipe calling for \\"cipollinis\\" you will have to look for the bulbs of the grape hyacinth and they are used in Italian cuisine. You could substitute pearl onions. I also found it difficult to find baby zucchini where I lived so I just used regular sized zucchini and cooked the soup a bit longer.While this book is written for cooking at home, you will feel a bit like a chef when using a hand-held immersion blender to transform vegetables and stock into a satiny smooth soup right in the cooker.If you have never tasted a homemade soup, you owe it to yourself to pull out that slow cooker. It is very satisfying to make homemade soup and it is so delicious. Most of the recipes in this book say to season to taste. You add the salt and pepper at the end. In a way, I wish she had given a basic measure of the salt and pepper, but if you are trying to cook with less salt, you will like the fact that you can add just enough for your own taste.Many recipes include a \\"Variation\\" or a \\"Note.\\" If you can't find herbes de Provence, Lora shows you how to make it yourself. Lora also includes fun headnotes so you feel that you know her better. \\"I wandered into an Indian grocery store in my neighborhood and perused the shelves for an ingredient I hadn't tried before. Tamarind paste caught my eye.....\\" and so this is how the recipe for Tamarind Sweet Potatoes came into existence.You will especially like the design of this book. It has a beautiful blue cover and the binding will last a long time. The index is well organized, although it is easy to find anything you are looking for just by flipping through the 200 pages. There is not a color picture to be found, yet that does not seem to detract from the book. I like the artsy style of the layout with a light gray border at the top of each page and a slow cooker design element running through the book. You will find recipes for appetizers, soups, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, pasta, breads, grains and desserts.Using smoked Gouda cheese in the Smoky Stuffed Chicken Breasts might give your mother's slow cooker a bit of a shock but it sounds delicious to me! Your slow cooker might just become indispensable! I am really looking forward to making the Vanilla Ice Cream recipe in which you make the base in the slow cooker in order to infuse the cream and sugar with vanilla essence from a vanilla bean.Tonight I am serving the Cream of Zucchini Soup that is quite good with a sprinkling of paprika and a few toasted pumpkin seeds. I added 1 teaspoon of seasoning salt to the soup. You might prefer more or less salt. I just took a taste and the flavor is just superb. The color is an almost mustard yellow and the texture is smooth and creamy.While you are making the soup, you could also make some bread in your bread machine. After all, Lora is famous for her bread baking skills.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I pre-ordered this book and waited with great anticipation, being a big fan of Lora Brody's other cookbooks. I plan to try a few of the recipes but I was, overall, a bit disappointed with the content; only 3 chicken recipes but 7 for duck? And several recipes involve ingredients I've never seen (even living in 3 large cities); cipollini onions, anyone? The techniques used look very good; none of that old method of tossing all ingredients in the crockpot here. I'm definitely interested in the author's recipes that involve putting your crockpot insert into the oven or microwave, since I've never tried either. I have a feeling that most of these recipes may not appeal to my family of six, but perhaps this was never the author's intention. If she wanted to venture to the opposite end of the culinary spectrum from usual crockpot recipes, she certainly succeeded."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"Finally, a slowcooker cookbook with recipes that sound GOOD! I have been valiently trying to find some recipes that appeal to me(and yes i tried the Rick Rodgers book -- those recipes required way too much work) and this book has 'em! I agree with the reviewer before me that there are too many duck recipes, but every cookbook has plenty of things to skip over. This book has carmelized onions and ideas for using them, baked garlic, again with ideas for using it, hummus, several recipes for dried beans &amp; lentils, risotto,scallops, lamb, and stocks in addition to stews, brisket, and deserts. It works for me!"},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"... I was excited to find a slow cooker book that did not use canned soup or onion soup mix and was willing to put put in some extra prep time up front for a superior meal.While I greatly enjoyed browsing through the book, I found actually using it to produce hit and miss results. So far the score is Hits-1, Misses - 3. Extremely disappointing given the amount of time I invested in prep work. I have found several misprints e.g. cook on high, instead of low; incorrect measurments for ingredents, which definitly contributed to the poor results.A large percentage of the recipes are for duck which we don't eat. Given I fell \\"victim\\" to the missprints in the chicken and beef recipes, I don't have the confidence to swap other items for the duck.This book may be wonderful for very experienced cooks who require a recipe only to obtain a bit of inspiration but it was a disappointment for me."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I ignored all the reviews the came before it and bought this book. Like the others I was disappointed when it arrived.If you are looking for a book to help you make simple but amazing meals for your family this is not the one. Although it does contain about 5 recipes for entrees that are easy to prepare, delicious and don't use canned soup, four of these same recipes can be found online. All of the others require so much prep or such arcane ingredients that they aren't suitable for everyday cooking.I think to appreciate this book, you have to stop idealizing the crock pot as a device to make life easier and instead see it as a means to elevate your gourmet cooking. If braised beef tongue sounds impressive or you think you could get into waiting 12-14 hours for your onions to perfectly carmelize than perhaps this is the book for you. Otherwise like me you'll have to keep waiting for the perfect crockpot cookbook"},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I've made 3 or 4 recipes from this book now - the only one that turned out was the caramelized onions, which were wonderful, but how could one screw that up? I had thought that perhaps my idea of what tastes good was just different from the author's, but after reading some of the other reviews here I see it's not just me.My expectations aren't usually all that high for crock-pot books, but Lora Brody has such a good reputation that I was expecting more than usual. I even tried one recipe twice thinking I must have made a mistake - it was worse the second time. Oh well.I was disappointed enough to be inspired to write my first-ever Amazon book review. I guess that's something!"},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I have never written a review before but just saw that this book (which I am buying for my mum and friends for Christmas) was only rated 3 stars and I couldn't understand why. As far as I am concerned this is the best crock pot cook book out there - the recipes are simple to follow, always turn out exactly as shown and are delicious. The sole recipe I have served at several dinner parties to much acclaim as with the 'lamb you can eat with a spoon'. I cannot recommend this book more highly and I looked at several crock pot cookbooks that were really boring."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"When I try a new recipe I have never done before, I get nervous. But EVERY recipe from the book has come out totally amazing. The directions are clear and the results are more gourment than the boullion cube and gravy garbage in other slow cooker cookbooks.As another review said, there are many recipes for duck and things that are easily found in my neighborhood. However there are excellent recipes like the Morroccan Chicken with Prunes, Chicken with Wine and Mushrooms, and Horseradish Potroast that continue to amaze my husband and guests with minimal effort. Last night I made the Honey glazed Ribs but substituted beef for the pork. AMAZING!My only negative comment is that there aren't more crockpot books by the same author."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I found this cookbook while house sitting and I had to order a copy for myself. I've made four of the soups so far and they were all fabulous! Also the carmelized garlic and the garlic oil were a real treat. My friends are asking me for these recipes. Everything I have tried so far has been wonderful and easy."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"The best in this arena. Try the lamb shanks and you will be in heaven, feasting on the sunshine of Provence."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I just threw out an entire 6-qt recipe for New England Boiled Dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, although I had an uneasy feeling about her instructions to cook this corned beef dish for 12-16 hours on high heat. My suspicions were born out as the recipe absolutely destroyed the meal I had planned for tonight. I cooked it overnight or I might have realized it was done way before 12 hours. When I woke up to an entire house full of the stench of food verging on burnt I knew immediately. I looked at the recipe again to be sure I hadn't mis-read her instructions. Twice in the recipe she says to cook for 12-16 hours on high. Use this book at your own peril. I have other books by Lora Brody and have never had a problem, but this one must have not been checked for timing. Who knows what else might be wrong with the recipes."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"There are alot of good recipes in this book, and the organization is well done. The only minus (or plus) is there's a big focus on chestnuts. They seem to be in half the recipes."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"It's a good book-but-just wish that it had the nutritional breakdown for the recipes. It would be great for those on a low carb diet or that are diabetic."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I recently bought a crockpot and have spent a lot of time on Amazon.com's website looking at crockpot recipe books. From what I can gather from reviews, there are two basic types of recipe books: 1) those that use a lot of prepared ingredients like frozen vegetables, canned soups, salad dressings etc. as time-savers, and 2) those that involve more cooking \\"from scratch\\" using a crockpot instead of the stove.This book falls into the second category, which is what I was looking for. But I sent the book back for a refund and I'm only giving it 3 stars because the book description says the author \\"pushes the slow cooker to places no one ever expected it to go...\\" There are recipes that are more exciting and I want to acknowledge them, but there are too many simplistic recipes: chicken stock, vegetable stock, black beans, slow cooked chickpeas, black bean dip, 2 types of mashed potatoes. I think the book description just made too strong a claim for this book."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"i collect cookbooks and do a lot of experimenting with recipes. every dish i've made from this book has had a strange, unappetizing flavor. i've just ruined a $30 piece of lamb, so i don't plan to cook from this book again."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"This book gives elegant and just &quot;real food&quot; to cook in the crockpot. I love it and can not wait to try alomost every recipe!"},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I basically agree with the other reviewers who liked this book. First, and impressive, is that the recipes have obviously been well-tested-- everything I've tried comes out just as described (although my particular slow cooker is somewhat 'faster' and doesn't require the length of time given in some recipes). Second, the recipes are tasty. I really prefer this method (fresh ingredients) rather than the usual crockpot fare of canned and frozen ingredients. It may take a little longer to prepare, but the time-savings will come in making extra servings to save for another meal. I will definitely try other cook books by this same author."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"This cookbook was not good in my opinion at all, unless you are a gourmet cook, eat like one every night and have your pantry stocked with exotic foods. If you're looking for a cookbook to make your life easier with &quot;everyday&quot; type foods, this is NOT it. However, if you eat rabbit, duck or lamb on a regular basis, you will love this cookbook. There were only a few recipes that included foods such as a beef roast and chicken."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"I really like my slow cooker after trying recipes from Lora Brody (and also the Better Homes & Gardens slow cooker book). I used to have a Fix-It and Forget-It but I always got lost in all the different variations. I have tried several recipes in this book, mostly soups and entrees. I have not tried any of the desserts, bread or dips.Brody's recipes are unique and very tasty - I get lots of compliments on them. My husband and 3 year old ate every one that I have made so far. One bit of critisim - there are several recipes for uncommon meat such as rabbit or pheasant - but I have easily substituted for chicken or beef of about the same thickness and cut. I have wondered why she just does not come out and say that in the recipe introductions so that it is not so intimidating.Additionally, I find the recipes fairly simple and economical. They contain ingredients and spices that I usually have on hand. Most of the meal/entree type recipes do not call for a lot of ingredents to be prepared outside of the slow cooker. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"This is a cookbook for people that REALLY know how to cook -- I can handle pretty much anything in the kitchen and get dinner on the table on time but these are challenging recipes for me, and many of them are just too fancy to attempt. I've got two little kids to feed, not a few gourmet food type friends I'm making dinner for.On the positive side, the book is very well-written. I may try some of the easier recipes, but not when I'm on a deadline. More than a couple of the ingredients are not exactly things I ordinarily stock in the kitchen. I do admire Lora Brody's approach to cooking and I will keep and reread this cookbook, though it's not the everyday Joe Lunchbucket type of book I really needed -- try \\"Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook,\\" which so far is the best of the four slow cooker cook books I've ordered through amazon.com"},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"The author has revealed how your slow-cooker can enrich life by protracting the task of making an insipid, sickly-sweet ice cream to three hours. Hopeful cooks made this ballsily named recipe with the best available ingredients and exact measurements. The other dessert attempted with equal care, Mont Blanc, was also disappointing. The windy, cliche-clogged, and hyperbolic recipe blurbs (assuring us e.g. that we &quot;haven't lived until&quot; we've eaten dulce de leche) ask for high expectations for such methods as chestnuts braised in a Crock Pot, when really this turns out not to be a good way to cook them at all. (Slow braising robbed the fresh nutmeats of the flavor correct roasting intensifies, steeping them for many hours in a liquid embittered by their shells, and in the candying step the amount of sugar was again over the top, resulting in a mealy mess like stale oversugared red bean paste.) These trials of relatively simple recipes warn against risking any cut of meat on the giddily blurbed, tantalizingly titled entree recipes. Amounts often seem wild or chosen to have round numbers--another reader warned of many mistakes, and arguably, for adult palates at least, the sugar amounts in both desserts tried here were mistakes. These failures and the book's editing and design make it seem slapped together at the last minute, so it also seems miraculous that all these recipes were tested. I use my Crock Pot often, usually simple recipes with results that bring smiles to friends' faces, but this book's recasting of it in a refined, France-trotting, all-purpose role is, so far in this kitchen, a complete crock."},{"Title":"Slow Cooker Cooking","review":"This slow cooker cookbook is like none other I had found. Unique and delicious recipes that I prepare not only for the family but to entertain guests. I haven't tried any of the desert or bread recipes yet.

Certainly, this is the question that those of us familiar with the Michael Jordan of theology keep asking ourselves. How does he manage to be so prolific a researcher and writer? How does he consistently communicate truths that would otherwise baffle us in such clear and understandable terms? How does he achieve his inspiring balance between outstanding theological scholarship and fresh, evangelical piety? Certainly, the present text is no exception to the pattern of excellence that characterizes the rest of McGrath's works. This book is precisely what it claims to be: an introduction. However, as with every other &quot;Introduction&quot; McGrath has produced, it serves its purpose with penetrating depth and illuminating breadth. Theological, historical, and practical in its orientation, this text will benefit every reader who desires to ponder the foundations and practice of Christian spirituality. However, I would especially wish to emphasize the usefulness of this text for anyone seeking to explore the relationship between theology and spirituality. Much reflection and inspiration awaits you between the covers of this 204 page treasure from one of our foremost contemporary masters. Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Prof. Alister McGrath is a moderately conservative theologian and an ordained minister of the Church of England. He has written a large number of works, some of which are quite technical and others of a more introductory nature.This work is - as its name indicates - an introductory study of Christian spirituality (a topic that is often left out of standard texts on theology, for some reason.). I enjoyed the book a lot. In particular, it is well organized. The book starts with a discussion of certain themes and proceeds to develop the. The second portion of this book surveys spirituality from a historical perspective. Prof. McGrath provides brief selections from various writers and then asks questions, encouraging the reader to reflect on the excerpt. Prof. McGrath discusses prayer, Christian living, the church year, and other matters that form the basis of spirituality.The one problem that I have with the book is that it tries to be a little too ecumenical. For example, when discussing asceticism, he doesn't mention the extremes that many Catholics have taken to deprive themselves of worldly things. Likewise, when discussing Mary and the saints, he simply points out that Protestants reject Roman Catholic practices in this respect. This doesn't exactly clue the reader in on the extent of the controversy.In spite of a few flaws, this is an excellent introduction."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"This is the kind of book, I would have liked to read during my academical training. Then I struggled with books full of technical terms, betraying more about the author's wish to be honoured as leading scholar than his will to teach those who were likely to read the book. Even when they were called &quot;Introductions&quot; they always presupposed a certain knowledge of things, that actually they still had to provide. But this book is quite different. It's fantastic as it's predecessor and counterpart &quot;Christian Theology&quot;. McGrath offers a clearly written and extremely understandable outline without ever oversimplifying the matter. It's really an Introduction in the strict sense of the word, for it provides information for the beginner. But the well- ordered and clear style even make it a resource for those already familiar with different kinds of Christian Spirituality. What I appreciated most with this book is the wide perspective of the author. Probably such a book could only have been written by an Anglican like McGrath for its ecumenical scope. Where do you ever find John the Damascene, C.S. Lewis, Martin Luther, Augustine, James Packer etc. listed together friendly side by side. Even the delicate question of using images for personal or communal contemplation find a surprising affirmative answer by McGrath who tends to a more reformed- evangelical position himself. It's the positive evaluation of religious, especially Christian religious, enterprise as a signpost to the God of the Bible that permeats the book, which makes the reader feel so comfortable. McGrath needs not renouncing any position but gains a lot of insights from very different standpoints. Were I at university or seminary again, I would be glad to have some reliable but understandable guide in the sometimes so difficult field of theology like this. Not in this setting any longer, I'm still surprised how easy things may be, if great scholars are not too proud to let even the &quot;poor in spirit&quot; see what is there. I recommend this book very much."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Alister McGrath has long been a master at presenting Christian theology with blessed clarity and depth, and this volume does not disappoint. Well-suited for those entirely new to Christian spirituality, and a good review and reference book for those of us who have learnt and forgotten plenty, this book is an excellent text, particularly in that the review questions ending each section help one logically connect the points and reinforce the readings.This is not a devotional work or a seminary textbook (though, perhaps, it should be.) No truth is sacrificed in the very thorough and understandable text, which even the very young will find quite clear."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"A wonderful introduction to Christian Spirituality, McGrath, as usual, is able to cover a large amount of information in a way that is simple to read and fairly easy to understand, even if one is completely unfamiliar with the subject. He also is careful to remain fairly ecumenical in his approach, covering the relevance and practice of spirituality in all the major branches of the Christian Faith. Having read MANY of his textbooks, I must say that this one is probably (with the possible exception of &quot;Foundations of Dialogue in Science and Religion&quot;) his best yet."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Alister McGrath, theologian at Oxford University, is one of my constant and consistent references. From his books on various topics in theology (historical theology, theology and science, etc.) to his general surveys (his 'Introduction to Christian Theology' remains a standard I use in my classes when I can), he cover material in an interesting, accessible, and generally thorough manner.This particular book, 'Christian Spirituality', is broad introduction to the diverse strands of practice and belief in the history of Christian spirituality. It does not assume any particular theological background -- McGrath introduces the theological underpinning as he develops the topics. Unlike many introductions to this subject, McGrath does not follow a strict historical development approach. This book takes a more thematic approach, building up to a final chapter of classics of spiritual literature from the various strands of tradition within the Christian framework.Primary texts are used throughout this book; these include writers from Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant traditions, but for the most part, all of the writings here are accessible and relevant to those in most traditions. The first chapter sets the stage by looking at terminology and definitions, as well as the limitations and drawbacks of being too precisely defined in a discipline such as spirituality. The second chapter develops broad paradigms -- historical, denominational, psychological, and cultural, particularly looking at the various ways in which Christianity has interacted with the world (in the world, against the world, above the world, transformer of the world, etc.).Chapters three and four look at theological relationships with spirituality. The nature of theology, according to McGrath, is often considered different from, sometimes opposed to, the general nature of spirituality. McGrath agrees, if definitions are high abstractions and intellectually removed from relationship with each other. There are positive and negative aspects of the relationship between spiritual practice and theology -- McGrath argues that, with appropriate care and attention, the tension between the disciplines need not be so pronounced.Chapters five and six develop Christian spirituality from a biblical and a physical/practical sense. Both of these are rooted in the long tradition of Christianity; from the structure of biblical stories to the structure of the church year, there is a way of bringing the images to the forefront. The bible provides many strong images, in word and narrative. The spaces, places and art work of Christian develop in strong symbolic tones means for Christians to develop their spirituality. McGrath covers the many aspects of these.The final chapter has a rich collection of spiritual classics, from Augustine and Gregory of Nyssa to John Henry Newman and Charles Wesley. While most names will be immediately familiar to readers (Francis of Assisi, Teresa of Avila, Martin Luther, etc.), a few will likely be new. Classics are not, as McGrath points out, elitism texts remote and distant, but rather, those texts that have been proven to have enduring qualities and value for generations -- hence, it is hard to proclaim 'new' works as 'classics'; however, there are some relatively recent pieces included. McGrath introduces these texts by looking at various aspects of the texts -- a rather introductory literary and critical analysis framework.Part of the purpose of this book, besides being a survey, is to motivate readers and students to further study. There is bibliographic information given after chapters for further reading, developing the topics covered in more detail. The appendix also a listing for further reading, as well as a directory of internet sites. This is a great resource."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Alister McGrath is a prolific Evangelical Anglican scholar. He's written on a wide variety of subjects related to Christianity, ranging from very scholarly works to popular works. \\"Christian Spirituality\\" occupies the middle ground: it can be used as a brief reference for more serious study but is also accessible by the literate laymen. McGrath is a reliable scholar who understands theology and church history and writes from the perspective of one who is himself an orthodox believer.The best part of \\"Christian Spirituality\\" is the range of topics it covers. These include:Definitions of \\"Spirituality\\"Types of Christian Spirituality - Denominations, Attitudes to CultureTheological Foundations - Creation, Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption, Resurrection, ConsummationBiblical Images - feast, journey, exile, struggle, purification, ascent, darkness and light, silenceFaces, Places, and SpacesEngaging the Tradition - excerpts from 13 classic textsMcGrath's work is fairly comprehensive - about as much as you can get in 175 pages. He is also very readable and manages to cover a lot of things in a fairly brief book for such a comprehensive topic.However, there are some limitations and things lacking in the volume. First, McGrath only spends a page or so each on Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. One of the most important aspects of spirituality, however, is the large variety of ways that different traditions have developed their own spiritualities and how each differs. McGrath should greatly expand this section. McGrath should also have had a section that was more historical in nature, giving an overview of Christian spirituality through the ages.The definitions of spirituality that McGrath highlights are both cumbersome and not the most useful ones. Also, why include something from the obscure Hugh of Balma as one of only 13 classic spirituality texts when there are so many more important ones to include in an introductory work?In spite of these limitations, \\"Christian Spirituality\\" is a good introduction to Christian Spirituality. Although it's currently out of print, I like Holt's\\" Brief History of Christian Spirituality\\" better. \\"Christian Spirituality,\\" volumes I-III, edited by Dupre and Saliers, is also good if you're looking for a comprehensive historical approach."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"It seems as though everything Dr. Alister McGrath writes is incredible. &quot;Christian Spirituality&quot; is no exception to this thought.

I didn't remember absolutely loving it, nor did I remember hating it. After re-reading it last night, I now know why I had no strong feelings attached to it.The book is mildly entertaining, but the characters are flat and -- with a few exceptions -- the action is relatively predictable. Written for boys (although not inaccessible to girls), the book's only female characters are all adults. Our Hero, Kerby, is a Boy's Boy of 1960. He makes messes, resists doing his chores and stays out playing too late, but he isn't really a bad boy, and in fact, his parents worry about him when he behaves like a perfect angel. Naturally, Kerby has a faithful dog, who like him, gets into trouble but isn't really truly bad. Bumps Burton is the typical Misunderstood Bully, with standard bully name. Fenton Claypool is the Good Boy who is not so good as to be (in the author's words) \\"prissy\\"; Fenton's goodness allows the author to add one of the few truly surprising plot twists to the book. The adults also fit neat stereotypes, such as The Nosy Neighbor Lady and the Frazzled but Hyper-Organized Pagent Director.The basic plot is: Kerby does a good deed for an Eccentric Old Lady in Distress. The old lady gives Kerby a magic chemistry set. Strange things begin to happen. Is the set really magic? Who is the old lady?

It is indeed rare to find such a book which so deeply investigates the subtlety of thought, its construction of the \`self' and its uses and abuses so to speak.

It is particularly effective in utilizing the birth stories of three women (including the author herself), which come from a spectrum of birth-traumatic experiences: the unnecessary cesearean, the absolutely necessary cesearean, and the highly manipulated vaginal birth. Through the accounts of these three women, a pathway is shown for many to follow in coming to terms with their own birth trauma. Perhaps the most commendable aspect of Madsen's treatment of the subject is that she choses to acknowledge birth trauma and the possible depression that follows as something other than &quot;just hormonal,&quot; and even makes a good case for birth trauma being a particular instance of post-traumatic stress syndrome.Besides the much-appreciated acknowledgment (to this reader, at any rate) that birth trauma is not merely unjustified self-pity, Madsen provides very concrete ways of coming to terms with what has happened and pushing on with life. Each chapter has &quot;journal topics&quot; for women to think, write or talk about. She also includes an entire chapter, &quot;Creative Tools for Recovery,&quot; which details several more pathways, including art, writing, storytelling, dreams, bodywork, among others.Not only is this book a must-read for any woman who has had a less than ideal birth, it would be highly recommended to people who have contact with new moms, including partners (who may have their own birth stress as well), doctors, nurses, midwives, doulas, counselors, and so forth."},{"Title":"Rebounding from Childbirth: Toward Emotional Recovery","review":"Perhaps if I read this book after my first birth, I might look at it differently, but I read it after my last birth and I felt left with the thought afterwards of \\"now what\\". After 3 difficult births, I had already gone through a lot of grief, research, and personal thought before we had our 4th child nearly a year ago. Despite doing everything I could do to have a good birth experience, it was an extremely difficult one. I do not plan on more children (nor did I before my last birth). This book, along with other books of this subject (related to cesarean trauma/birth trauma/VBAC issues) puts a lot of emphasis of planning for a \\"next birth\\". For many people who grieve because of a birth trauma (i.e. excess pain and suffering whether cesarean or vaginal, prolonged separation from baby due to health issues, a loss of child), it may be our last birth and while I'm pleased the author's second birth was a good experience, not all of us will have that option. What I needed was a book to help me come to terms with my experiences and integrate it into who I am, not something that seemed to gear so much toward a future birth. Traumatic births are life-altering experiences, but some of us do not get another chance. This book is necessary and I would recommend to anyone who is planning more children with a past difficult birth or loss, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone who knows that their traumatic experience will be their last birth experience."},{"Title":"Rebounding from Childbirth: Toward Emotional Recovery","review":"I had a very difficult childbirth (back labor, young inexperienced doctor AND nurse, long, LONG labor, botched epidural led to general anesthesia for my emergency c-section, etc.).For months I looked and looked to find something that would address my lingering feelings of loss and trauma.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to recover from a negative experience and feels that no one understands. I am so glad I found it!"},{"Title":"Rebounding from Childbirth: Toward Emotional Recovery","review":"After experiencing a c section post a failed induction for my first birth and then a second c section after a failed VBAC attempt for my second birth, this book presented itself at the right time for me to begin my healing process, dig out what I had buried for so long and face my emotions!It took me over a year to complete this book because my emotions were so raw that each page would stir up so many memories, feelings, flashbacks and experiences that I had been denying and did not want to face. With each page my hand would glide across my notebook with random thoughts that would pour out as things were triggered.After getting through most of the book I did seek therapeutic support from a social worker who specializes in birth traumas and did reference and use this book along in my journey.I did appreciate the candid honesty and intensity of this book and that the stories were not \\"sugarcoated.\\" As others have mentioned, it allowed me validity to my thoughts and feelings and that others experience them too vs. the fear that I was going crazy or abnormal, thus encouraging me to feel \\"safe\\" when seeking additional help.As much as I am grateful for having come across this book and it moving me forward and into my healing process, I was a bit sad and jealous when the author spoke of a successful second vaginal birth. This is what I so much wanted and unfortunately did not work out for me, not even the second time....Overall I do recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with a traumatic birth or a birth that did not meet your expectations.

I think there is a desperate need for a treatment of this topic, and this book isn't that bad in many ways. The author knows her subject, it is interesting to read, and ways to deal with anger and dissapointment are found throughout.But I finally threw this book away after a couple of months because I found so many things annoying. I'm sorry, but it is the attitude of the author. We all work through things in our own way, but her talk about chewing out her husband as a release for anger (with minimal apology), telling him at one point that she really didn't miss him yet (after about a week away from him and baby)...the overall impression I got was \\"wow, this is one incredibly selfish woman.\\" Some would say \\"oh, people always say that about women when they pay attention to themselves instead of someone else.\\" True. But there is a difference between nurturing self-confidence/being at peace with yourself among others, and saying all the time \\"but what about ME?\\" without considering others' feelings. I'm sorry, but all the stories about her personal relationships really turned me off."},{"Title":"Rebounding from Childbirth: Toward Emotional Recovery","review":"This book confronts the reality that a difficult childbirth can impact a woman but it fails to help in any other way. The author focuses too much on the specifics of the difficult births featured in the book without doing a good job of looking at the bigger goal of helping any woman who had a difficult childbirth overcome the experience. I found it too hard to relate to the women featured - everyone's experience is different, even traumatic experiences. A better approach would be to take the focus off personal stories as anyone reading this book likely has replayed her own traumatic experience over and over and is seeking to overcome it rather than read a play by play of yet another bad time giving birth. I think a book about common reactions to a difficult delivery (such as anxiety) and how to deal with them would be more helpful."},{"Title":"The Witchcraft Delusion: The Story of the Witchcraft Persecutions in Seventeenth-Century New England, Including Original Trial Transcripts","review":"\\"Witchcraft...is as old as human history,\\" states John M. Taylor. \\"It has written its nature in the oldest of human records. In all ages and among all peoples it has taken firm hold on the fears, convolutions, and the consciences of men.\\" Taylor devotes the first chapters of his book to the beginnings of the European witch persecutions in the thirteenth century, which were guided by the Dominican order, church inquisitors, and papal pronouncements. In England, witchcraft was not made a felony until 1541, and early in the seventeenth century, in the reign of King James I, Parliament enacted a new law that enlarged and clarified the definition of witchcraft, which immediately increased the number of reported incidents and persecutions.In colonial New England, laws against witchcraft were passed in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven, in the mid-seventeenth century. The most notorious episode of persecution occurred in 1692 in Salem, where twenty persons were executed as witches. From the 1660's to 1690's, there were ongoing witchhunts and trials in the colonies of Connecticut and New Haven. Several chapters of The Witchcraft Delusion are devoted exclusively to these accounts, most of which have been selected from colonial records and from original depositions.Each of these cases is presented using actual trial testimony. At the trial of Kathleen Harrison at Haartford in May 1669, for exampls, the witnesses describe such \\"indicting\\" evidence as a vision of a red calf's head, a voice calling \\"Hoccanum,\\" swarming bees and a canine apparition.In addition to trial transcripts, there are such documents as the guide to discovering, accusing, and examining a witch prepared by William Jones, a deputy governor of Connecticut and a member of the court at some of the trials. Also examined is the role played by the court official known as the \\"searcher,\\" who inspected the body of the accused for the Devil's mark, for it was widely believed that Satan placed a sign in a very private part of a witch's body. The searcher was usually a woman, since most of those accused were women.Included in the last chapter of The Witchcraft Delusion is \\"A Record of the Men and Women Who Came Under Suspicion or Accusation of Witchraft in Connecticut, and What Befell Them.\\" This short case-by-case summary reveals that from 1647 through 1697, and including two cases in 1724 and 1768, thirty-seven people, ten of them men, were brought before the civil authorities on charges of witchcraft, and eleven of them were executed. Using original materials from the colonial period - from colonial records to court testimony - Taylor expertly re-creates this bizarre period in American history, allowing the participants in the trials to speak for themselves.--- from book's dustjacket"},{"Title":"Secret Bodyguard","review":"Intrigue's part of the Texas Trueblood series continues with \\"Secret Bodyguard.\\" Jesse McCall is undercover as a chauffeur as he investigates a mobster. When the man's daughter reports her child has been kidnapped, he doesn't believe her. After all, a mobster's daughter has to be a liar, right? Can Amanda make this mysterious man believe her?\\"Secret Bodyguard\\" reminded me a lot of Daniels's \\"Love at First Sight.\\" In that book, all the characters were connected to one another in a dozen different ways, something that was implausible in a city the size she was describing. In \\"Secret Bodyguard,\\" it's even worse, especially in a state the size of Texas. \\"Love at First Sight\\" pushed the limits of believability. \\"Secret Bodyguard\\" bulldozes straight through them.For most of the book, there are two separate stories: the kidnapping of Amanda's daughter and the mystery of Jesse's birth. This isn't a very successful tactic. The stories don't progress together. The characters focus on one, then turn to the other, then back again. For a woman whose child is missing, Amanda doesn't have too much trouble forgetting about that while she and Jesse investigate his birth. I had the impression the book would have been stronger if the mystery surrounding Jesse's past was left out and the story focused on the other storyline.Jesse isn't much of a hero. He continually jumps to the wrong conclusions about Amanda and his arrogance toward her is not endearing. It does provide the book's best moment, though, when he guesses what Amanda majored in at college and she knocks him out of his seat with her answer. There's nothing like seeing an arrogant hero get his comeuppance. The story is fast-paced and full of action, but the romance is underwhelming. Jesse and Amanda have very little contact for the first 75 pages of the book, which means they have to fall in love in a very short period of time. It's not very convincing, and the love scene in particular seems forced in rather than a natural reaction on the part of the characters.Daniels does a good job setting up the next book, \\"Unconditional Surrender\\" by Joanna Wayne. \\"Secret Bodyguard\\" is an entertaining read, but is ultimately too far-fetched to be credible."},{"Title":"Secret Bodyguard","review":"This book is good for a quick read, but it didn't thrill me.

Another weak point is that if someone really likes the hand-holding and slow pace of, for example, a Dummies book or a Complete Idiots Guide or a Step by Step book (where they tell you to click OK when you finish with some dialog box), this isn't the right book.

The first was, \\"A Place Of Execution\\", and it remains my favorite of the three. This newest offering, \\"Last Temptation\\", is a very good tale, but is definitely not for those readers who prefer to avoid the grisly details of murders, in this case those of a serial killer. There is also brutal violence with both men and women as victims, so read and be prepared. I don't find her descriptions to be gratuitous, just very graphic. He portrayals are probably much more accurate than generic description of violence that have become so prevalent and clich&eacute; that they are barely noticed. This author illustrates for the reader just how vile murder and violence are.This author uses atrocities committed by a group in the 20th century that I generally have tired of reading, as they have become the crutch for any form of evil. It is a tribute to this lady's talent that she has found a more obscure practice of the Germany of the Nazi's to play a very valid role in this novel. She also represents the evil of this group through the effects they have had on generations that were not even alive when they practiced their atrocities. Their twisted science echoes through the victims to their descendents, and this adds an entirely new dimension to the resonance of evil.The only aspect of the story I found troubling was the placement of the two main characters so close together while they were working on different operations. It makes the story work, but from the moment the situation is set, you know this is the Achilles heal that will bring the protagonists to the edge, or possibly over, to their detriment.I don't read many books in this type of genre, but Val McDermid seems as though her work should have a much greater following than it does. If this type of work appeals to you, pick this lady's work up; you will be happy you did."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"The sophistication and talent that a writer needs to maintain two plot lines and ferry seven characters through a full-length novel, may be a challenge to author Val McDermid, but she does it with style, believability and panache in THE LAST TEMPTATION.A serial killer is targeting psychologists in Germany and Holland. When an old friend is murdered, former British profiler Tony Hill reluctantly gets back into the game. His job is to outsmart the killer and prevent any more brutal \\"mutilation\\" deaths.At the same time, Carol Jordan, a very ambitious DCI and the love of Hill's life, is offered any position she wants if she does her superiors a \\"favor\\" --- seduce Tadeusz Radecki into a sting that will expose his drug, arms and people smuggling businesses. This seems to be an offer she can't refuse. But, by the time she finds out that she's been set up, it's too late to back out. She feels betrayed and used when she discovers that she is the \\"twin\\" image of Katerina Basler, Tadisck's lover who was killed in a mysterious hit and run accident.Hill's murder investigation eventually brings him to Berlin. And, although he must travel to several European cities, he takes a small apartment in the same building as Jordan. Both of them work with local cops, Jordan with Petra Becker in Germany, and Hill with Brigadier Marijke van Hasselt from Holland.THE LAST TEMPTATION is an aggregate of pristine prose, complicated plot twists, roller coaster pacing, intelligent characters, and very interesting subject matter. McDermid writes with finesse and her extraordinary storytelling prowess sets her new book apart from the ordinary. Wow! This book is a sure fire winner.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"Val McDermid's latest novel, &quot;The Last Temptation,&quot; is an ambitious undertaking. The author crosses geographical boundaries; her plot lines involve police forces in England, Holland and Germany. This novel also has numerous characters and several storylines that at first seem unrelated, but which eventually intersect.Carol Jordan is an ambitious Detective Chief Inspector who is well trained in criminal intelligence. Jordan has helped bring two serial killers to justice and she has paid her dues as a police officer. Now, she is aiming for a high-level job in British intelligence and analysis, and she is expecting a promotion to come through very soon. Much to her surprise, Jordan is not granted her promotion. Instead she is sent into deep undercover to bring down a notorious criminal named Tadeusz Radecki and his right hand man Darko Krasic, who are based in Germany.A second protagonist in &quot;The Last Temptation&quot; is Dr. Tony Hill, a psychologist who has been deeply scarred by his job of profiling serial killers. He is now on the trail of a criminal who targets psychologists and murders them in a particularly gruesome manner. Hill and Jordan have collaborated professionally in the past. As they work these difficult cases, Jordan and Hill provide one another with much needed advice and emotional support.McDermid handles her large cast of characters and a complex plot adroitly. Her dialogue is crisp and her descriptive writing is vivid yet understated. The author ratchets up the tension as the novel reaches its exciting denouement. Unfortunately, McDermid resorts to a pat ending, which strains believability. However, this quibble aside, I recommend &quot;The Last Temptation.&quot; McDermid's skill as a writer of fast-paced and well-crafted thrillers makes this new novel a &quot;must-read&quot; for fans of this genre."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"Smashing success. Carol Jordan entices Tony Hill to join with Dutch and German Detectives to try and capture a serial killer that drowns his victims then scalps their pubic hair for his collection.

A joy to read."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"This is a serial killer story, but it is so much more. It's an insight into the law enforcement agencies across Europe and an undercover police operation all rolled into one.We see the return of criminal psychologist Tony Hill and Carol Jordan a police officer who has just applied for a job with Europol, working behind a desk processing information. But her superiors see her as something more and offer her a job working undercover. Through this undercover work, she and Tony Hill renew their acquaintance and begin chasing down a German criminal named Tadeusz Radecki. He has recently branched out from his drug distribution into people smuggling.Also chasing down Radecki is Petra Becker, a criminal intelligence officer in Berlin who has been after him for years and is hot on his trail after the murder of a drug dealer. She corresponds to a friend in Holland over the Internet and occasionally helps out when it comes to solving crimes. In this case, there is a serial killer on the loose across Europe who seems to be targeting psychologists by replicating atrocities performed during the reign of the Nazi's in Germany.Although spread across Europe and seemingly tenuously linked, the whole story is nicely drawn together. It's a book that would best be classed as a shocker with some descriptive, grisly scenes. We are also treated to the killer's thoughts and the reasons behind his motives, suggesting that there are still more victims of the medical experiments performed during World War 2 than those who died.Val McDermid has once again produced an exciting and entertaining thriller. Fans of the psychological suspense novels will find this one right up their alley."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"If you have any affection for Tony Hill and Carol Jordan as created by Val McDermid, don't read this book. I read \\"The Mermaids Singing\\" and was enthralled, but this one was a big disappointment. The plot involving the serial killer is shallow and seems tacked on. The real plot involves Carol, her relationship with Tony, and a sting operation that is completely unbelievable. The ending is a depressing let-down. Overall, the book is a big mess.

He is drawn back to the fray when his old love interest, DCI Jordan, becomes involved in a dangerous undercover mission in Eastern Europe.

It is a very entertaining novel and all fans of McDermid will relish it."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"I listened to this audio book becuase it was lying around. It wasn't inspiring or enlightening. Too many characters and plot twists leave the reader wondering who is who and what is going on. It would have been more interesting if it was real. As one who hasn't read any other books by the author, my viewpoint stands in a vacuum. The ending seems trite and fumbles for closure."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"This is the first Val McDermid book I have read and I was disappointed. First, it was slow to start. I was tempted to chuck it in, but was too lazy to go to the library to get a replacement. Finally, it got my interest. ]Be warned, it is quite gruesome in the description of the crimes.There are two stories. Carol Jordan goes undercover in Berlin to get a much wanted criminal. She looks like his dead lover. Meanwhile a serial killer is at work and Carol's police contact in Berlin asks Carol to ask Tony Hill to come to Berlin to do a profile. Tony goes because he knew one of the victims and he wants to be close to Carol. Mistake number one.The second mistake had me screaming at how stupid Carol was. After being with criminal Tadeusz, she returns to the building where she and Tony are staying and instead of returning to her apartment, she goes to his. Not only that, but the curtains are open. She knows she is being followed. She even noted on a previous visit that it was okay to go into the Tony's living room because the curtains were closed. She is a smart woman, but makes a rookie mistake. This really made me mad and frankly left me with no sympathy for Carol.I also felt more heat and chemistry between Carol and Tadeusz than between Carol and Tony. I actually wanted Carol to hook up with Tadeusz. I don't understand why Tony is appealing at all. From what I gather, he's not that old, yet he needs to take Viagra to get things going in the bedroom.When you want the criminal (Tadeusz) to win, there's something wrong with the writing. So I would say McDermid was unsuccessful in this book. I guess if you're reading the series, you'll read this one, but if you haven't, I would suggest you skip this book. Maybe skip McDermid altogether."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"This is probably the grittiest of the Tony Hill/Carol Jordan stories and one of the best. Carol goes undercover in Europe to catch an international criminal and both she and Tony nearly lose their lives as a result. They both begin to acknowledge their feelings for each other but before it can go very far, events take over and in some ways, they end up even farther apart than they were before. This is not a story for the squeamish. There is quite a bit of brutal reality and a rape too terrible to even think about, but Val McDermid has created characters and a story that I just couldn't put down. It left me anxious to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"With apologies to anyone who is reading this as a duplicative review, I am going to review all four of Val McDermid's Dr. Tony Hill/Carol Jordan novels in one place and copy the reviews individually.I've now read seven of McDermid's books. She's not a great writer but she's a fabulous storyteller and her Tony Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries are the best of the bunch. The first two books aren't written terribly well, but the writing gets better as the series goes on. You may know these characters from the BBC series \\"Wire in the Blood\\" starring Robson Green. As an aside, while I generally find film and television adaptations to be far less satisfying than the source material on which they are based, the BBC series is really an exception. While the books have some detail that doesn't make it to the t.v. series, the television program really brings the characters to life and improves on the writing while staying true to the novels, although only the fourth book's plot actually made it to the screen.As noted by some other reviewers, these books are not for the squeamish. McDermid doesn't pull any punches in writing about vicious psychopaths who commit sex crimes and the books may well be disturbing to many. The second book in particular (more below) actually gave me nightmares. McDermid, however, really gets into the heads of her twisted antagonists and she seems to have done a tremendous amount of research. Most importantly, both Dr. Hill, a clinical psychologist who consults with the police as a profiler, and Carol Jordan, the police officer with whom he works most closely, always feel like real people with investigative abilities and compassion that are easy to admire and foibles that are easy to relate to. They have serious difficulties in forging personal relationships which makes their relationship all the more poignant. Each book focuses on two stories -- a main investigation involving a psychopath and a secondary case that is generally no less compelling, while also following the relationship that develops between the two protagonists. If you've never read any of the books in this series, I would recommend taking them in order. The fourth book is the best, the third the worst, but it's worth reading them in order for the character development (although you could easily skip the third). If you really think you only want to read one, or aren't sure and don't care about spolers, just go straight to the last one. Some people who have read the entire series have found the fourth book repetitive, but it's the one that really works on all levels. Overall, the series gets 4 stars, but here are my individual assessments:SPOILER FREE REVIEWS1. The Mermaids Singing - 4 starsThe first of the series is really the only one that delves in any great detail into the personal lives of Tony Hill and Carol Jordan, who come together to investigate the brutal torture and slayings of four men in northern England. McDermid's Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books all deal with issues of sexual identity, but this one does is particularly focused on that as the police suspect a gay man of killing heterosexual men. McDermid shares the thoughts of the killer as well as those of Dr. Hill, who relates all too well to the motivations of the subjects he is asked to profile. The writing in this book is kind of clunky, but the insights of the author into how and why someone sets out to cause maximum pain and humiliation still make it a riveting, if disturbing, read.2. The Wire in the Blood -- 4 starsIn this second book in the series, teenaged girls are being abducted and brutally raped and tortured to death. We are introduced to an extremely smooth and charismatic character, Jacko Vance, a television celebrity and former star athlete, that Dr. Hill and Carol Jordan called upon to investigate. This is the hardest of the series to read, probably because the killer's victims are all extremely young, naive and female, with no chance whatsoever of fighting back. This book deals with charisma and celebrity as well as sexual deviance and although the writing is still somewhat awkward, it's generally a more compelling novel than the Mermaids Singing.3. The Last Temptation -- 3 starsThis is the weakest book in the series. On the plus side, McDermid decides to branch out from northern England and take the reader into continental Europe, particularly Germany, where Carol Jordan has gone as an undercover operative to investigate a drug dealer/slave trader. Tony Hill is also in Europe, helping the police solve a series of murders in which psychologists are the victims. McDermid brings to light some of the darker deeds of the Nazis that are generally not known and discussed and for this she should be commended. The writing also starts to improve with this book and the secondary protagonists, two female, European police officers who develop a long-term relationship with each other, are the best of any of the books. There are some serious problems with the novel, however, that make it the weakest of the bunch. First of all, in the other books McDermid is writing about the North of England, which she clearly knows like the back of her hand. The locale in the other books is really the third character after Tony Hill and Carol Jordan. The European locations never quite come to life in the same way. But the biggest problem with The Last Temptation is that McDermid tries too hard to force a particular ending. In order to get where she wants to go, she has to have Carol Jordan do something completely out of character and, frankly, she doesn't do a good job of convincing us of the reason. The whole book feels a bit contrived. Kudos to McDermid for trying something different instead of just writing variations on a theme, but the theme is one she does really well and this effort is a bit disappointing.4. The Torment of Others -- 5 starsThere's a reason this is the only story that got used in the BBC series. By this point, McDermid had started to write really well, and she'd really gotten the hang of tying the two story lines together. In the main story, someone is killing prostitutes with the m.o. used by a man currently in an insane asylum. How does the killer know exactly what the prior murderer did? The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues. There's not much to learn at this point about Dr. Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level.If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work. If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr. Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"This is my 3rd McDermid novel, I previously read 'Mermaids Singing' and 'Wire in the Blood.' McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which, if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase. Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual. The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger. I was extremely disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"Very enjoyable. Depth of story keeps you interested all the way to the end."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"I don't know what the one reviewer of this book is talking about. This book is terrific and I loved it! Could it be this writer is selling more books than her? It''s a thought. And in my opinion what other reason would another writer slam another one? Too much of that nonsense goes on on this site. I think it is an unfair for anyone to do to another writer! Shame on you guys!"},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"As far as the story goes, I could easily rate this a 3 or 4 star. However most Kindle books I've read (they number in the hundreds) are replete with typos, missing words, etc. \\"The Last Tempation\\" absolutely defies belief. It seems like there are several typos on every page, and some of them are so bad that I can't figure out what the actual word should be. A classic example is \\"die\\" for \\"the\\", over and over again. I appreciate that much of the story takes place in Germany, but Val McDermid is a Scottish writer writing in English.The most irksome feature is the lack of formatting. As scenes shift from one locale and set of characters, to another, the Kindle edition just starts a new sentence (not even paragraph). You be come aware of this as you read on, then have to go back, and adjust your thinking for the sudden shift.Whoever prepares books for Kindle publication seems to have no interest in formatting, and has never met a spell checker he/she was willing to use.This is far and away my biggest complaint with Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"There isn't a way to review The Torment of Others yet because the American edition has not yet been released, (I got one from the UK about three months ago) so I'll just give you my review of both Temptation and Torment here.I hate giving away endings and plots, so I won't do that here, my advice is to read this entire series (Mermaids Singing, Wire in the Blood, Last Temptation) back to back and then buy Torment of Others as soon as you are able. The Torment of others is actually my favorite of the four and I can't wait for the next one. I don't really care for McDermid's other running characters, but I love the dynamics between Tony Hill and Carol Jordan. I don't usually like long-drawn out English romances that may or may not go somewhere, but this relationship is more realistic than most.Oh, and there are some murders to solve in these books, too.:)"},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"It must have been the wrong choice of Val McDermid's work. I must agree with one star reviews.The characters must have just landed from the moon and Special Ops guys use Swiss army knives.With McDermid's grasp of the world I have no more temptation to read her despite Mikael Blomquist (Stieg Larsson's character)read her books."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"Pretty boring book. After about the first chapter I wondered if it would get any better. It didn't. Half way through I wanted to give up, but things were just starting to move, so I didn't.I couldn't get past the fact that it all was so contrived, with the profiler magically pulling predictions about the criminal out of thin air. Definitely not worth the read. If you find that you're not really believing the characters after the first chapter or two, bail out. Read something else."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"The book is by a British woman, the characters are mainly British, and yet the publishers chose an American man to read it! Wow! That choice totally ruins the book. His attempt at an English accent is laughable. I couldn't finish it and I usually love Val McDermid's work. Guess I'll have to get a paper copy."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"This is by far the best out of the four Dr. Hill books I've read. It is riveting, believable, and suspenseful. A definite must-read for McDermid fans!"},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"Val McDermid continues her 'Hill and Jordan' series with an entertaining story that combines a dangerous undercover assignment with an investigation of a serial killer, each of which leaves Tony and Carol on the verge of death!McDermid does a pretty good job of integrating the two subplots, and her use of German and Dutch settings makes for a change from her usual 'real English locations with fictional names' approach.The two policewomen, Petra and Marijke, are among the most interesting characters, and their personal and professional relationship adds some color to the story.As for the 'bad guys', the smuggler Tadeusz and his crony Krazic, are suitably creepy, although the scenes featuring just the two of them are a bit slow. 'Tadzio' has more chemistry with Carol.The 'serial killer' subplot is not quite as riveting as it might have been, relying on the coincidence of Tony knowing one of the victims.McDermid relies a bit too much on coincidental/convenient plot developments late in the book; as other reviewers have mentioned, the bad guys find out what Tony and Carol are really up to purely by chance, due to a careless mistake that neither Tony or Carol would otherwise make. Likewise, when both Tony and Carol are captured separately, both are left tied up, but only one is gagged, and that omision serves purely to advance the plot from a seemingly impossible situation).The ending is satisfying for the most part, although it would have been nice to have a final scene with Petra and Marijke, since it's not likely McDermid will use them again.Despite the amount of 'suspension of disbelief' required in the final chapters, this is still a worthwhile entry in the series."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"The book had a far-fetched premise, but once I was able to move past that detail, the book was readable, albeit unrealistic.Without giving away anything significant, I can tell you that a major portion of the book was centered around a police officer assuming an alias. Unfortunately, I was a little surprised, and very disappointed in the way the author chose to \\"reveal\\" the main undercover operation to the criminal. The unraveling of the cover was brought about by a mistake that I found completely innane. I could not believe that a rookie, much less a seasoned officer would slip up as the author has Carol (and Tony) slip up. This disbelief is compounded by the lengths that are taken initially to insure that the operation is not comprimised.I was disappointed enough in the book to move along to another author, as opposed to reading the rest of the Carol Jordan/Tony Hill saga. I thought the writing skills of the author were good, but the storytelling skills were not."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"McDermid is the author of several series including one with serial killer profiler, Tony Hill and DCI Carol Jordan first introduced in the superb THE MERMAIDS SINGING. This current book is the third one in the series.Two storyline threads interweave themselves into this compelling plot. Carol is offered the bone of a possible promotion if she would agree to an undercover assignment. The assignment concerns getting to know and possibly date a criminal in Germany who imports illegal immigrants from Asia, as well as, drugs. She is to gain his confidence and set him up for arrest. Of course, if her cover is blown, her life will be in imminent danger. At the same time, a serial killer is murdering psychology professors in Germany. The killings are done in a particularly gruesome manner. Tony Hill is on the trail.Val McDermid is a superb storyteller. She succeeds in creating full rich characters that illicit a great deal of empathy with the reader. The parallel plots work quite well together and greatly heighten suspense to the degree that the book simply cannot be put down. This is another strong recommendation for one of our best writers working today."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"What can I say that has not been said before? McDermid's psychological mysteries are absolutely brilliant. She creates memorable characters and her plots are so brilliantly woven. I could not put this book down. But then, I can't put any of McDermid's books down. She gets better and better, though I have no interest in reading her Kate Brannigan series--they sound so fluffy after reading these *intense* psychological mysteries."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"I did not enjoy this book half as much as i have enjoyed her previous books. However, that does not mean it is a bad book. It is actually a very good book, one that i expect will appeal to many people. But it is not what i was expecting, nor what i was looking forward to, and hence i am disappointed.The basic plot goes thus: Carol Jordan is sent to Berlin on an undercover covert operation to trap an evil traffiker in both drugs and humans. Her bosses think she will be able to handle it. During the job she will be almost completely cut off from everybody, and will feel very alone. Her peril's are increased when the actions of her superiours put her in mortal danger.Alongside that, psychologists are being murdered on the contient. Murdered horribly, with no apparent motive. It is when an ex colleage of profiler Tony Hill's is found slain that he takes it upon himself to investigate the killings.The emotionally tangled pair must both tackle their own monsters with little help from anyone else and both of them, Carol in particular, will face great personal danger.It is a very well written book, that is undeniable. However, i cannot say that it is as atmospheric as \\"A Place of Execution\\" or as scary and original as \\"Killing the Shadows\\", but it is thrilling in a hard-edged way. But......McDermid concentrates far too much on Carol Jordan's side of the book, and not nearly enough on the serial killer aspect of the plot, which is what she is known for, and what she does best. As such, the serial killer nit about the psychologists getting killed seems underdeveloped and at times just incidental. Instead of the tense serial killer novel we expect, we are given a novel mainly about the criminal underworld and undercover policing. Many people will greatly enjoy this aspect of the book. And if so, i cannot reccomend it highly enough to you. But, if you are expecting a nice meaty serial killer novel, reasses your beliefs quickly, because it is not what you're going to get.Actually a very good novel, just not what i was expecting. I would have preferred more emphasis on Tony Hill's aspect of the book, but we don't always get what we want, and this book certainly displays Carol Jordan's full abilites."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"\\"The Last Temptation,\\" (2002) is third in what has come to be known as \\"The Wire in the Blood\\" series; a series of British mysteries that so far consists of four novels by increasingly well-known Scottish-born author Val McDermid. McDermid, a leading practitioner of the Scottish crime writing school that has come to be known as \\"tartan noir,\\" for its high level of violence, sheer bloody-mindedness, and grisly humor, burst on the scene withA Place of Execution. That novel won the 1995 Gold Dagger Award for Best Crime Novel of the Year, as well as a \\"Los Angeles Times\\" Book Prize, and was a \\"New York Times\\" Notable Book of the Year. It also won the Anthony, Macavity, and Dilys awards for best novel, and was a finalist for the Edgar Award. A British television series, of the same name,Wire in the Blood 4 Pack; starring Robson Green, based on characters from the\\"Wire\\"novels, is currently being made and shown in the United Kingdom, and in the United States on BBCAmerica.\\"Last Temptation\\" again gives us Dr. Tony Hill, psychologist, academic, and serial killer profiler extraordinaire, and Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan of the Metropolitan Police. It has Carol sent to work on an undercover job in Germany, while Tony finds himself drawn into a serial killer case happening near by. It explores phenomena dating back to the dark secrets of the Nazis; and the East German \\"Stasi,\\"secret police.Mind you, the major plot, the one that has Carol going undercover, revolves around Tadeusz Radecki, ruthless international drug/arms/illegal immigrant dealer. Carol is supposed to resemble his late lover Katerina Basler, and so has been sent to worm her way into his confidence. Unlikely? Would seriously put her life at risk? You bet. Is there any mystery fan in the world that was yearning for one more ruthless international drug/arms/illegal immigrant dealer plot? I doubt it. I wouldn't even consider this plot properly a murder mystery. The subplot, serial killer story, on which Tony is supposedly working, is also problematic: we know the killer from the beginning, and also know what, why, when, where and how he is doing what he's doing. Further, a possible romance's developing between Tony and Carol is not, I think, what readers want, either. And as if all this weren't bad enough, McDermid has also chosen to have not one, but two, German lesbian detectives galumphing around, one Petra Becker, and one Brigadier Marijke van Hasselt, and, before you sharp-eyed readers bury me in critical comments, I know Marijke is supposed to be Dutch and exc-u-u-u-se me.The writing of this book sometimes seems unusually repetitive and flat-footed for this writer. But it is reasonably quick-moving, at least complex: the material is well-organized and suspenseful. The author renders Germany, and particularly Berlin, very well. In a chapter dealing with Tony's academic life - he's teaching at Saint Andrews, Scotland's ancient, prestigious university, headquartered at Edinburgh-- she gives herself the chance to do some lovely writing about her home turf. And, in a crack I've remembered since first reading the book, she references Thomas Harris's great suspense, serial killer standard,Silence of the Lambs. Marijke, you see, was raised on a farm, and she doesn't care \\"how much noise the lambs made.\\" Even McDermid's weakest works are ground-breaking, and this one is no exception; in its treatment, for instance, of the violent consequence's of Carol's ill-considered masquerade. To my mind, this book is immeasurably the weakest of the series: but McDermid fans will still want to read it."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"Like all of her Tony Hill series, this one temporarily satisfies the itch for a Tony Hhill fix. My hope is McDermid will not tire of him, and that he will appear again in one of her amazingly smart novels."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"It's okay if you already like Tony and Carol from the TV show.

(We read the first but not the second, but wish we had read them in order given the many references to apparently what happened in the prior book...) McDermid shows a lot of plotting skill in running really two different and suspenseful stories concurrently - only connected really by the police principals. In one tale, German and Dutch police officials, spurred by an unofficial collaboration between two female officers who rendezvous online with some frequency for romantic purposes, detect that a serial killer is at work, and conduct a book-long hunt for that killer. Tony Hill is amazingly accurate in predicting the killer's profile, almost his very identity; and is a major player in that part of the book. He is housed, meanwhile, temporarily near where Carol Jordan is involved in a very complicated and dangerous undercover operation to ingratiate herself with a long-sought drug and illegal alien trafficker, one who falls for her sexually due to her amazing likeness to a former girlfriend who was killed in a accident. Since Tony is handy, she consults with him on her role playing, partially as an excuse to just spend time together. While the many alternating chapters get a little confusing, along with sections in first person by the serial killer, the plots are nonetheless entertaining until they coalesce just slightly at the end. As in the other Hill/Jordan stories, their relationship is yet another angle provoking our interest. All-in-all, an absorbing outing in the set."},{"Title":"The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill & Carol Jordan Mystery)","review":"I love Val McDermid.

In a humorous way, Dr. C points out that, although it may be hard at first to let your child cry out her frustration, no adult in the working world can get by for very long by throwing tantrums. It's this common sense approach to pareting and discipline that makes this book so worthwhile. The book explains how to use discipline appropriate for the age of your child, and what to do if the first suggestion doesn't work. In the back of the book, he's included free hand-outs that you can use to refresh your memory. If you think about it, what Dr. C. is recommending isn't DISCIPLINE at all.

While it does have some useful information, it is a flawed work at best: Throughout, the author decries traditional gender stereotypes, only to replace them with images no less stereotypical, and no more accurate.A great deal of every chapter is fluff, merely repeating in different ways how women have become internet savvy, and how they do most on-line purchasing, and must be courted as a target market: Pointless, as anyone who didn't believe this wouldn't be reading the book in the first place.Numerous examples of on-line behaviour are given, then used as proof that the example is correct: 'When Cathy is on-line she does x, y, and z': As you can see, Cathy is proving whatever point I am trying to make!Don't get me wrong: The basic marketing techniques in the book aren't bad. The comments on web design aren't bad. And the book is correct in that women are a valuable market that shuld be courted.But this book is more fluff than crunch. I'll be checking out the 'customers also bought' section of the website, looking for something better."},{"Title":"Dickless Marketing: Smart Marketing to Women Online","review":"Most books on e-commerce offer advice on hardware and software, or web design, or e-mail marketing campaigns, or a dozen other pieces of doing business on the Internet. A few recent books and articles have called attention to the importance of marketing to women in the bricks-and-mortar world. Dickless Marketing: Smart Marketing to Women Online pulls all of these pieces together and explains why you need to refocus your online efforts to make sure your Web site rates a \\"female-friendly\\" score on the Dick-e-Meter.Backed by solid research, statistics gathered into the second half of 2003, and her own survey results, Yvonne DiVita has created a roadmap for successful selling online. She provides compelling evidence that success online means selling to women (even if your target market is men; even if you sell a product or service traditionally associated with men; and even if you're selling to businesses rather than consumers).Most important, she explains how to revamp your Web site and your business processes \\"to gain the trust and support of the largest and most generous group of consumers in the world.\\" From site design details to customer service practices to creating community, DiVita teaches us how to do better. She uses dozens of examples, with screen shots and detailed analysis, to guide us.In a chapter called, Can You Handle It?, she reviews in detail half a dozen sites for female friendliness, applying the concepts developed throughout the book to real situations. Even if your site is not one of those reviewed, you will likely find much to learn from these reviews that will apply to improve your Web presence.You do have a Web presence, right? (As DiVita points out in the Introduction, \\"If you have a business, and you do not have a Web presence, it's been nice knowing you.\\")Whether you do or not, you need the information she has collected and presented in her wonderfully readable, sometimes playful, writing style."},{"Title":"Dickless Marketing: Smart Marketing to Women Online","review":"I looked forward to reading this after reading the other reviews, but Divita never really settles into a comfortable voice. She did offer some constructive ideas about specific web content and design techniques to target women. I appreciated this information, and wished she would have focused her energy more in that direction--more of the how-to, and less of the disjointed commentary. Statements that are supposed to be humorous are too often condescending or arrogant. While some degree of stereotyping is expected in a book about marketing (which, after all, targets groups with similar characteristics), Divita too often describes female behaviors, then immediately defends or apologizes for them.She also reveals a disparaging attitude toward anyone in business who is slow to embrace new technology, and specifically, selling on the Internet, but this attitude often seems hypocritical, since her book came out in 2002 and numerous sections of it--from discussions on web trends to TV commercial examples--are necessarily dated and anachronistic.Another frustrating thing I found with Divita's writing voice was the unnecessary refrain, \\"What's not to like about that?\\", along with a continuous sense that she was working too hard to sell me something. Women are an important market--I believed this premise, so I bought the book and wanted to read Divita's insights. I am a woman; it's not difficult to convince me I belong to an important group of consumers, so the overkill of anecdotal and statistical evidence on this point was almost offensive--how could anyone believe women are not an important market? I wish Divita had focused more on specific strategies to target women, and left the hard sell of the premise to the book jacket and introductory chapters. She had me at hello, but she lost me with the same kind of car salesmanship tactics she advises against in her book.It's clear Divita has useful insights to share regarding website design. The end of the book includes an interesting analysis of the effectiveness of several actual websites. While I didn't always agree with her conclusions, this part of the book did offer the kind of specific food for thought that I was looking for. I hope subsequent works will make use of her knowledge, in a voice that addresses the \\"how can I help you,\\" as opposed to the \\"I told you so.\\""},{"Title":"Dickless Marketing: Smart Marketing to Women Online","review":"If you are selling anything, you need to read this book.

For all of us who grew up learning to read with these loveable characters, taking a trip down memory lane reminds us as women how we have to embrace our future more than our past. Marketing to women online is a vital concept that companies need to embrace if they want to sell their products online. I myself am using the internet more and more to purchase goods for my home and my business. It just makes sense considering the time restraints I find myself enslaved to as a fulltime mother of 4. Yvonne not only goes into why we as women will continue to shop more online, but why we have come to realize how much more sense it makes given our busy lives. Our time to redefine ourselves as modern women is over, now our time is to be spent doing what we do best. Budgeting! Its about our time and our money and how we are proned to save in all aspects of our lives. Its also time for businesses to realize that grasping our attention when we visit their websites is more than just making a \\"first impression.\\" Its about developing a relationship, thats what women do. We have moved beyond the \\"handshake\\". Yvonne helps us to realize that we need more to keep our attention. We need to be invited to stay and visit! Not be overloaded with visuals that make us click the \\"next button.\\" Yvonne's book helps business learn how to do that. She makes valid points for creating a website that creates a comfort zone for us and once we are comfortable....look out...we are getting out the plastic.This book is one that will remain on my shelf for a very long time."},{"Title":"Dickless Marketing: Smart Marketing to Women Online","review":"Notice the pattern?Antony and CleopatraBarney and Betty RubbelBob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; AliceDaphnis and ChloDonald and Daisy DuckHansel and GretelRomeo and JulietSamson and Delilahand finally, DICK and JaneHistorically, when famous couples are listed, the male's name is usually first. (Bonnie and Clyde is a very rare exception.) And historically, the marketing of goods and services has focused almost exclusively on men. Times change. DiVita suggests that at least in terms of online marketing in the 21st century, that is a serious mistake. Why? Because women (i.e. Janes) now comprise a majority of the current U.S. population. More to the point, research indicates that online spending will increase 26% this year to $96 billion. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy and women influence 95% and make 85% of all consumer buying decisions; moreover, the majority of corporate purchasing agents and managers are women. Female entrepreneurs account for 70% of new business start-ups.What we have in this volume is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective \\"game plan\\" by which to market online to women. DiVita offers the \\"Top 12 Reasons Why Women Shop Online\\" and suggests \\"Six Ways to Get More Women to Buy at Your Web Site.\\" Although at times her narrative becomes somewhat overheated, DiVita's advice is eminently practical and can be of substantial benefit to almost all organizations (regardless of size or nature). If you are still unconvinced of the upside potential of marketing to women online, consider these facts:* Between 1970 and 1990, the number of women living alone doubled from 7.3 million to 15.3 million and this pattern has continued.* At least 55% of those online each day are women.* By the year 2010, women will control 60% of wealth in the U.S.* College students were responsible for $210 billion in sales in 2002 and 58% of them were female.* Women purchase more than 50% of the cars and own more than 46% of the homes in the U.S.* More than half of all business travelers are women.This book will probably be of greatest value to smaller companies. Although they have limited resources, they can use the Internet (and especially the WWW) to compete successfully with much larger companies and even do so on a global basis. According to DiVita, \\"Dickless Marketing is going to help you construct a homepage that search engines and women will love, a homepage that directs both of them to your products page, a homepage that will get the women, at least, spending money. The vital elements of a female-friendly homepage will get women to share your site with every other woman they know.\\""},{"Title":"True To Our Feelings: What Our Emotions Are Really Telling Us","review":"Background: Robert Solomon, University of Texas, Austin, philosopher in the Anglo-American method and Continental leanings, re-introduced \\"emotions\\" or \\"the passions\\" into the vocabulary of the theories of mind, particularly with his seminal (and substantially revised) \\"The Passions: Emotions and Meanings of Life\\" (1976/1993). He has since written extensively on this subject, including his evolving essays in \\"Not Passion's Slave: Emotions and Choice\\" and his superb \\"Love: Emotion, Myth, and Metaphor.\\" His own \\"philosophy\\" that borrows heavily from Continental Thought is \\"The Joy of Philosophy\\" which is a true joy to read, re-introducing those topics that are most meaningful in our daily lives (not connotative/denotative, but meaningful).As has been a theme throughout all his writings, our emotions are not a subordinate, but the dominant, feature of our mental lives. Plato and Christianity clearly depreciated the West's understanding and value of these \\"things\\" we call variously emotions, passions, feelings, etc. Not until Hume did the passions receive the attention they deserved, only to fall into obscurity again with positivism, analyticity, and ideologies. Solomon resurrected them in the 1970s, and has awakened others (e.g., de Souza, Nussbaum, Davidson, et alia) to an energized interest in these curious \\"things.\\" Alas, even psychology (yes, psychology) has re-awakened itself to these \\"oddities\\" they too had marginalized.This Book: If one is already acquainted with Solomon's other writings, especially those mentioned above, the present one, \\"True to Our Feelings,\\" will not offer any revelatory insights. If, however, one is new to Solomon, this book is an excellent place to begin one's inquiry into this long-ignored subject, aided by Solomon's articulate writing, keen insights, and devotion to assuring the West that life does have \\"meanings,\\" those meanings locked-away as \\"brutish\\" and \\"inhuman\\" by Christianity and others, and the locus of those meanings is indeed in our emotional lives, not in our ratiocinative ones.Using a rhetorical question Solomon posed in \\"The Passions,\\" he asks the reader to recall from memory the most-meaningful memories, and demonstrates that in each and every instance those meaningful experiences and memories were achieved through our emotions. But before dumping our ratiocinative faculties for our more hedonistic emotions in order to make life all that more meaningful, Solomon insists that the very bifurcation of ratiocinative/appetitive is solely conceptual, not actual. The West's Mistake was to make the conceptual bifurcation actual, and thus deprive humans of their appetitive faculties as \\"sub-human.\\" So, he's not articulating an either/or dichotomy as has been the dominant paradigm for millennia, he's conjoining them as they properly belong.Lest one think Solomon's endeavor is another philosophical pursuit in obscurantism, I assure the reader he's anything but obscure. If any philosopher has touched \\"relevance\\" more aptly and assuredly, it's because Solomon has opened the door wide to let all them in. That said, however, it must be remembered that Solomon is a philosopher and these writings, including the present one, are philosophical in their bearing (not biological, as, for example, in evolutionary biology and psychology). The two disciplines are talking the same talk, they're just approaching the same subject from different angles, and both, not either one, are fruitful endeavors in that they mutually-enhance each other's insights and studies.Thus, the present book is an excellent survey of his own thoughts and how they too have evolved as knowledge of these \\"things\\" we variously call emotions, passions, and feeling retake the stage. It also complements all the research in evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Cosmides, Tooby, Ridley, Pinker, et alia). And, as one's esteem in these curious \\"things\\" called emotions has been restored, I heartily recommend reading his \\"Love: Emotion, Myth, and Metaphor\\" (if not all of his other works). No Theory of Mind is even half competent if it ignores the most prominent feature of all, viz., emotions.The Stoics embraced apathethia (apathy) and the Epicureans embraced ataraxia (unperturbility) as \\"responses\\" to emotions (see, Nussbaum's \\"Therapy of Desire\\" for a great survey of these schools and their approaches to our emotional lives). Saint Paul had little positive to say about emotions, but even he embraced (in a moment of sinful weakness, perhaps) \\"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control\\" (Gal. 5:22), so even Christians seem to have protested against emotions too much, too. Solomon has a different approach: embrace our emotional lives, because they fill us with all our most important meanings. And if the emotions of \\"love\\" (romantic, parental, universal) don't speak to the obviousness of that observation, then Solomon won't speak to that individual, either. But don't take that appraisal too proudly (since pride is also an emotion, as are hate, anger, jealousy, etc.) If Nature has endowed the human species with such a rich armamentarium of emotions, why are religion, philosophy, and even psychology repressing the very nature of our constitutions?Hopefully, one will understand why I recommend this book, indeed many of Solomon's books, very highly."},{"Title":"108 Ways to Get a Bright Idea and Increase Your Creative Potential","review":"Arthur VanGundy is an amazing author!

It relates two paralell narratives (or rather - and Queneau is the great mathematical novelist! - base and perpendicular narratives): the historical narrative of the endearingly aggressive Duc d'Auge, nay-sayer to royal authority and public opinion, friend of Gilles de Rais and the Marquis de Sade, and debunker of religion to the extent of daubing on caves in the Perigord region to 'prove' the existence of humanity before Adam; his three daughters, including the defective, bleating Phelise, and their small-minded spouses; his squire Mouscaillot and their talking horses, philosophical Demosthenes and taciturn Stef; and his clerical foils, the abbes Biroton and Riphinte. We meet the Duke at 175 year historical intervals - refusing to rejoin the barbarous crusades in 1264, and forced to slaughter disapproving bourgeoisie; investing in new weaponry, most notably the cannon, in defence of his castle in 1439; dabbling in alchemy in 1614; fleeing the French Revolution in 1789. Throughout he hunts, visits the capital, marries woodcutters' young daughters, feasts ferociously, and debates with his clergy.From the terrifying active Duke, the contemporary story focuses on passive Cidrolin, once wrongly convicted for a crime for which he is still persecuted by an unknown graffiti artist who daubs obscene accusations on his fence every night. Now living on a barge, drinking endless glasses of essence of fennel, he doesn't do much, giving directions to tourists, staring at construction sites or the nearby camping site. Any trip out of the ordinary invariably finds him back where he started; conversations are banal and repetitive. Like the Duke, he has three daughters and sons-in-law, a dead wife and the first name Joachim. He spends most of his time taking siestas, dreaming of the Duke. When the Duke sleeps, usually replete from an enormous meal, he dreams of Cidrolin. Queneau says his book's starting point was the old Chinese saying about a philosopher - When he went to sleep, he dreamt of a butterfly; when he woke up, he wondered whether he was a butterfly dreaming of a philosopher.'Flowers' is, according to the experts, Queneau's most dense and philosophical novel, an intimidating mixture of Chinese philosophy, 'Finnegan's Wake', Plato, Hegel etc. It certainly deals with Big Themes, such as History, Time, Cosmology, Art, the Importance and Interpretation of Dreams. But for the less intellectually alert amongst us (including me), 'Flowers' offers sundry, more accessible pleasures. The comic set-pieces, which can arise from slapstick; bathos and deflated rhetoric; the deadpan recording of absurd conversations, and the absurd convolutions of deadpan conversations. the characters, from whom biography and psychology is deliberately and crucially elided, nevertheless end up being so completely endearing you don't want to leave them. The eulogy to dreams and their subversive power over official history. The detective story element - what crime was Cidrolin accused of? Who is his persector? Why is the watchman of the camp spying on him? Who sabotaged the new flats? Mostly, 'Flowers' is a joy for its language: the historical settings and wide social range of characters allowing for an Augian feast of archaic and obsolete words, jaw-breaking technical terms, slang, puns, neologisms, for all of which Barbara Wright finds delightful and rich equivalents in the wealth of English life and literature. So inventive, audacious and important is her translating, she should really be credited as the book's co-author."},{"Title":"The blue flowers","review":"Raymond Queneau (1903-1976) provided a summary of his novel &quot;The Blue Flowers&quot; (1965): &quot;...'I dream that I am a butterfly and pray there is a butterfly dreaming he is me.' The same can be said of the characters in my novel...&quot;. The plot wigwags between the bedlam-inducing Duke of Auge (clobbering his way through History at 200 year clips) and the perennially-dozy Cidrolin (fixed to the '60s and his barge on the Seine).Is one dreaming the other? That is the basic conceit of this lavishly surreal and philosophically-rich novel.I espeially recommend this title to readers who enjoy books by Italo Calvino, Umberto Eco &amp; Georges Perec.Did I mention the talking horses?"},{"Title":"The blue flowers","review":"Think of a book with two main characters and you cannot tell which one is actually living or is just the dream of the other.

This book full of humour, joy and adventures will capture your attention. And if you read it carefully maybe you won't miss a very interesting conception of Time, Life and History that lays behind the lines not so far from the Hegel's one."},{"Title":"The blue flowers","review":"Queneau is a master, as is his translator Barbara Wright. I don't think you will find a translation that communicates more of the book's essence than this one. Every sentence is a play on words and meaning...Wright manages to take Queneau's French &quot;jokes&quot; and make them equally artistic English ones. This book is a delight in its entirety, perfectly deliberate and crafted, yet whimsical, personal, rambling, historical, and more all at once. It is as forward-thinking as Joyce's Ulysses, and in my opinion as important a primer for the ultimate literature."},{"Title":"The blue flowers","review":"This is a beautiful fairy tale-esque novel that crosses centuries and temperments while writing a new history of France. The main character is Cidrolin, a Frenchman in the 20th century who spends his lackadaisical days giving directions to tourists, painting over graffiti on his fence, and dreaming of the Duke d'Auge. The more charismatic Duke comes galloping into his dreams atop his loquacious well-read horse, starting in the 13th century before running into Cidrolin in our century. In fact the Duke rams his way through history 175 years at a time. In the meantime, he argues religion with the clergy, slaughters herds of bourgeois, and bludgeons anyone who happens to disagree with him. After all, he is a Duke.It does not get any funnier than this. Whether you want 3 stooges physical comedy or satire concerning religion and class, it will be provided. This is a novel in which Don Quixote himself would not be out of place. The fantastic clashes with the mundane, but always to the readers utmost delight.

It is filled with some tear jerking metaphors, powerful quotes, and a sad and wonderfully accurate portryal of life. It is a 'Catcher in the Rye'-esque read that leaves you feeling nostalgic sad and happy all at once."},{"Title":"Things as They Are","review":"This is one of the favorite books I taught to seniors in high school in the late 1960s. I lost my copy years ago and I am greatly looking forward to reading it again (and again) now that it is back in print. It was written in 1951 (the beginning days of birthing boomers) by a two-time Pulitzer prize winner. It is a collection of chronologically sequenced \\"short stories\\" (each a major learning event) in the life of a boy-child growing step-by-experiential-step out of innocence into maturity (young adulthood). Horgan defines innocence as a child's initial belief about self and the world which is summarized in the phrase that \\"the world revolves around me,\\" which, of course, is not the reality of \\"things as they are.\\" It is as good a book today as it was almost 60 years ago when it was written, especially since all of us know too many chronological adults (individually and collectively) who are still \\"innocents\\" in their personal, community, and political lives. Seeing and relating to the world as it is, is seeing \\"things as they are.\\" Horgan's very well written book helps us reflect on our own maturity and how we achieved it (or are still growing into it), what our interaction with key events in our lives led us to, and hopefully those reactions were an opening of our eyes/minds/hearts to accept and see \\"things as they are\\" and act accordingly."},{"Title":"Things as They Are","review":"I liked the book. Life from a child's view is something adults tend to forget. We tend to believe that childhood is a carefree, unaware and uncomplicated time. It's not.

Morris Wu's first novel, \\"Losing Plum Blosson,\\" under the review title \\"A Unique Novel.\\" \\"The Black King\\" is the sequel to her first novel, and it qualifies for a \\"unique\\" label as well. I suggest you read \\"Losing Plum Blossom\\" and its Amazon reviews before taking on \\"The Black King\\" or you'll be lost.\\"The Black King\\" is set in Taiwan around 2001. The plot revolves around the escapades (mostly sex and alcohol related) of several members of the self-important but cheesey expatriate community in Taipei and a few Taiwanese who have the misfortune to come into contact with them. Superimposed on these is an international intrigue involving secret left-wing and right-wing groups in the U.S.A. called CENTURION and PHALANX, who are trying either to promote or discourage the Taiwan independence movement for arcane reasons of their own. Unfortunately, UNCLE and CONTROL never get involved.The nexus of all these intrigues is a neurotic, over-the-hill American Vietnam War widow. The success or failure of the CENTURION and PHALANX agendas hinges on getting her into bed (or not) and luring her away from her Japanese-Taiwanese husband, an eminent orthopedic surgeon who belongs to some kind of radical Buddhist sect (which probably exists only in his own mind) and declines to consummate the marriage for spiritual reasons.Ms. Wu is a long-term resident and educator in Taiwan, which uniquely qualifies her to write accurately and convincingly about the local scene. Given that few popular novels have been set in Taiwan, and that most Americans don't even know where it is, anyone interested in East Asian history, politics, and street life should give this novel a try.A defect of Ms. Wu's first novel, \\"Losing Plum Blossom,\\" was that it looked as if it went directly from the author's printer to the publisher with no editorial intervention at all. \\"The Black King\\" still suffers somewhat from this problem, although it is much tighter and more conscientiously edited than \\"Plum Blossom.\\" Some distracting flaws that I hope the author will attend to in her next novel are as follows.(1) The habit of enclosing names of streets, hotels, bars, etc. in quotation marks is very irritating. Capitalization should suffice to let an intelligent reader know that these are proper names.(2) The practice of having Taiwanese speak in highly accented pidgin English, even when they are speaking Mandarin or Taiwanese among themselves, is somewhat condescending and mostly unrealistic. I live in Taiwan and have seldom heard people talk like that.(3) Many of the Chinese place names in the novel are mistranslated. This won't matter to most people, who don't know the difference, but it bothers someone who does.(4) Former Vice-President Dan Quayle would be gratified to find the word \\"potatoe\\" on page 71.I look forward to Ms. Wu's future literary efforts."},{"Title":"The Black King","review":"THE BLACK KING, Eleanor B. Morris Wu's sequel to LOSING PLUM BLOSSOM is once again set in Taiwan and continues the trials and tribulations of the main character, Clarissa Carleton, an exiled American war widow who marries a local doctor with Japanese connections. The match is not without its problems as her newly acquired husband neglects her for work, leaving Clarissa confused, hurt and seeking friendship among her countrymen. Clarissa's new family connections, however, turn out to be more important than she had ever dreamed of and unwittingly she soon becomes a pawn in the power struggle for Taiwan's independence as the major players of the region readily use her to further their own ambitions. This is an excellent read and well balanced with facts and fiction. Try it!!!"},{"Title":"The Black King","review":"Last year I reviewed Eleanor B. Morris Wu's first novel, \\"Losing Plum Blosson,\\" under the review title \\"A Unique Novel.\\" \\"The Black King\\" is the sequel to her first novel, and it qualifies for a \\"unique\\" label as well. I suggest you read \\"Losing Plum Blossom\\" and its Amazon reviews before taking on \\"The Black King\\" or you'll be lost.\\"The Black King\\" is set in Taiwan around 2001, based on various internal clues alluding to the presidency of George Dumbya Bush. The plot revolves around the escapades (mostly sex and alcohol related) of several members of the self-important but cheesey expatriate community in Taipei and a few Taiwanese who have the misfortune to come into contact with them. Superimposed on these is an international intrique involving secret left-wing and right-wing groups in the U.S.A. called CENTURION and PHALANX, who are trying either to promote or discourage the Taiwan independence movement for arcane reasons of their own. Unfortunately, UNCLE and CONTROL never get involved.The nexus of all these intrigues is a neurotic, over-the-hill American Vietnam War widow. The success or failure of the CENTURION and PHALANX agendas hinges on getting her into bed (or not) and luring her away from her Japanese-Taiwanese husband, an eminent orthopedic surgeon who belongs to some kind of radical Buddhist sect (which probably exists only in his own mind) and has failed to consummate the marriage for spiritual reasons.Ms. Wu is a long-term resident and educator in Taiwan, which uniquely qualifies her to write accurately and convincingly about the local scene. Given that few popular novels have been set in Taiwan, and that most Americans don't even know where it is, anyone remotely interested in East Asian history, politics, and street life should definitely give this novel a try.A defect of Ms. Wu's first novel, \\"Losing Plum Blossom,\\" was that it looked as if it went directly from the author's printer to the publisher with no editorial intervention at all. \\"The Black King\\" still suffers somewhat from this problem, although it is much tighter and conscientiously edited than \\"Plum Blossom.\\" Some distracting flaws that I hope the author will attend to in her next novel are as follows.(1) The habit of enclosing names of streets, hotels, bars, etc. in quotation marks is very irritating. Capitalization alone should suffice to let an intelligent reader know that these are proper names.(2) The practice of having Taiwanese speak in highly accented pidgin English, even when they are speaking Mandarin or Taiwanese among themselves, is somewhat condescending and mostly unrealistic. I live in Taiwan and have seldom heard people talk like that.(3) Many of the Chinese place names in the novel are mistranslated. This won't matter to most people, who don't know the difference, but it bothers someone who does.(4) Former Vice-President Dan Quayle would be gratified to find the word \\"potatoe\\" on page 71.I look forward to Ms. Wu's future literary efforts."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Far and away the best of the Alex Hawke series and by far the best thriller, period, this summer!

There are more problems and plot holes with this book then there are with a book by Clive Cusler.For example the US military loans Hawke a preproduction model of the F35 to fly into a hostile foreign airfield to test the status of the now fly zone and how they will react to the US. First he's not really trained on the plane which even the author admits flies substantially different than less advanced fighters, but the bad guys (foreign nations) would just about do anything to get a working version of the plane which he had planned to land in their laps. Later in the book there is an insane (from a military standpoint) intent to use a super gun with 120+ mile range to cover the 20 mile wide Strait of Hormuz. Not only wouldn't it be appropriate to use it there the installation parameter and the relatively flat trajectory the gun installed where it's supposed to be would negate the effectiveness and range of this gun which was in the real world is intended to launch it's shell in a ballistic trajectory. Beyond the faults with the weapons there are other problems that our hero solves in impossible ways or in impossible time periods. The damage to the auxiliary engines latter in the book is just one glaring example.The book is like a James Bond movie. It works if you don't care about the details.

It started off pretty well. Very interesting plot line, a couple of interesting characters...but then it fell flat for me. I ended up dropping it about 3/4 of the way through.

The author hates government,hates the French and the Chinese, and has an overdevelopedsense of sadism. The tone is flip/cool but the author lackseven the modest talent of an Ian Fleming to pull it off. Thehero is infallible, independently rich, and invariablyattractive to beautiful but dangerous women, which onlyadds to the dullness. There are much better books out there.It is a sign of trouble when the gushing inside-the-coverreviews are from Booklist, Library Journal, a few paid sources,and the Shreveport Onion-Harvester Monthly.

Operations and deployment factors are unrealistic to real world military and /or special operations capabilities.A great spin but he is nowhere in the class of Clancy."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This is the second Ted Bell book I've read. The first was \\"Hawke.\\" Perhaps I should have cut my losses. Bell's writing and research have improved but \\"Pirate\\" is still burdened with hollow characters and jarring implausibilities. In providing fast-paced action and a lively plot, Bell has sacrificed all else.Bell's target audience would seem to be 18-year-old military enlistees with time on their hands. As for myself, I cannot suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy a Bell novel."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This book is a book written as a \\"formula\\" book. It has several outright inaccuracies as has been previously cited. Hawke was given the first F35 to buzz around in? Riiiightt!

Is this Science Fiction?Another case was when Jet was about to be set upon by a frothing at the mouth Doberman, Jet says release the dog. It turns out the dog was a long lost pet of hers named Blondi. Riigghtt! A pet does not show fangs and froth at the mouth.I believe several parts of this book were just stuck in for filler.To often someone shows up miraculously just at the right time to save the day.There is a great lack of creditability in this writing."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I got this one at the library (thank goodness I didn't pay for it!) after hearing someone highly recommended it. I will rememeber this book whenever he recommends something in future.The premise is imaginative, but the execution is formulaic and in dire need of editing. The characters are cliche, and a good portion of the action had me rolling my eyes. The way the characters behaved was so unrealistic; I tried to suspend my disbelief, hoping for a twist but none came. The tempo was uneven; I expect a thriller to be hard to put down, but that was not a problem here. There were some well-written action sequences, but there were a lot more scenes that were mired with long explanations as if the target audience were teenagers (and not very bright ones at that).There were a lot of situations with Hawke and Congreve (God help Britain if Scotland Yard detectives are this dim) that left me wondering how they ever survived. There were too many situations in which spies just boldly walked into situations and started interacting with the bad guys as if an unwelcome American or British intruder wouldn't be shot first and interrogated later (if he survived).If the author had grounded the fanciful plot with realistic action and believable characters, this novel would have been truly terrifying. As it is, it is mediocre and way too long. I would have stopped reading but I was hoping for a surprise twist (again disappointed).If you are looking for an intelligent and well-written spy thriller, check out 'The Gun Seller' by Hugh Laurie."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I have never written a review of any kind.

I couldn't put it down, listened to it through the night. I have the audio version (great for commutes, laundry and woodworking) and the narrator is excellent. The story moves fast and is told from the viewpoint of multiple characters -- this is what slowed me down in the beginning, figuring out who all the characters were and what their role was.If you like your novels action packed with characters that you really care about, some humor and a good ending, then this is the novel for you."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I've read several of Ted Bell's novels and they always entertain and keep me turning the pages until the end.

It follows the adventures of Sir Alex Hawke a descendant of the pirate Blackhawke who works as an Intelligence officer for both the English and American government.The novel opens with an American spy being held captive on a Chinese yacht off the shore of France. He holds information about a ominous link between China and France. Hawke is then sent to save the American spy and learn what he knows. He also has to prevent the plot from being fulfilled.At times the plot is a little far fetched, but it written in a style that prevents you from second guessing anything you are reading. Bell convinces us that anything is possible just by writing it down strongly. The story is always interesting and keeps you involved.Hawke is clearly the next generation James Bond. Hawke has fewer gadgets and focuses more on brute force and hard action tempered with high society intrigue. Which in my opinion makes it a much more enjoyable read. It is a great story written with great style."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Being a fan of Cussler, DuBrul, and Rollins are am always wary of a new adventure author.

I have just started reading SPY and can already tell that the editing is better.Keep it up Ted!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This book was very much like a summer blockbuster action movie, both for the good and for the bad.There was very little character development, pretty much everybody seemed the same to me. I got kind of tired of the bullets flying right next to our heros without hitting them, or them jumping off the boat just as it explodes. Just like an action movie, this type of thing happens over and over.There seemed to be a lot of things just thrown into the plot just for random coolness value. For example, an antigravity train appears for one chapter, bringing our hero to safety and shielding him from bullets with its antigravity field. Then we never hear from the train again. Huh? I sort of expect that something that fundamentally breaks the laws of physics to play a more significant role and have some kind of backstory. There were other things like this but this was the worst.On the other hand, the action was pretty exciting and the plot was fast-moving. I got it for a long airplane ride, and it was perfect for that situation. When I got home, I finished the last few chapters. Reading it at home, where I'm less demanding of action and demand higher quality, the book felt pretty silly."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"There isn't anything ground breaking here, it's just a positively fun book to read.

Far too much time was spent on Ambrose and his love affair and other fluff. There really wasn't much story with our hero Hawke until the end. Pirate did nothing to advance or give more insight to the Hawke character. Also, far to much time on Stokely with his comical remarks in life threatening situations.

Not literature, but a fun thriller."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"The third installment in the Alex Hawke adventure series is easily the best book yet, though there were still a few wrinkles that needed ironing out. Sometime spy Alex Hawke is called in to rescue an American spook who has fallen into the hands of the Chinese. The Chinese, who have become close friends with France, are up to something big, and it somehow involves beautiful actress Jet Moon, whose bed Alex is roused from when duty calls. Jet's father, General Sun-Yat Moon, is in league with her dubious boyfriend, Baron \\"Schatzi\\" Von Draxis. The French, the Chinese, and the German shipbuilder are up to no good, infiltrating the Arab empire of Oman as part of their plans. While Alex's ex-Scotland Yard investigator pal, Ambrose Congreve, travels to New York to hunt for witnesses to a decades-old murder related to the French-Chinese plot, armoire-sized Stokley Jones rescues Jet from her angry boyfriend and travels the world gathering clues with her, figuring out what the French and Chinese are up to. Meanwhile, Alex has to infiltrate an impregnable fortress to rescue a sultan and his harem from their enemies. There were a lot of loose ends to tie up, and just when it seemed like things were winding down, they kicked into overdrive, and Alex suddenly found himself in a race against time to save New York City.Though the book wins points for handling a multi-faceted mystery, I have a few small complaints. First, though Ambrose Congreve is a charming character who adds wonderful texture to the back story, he was given far too large a role. Pages that were spent describing his fondness for the finer things would have been better spent on Alex, whose role in the book was minuscule. Alex is recovering from severe heartbreak, which is a challenging aspect to add to an adventure yarn, but merely leaving him alone for the bulk of the book made me feel cheated. I like Alex! This would have been a good time to delve into who he really is, maybe have him get back to some hobbies he had let slide in his grief over his wife's death, but he merely played a bit part instead. Stoke's part was just about right, and I always find myself smiling when he's on the page. My other complaint is about the action. Though Bell can write a pretty good action scene, this book had a tendency to leave the action when it was hot and not return until the dust was settling, cheating us out of the juiciest bits of the story. These scenes are utterly vital in an adventure novel, and he's doing well up to a point, but the final quarter of the important, tense scenes needs work. Two scenes I sorely missed in their entirety were Jet's family dinner that ended badly and the final takedown with Stoke and one of the bad guys at the very end. Shame on the editors for not insisting on a few more pages there.There was a great deal of character development going on here...for Ambrose Congreve. The rest of the characters, especially the star, needed a little more attention. Bell is still relatively new at this, and he's taken on one heck of a story with this book, which was a smashing success. Its few imperfections mar the overall product very little. He's created a great cast of characters; so it's natural that I want to get to spend more time with some of them. Alex Hawke and friends are climbing the ranks, and they're high on my list of favorite adventure heroes."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but not as much asHawke: A Thriller. It is a roller coaster, page turner book for a long weekend or a sunny day on the beach. Don't expect great literature or admiration to the laws of physics (and sometimes common sense) but it is a fun read especially if you like James Bond movies, Bruce Wayne persona, and Sherlock Holmes character."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This book is a perfect storm of a bad novel: unbelievable plot, absurd writing and annoyingly incorrect details.First is the plot. A thriller doesn't have to be realistic to be good but it does have to have internal consistency. This one doesn't. Time after time, our hero(s) get caught in unescapable situations. You turn the page and they've escaped. No explanation, just escape. it's sort of like trouble, trouble, touble, oops miracle occurs, no more trouble. No explanation, just no more trouble.Next is the writing. Mr. Bell's bio says he was the former creative director of Young & Rubican. Presumably, he was a former art director, not a copywriter because his writing is awful. Other than our three heros, characters flit in and out and back in to the book with no explanation or depth. And the quality of the prose is astounding. I could fill page after page with examples like \\"Moon's sidekick, a nasty little horror-show featuring a bald head with greasy black locks, leaned casually against the sweaty bulkhead, whistling a pretty ditty.\\" I could go on but some readers may have sensitive stomachs.Finally, the details. Mr. Bell, Ile St. Louis is west of Ile de la Cite not south; Hong Kong Shanghai Bank is abbreviated HSBC, not HKSB; von Draxis's sloop cannot have three carbon masts because a sloop, by definition, only has one mast, etc. etc. etc.I'm generally against book burning but I'd make a exception in this case.

The Chinese and French team up in a nefarious plot to assume world dominion backed by a nuclear power-play, and Hawke must race against the clock, face impossible odds, and battle through with the help of his old and trustworthy friends. This is a fun read with tons of action as our espionage hero Hawke takes it to those smarmy French and gives them \\"what for\\". Have fun, I sure did! Nothing quite like a vicarious pounding on the French to make you feel better about your day.Bell's prose is taunt and experienced in this his third outing and his character development is becoming convincing and enjoyable. The pace and writing crackle with Bell's trademark electricity and he deftly ratchets up the tension and odds in each successive scene leading to the spectacular denouement.

It drove me nuts! I'm in my early thirties and started thinking \\"What have I done with my life?\\" Hawke is personal friends with the President of the US who utilizes Hawke and his team to figure out this French / China connection; Hawke is trusted enough to fly a brand new design of a US fighter jet where he is known by the US Navy from previous exploits; His friends are Vietnam Vets and senior Scotland Yard detectives; and he travels around in his personal yacht converted over to a personal battleship.

All of a sudden there was no more big, bad KGB to go do nefarious things. For a while we had a really hard time finding stories with a credible bad guy. Most of the writers have turned to terrorists. You can go save the world from the small group of bad guys that want to nuke New York or whatever.Not so with this novel from Ted Bell. He has leapfroged the terrorist problem to what just might be a really big problem in the future. China is becoming hooked on oil, just like the western countries. China is now the second largest importer of oil in the world. And with a billion people trying to become industrialized, where's that oil going to come from.Enter France, always difficult to determine where France is on the world stage. But clearly France has an oil problem. (The reason she didn't support us in Iraq was that she was selling Iraq proscribed weapons in turn for a more favorable price on oil.)So can France and China get together and ...

In this case that would be the Chinese and the French.The French? Mais Oui! Always an easy country to concour in the last two centuries, they are taken over from within by a direct decendant of Napolean, one Lucas Bonaparte who has schemed his way to the presidency that he considers his birthright (except he wants to be Emporer) by crushing all who stand in his way.The Chinese are simply the last really bad guys on the planet with the wherewithal to make things dicey for the forces of good and they have convinced Bonaparte to join their cabal.Add some delicious characters such as Stokely Jones, Jet and her twin sister along with a few others and enfold them in several ongoing crises and you have the receipe for a barn burner of a thriller novel which is written with a touch of elegance and a whole lot of imagination that will keep you turning pages and burning electricity into the wee hours until truth and justice prevail.

'Do I keep reading or cut my losses?' This is by far one of the most poorly researched and unrealistic \\"thrillers\\" I have ever read.

Nothing like Preston and Childs, but fun. Most disappointing were the four and five star reviews given by Amazon \\"top reviewers\\". Such ratings dilute the value of reader reviews. Even books that don't presume to be great literature should be rated according to their purpose. In this instance, the genre is international thriller, espionage. If this book is worth four or five stars, then what is Clancy's best work to be rated? Not all books should be rated four or five stars just because one will bother to read them.

Nevertheless I am having problems putting this book down.Take this book for what it is worth, fictional entertainment.5 stars."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This is the third Alex Hawke Book I've read and my feeling for it, is the same as for the other two. There's potential there but it rarely lives up to the hype. I was amazed that Hawke let himself get so stupid over Jet in this novel. And I really couldn't understand why Jet would all of a sudden be in love with Hawke and willing to betray everything for him. There was no real development of that story. It felt like there were too many side plots in this novel - Ambrose falling in love? That was hooky. Hawke almost dying in that new plane? Really what was the point of that. I keep reading his books in hope of him finally getting it ALL right. So far it hasn't happened. So I'll probably wait until the next Hawke book hits my library instead of wasting money on it here."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This novel really gets going with an interesting bang. Ted Bell sets up an interesting James Bond type who has seemingly met his match and in a few pages manages to grab the reader with a well told remminice of past events. However, Bell then goes and adds several other interesting characters who manage to overlap one another. Quickly we are accosted by two other James Bond types, one of whom is also a primary protagonist. It all becomes a bit ridiculous after about 50 pages with swashbuckling rancor.My main beef is that Ted Bell goes wayyyyy over the top here. He has a nack for terrific writing, and well fleshed out characters. But sadly he over does it by a multitude of twenty and turns what could have been great into a silly comic book. I kept thinking that 'Pirate' had all of the ingredients to become a modern day Sabatini adventure, but instead it falls on its face with James Patterson-ites.Perhaps what was most disturbing to me while reading this, was the way the chapters were set up. He has so many characters rambling about here that it at times takes six or seven chapters to get back to the one in question. I am used to the modern day second person story telling that jumps back and forth between protagonists. But Bell has a nasty habbit here of leaving a chapter in a cliff-hanger moment. You want to know what is going to happen next, your into the plot, and then you have to hurry through five chapters that also simmilarily set you up in the same manner to find out what happens next. Only by then you probably are exhausted by so many climactic moments that you have put the book down and an hour or a day has passed.I really like Bell, and I hope his next one puts to rest my main beef with Pirate. I think that if it does, Bell will be up there at the top of his field."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"It took a little while to get through the 600+ pages of the paperback. Not that it was hard reading, it wasn't, just the sheer number of pages.It was worth the effort.Pirate opens with a spy, caught by the Chinese, on a slow boat back to China. The spy, however, has knowledge of a Chinese conspiracy to directly get oil from a Middle Eastern country with the assistance of France. He is the only person privy to this information. The CIA sends in Alex Hawke to rescue him, and thus begins an excellent novel. The novel takes you from Cannes, to Taiwan, Paris, New York, and England. Along the way, you meet a very unsavory cross-dressing Chinese agent/assassin, very deadly, twin female assassins, and a megalomaniacal French politician (a direct descendent of Napoleon Bonaparte). Pirate brings all of these characters together for a very believable plot concerning Red China pulling the strings of France to get direct access to oil, access to Taiwan, and subplots concerning super tankers doubling as atomic bombs and a 30-year old murder. The whole point is to crush America's standing as an economic powerhouse. And to sever their ties with Middle Eastern oil.The heroes of the novel, including the main character, Alex Hawke, are well drawn and believable. Bell does a great job of not making the secondary characters two dimensional. He also is able to tie all of the subplots together in a fashion that doesn't seem rushed or contrived. But you have to know that Alex Hawke gets himself out of some jams that will remind you of a Cussler novel. But not as quickly (hey, it is 600 pages - and it was a paperback!)This is the fourth novel in the Alex Hawke series, and I will have to go back and read the others, before reading his latest novel, Spy. This is one of those times when you are glad to have picked up a novel, without knowing that it was a series, and are happy to find that you have additional books to fill in some of the backstory.Another highly recommended series."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Grabbed this in a (poorly stocked) airport bookshop. $8 down the tubes.Ted Bell is an accomplished guy in other fields, but this is book is to classic spy fiction (early Ludlum, Forsyth, Le Carre, etc) as paint-by-numbers is to the Mona Lisa.The characters are awful stereotypes. The English characters are typical of what bad American writers make of British characters -- their mouths full of locutions from British movies of the 1930s and 40s that are heard nowhere in the British Isles of the 21st century.The characterizations are so inconsistent as to be laughable. We're supposed to accept, for example, that a Scotland Yard detective with a legendary reputation suddenly is struck dumb by the beauty of a suspect he's about to interrogate -- so stricken in fact, he begins to act like a schoolboy, unresponsive to others.I confess that this is the point at which I stopped reading, somewhere around page 125. Giving up on a book, like walking out on a movie, is something I almost never do -- I'm a persistent guy, and I'm usually curious enough about the plot to keep going. Hell, long after Ludlum lost his orginiality and became a factory, I bought and read all his non-ghost-written novels. But Ludlum at his most tired, \\"I-signed-the-contract-so-I've-got-to-churn-it-out\\" worst is better than this.If you want good contemproary spy fiction, try Daniel Silva instead."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"What happens when you have a rugged good-looking, quick-witted hero named Hawke, dangerous beautiful women, international intrigue, terrorism and the open sea.........TED BELL is what happens, Pirate: A Thriller is the result!!!Ted Bell puts together a fast paced intense story where the future of the free world is at stake. His characters are unpredictable and cunning. The mission is impossible. Failure is definitely not an option. The action is intense and lightning fast. The romance is heavy and dangerous.

I like the spy/thriller genre, and I like the premise of France and China collaborating to counter the United States. But I can't stand it when an author doesn't even take the time to check his facts. If he had reviewed his manuscript with any number of 14 year old military buffs, he could have gotten some easy improvements. Not to nitpick, but Lear Jets can't land on aircraft carriers. The Navy doesn't fly CIA agents and their rich British friends around on prototype fighter planes. Harpoon missiles can't be launched from yachts. Etc, etc. None of these things is really central to the plot, so why didn't Ted Bell do just a little extra work to get things right? Laziness."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"There are too many technical omissions/errors to make this book readable to me. I get it that a \\"thriller\\" is over-the-top, but when I hit errors of this magnitude(flying a Gulfstream onto an aircraft carrier???), my reading comes to a screeching halt. I got about halfway through it, and just couldn't pick it back up. The characters are likable enough, but they're very one-dimensional and predictable. I'd rather re-read GOOD books than try to slog through this. I gave it one star because I had to in order to write a review."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Bell has created an uber James Bond. He's rich, he's powerful, he's able to do absolutely anything. Everything he owns is the biggest, fastest and most technically advanced. All his friends are the biggest, smartest, strongest, and most connected. Therein lies the problem. He's just too everything. Bell's books are decent for casual reading when you don't want much of a challenge. There are two things that bother me about Bell's writing: 1) notwithstanding Hawke's amazing abilities, he still abysmally stupid at times, and 2) the little technical errors scattered throughout the book. Examples: Speed at sea is measured in knots, not knots per hour. A sniper does NOT put his eye against a scope. 9mm cartridges don't come in belts. A 327 is NOT a big block Chevy. Tomcat F/A 18 Super Hornets? What is it, F-14 Tomcats or F/A-18 Super Hornets? Aircraft carriers and navy bases are not commanded by admirals - that's a captain's billet. The propellers on the Lincoln turning 2,000 RPM? That's about 1,570 MPH at the tip. Ridiculous!Unfortunately, these small errors are distracting, rather like walking into a closed door when you're preoccupied. I read Bell when I'm up for mindless entertainment, not when I want a real story."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"My God this was horrible. I got half way through and had to stop when it was becoming obvious that the bullets would always narrowly miss our hero, wound his sidekick in the shoulder, and kill the bad guys.However, I loved the author's description of France:\\"A demented version of Italy.\\""},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Sorry to say, but Pirate isn't very good. Bell has come up with a thrilling plot, but the narration is just awful. Maybe I am over critical but I find the narrators voice to be annoying. The narrator 'changes' depending on which character has the lead in which chapter. When following Stokely, a ghetto refugeee cardboard cutout figure, the narrator throws around vulgarities \\"and sh**t\\" and generally pitches his \\"voice\\" to mimic the inner city. When following Hawke (half English, half American) the narrator is always shaving the differences. \\"Rather\\" was used to qualify descriptions three or four times on one page of narrative.The characters are all cardboard archetypes. Spy- conflicted, brilliant, irresistable, and talented. Cop- virtuous, dogged, refined. Big man- uneducated, wise, gruff, loyal. Villians- evil, evil, evil and evil. Prostitute- hidden heart of gold etc. under pressure from evil, but desiring to be a good guy after all.The reality is just bizarre. One character can tell if a handgun is loaded by the weight in his palm. Jet Rangers are \\"big\\" helicopters. I guess that is small stuff, but it takes away from the 'thrilling' elements."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This was ridiculously bad. And yet, like a train wreck, I found myself continuing to read it, which is why I'm bothering to review it. Since there are all kinds of \\"bad\\", I'll clarify what I mean: it's written in a pulp fiction style--the characters are more stock caricatures--the foppish english detective, the swashbuckling hero, the former-NY-cop (who was a former navy SEAL and former NY Jets football player) African-American=giant-who-kicks-ass, megalomaniac villains from China, France and Germany. The prose is as purple as it gets. The action always takes place under dark-and-stormy skies. Nobody works hard at anything (or accomplishes much of anything).And yet...I kept reading. I'm a sucker for plot and loved the premise--that Bonaparte's heir teams up with the Chinese to take over the world's oil supplies. I lfound it silly, but kept forgiving, hoping that it would gel and live up to the promise. I forgave characters having a broken leg in one chapter, then walking into a room a few days later, apparently right as rain. I let it pass that a world-class espionage agent didn't know that the woman he slept with, daughter of the Chinese military leader sworn to kill him, has a twin sister, or that both women are military agents. Apparently, he's a world-class agent who doesn't do any research on his target. I kept letting things slide. My mistake.In the end, I was disappointed in myself for sticking with it. There was never any real sense of danger, never any challenge that our characters had to use wits to overcome; things that didn't make sense were swept aside and forgotten; even the final moments with every villain in the book took place OUTSIDE THE STORY. Seriously, someone would walk into the room and say \\"I had to kill so-and-so\\" or \\"they found the body of bad guy x. apparently he'd been shot by...\\" Or, the military would just show up and save things. The reviews that compare this to Bond do Ian Fleming a disservice.Apparently, the publishers have given up having editors edit for this to so miserably fall short of the promise. For that, someone should be keelhauled."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This was the first book by Ted Bell that I have read - I selected it based upon the reviews and Amazon recommendation based upon other books I have bought. While the storyline was really good, the writing was not - there are too many attempts at \\"clever banter\\" along with details that contribute nothing to the plot. Additionally, some areas of the story are passed through very quickly while others go into long, unnecessary detail - I ended up jumping through several sections of pages without missing anything. I also did not care for the abrupt ending - I actually thought my Kindle download was missing pages. Based upon the writing style - and not the plot - I would not recommend this book which is too bad because this could have been a really good book!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"As a BIG fan of well-plotted spy/adventure yarns, I have been frantically searching for someone, ANYONE who could fill the HUGE shoes left by Robert Ludlum after his death. Without a doubt, Ted Bell IS the man to do it. However as a reviewer also mentioned, he is too unique in his own right to assume somone elses spot. He has created his own place in the world adventure/fiction, and he has done it quickly and he has done it very well.Just a few minutes of reading any of Bell's 3 novels and you can sense he just writes differently than what you normally find in this particular genre. There is almost a harmony to how the sentences flow. All I can say is in this case, Different isn't just good, it's GREAT.With Pirate, we see Alexander Hawke on his most daring mission yet. A crazed decendant of Napoleon has a plan to unite China and France together against virtually any and all nations in order to pull off a frightening scenario that includes the Middle East and the one thing they produce more of than almost any other place on earth: Oil. At first I thought that nobody in France or China could be stupid enough to pull off such an insane stunt, but trust me as you read Pirate, you will be utterly shocked at not how realistic it all is, but just how downright PLAUSIBLE it is. Shockingly realistic.Do yourself an immense favor and give Ted Bell a shot. You will NOT be disappointed. Yeah, I know I've heard that one before and it certainly SEEMS like an overused cliche, but in this particular case, I simply cannot endorse this guy enough. But if I could also bend your eye for just a few moments longer, if you take my advice, begin with 'Hawke' and then move on to 'Assassin' before reading 'Pirate'. NOT because you must read them in order, they are ALL excellent, but they simply get BETTER. I cannot WAIT for Alex Hawke's next outing. Yes, the book is THAT good."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"Ted Bell extends his tale just a little too long. But it is good adventure for the arm chair tough guy.

Throw in a 4th rate James Bond, using the Ian Fleming style of product placement, an extremely silly plot - the French! the Chinese! World Domination! - and some hack writing and here you are.The wooden villans can not shoot straight (although they are armed with machine guns). Our hero never misses. His character is lacking. For example, (spoiler alert...just kidding) to rescue the tortured CIA agent he is able to walk onto a Chinese ship (in the harbor of Cannes - Thank God the Chinese decided to hang out with their captive) after stabbing two men. He then rushes the pilot house (oh yeah, best place to keep a captive, a place with huge glass windows). There he is overpowered, but luckily one of the villans decides to monologue. The friendly Navy Seal (I hear that they are great to have around in times like these) intervenes. Our hero has a moment of thought when he sees the villan on the ground - he hates to kill in cold blood (um, what about the two guys on the dock?). Our hero continues to look for the captive and finds him in a closet. One of the bad guys is shooting at them, but the hero is able to shoot him, whipping his Walther out in less than a second, from a rubber boat before his friendly Navy Seal (who is slow to respond to a machine gun - I guess he was sick that week in training) is killed.If you have time to kill, and do not require much besides the occasional \\"blow stuff up\\", this is the book for you. If you require that the author writes proper English, creates characters, has a sense of place and setting, then pick up someone else. This one wanders off into French-hating, evil Chinese, and a plot defined by twelve monkeys and a typewriter."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I am not going to repeat other reviewers discussion of the lack of character development.My issue is with the lack of basic research. One incident has Hawke's Zodiac being fired upon by a French Patrol Boat's missile. Bell uses the Harpoon missile as the weapon. The French have their own very effective ship to ship missile in the Exocet. Very unlikely that the French would use an American made Harpoon. Later in the novel, Hawke is taking off from a carrier deck in the latest VTOL aircraft, the F-35. The catapult fails and Hawke is put in grave danger. My problem, this is a VTOL aircraft, which the author goes to great lengths to mention and describe. Why would there be a \\"cat shot\\" at all. VTOLs are designed for vertical takeoff and then transistion into level flight, which, again the author describes. Also this scene has nothing to do with the story. Just another \\"Saturday Cliff Hanger\\" episode.This is my second attempt at a Ted Bell novel, ASSASIN being the first. There are too many other writers out there than give a sense of believability for me to waste my time on this type of thriller. I believe the author has the ability to create a very good novel. I wish he would cast aside the unbelievable and go with something a little more creditable."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This was my first novel by Ted Bell and I can't wait to read more! \\"Pirate\\" was a spellbinding, edge-of-your-seat, awesome adventure from page one. With a wide assortment of interesting, complex characters and situations, this book is anything but dull. It spans several continents and jumps back and forth from various story-lines which are all clearly connected. There are twists and turns galore and the ending will not let you down!Ted Bell is an truly exceptional writer which is so refreshing in this genre where most authors tend to be creative yet not particualrly talented. The book is intelligent, the characters practically jump off the page and the diaglogues very well-written. I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!"},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"There is some good writing in this book, but it is limited to about 100 pages out of 600 pages. The main character, Alex Hawke, excuse me I mean Lord Alex Hawke, is a magical combination of James Bond, Austin Powers, Batman and Superman--he can do it all...around the world in a day. He is friends with the President of the US, he's a British Lord called on to rescue a hostage from the Chinese, rescue the Sultan of Oman from a fortress, rescue NYC from a nuclear bomb, fly a $50 million stealth jet on loan from the USA to a US aircraft carrier. Apparently the US Navy Seals, US pilots, etc don't exist in this book, as the Pres of the US, the CIA, Scotland Yard, etc rely solely on Lord Hawke to save the world. Hawke is apparently in his young 30's too.In the book, there is also the ego-maniacal descendant of Napoleon who murders his way to the top of the French Government. There is also the Chinese version of Hannibal Lecter who is an assassin and total freak, The German industrialist Neo Nazi who are all scheming to take over the world. They all meet with anti-climatic ends.And of course Sir Alex Hawke gets the girl, a beautiful Chinese spy, actress, singer, diva, etc who, after one night with Sir Hawke, betrays her country, kills her evil twin sister, almost kills her father, betrays her ex-boyfriend, helps Hawke's friend Stokley, the 6'5 260lb ex Jets running back who sneaks into all of the enemies' lairs to help Hawke save the world.The tone of the book varies from life and death serious to total tongue in cheek; it makes me think that even the author doesn't believe what he's writing.Bell's new one is on the best seller list. I guess that is what marketing can do for you."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"It is probably too late, but I've decided that when I grow up I want to be Ted Bell. You can tell from the opening page of any of his Alex Hawke thrillers --- be it HAWKE, ASSASSIN, or the newly published PIRATE --- that the guy is a marvelous, unique talent: he has a canny understanding of how apparently disparate events and facts are connected, and a unique way of providing explanations for them --- so much so that his novels, taken collectively, could be subtitled \\"How The World Works.\\" He is also married to a woman who, while not a household name, is possessed of one of the most brilliant minds on the planet. Lest you need any further endorsement, keep in mind that \\"10s\\" don't marry \\"2s.\\" Bell's most significant literary asset, however, is that he understands people, so that while his excellent novels are plot-driven, there is always a set of living, responsive hands firmly at the wheel.PIRATE is the third and best of the Hawke novels, an already brilliant series of derring-do and contemporary swashbuckling that contain more action and interesting characters than most books do in three. Hawke is brilliant, wealthy and talented; notwithstanding all of that, he is quite believable, even as he executes every task flawlessly, from (almost) single-handedly rescuing a hostage who possesses knowledge that threatens the free world, to carrying off a seemingly impossible escape from a technological grave with the coolheadedness and collectiveness of a Harry Houdini.The secondary characters are a delight here, ranging from Stokely Jones, who is guaranteed to save Hawke's bacon at least once per novel, to Hu Xu, who may well be one of the most unique villains introduced in recent fiction. Indeed, Xu, a cross-dressing assassin and expert interrogator, is guaranteed to creep out a reader from first appearance to last, as much for what he does as how he does it. His ingeniousness and depravity put me in the mind of Fu Manchu, a brilliant pulp villain from the early 20th century; as bad as the guy is, you can't wait for his next appearance, as he plots to...Well, yes, there is a plot to all of this, and a great and timely one it is! Luca Bonaparte, the ruthless descendant of Napoleon, plans to seize control of the reins of the government of France in a daring, de facto coup d'etat. His aim is to restore France to its 19th century status as a major world power. Bonaparte forms an unholy alliance with China to achieve this goal. China, with its nuclear arsenal, and France, through the use of an otherwise benevolent alliance, plot to occupy and control a sovereign, oil-rich Middle Eastern nation in order to utilize its most abundant natural resource for its own purpose. Hawke is brought in to provide clandestine support to the CIA in an attempt by the U.S. to thwart this alliance of convenience and the deadly nuclear confrontation it represents.It isn't entirely all Hawke's show, however. Stokely Jones is heavily involved as well, as he squires a beautiful, enigmatic Chinese actress across Germany while attempting to unlock the secrets of a wealthy German industrialist, hidden away in a mysterious and magnificent fortress near the Untersburg and Waltzmann mountains. Bell, never without his masterful touch, switches back and forth among various and precarious events, keeping the reader consistently off-balance and constantly entertained, from the first page to its thrilling, countdown conclusion.Bell easily could be considered the rightful heir to the throne of Robert Ludlum, but he is too talented to assume the chair of another; he brings his own to the table with unique and considerable talent. PIRATE and its predecessors are unbeatable.

The pace is relentless and the action keeps the reader in its grip right up until the very end. We go to some exotic locales with Hawke and his merry band of mercenaries while they attempt to save our world from the terrors and bad people that have cruel designs on it. We even get a truly nasty villain that it is our pleasure to \\"love to hate\\".The book breaks off into about three or four different story lines, but that does not seem to fracture the plot. It just adds whole new dimensions to the pace and to the tension. Hawke is a wonderful new \\"James Bond\\" type of figure who gets into and out of more scrapes than we can imagine. His entourage led by Stokely Jones (my favourite character), Brick Kelly and the indomitable Ambrose Congreve mange to get into and out of a lot of trouble all on their own.

This particular book is over 500 pages, but it doesn't seem that long once you get into it."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"This is billed as a Hawke novel, but there are two other great main characters that fill out the book. This is the thriller blueprint for beyond the year 2000.Starting with Lord Hawke - he's the 21st century's James Bond. His sidekick Stokely is the 21st century's Hawk (to Spenser). The inspector is the 21st century's Sherlock Holmes.The three team up (with help from other equally good side characters) to meet and beat a conspiracy of Chinese, German and French megolomaniacs that have a plan for Chinese domination that fits the 21st century as well. These bad guys are perfect Moriarties/Dr. No's, etc. for this century.To cap the comparisons, there is the understated British humor throughout - that rye, dry look at the world - that Hawke and the Inspector exhibit that is reminiscent of Bond. Stokely's humor is American all the way - a black Spenser rather than a tight-lipped Hawk. You can't help but enjoy these guys.There is non-stop action and thrills (of many varieties) for the full 500+ pages. Like all of this genre, you know the good guys will win. However, every scene poses a different challenge, including the possibilities of moles and traitors. The expected outcome never diminishes the tension or excitement.This is highly recommended and I will be rushing to Bell's other Hawke novels."},{"Title":"Pirate (Hawke Series)","review":"I have been a fan of James Bond for many years.

It has many excellent recipes containing my beverage of choice ;-) as well as other \\"down home\\" and family keepsake recipes gathered from the citizens of Lynchburg, TN. (For the uninitiated, this Divine Nectar is distilled there - in a &quot;dry&quot; county!) There are luscious photographs of the food and a travelogue for Lynchburg.

As you're perusing the wonderful recipes and stories, if you're lucky you'll meet Lem (is he really Jack Daniel?) or Pat or Lynne (those beauties on the dj) you'll never forget them. Heck, make trip to Lynchburg AND you'll really meet the warmest, most friendly folk since you were a kid in kneepants (or buttons and bows). Don't know who runs the office where this book was born (and no one will admit to it so if everyone's just &quot;cog in the wheel&quot; --- what a smooth-running and happy machine!). This latest and an earlier volume (call it One, this one Two) are both keepsakes, and a good cook's chance to &quot;break out of the mold.&quot; Yes, there are some Social Drinks in there like Rolman's Year-Round Toddy that keeps him young and fit, and the Hollidays' La Creme Damage, which takes a sippin' whiskey to a smooth milkshake. OK, OK, Cakes, Casseroles, dishes for those down-home get-togethers...at Christmas, Special Birthdays, Family Reunions, close-knit neighborhoods just making their own weekend retreat while the ballots are being counted. Hearth and Home, Oh My! Did I mention Pat Mitchamore's &quot;A Tennessee Legend,&quot; all about Bottles and Jugs? That's one of my favorites, too."},{"Title":"Song of My Soul (Silver Hills Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Adrian is a wanted man who, name changed, has bought a mine in a small town in Colorado. He is determined to stay unknown, but the town has its' fair share of nosey busybodies who refuse to overlook his every move. He also owns the only store and has one employee to whom he has gotten way too close. Can his love for her be the one thing to cause him to come clean, or must he continue to run? I was very pleased with book 2 in this series and have already started book 3. Thank you Ginny."},{"Title":"Song of My Soul (Silver Hills Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Props to a writer who can actually write believable dialogue. Okay part of the storyline stretched believability beyond reason but it was still a fun read. Adrian's got a hidden past; Phoebe's not too keen about her future and both are out to right wrongs or bust.Aiken's characters are fun to get inside, their lives are usually never dull and even the \\"sappy romance\\" you know's bound to come finds new ways to surprise a reader."},{"Title":"Song of My Soul (Silver Hills Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I have read several of her books?

Photography is intimately connected to memory and Garrett goes searching for her mother and ultimately herself through academic considerations of the nature of photography. We are drawn into Garrett's life by her poetic words and left to consider our own stories told and untold by photographic remnants and tracks. I will never see my photos in the same way again."},{"Title":"Quick-Eyed Love: Photography and Memory","review":"Not what I expected and wasn't really into it. I found it a little slow and stopped reading halfway in."},{"Title":"Crescent Rivers: Waterways of Florida's Big Bend","review":"This book shows Florida at its natural best, with an insider's look at some of the state's most beautiful waterways. As a Florida native, I found the book especially enjoyable - as it shows images of things that are disappearing all too fast. Even those who have never seen sights such as those Bertolaet reveals will enjoy the beauty of his photographs. The images draw the viewer into each scene, and it's easy to imagine the call of birds, whisper of the wind through branches or the murmur of water moving swiftly past. The writing is entertaining and easy to read, while also offering food for thought about the natural world and man's relationship to it."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"I found this book well worth the cost simply for the art. I have a great many books on WWII and secret projects, but most simply provide dry technical information, and 3-up drawings gleaned from old blueprints.This book, however, provides color illustrations from dynamic angles for a large portion (probably 80-90%) of the planes in the book. The information provided is certainly decent, with technical information, and 1-2 pages of text for each plane, but I felt the art, which was all excellently drawn, was the real gem.It is quite encompassing as well, with just about every hypothetical plane for which there is information on contained within. It was such a well done book I've ordered its companion, the Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Fighters, 1939-1945 book as well."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"Ignore the nut babbling about UFOs. This book is a well-written volume about secret Luftwaffe designs - all within the realm of possibility - that goes into great detail in discussing what might have been had the war lasted longer. It is illustrated throughout with beautiful color paintings of these proposed aircraft. I have purchased all books on the market about &quot;Luftwaffe 1946&quot; designs and the two volumes in this series are by far the best (even without the UFOs). You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"A fabulous buy. Heartily recommended. It doesn't have reams of text making for a dull read like many historical books, but still remains informative and to the point (as many designs were just that with no hard data available). The artwork on the cover by renowned aviation artist Keith Woodcock sets the tone for what is an excellent resource for modellers of Luftwaffe aircraft and military enthusiasts alike. Plenty of nicely rendered artwork can help modeller's choose paint schemes, decals, as well as fire the imagination to try and kit-bash some of these designs and view with interest what was so close to becoming our reality. This is more than a coffee table book. And UFO enthusiasts should look elsewhere - I don't see the relevence of a mention of that from a previous reviewer as the book extends only as far as a variety stealth bomber/flying wing designs which are so familair today...."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"It is well known that the Germans never fielded a heavy bomber to compete with the B-17, B-24, Lancaster, etc.Less well known is the fact that the Germans spent quite a bit of time both before and during the war on developing large bombers. That they were not put into production was a matter of political and military decision making rather than any technical issues. Neither the Army nor Hitler expected a long war with the need to bomb the Russian factories beyond the Ural mountains or of course England. Planes like the Dornier Do 19, the Junkers Ju 89 and 290, and of course the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor were produced and flying before the war.This book is mostly drawing of planes that never made it past the design phase. But in these drawings you can clearly see the equivalents of B-29's even the later B-36 (Except that it appears that almost everything the Germans did had two tail fins.). There are several flying wing designs that were being done just about the same time as the Northrup B-35 Flying Wing. The Messerschmitt ME P.08 was proposed in September of 1941, the Northrup contract was awarded in November 1941. Presumably the ME P.08 wouldn't have worked any better than the B-35 because the computer controls just weren't up to it in that time frame.Of course the German Jet powered designs are very interesting as well. They had the jet engines in production and were beginning to think of the problems of layout and design for jet powered bombers. A gret fun look at what was never to be."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"I mostly disagree with &quot;anhistorian&quot; and his review of the book. The artwork in it, and it's two companion works, are top notch. I agree much of the text is simplified, but as a bonus that gives more room for line drawings, illustrations and photos. And I am not really interested in the authors political alignment, I am just reading his book. If you think he is being pro-German, well it appears to me that he IS German, and loves his country. Mr &quot;anhistorian&quot;, if you are an American, don't you love your country? Nuff said. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this unique subject. Great job!"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"This book is an incredible overview of the misguided genius behind the air arm Nazi war machine. The color plates are beautifully rendered and well complimented by the plan views. Considering the way things ended it's amazing that any of this information survived. It's also quite interesting to see the roots of the American jet age in these designs."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"This book is exemplary in its illustrations, line drawings, and photos of the various production models, prototypes, and proposals for new bombers. The imagination and forward thinking of the German aircraft designers is just stunning, and lucky for us Der Fuhrer did not persue a long range strategic bomber program. So, aircraft buffs, modelmakers, you will drool over this book.Guten Tag meine Herrs/Fraus"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"I came across the first of these books a long time ago..I had to wait for the two that followed a few years..this is the second in the series..I've personally always been drawn to the exotic and strange weapons Nazi Germany was meddling with from before the war and during..A lot of these designs have obviously influenced so many of the post war jets it's incredible.The German scientists left a wealth of documentation behind to show they had some pretty way-out ideas for aircraft..A lot were way beyond their time,some would never have flown,but some would have been a real menace in the skies over Europe(as shown by the operational appearance of the Me 262,Arado 234 and to a lesser extent the Me 163 and He 162).The whole swept back wing idea and flying wing concept was taken onboard by all nations after the war..I was lucky enough to get the whole set of these books. If you are a Luft 46 fan as I am and build thee exotic models these books give you plenty to ponder on..The artwork is great,although the writing is sparse it still gives a lot of detail. I would think these books will become quite hard to find soon so grab them while you can!"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"The paintings in this book, realizing in many cases designs that were never constructed, are first rate. Unfortunately, the rest of the book is not to the same standard.Data on the designs is sparse at best, and the information is far from complete. The entry on the Junkers Ju 390, for instance, even though it appears in the section \\"Target New York,\\" neglects to mention the second prototype, which flew to within 12 miles of the American coast near New York (only the first prototype is mentioned, and described as if there never was another -- an outright mistake). A vastly better entry on this plane appears in William Green's Warplanes of the Third Reich. Text entries in this book are consistently brief & lacking in detail; too often, they are oversimplified or inaccurate.Likewise, the chapters on projects from 1944-5 contain a number of designs from the early 1940s, and even some from the 1930s. There seems no rhyme or reason to the organization (furthermore, some of the planes included are not strategic bombers at all, despite the supposed focus of the book). Another problem is that related series of aircraft designs are scattered, out of order, through different parts of the book, without reference to chronology, technological development, or any other logical consideration.The author's pro-Nazi sympathies are also too much in evidence; he served in the Luftwaffe's design bureau during the war, and his regret that Germany lost the war is repeatedly expressed. He is actually quite strident in calling it a tragedy that New York was not bombed. He blames rigid bureaucrats at the top of the Nazi government for stopping designs which he clearly feels might have turned the war in Germany's favor, something he sorely wishes had happened. Given the horror that Germany unleashed on Europe and the world in the 1940s, I find it hard to read such dubious nostalgia.The one plus point of this book is the illustrations. The paintings are first-rate, showing all of the various designs in splendidly realized detail. Unfortunately, it's hard to appreciate the illustrations, since the book gives no clear sense of the development of the aircraft they depict.In short, if you are a modelmaker, you may well find this book very helpful. If you are interested in the remarkable technological leaps carried out by the German aircraft industry during the war, this book will not teach you much. For all the designs that were actually flown, Green's book, mentioned above, is vastly superior to this. For the planes only designed, this book is still the only game in town -- but poor information is not much better than none. I returned this book."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","review":"The (brilliant) illustrations and the (weird) technology described by the authors seems &quot;sci-fi&quot; to us, even now in the XXI century, and most of the times this book is closer to UFO literature than to military themes. But that's what makes the book BIG fun to read. So if you are interested in secret technology, nazi conspiracy and UFO stuff... you must read this book."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Exam Verbal Workbook (Kaplan Gre Verbal Workbook)","review":"I took my GRE in October and got 96% for Verbal. I think I owe it to this book (AND to Barron's Pass Key to the GRE). This book has a very helpful vocab list -- I especially like how they break down into which sets of words are most common, then next most common etc... I also found their analogies section and sentence completion section very helpful -- the 4 types of bridges idea for an analogy was next to revolutionary for me. Also learning that the answer choices for an analogy have to match the same order as the words in the analogy. I lived 27 years and NEVER knew that, I don't know how many times I've gotten questions wrong from having the correct relationship there but the answer words in the wrong order.The other sections I didn't find too helpful, the reading comp.

In the end he is just a normal giraffe again."},{"Title":"A Giraffe and a Half","review":"Vivid imagery coupled with the hilarious, rib-tickling narrative in this story continues to illustrate the magnitude of Shel Silverstein's creativity.From the Giraffe and a Half looking cute in a suit, playing toot on his flute, to the snake eating cake who was told to go jump in a lake, to the entire montage falling in a hole dug by a mole including the dragon whose wagon was saggin..this is the most wonderful rendition of taking an event &quot;full circle&quot; that you will ever read!Once again, Shel Sliverstein captures not only young readers but adults as well, subjecting each to a &quot;young-at-heart&quot; mentality that is completely infectious and renders the reader full of laughter!By far Shel's BEST YET! Excellent reading for one and all"},{"Title":"A Giraffe and a Half","review":"Shel Silverstein's poems are always truly a delight. Some of the collections, however, contain poems that are not quite appropriate for the very youngest listeners. A Giraffe and a Half IS targeted at the youngest audiences.As the poem goes on, the titular giraffe is exposed to a more riotously funny situation on every page (a rose on his nose, glue on his shoe, etc.) My kids were laughing hard, and completing the rhyming phrases by the time the tired (and ludicrously attired) giraffe is rescued from visiting the mole in his hole, and divested of all his rhyming add-ons by various (also rhyming) people and animals.This is a great book to read aloud to your children--just remember to take a BIG breath at the beginning of each page!"},{"Title":"A Giraffe and a Half","review":"Giraffe and a Half is my favorite childrens book.

I take them to the library every few weeks, and my boy has fun getting some of his old favorites for me to read to his little sister. She doesn't always like the ones he picks out, but this one was even more of a hit with her than it had been for him. Besides being wonderfully clever and entertaining, the cumulative verse structure is really motivating her to learn how to read. She's got the first half of the book memorized, and we've got some incredibly cute video of her \\"reading\\" it.

In my 33 years as an educator, both teacher and principal, I have used his books every year and in every classroom. His stories and poems are not only fun to read, but also fun to hear! Read them to your children, kids of friends, grandchildren, and to yourself when you need a good laugh.While I am writing this review for a different title, 2 of his books of poetry are my favourites.

I believe that everyone should have at least one of his books; but, of course, after you read one, you'll hanker for more!"},{"Title":"THE CHURCH AND THE AGE OF REASON 1648 - 1789","review":"This is a good summary of what was happening in the European Christian church during the period mentioned in the title (although in the interests of context it does look at events that occur either side of the dates). In particular, this book is strongest when it analyses the impact that changes in society were having upon the Church. The basic format is for each chapter to focus on one particular country for one section of the period.One of my criticisms of the book is that 5 of the 15 chapters (plus an introduction and an epilogue) focus on England and 2 focus on France. Of the 8 remaining chapters; Germany, Scotland, Russia (and the Eastern churches) and the New World rate a chapter each, while the other 4 look at the impact of specific cultural changes. It does come across as being very Anglo-centric.Another negative about the book is that the writing style can be a little pedestrian at times. Yes, this is history, but there are plenty of history books around that make it clear that you can write history (and remain accurate and factual) while still being a page-turner.While this sounds quite critical, I did enjoy reading the book. The period (between the enormous changes of both the Reformation and the French Revolution) is a fascinating one and there is much in this book that has prompted me to want to read more. Cragg's footnotes and bibliography point in some good directions for doing so. In reality, if there were half stars I would rate this one 3 1/2, but my criticisms mean that I have to lean toward the 3."},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"The reason it's second-best, is that the first book, &quot;The Old Man and the Boy&quot;, is the best.

If you can't, then just read them anytime, anywhere."},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"A brilliant sequel to the book &quot;The Old Man and the Boy.

Marvellous!"},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"I hate sequels, but in this case it worked! The Old Man and The Boy was great, this one is too.

In my opinion, these two books are the author's best work, much better than most of his fiction."},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"\\"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older\\" is the wonderful sequel to \\"The Old Man and the Boy\\". As the author grows up and moves away from his grandfather, he remembers more of the things his grandfather taught him. Being hungry, miserable and mistreated in his first job as crew on a cargo ship brings memories of hunting for ducks and the wonderful food prepared in hunting camp. The reader can see how the grandfather started teaching Ruark to be a man, and dealing with adversity on his own taught him more. As with \\"The Old Man and the Boy\\", this book contains some really beautiful hunting and food writing. A book not to be missed by old men, boys, and anyone else who loves the outdoors."},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"In my opinion, most sequels do not live up to the original. Many movies support this theory. In this case, The Old Man's Boy Grows Older has quite a challenge considering the quality of Robert Ruark's original book about growing up in NC entitled, The Old Man and the Boy. I found this book to be good as good a read. Once again, Ruark wrote this book a chapter at a time, each with its own tale, advice, lessons learned, etc. The difference is that Ruark share many of his own life experiences, as he does the advice he received from his Grandfather (the Old Man) growing up. The two views present and past work well together.I particularly like the fact that Ruark traveled the world on many outdoor adventures, yet he can connect all of it back to the simple way of life that he learned back in North Carolina in the early 1900s. He also includes a lot more detail about his hunting exploits that I enjoyed since it includes stalking big game in Africa. The last few chapters of the book provide an intriguing gliimpse into the mind of Ruark as he decides to purchase the home he grew up in, and talks about the memory of his favorite dog.If you have read the Old Man and the Boy, and have not read this sequel, you should. If you have not read either, I recommend starting with the original, then taking a break for awhile, and reading this second one. Some of the content is repeated, thus my recommendation for a slight gap between the two."},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"This is essentially an anthology of columns written for a major outdoor magazine in the fifties. These were among the last columns written by Ruark for it and essentially the boy has grown and the major character the 'old man' is gone. So, you get a lot of rehashes of the same material written previously as remembered by the boy. I guess you should keep in mind that these magazine pieces were written to be read monthly and not a series of short stories. So, if you haven't read any \\"Old man the Boy\\" material it will be an interesting and gratifying read. If you have read the delightful series \\"The Old Man and the Boy\\" it is diminished. And if you're choosing between the two books, read the first one. Everything is better the first time."},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"I read The Old Man and the Boy and then this book back to back. I found this book to be repetitive, containing some of the same stories and references from the first book in perhaps a recap form. This one was not nearly as interesting to me as the first one. Of course what makes the first book so absorbing is the grandfather's advice to young Ruark which is absent or abbreviated in the second book. Maybe if I hadn't read them back to back I would have liked this one more. It was a disappointment after how great the first book was."},{"Title":"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older","review":"I gave this book to my husband to be for his birthday.

The first were stories of a bygone day, when our grandparents were there when our fathers came back from WWII. It's about ourdoorsy things, and rural things, as the setting for a youth's learning from respected elders what was important. THIS volume is not so much nostalgia but a personal distillation, sometimes wistful, as that boy assumed the role of adult. Probably autobiographical.

I have already read the first book \\"The Old Man and the Boy\\" and it was also great, I am only half way through this one but have not been disappointed yet. My only complaint is that the sellers description clearly stated unmarked and upon opening it to read I discovered that this book was in fact heavily marked as if by a child using it for a book report.

Block creates one vivid character after another in his Scudder series (Walk Among The Tombstones and A Long Line of Dead Men are especially recommended). But he stumbles badly here.Tanner On Ice has it all: A rambling, utterly structureless plotline; paper-thin characters; creaky dialogue. You get the idea that Block is parodying the spy genre somewhat, but this doesn't even work as parody.What's aggravating is, Block is clearly expert enough to write a spy thriller that mocks the genre even as it uses the same conceits to capture the reader. He just didn't succeed here.

(There are seven others, all out of print.) Tanner is the spy who never sleeps. He was placed in cold storage, hence Tanner on ice; a quarter of a century before this latest adventure takes place. Tanner's reentry into the 1990s finds him catching up with all things modern such as computers, the Internet and E-Mail. He does some quick research to catch up on world events he has missed. Tanner goes to Burma and stirs up the county's regime. Here he meets a beautiful Russian/French/Vietnamese woman who travels with him.

The conceit of being &quot;de-frosted&quot; after 25 years would be more acceptable if the entire tone of the book gave way to this surreal assumption. I loved the evocation of the politically charged Burmese landscape, but thought that an extenuated escape from Burma had too much malaria and too little wit. I think the intent was an homage to Donald Westlake in the &quot;Smoke&quot; vein, but as they say, no cigar. If you do venture to &quot;Tanner on Ice,&quot; however, there is a poor sod from Australia that Tanner meets in jail whose crime is so ridiculous that it's probably based on the actual law of the land. I remain in awe of Block's amazing output. &quot;Hit Man&quot; was truly original and challenging, Scudder and Bernie, the thief, are always great, so I won't begrudge this &quot;swing and a miss.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tanner on Ice (Signed)","review":"Block has revived a 60's series hero, Evan Tanner, who has no need to sleep and has extra brain power, including fabulous language skills. The only trouble with the book which is a fun and quick read is it is so light it might float away in your hands. Improbabilities pile on impossibilities but you know lthis likeable a hero will pull through. Sixties? It's more like a fifties adventure."},{"Title":"Tanner on Ice (Signed)","review":"The return of Lawrence Block's Evan Tanner, sleepless free-lance adventurer and defender of lost causes, is a welcome sight for fans of Block's more light hearted novels. Block's first challenge is to transport his Korean war veteran into the 90's after a hiatus of some twenty-five years. Rather than ignore the passage of time, Block maintains series continuity by an amusing contrivance. Not to spoil the fun, suffice it to say that the title suggests the reason for Tanner's absence all these years. Re-ensconced in his Manhattan apartment with his now fully grown ward, Minna, it isn't long before Tanner sets out on a new globe trotting adventure, this time to destabilize the illegitimate SLORC regime in Burma. Of course, nothing goes even remotely as planned, and as soon as Tanner sets foot in Rangoon he finds himself immersed in a cacaphony of intrigues. Along the way, he is chased, framed for murder and drug smuggling, arrested, allowed (?) to escape and abetted by an alcoholic young woman as they make their way on foot across the Burmese interior disguised as Buddist monks. Though a fan of Block's work for many years, I think his better known Matt Scudder series lost most of its quirky edge as its lead character sobered up and settled down over the years. (In fairness, a new, supposedly &quot;dark&quot; Scudder novel is due to be released this autumn. We'll see.) But all of Block's ligher works, both the Tanner books and the popular Bernie Rhodenbarr (Burglar) mysteries, continue to hit the mark. Like the previous Tanner novels (soon to be republished), Tanner On Ice is a romp. It requires a robust suspension of disbelief, but readers who enjoy the caper sub-genre will be well rewarded."},{"Title":"Tanner on Ice (Signed)","review":"Richard Nixon was president of the United States when Evan Tanner, the man who never sleeps, was placed into a comatose state in a Union City, New Jersey freezer due to an intricate double cross.

Not only is Tanner a man who can't sleep, but now he's been out like a light for 25 years and has missed a quarter century of social upheaval.In one of his books on writing, Block talks a bit about the then-dormant Tanner series and why it had become dormant. One reason he cited was that many of the protagonist's lunatic-fringe interests weren't fringe any more, or at least had struggled a bit closer to center stage. He's right, I think. Many of the simmering ethnic conflicts, conspiracies and such that were grist for Tanner's mill in the old days are headline material now. (Not all, though. The funniest moment in this book comes when Tanner matter-of-factly explains to his part-Russian lady friend that she might, just might, be a beneficiary in a movement to restore the Russian monarchy.)The problem, is, the Tanner books were never as tightly plotted as some of Block's other books -- they were romps, and their very romptitude carried them along. Now that events have diminished the central conceit, this book's weaknesses are highlighted -- much of the action takes place off-stage, several key events are chalked up to &quot;I guess we'll never know,&quot; and too many scenes are summarized, rather than shown.That said, I enjoyed the book. It's full of witty asides and characterization bits. and I think I would enjoy future outings, if Block can come up with some way to make the series motor work again, like he did with the Chip Harrison books. Tanner is a fun character and he could probably get a lot of mileage out of the current X-Files/conspiracy freak atmosphere, for example."},{"Title":"Tanner on Ice (Signed)","review":"The older Tanner books were a blast to read.

A kind of James Bond, boy who never grows up feel to them.Towards the end, they started to drag -- Tanner was considering marriage, had an adopted daughter and sons somewhere in Yugoslavia. His playboy lifestyle was getting very dated, and he wasn't aging gracefully at all. It's hard to transition a character from all-fun-and-games to something more serious. With Tanner, it never jelled.With Me Tanner, You Jane, Tanner got bizarre and creepy. His affair with a 14-year-old-girl was just creepy. Not to mention illegal and, again, very creepy. Yecch creepy.With Tanner on Ice, the author seems to step back from the abyss of the previous book -- but he doesn't go back to the hijinks of the first books, either. The trip to Burma is pointless -- as was the escape from Burma that followed. The plot makes no sense and various details are never explained -- like who was the dead guy in his bed.

For me, the most interesting part was Tanner catching up with all the changes in the world over the 25 years he'd been frozen.

He's been kidnapped and frozen. He's still in the prime of life, but virtually everyone he knows is now old - or dead. Except Minna, his ward, who is now old enough to be the love of his life - but he can't bring himself to think of her that way. Tanner still has his rent-controlled New York City apartment, thanks to her ingenuity - and the city thinks he's lived there the whole time.So Evan has to play catch up and figure out what to do with his new feelings. And what better way to do that than a new assignment from his super-secret intelligence agency - an assignment to Burma (as he remembers it) or Myanmar as the military junta insists that it be called. So Evan covertly enters the country, comes under the scrutiny of the local police who find a corpse in his room, meets a beautiful woman in distress, is hounded by the secret police, and makes his way across Burma on foot, disguised as a begging Buddhist priest, to meet up with the resistance.Block's attention to local detail will provide insight into the country and culture as it exists today as you marvel at Tanner's facility with languages and his easy adaptability in the face of adversity.Armchair Interviews says: This is an easy and a light read."},{"Title":"Tanner on Ice (Signed)","review":"The major disappointment of this book is not the implausibility of 25 years of Tanner frozen, but having lost 25 years of Tanner stories.

He comes round in a hospital bed looking and feeling the same as he did when he was frozen by a foreign agent. So at sixty-three he has to catch up on a lot of history including the impeachment of Richard Nixon and the presidential terms of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush senior, and Clinton. Evan spends some time catching up on the missed years, fortunately his adopted daughter Minna has kept his apartment and the only difference in it are due to new technology such as Video and DVD players, and a personal computer.

While I was very impressed with The Thief Who Couldn't Sleep - one of Block's best i think, i feel that this sequel of sorts is lacking a little as far as atmosphere goes, but then again its not the same story, its very different.Even Tanner is a fairly deep character (not quite as much as Block's other protagonists such as Keller or Rodenbarr). Also there's that sense of humor that Block can always pull off with a dry wit - makes me chuckle to myself everytime.While the general plotline is sorta ridiculous, Block pulls it off - and it takes a great writer to make a bad storyline sound good."},{"Title":"Tanner on Ice (Signed)","review":"OK, take Austin Powers (1997) plus Beyond Rangoon (1995) and you get Tanner on Ice (1998).

If you take away all the pointless dialogue and the self-indulgent musings, you're left with a trite plot and a bunch of self-parodying characters. There's plenty of really good Florida fiction out there without having to waste time on marginal, not-ready-for-prime-time writers.Mr. Allison would be well advised to keep the day job."},{"Title":"All the Little Birdies","review":"Now that Dan Allison has his first novel out of his system, it will be interesting to see what he comes up with next. I actually enjoyed many parts of this first work and am hoping Mr. Allison's next book won't be quite so pretentious. I would actually like to see more of Jake Murdock and his adventures. Albeit, a little more planning in the area of overall plot would be in order. A good idea...just needs refining!"},{"Title":"All the Little Birdies","review":"As a fan of \\"Florida Noir\\" or \\"Florida Mystery\\" or whatver they call it now, I stumbled uopon this author. I read both his books \\"All the Little Birdies\\" and \\"On the Whispering Wind\\".I think these are essentially self published titles, but they were very good. I can see the Hiaasen and maybe Dorsey influence, but it isn't blatant. However, if you like them, you should like these.....I enjoyed the books and would purchase other titles from this author in the future."},{"Title":"All the Little Birdies","review":"A deep passion for Florida's intrinsic beauty and rich history lies at the heart of &quot;ALL THE LITTLE BIRDIES&quot;, Dan Allison's first novel (or someone please tell me where to find others by him!) Cabby Jake Murdock teams up with a wealthy yuppie to recover the yupster's frozen sperm-the Family Jewels-from twisted extortionists. Admittedly, the author doesn't break much new ground - characters like Robin, Charlene, Mac, and Bulldog fill every novel about Florida (cuz it's who LIVES here!)- but at least the narrator here has some surprises. He doesn't live on a houseboat and he doesn't get a girl. (If you have read ANY Florida fiction, you KNOW how cliche THAT is!)Frankly, we can't get enough writers telling the truth about Florida and the corruption that's killing it. I love the pace and the way this Allison guy weaves Florida folklore and culture into his story. This book is about MY stomping grounds! As a cabby, I appreciate how Dan Allison writes great scenes that paint a picture (like the NASCAR race or the strip club in Tampa) and I feel like I'm THERE (and HAVE BEEN)! Some of Allison's lines had me rolling on the floor laughing! My only complaint is that the book is not long enough. With only 2 or 3 plot twists, I kept thinking there was going to be a boat chase (a la Miami Vice), but there wasn't. I actually read the book and I love it...can't WAIT for the sequel!"},{"Title":"All the Little Birdies","review":"Actually BIRDIES is pretty darned good. Some of the plot and scenes may be cliche -- every required element of the Florida crime comedy is here -- and some of the passages are fresh and pretty clever. The book certainly isn't drivel, as the next reviewer claims, and it's certainly not at the level of Hall or Hiaasen. Allison handles transitions well, and even handles several different narrative voices. But BIRDIES is a good read, well-plotted, and I expect Mr. Allison is capable of even greater work in the future. If you live in Florida, read this one until Hall and Hiaasen get their new volumes out."},{"Title":"Getting through the Tough Stuff","review":"Charles R. Swindoll has been through a lot of tough stuff. As a pastor, college chancellor, radio host and author, he has experienced firsthand many of the troubles that life has to offer. From \\"Anxiety\\" to \\"Temptation\\" and from \\"Confrontation\\" to \\"Shame,\\" the fourteen topics he covers provide a model for the reader to use when life blindsides him. Thus it is with the authority that comes from experience that Dr. Swindoll generously offers to help those who are struggling with their own particular pile of tough stuff.GETTING THROUGH THE TOUGH STUFF explores two basic premises that are built on an underlying theme. First, if you are alive on this planet, you will have problems. The second premise is that God has provided us with the original self-help manual, the Bible. The underlying theme is the adequacy of God's love and grace to see us through even the toughest of stuff.Dr. Swindoll has the gift of knowledge when it comes to the Bible, and he deftly identifies the roots of our \\"troubles\\" as well as the solutions to them by referencing biblical stories and passages. In each short, focused chapter, even seasoned believers will wonder anew at the omniscience of God. He knew just what kind of problems we would face, how we would try to solve them according to the wisdom of the world, and how sadly we would fail. Then, as Dr. Swindoll demonstrates, God in His loving and benevolent way provided us with the wisdom of the ages if only we would use it --- not only when things get tough but even before they get tough.Often, when people have problems, they feel guilty and shamed or angry and resentful. But the problems themselves have been around since the beginning of time. And, more importantly, Jesus Himself experienced them. So when the Word of God offers answers, it can be trusted because the Word Himself did what His Father told Him to do...and it worked. We cannot be exactly like Jesus because, though He was tempted, He never sinned; often our problems are compounded because we do sin. Yet, through God's grace, the same solutions are available to us, and if we truly repent, we won't have to go through the same tough stuff again.GETTING THROUGH THE TOUGH STUFF is not a simple \\"take two verses and call me in the morning\\" book of platitudes. It provides biblical answers to contemporary problems in a loving and gentle way.

He writes in a conversational, warm style but uses a lot of biblical references and anecdotes from his personal life that resonate with me. He seems to be speaking my language and telling my life story with each book!By way of contraste, some contemporary Christian authors (such as Rob Bell, author of Velvet Elvis) gloss over the Bible (or outright undermine it) and offer nothing but more questions, doubts and concerns. (See my review of Velvet Elvis for more on that kind of Christian author's efforts to speak to a \\"new generation.\\")By way of contrast, Charles Swindoll attempts to answer questions and heal wounds. He's not divisive or offensive in his efforts, either. He seems to be a wise, compassionate man who truly cares about those in his church -- as well as those reading his books around the world.I've been through a few tough times in my life, and I usually gain strength by reading books like this one from Charles Swindoll.Thank you, Pastor Swindoll for doing so much to touch the lives of those around you."},{"Title":"Getting through the Tough Stuff","review":"There are times when I just feel so sorry for myself, for what I've suffered and the pathetic mess I find myself in, some related to an actual tragedy and other \\"disasters\\" of my own making, or even imagined hurts. Getting Through The Tough Stuff helps put it back in perspective again. It's like a pat on the back and a hug. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Getting through the Tough Stuff","review":"To be honest, I'm surprised that there aren't more Amazon reviews of this book. Swindoll is known by many thousands and his name is constantly being repeated on radio each day. Maybe he will glean more reviews of this in time. Meanwhile, I'd like to speak in favor of the book. Chuck Swindoll is definitely not seated in some ivory tower looking down upon us ordinary Christians. He faces the \\"tough stuff\\" head on and even confesses some struggles he went through in years past. He also is neither soft on sin nor a raving condemner of vast multitudes. He makes the Bible his authority and argues with that as his master reference point. He admits the reality of evil, even among Christians, but does not condone or make excuses for it. He isn't afraid to tackle even the toughest issues debated among either believers or non-believers. He isn't a people pleaser, yet, in my opinion, he has one of the more balanced biblical approaches to tough issues that I know of. Some may think that Swindoll has writers who churn out reams of material with merely his tacit blessing. All writers have editors, but each book he writes is really from his mind and his pen. You will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Getting through the Tough Stuff","review":"LOVE this book.

Dr. Swindoll offers a compassionate gracefull illustration of Christ that depicts Him not only as savior and redemeer but of a loving God that came to earth and endured every pain imaginable so we could understand Him on a human level. Every pain we have experienced, He experienced also. This is a simple book for complex lives. Good for not yet, new and seasoned Christians alike."},{"Title":"Getting through the Tough Stuff","review":"No one has impacted me more in the early years of my ministry like Chuck Swindoll.

The story line flowed with the last story (Asterix and Son). The story never did explain why Cacofonix's voice brought rain every time he singed, but really did not matter. The whole Asterix series just seems to get better every book."},{"Title":"Asterix and the Magic Carpet (Classic Asterix hardbacks)","review":"In this enthralling tale the lovable Gaulish duo hitch a ride on a magic carpet with the village bard, Cacofonix to the mystical land of India. And yet in this far away country, the natives have heard of the &quot;village of madmen where a voice makes it rain&quot; - a man that the Indians could use to end the long spell of drought that they have fallen under. Finally! An audience that appreciates the (incredibly annoying) vocal talents of Cacofnix! But as luck may have it, the great bard loses his voice...With the life of a princess at stake, a race against the clock to get the bard's voice back and dodging evil fakirs at every corner, this is an adventure to remember - an episode in which the oft-neglected bard comes in to his own.Although the book was well laid out with a funny, interesting plot, some of the laughter comes at the expense of an ethnic stereotype. As long as it is understood beforehand that life in India doesn't follow such a pattern, this book would be a whole bunch of constructive fun. For that reason alone I felt the need to drop a star from my rating.Most Asterix titles are aimed at a teen/adult audience and they cleverly integrate many historical events in to their plots. There is also a deeper satirical presence throughout these books, and for that reason I feel that children under the age of 12 or so would not quite appreciate the humor. The violence is more along the lines of black eyes, dented armor and missing teeth, and hence should not worry a parent too much. This is another good Asterix comic - I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Letters via Chinook: Life in Montana in the 20's and 30's","review":"This book is ostensibly a collection of letters written by the author and his sister to the author's grandchildren. I am sure that is an accurate representation. The purpose was to record for the youngsters the life that the great grandparents and their offspring lived on a homestead in southeastern Montana. I was raised in the same county as the Ambuels; my sister was born the same year (1918) as Philip Ambuel. The descriptions of life on a homestead of that time and place are accurate in every detail and will not be found in many other sources. The format makes the telling very personal and enjoyable. It also makes the readability somewhat varied, but not objectionable.

Paperback Series)","review":"Vygotsky, who was a contemporary of Piaget, unfortunately never received nearly as much attention while still alive. Probably due to the fact that he was working in Russia and had a relatively short career his work seems to have taken a very long time to even get published for 'western' consumption. His theories also go against the grain of the dogma currently in vogue in psychology.This book gives a brief overview of Vygotsky's life and career. Then it launches into Vygotsky's original manuscript which begins with a critique of some of the central themes of that time; oddly enough those themes are still being pursued by psychologists today. Vygotsky's critique is very interesting and demonstrates a very broad range of understanding of psychological, physical and philosophical knowledge throughout the section.The second part of the book then advances Vygotsky's theories of thought and language development. And that is the crux of Vygotsky's theory: thought and language each develop in a manner that one might characterize as partially self-catalyzing in addition to behaving as one. Vygotsky also advanced some important ideas about child potential with his &quot;zone of proximal development&quot;.Vygotsky pointed out that development hinges on the social structure surrounding the child and is not similar to the idea of some computer operating system simply requiring some type of &quot;load&quot; instruction. That is, Vygotsky's work seems to dispel some of the hot air surrounding Chomsky's ideas about &quot;deep grammar&quot; structures existing and just waiting for the instructions to start working; instead thought and language develop, sometimes separately and sometimes requiring each other to act as catalysts.Given recent advances in primate language studies, complex adaptive systems and Wittgenstein's contributions to the philosophy of systems I believe Vygotsky's work becomes all the more important and relevant. We are only just starting to grasp the importance of thinking about development in a systems mode as opposed to the old way of reductionism (and the weird dogmatic offshoot of this: strict materialism).This is a must-read for anyone interested in learning about how we develop. Other interesting ideas and overviews can be found in Bogdan's &quot;Minding Minds&quot; and Faber's &quot;Objectivity and Human Perception&quot;. Then there is the burgeoning field of complexity where a good general overview can be found in &quot;Signs of Life&quot;. And for those who really want to get deeper, read some of the recent work done in EEG and meditation to help kids with ADD and other problems."},{"Title":"Thought and Language (The M. I. T. Paperback Series)","review":"A contemporary of Piaget (developmental psychology)and Watson (behaviorism), Vygotsky launches a cogent critique and synthesis of these two scientific schools. His asserting that learning leads development is as fresh and valuable today as it was when he first wrote the text. Secondly, his calling for a functional analysis of language has been pursued only by the behavioral schools; a short-fall of cognitive and developmental psychology which focuses on the structure of language and hypothetical constructs of brain functioning. Vygotsky relied on observable behavior under contrived and natural conditions in developing his model of socially mediated learning. Although he does a bit of theorizing, his view of learning speech and thought--a skill taught and mediated by social forces--is an excellent bridge between the two schools of thought mentioned above. This book should be required reading for developmental psychologists, educators and behaviorists alike."},{"Title":"Thought and Language (The M. I. T. Paperback Series)","review":"In the 1920s Vygotsky had already seen simmilarities between the Old Freud and the Young Piaget, and beguins this book with a rejection of primary narcissism that has, since Melany Klein, influenced many psychoanalyists.

In this volume, Starr and Bigman Jones travel to a moon of Jupiter to discover the cause of a series of accidents on a secret project to develop a space craft with an antigravity engine. They uncover a spy of Earth's enemy, Sirius. Jupiter IX is called Adrastea in the novel; however, now Adrastea is referred to as Jupiter XV (more (16) satellites are known now than were known in 1957). It is one of the closest moons to Jupiter's surface and could not be the moon referred to in the novel. In an introduction written in 1978, Asimov apologizes for some of the scientific inaccuracies in the story due to all of the new information that had been discovered since 1957. Besides the number of moons, Jupiter's magnetosphere would present severe difficulties to space travelers. The intense radiation field that surrounds Jupiter would be fatal to travelers unless some new method is available to counter the problem. It is also doubtful that the characters would have landed on Io due to its large degree of volcano activity (there are at least eight active volcanos). There is also evidence that Io forms a ring (or torus) around Jupiter consisting of ionized sulfur and oxygen. In 1989, it was discovered from infrared spectroscopy using Earth-based equipment that Io has hydrogen sulfide on its surface. The characters in the novel also land on Amalthea (Jupiter V). This moon, discovered in 1892, is small and has a low orbit. Also unknown in either 1957 and 1978 was the fact that Jupiter has a single faint ring encircling the planet, a ring not detected by Earth-based observatories."},{"Title":"From C to C: An Introduction to ANSI Standard C with Reference Manual","review":"The book teaches C and programming without insulting the reader's intelligence.

Dahood does work deeply into Semetic philology, and while this may bog down the non-academics, he offers an incredible wealth of wisdom from this perspective. Often I was simply struck by the depth of his variant translations and readings of individual Psalms. For me, this is a strong resource to use along side of many other quality texts as mentioned by Olaf01. Dahood's takes some great risks opening himself up for brilliance or criticism. Either way, it makes for exciting and insightful comparisons among the other seminal texts."},{"Title":"Psalms I, 1-50 (Anchor Bible Ser., Vol. 16)","review":"This three volume commentary on the book of Psalms is in many ways the culmination of a lifetime of study in Semitic philology by one of the 20th century's most gifted and original semitists. However, Dahood's originality often took a commanding role over and against his training as a philologist. The commentary is essentially philological, and is of rather limited interest to the non-scholar; there are several other Psalms commentaries that would prove far more usefull to the interested non-scholar (Hans-Joachin Kraus's three volumes on the Psalms [\\"Theology of the Psalms\\", \\"Psalms 1-50\\", and \\"Psalms 51-150\\" published by Fortress Press] come to mind as a thoroughly academic, yet far more useful and usable commentary). In addition to Dahood focusing on nitty-gritty details of Northwest Semitic linguistics, there is the lamentable fact that he all too often grossly overstates the case of comparative linguistic data, and simply offers wholely implausible readings of biblical texts. One cannot help but think of Dahood's unfortunate publication of a text from the ancient city of Ebla, in which he claimed that it was a direct parallel to a passage in the book of Proverbs; as it turns out, the text in question was a butcher's list of different cuts of meat.The material in this commentary is of interst to professional students of the Hebrew Bible, Hebrew language, and Semitic philology--all too often as a warning of what NOT to do. As a commentary of use to the layman, it should be avoided. The forthcoming commentary of Kselman should be a most welcome addition to Psalms scholarship."},{"Title":"Phaedra","review":"The notes in this edition were excellent for a quick comprehension of Seneca--both his general context and specific business with this tragic cycle. The notes were never sparing of historical and mythic context, though often when I found some difficulty with the text itself, whether syntax, vocabulary or grammar, they did little to assist me. I recommend you find an English Phaedra for the sore spots in your reading. The editors took no caution to hide their disfavor for the play. An example, 1267n: \\"This is arguable the worst line in Seneca drama.\\" There are many other moments like this one, include several notes that contrast the Phaedra as a weak counterpart to Euripides' Hippolytus. The play may, indeed, be terrible, but why not let the reader see that themselves?Overall, this edition presents a clear introduction, readable, compact notes and a careful, sightly presentation of the text. My quibbles are small, not substantial.APPENDIX: On Ahl's PhaedraI'm not sure why Amazon decided to loop together the reviews for Ahl's translation and Mayer/Coffey's commentary, but, by coincidence, I also made use of Ahl, so I'll offer a short review.I used Ahl as an aid to translation, which was a mistake. His translation is clearly (and masterfully) designed for performance, not scholarship. Ahl works wonders with English prose, but these wonders often fly away from the Latin itself. Ahl admits to this, and I don't insult him for doing so. I would love to see his Phaedra performed. That said, because he plays with line numbers and tends to elaborate and clarify by adding to the Latin, the translation is poorly assembled for assisting a Latin reading.APPENDIX SECUNDUS: On Mayer's Duckworth CommentaryOh hell, it looks like Amazon has decided that every book on the Phaedra is the same book. Here, I'll offer my impression on Mayer's Commentary on the Phaedra, published in the Duckworth series. Here, Mayer is a bit lighter in his criticism of the play itself (perhaps it was Coffey who carried all critical weight in the Latin text commentary), but still offers consistent and careful criticism of various later performances and translations. His words are careful, but frank. Of course, the commentary also attempts to offer context and present various uncertainties about Senecan tragedy (performance, Stoicism, political context, etc.). Overall, it's a nice--and brief--companion to the Cambridge Latin text and commentary."},{"Title":"Phaedra","review":"This is a review of Michael Coffey's and Roland Mayer's commentary on Seneca's Phaedra for the Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics series. I made use of this commentary to prepare for a PhD exam on Latin Literature. Overall, I found the commentary somewhat undependable whenever I had occasion to turn to the back to find help for thorny syntax and vocabulary. About half the time there would indeed be an entry that addressed my specific question, albeit too often formulated in indirect or allusive language, and for the other half I found myself left to figure out the grammatical riddles on my own. That being said, I do think it would have involved a far greater amount of time and effort to read this play just using a dictionary and the OCT.In other respects, however, this book is an exceptionally good aid for reading and understanding Senecan tragedy. The introduction is quite sophisticated and does a great deal of interpretive work in contextualizing the Phaedra in its historical moment and in the literary tradition that informs it. Many of the notes in the commentary proper are geared toward fulfilling this end as well. Ultimately, the Phaedra that emerges from C&M;'s analysis is a play whose poetics and phrasing are heavily indebted to earlier authors (chiefly, Ovid, Vergil, and Horace). C&M; are also keen to point out and analyze passages that illustrate how Seneca has gone about reworking earlier literary treatments of the myth of Phaedra and Hippolytus, particularly that of Euripides. The complete text of Phaedra's epistle in Ovid's Heroides is also included at the end of this volume, although C&M; do not provide any commentary for it. The reception of Seneca's Phaedra in later literature is also addressed in some detail.C&M; thus do an excellent and thorough job demonstrating the complexity and literary aspirations of Senecan Tragedy. Yet one gets the sense throughout that the commentators are less than convinced about Seneca's skill and competence as a playwright. Here is an illustrative note from page 155: \\"This scene precipitates the catastrophe. Yet despite its importance to the plot S.'s indifference to dramatic coherence is plain in a number of details. First, the Nurse's decision to incriminate Hippolytus, an unheard aside, is without express motive. A competent dramatist is concerned to account for the actions he sets in motion; that is part of his skill.\\" I would have preferred that C&M; had made the attempt to formulate an explanation for the anomalies and inconsistencies of the Phaedra alongside the insinuations that Seneca is just a bad poet, but, on the whole, these occasional digs do not take away too much from the reader's ability to appreciate Seneca's achievement on its own terms."},{"Title":"Sundowner","review":"This is the third book in the series started in First Contact.

Get it for your students, for your kids, or just to for yourself.My daughter was in a class that used the Rainbow Kids story as a tool, and now that she is an adult, she still talks about those lessons. I am a business school graduate who does a lot of negotiation in my work, and this children's story has been an invaluable tool to keep me focused and keep me out of the fray when things get tough!In this story, the author does something I would not have thought possible: use clear metaphors to teach you how to understand and handle strong emotions like anger. Defining emotions as clouds (anger) and rainbows (happiness) may sound silly and childish, but once you are inside the story and begin to understand, it becomes very powerful.For children, this translation into metaphor makes learning about emotions fun and easy. Once they have heard the story, kids can understand that when they are mean to someone else, it creates a \\"cloud\\" that sits over them both.I have to admit that as an adult, I learned lessons that I have kept with me since reading the story, and I have been able to keep from getting dragged into other people's fights ever since! I hope my experience helps you understand how powerful this book is (with apologies to the author for my paraphrasing her wonderful work):In the story, clouds are a metaphor for anger, so the kids in the story throw clouds at each other when they are in a fight. When a cloud hits you, you ball it up, make it bigger and darker, and throw it back. To join in a fight, you just grab a cloud (or stand there and someone will no doubt throw one at you) and then you throw it back.At one point, a new boy enters the scene when everyone is fighting and the clouds are flying fast and furious. Of course, someone says something mean to the new kid, throwing a big, dark cloud at him. As it is about to hit him, the kid simply steps aside, letting the cloud dissipate past him. Just by stepping aside, the cloud doesn't hit him, he doesn't make it bigger, and he doesn't throw it back.After the fight is over, one of the other kids asked the new kid how he kept from getting into the fray: \\"Why didn't you throw that cloud back?\\" The new kid answered \\"That was not my cloud.\\"\\"That was not my cloud.\\"I now remember that line every time I am about to enter someone else's fight, or any time someone tries to draw me out with an insult or a pointed question. In business (where this happens all the time), if you don't get drawn into a fight you can remain focused.I hope you will read and use this book for your children, your students, and for yourself! Once she took the class, my daughter started to say things like \\"Why did he throw that cloud at me?\\" She learned new tools for dealing with anger and conflict. Sitting in business meetings, I still smile and say to myself \\"That was not my cloud.\\""},{"Title":"Peake's Progress","review":"I had tried to get this book ever since I read the Gormenghast books a few years back, but was informed it was unavailable. Imagine my surprise when it shows up on Amazon as available. I bought it as part of a deal with Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor. Had a slight twinge of anxeity when Slaughterboard showed up by itself, but Progress showed up about a week and a half later. Talk about worth the wait. Short stories, plays, illustrations, poems, Peake's Progress is a great collection of major work and oddities that showcases this amazing talent. My personal highlights are the Titus Groan in all but name story \\"Boy in Darkness\\" and his full length play \\"The Wit to Woo\\".

His poetry is excellent, his short stories are great, and his art is just cool.If you are a Peake fan, you must buy this book."},{"Title":"Peake's Progress","review":"Most people who get to know the work of the English novelist, poet, and artist Mervyn Peake (1911-1968), if they get to know him at all, will do so through the three published \\"Gormenghast\\" books - the beginnings of what would have been a lengthy roman-fleuvre covering the life and exploits of Titus Groan. I believe the \\"Titus\\" books (a better name for them, as the third book doesn't touch on Gormenghast castle at all) are among the great imaginative novels of the last century, and they made me a Peake-devotee for life. This collection of miscellaneous writings and art, compiled by his widow Maeve Gilmore a decade after his death, is a great place to continue (or start) an exploration of this amazing multitalented artist's life and work.Peake the poet is well-represented here - his lengthy \\"Rhyme of the Flying Bomb\\", various \\"Nonsense\\" poems and a large number of shorter works are present; Peake the prose stylist is on evidence, in a selection of short stories and also, fascinatingly, in early renditions of his children's story \\"Captain Slaughterboard\\" and an early prose-sketch of Titus and Gormenghast, \\"The House of Darkstones.\\" The previously-published \\"Boy in Darkness\\" is also here, but most of the contents in this lengthy volume (576 pages in the Overlook 1st US edition I have) are previously unpublished. The real revelations are in the author's fascinating full-length plays, \\"The Wit to Woo\\" and \\"Noah's Ark\\" - the fascination with grotesquerie and the fantasy-lives of children are fully in evidence in both of these works, the first ostensibly an \\"adult\\" play and the second clearly aimed at children. Both were unpublished before this volume was put out, and remain unavailable anywhere else, as is the case with the majority of work herein.There are also plenty of reproductions of Peake's drawings: pencil sketches, pen-and-ink, charcoal washes, block prints and woodcuts, etc. It would have been nice to have had some color plates, though the artist wasn't as far as I can tell all that prolific as a painter; one can't have everything though. Lovingly produced, nicely printed (in the edition I have, at any rate), next to the \\"Titus\\" books, I'd recommend this to anyone planning a sojourn through the gothic weirdness of Mervyn Peake."},{"Title":"Peake's Progress","review":"Excellent stuff.

For me this is altogether much more satisfying than, say, Tolkien. Here you can find Peake's short stories, plays, drawings -- everything that made him the creative genius he was.

How does one teach how to construct a portfolio, the end result of most freshman comp classes, at a level that will help those who need to firm up their basic skills without alienating students with a firm foundation? When faced with this challenge, Dr. Gina Claywell took matters into her own hands and wrote her own guide for students entitled, &quot;The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios.&quot; This guide clearly and concisely lays out the groundrules for making a portfolio without talking down or talking over students. However, even though the content of this book is very helpful, the layout of the appendices could use some work. Students under much pressure and with little time view the task of constructing a portfolio as an overwhelming monster. However, this book which takes only an hour or two at most to read, helps students banish that monster by explaining step by step in logical manner exactly what is expected. This gives students time to plan each part of the busy portfolio process around their crowded schedules. Directions are straightforward and easy to understand so that no time is wasted looking up words in the dictionary. The tone is enthusiastic without being overly bubbly. Finally, the first chapter actually explains the whole point of the process so that students don't feel like they are wasting their time. The only confusing part of this book is the layout of the appendices. The page is split with Claywell's comments at the top and student papers at the bottom. That's fine when Claywell's remarks fit in the space above the students paper, but it's confusing when they continue to the next page and the reader has to flip back and forth. One example of this can be found on pages 87-89. In conclusion, this book is highly valuable to students who need to construct portfolios. Without it they would be wandering around in the dark."},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios","review":"Claywell walks her readers through the entire process of portfolio writing in an easy to follow plan. First, she provides tips on getting started, and how to avoid procrastination. Next, she takes the student reader through the selection process, the revision, and finally the completed portfolio. By going through the process in this complete manner, the reader, by following the guidelines, will most certainly be able to produce a quality portfolio for his or her class."},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios","review":"The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios is an excellent short reference book for anyone writing portfolios. It covers everything that everyone from high school to college to more advanced businesses needs to know to create a distinguishable portfolio. Especially likeable is the fact that it is very condensed. Many people needing to write a portfolio do not have adequate time to sit and read a several-hundred page book to learn everything ever written about a good portfolio. The language is simple and precise, and the book is divided into easily indexed sections. Another priceless feature is that the book includes examples. These examples show the reader exactly what it is trying to get across. It shows good examples as well as bad ones to let the reader contrast the two different styles. All in all, this book is a valuable tool to anyone needing to write a portfolio. I can truly say that if a person follows it exactly, their portfolio will be a very enjoyable one."},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios","review":"Just as wildlife guidebooks provide information for a wildlife biologist, this guidebook provides plenty of guidelines and useful information for English students, as well as anyone that has to compose a portfolio. For those students new to the portfolio concept, this book offers the instruction needed to follow when writing a successful portfolio. The book successfully supplies data not only in a bulleted 'list of tips' form, but in a readable manner. Many positive aspects can be found throughout the seven chapters plus the appendices. Credibility is established within the text. The paragraph style of the book helps students grasp concepts to be able to apply them in their own work. Questions are given for students to answer while in the process of generating their final portfolio. Charts make the appearance of the book appear even more appealing. These qualities all make the book worthwhile and interesting to use as a guide."},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios","review":"Review: The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing PortfoliosThis text was extremely beneficial and informative on a subject I knew very little about before entering this class. Of course I had composed portfolios before; however, they were extremely informal and much less thorough. I cannot say that composing this portfolio was easy, but it was made easier by using this text as a reference. Whether or not you've never written a portfolio or if you've written 1,000, this book can be beneficial to all levels of &quot;portfolios writers.&quot; The examples of portfolio excerpts were very helpful in creating benchmarks for my own portfolio. Before reading this text I had no idea there was a process that one must follow step by step in creating a portfolio. This helped my final portfolio be more organized and comprehensive. The aspect I enjoyed most about this book was that it included several different types of portfolios (and guidelines for those) that I way have to write in the future. I therefore can use this book in composing those portfolios. There were no weaknesses that I could see (with the exception of a couple of spelling errors). I found this text very helpful and beneficial in creating my portfolio for the class. I would recommend this text to anyone writing a portfolio because this will undoubtedly improve the quality of it.Excerpt from Preface:&quot;The premise operating herein is that the advice in this text may seem apparent to instructors but rarely so to students. I frequently hear the admonitions form this book spoken at conferences, in teaching methods courses, and among my peers in the hallways: 'If only my students would choose better pieces to put in their portfolio' or 'I can read the revision statement and tell a whole lot about the portfolio.' Somehow, though, we never think to tell students in any methodical way all the tips that can help them fashion a portfolio that they can be proud to submit and that we are pleased to read. So, this text offers students just such no-longer-confidential advice.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios","review":"The book, The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing Portoflolio by Dr. Gina Claywell, was an excellent text in building portfolios.

Reflective statements are difficult for students to master; however, after reading this book, I can now write a superb statement in any portfolio that I do.

It had all the necessary content to piece together a distinguished portfolio. It had examples of good and bad pieces from Portfolio's. The problem is not with the book, rather, with the subject: unless they're creative or visual art, portfolio's are boring. It said everything that it needed to say, though, and it said it concisely, which is nice. A lot of portfolio books tend to get full of themselves and ramble on about nothing. This one didn't do that. The chapters were easy to access, and the book was well organized. I had no problem finding anything I needed. I also liked the fact that it gave examples. Every time I was stuck, I would flip to one of the corresponding examples in the book and figure it out with no problem.

I think that it was well organized and had good sources. There were many things that were helpful in this book. I thought that the questions that began each chapter were helpful because they started the chapter out and helped me know exactly what was in the chapter. I found the reflection statement chapter most helpful since I didn't know how to do that aspect of the portfolio. The appendixes at the end of the book were also helpful. Being a visual learner, it was easier for me to see a good example and a bad example, instead of rambling on about how to do it.

The book provides insight into what an instructor may expect from students regarding portfolios, and will undoubtedly result in an improved portfolio grade for the reader."},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios","review":"Review of The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing PortfoliosOverall, The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios is a helpful text, giving students tips and instruction about the proper way to put together a portfolio, revise and &quot;reenvision&quot; (23) your individual papers, reflecting on your writing, and other such topics relating to the many aspects of portfolios. Many students may have had trouble with portfolios in the past, but anyone who reads this book and follows its advice should have no trouble in presenting professional and well-written portfolios. Obviously time and effort have been put into making this guide the best it could be. One of the major strengths of the book lies in the last forty pages, in which the author, Dr. Claywell, gives many examples of student writing. This is very helpful to students, as it is much easier to relate to a piece of writing, seeing the good and bad points, than it is to read a list of do's and don't's and apply that to a sample of writing. Other strengths include the organization of the book itself as it progresses from the first chapter, &quot;Determine What is Expected of You&quot;, to &quot;Develop Good Writing Habits Now&quot;, and continues to follow a logical progression, discussing revision, selection of material, reflection, preparation, and &quot;Follow Up&quot;. All these chapters have their own well-organized sub headings, which is very helpful when skimming for a specific topic. Word choice and language is both professional and sophisticated, yet reaches down to the students' level of writing. The interactive questions at the end of each chapter help students to apply the content of the chapter to their own writing. All of these elements make The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios a very good choice for professors at the collegiate level, as well as teachers at the high school level. Something that could easily be improved upon is the presentation of the book; while the writing itself is good, it is hard not to feel slightly overwhelmed by too much text on each small page. Perhaps if the font was slightly larger, or if the book were spaced out a little more, it would help students to take more interest in the book itself. It is so easy for many students to become bogged down in the amount of homework they must do in college, so it is important for a text to draw attention to itself. Each class is competing for students' time, and this should be reflected in the layout of each text. Yet Dr. Claywell's book does not seem to focus on this aspect at all, and has a good chance of being put aside in favor of more interesting or necessary homework or classes. Another aspect of the book that should be examined is the occurrence of typographical mistakes. While there are not many, the few that are present should be fixed. For instance, on page 21 the answers to the first question should be reversed. As it is the answer for yes actually means no, and vise versa. This is a small mistake, yet one that can be very confusing to the reader. Overall, the book is a sound and confident guide, helpful to students as well as professors. Yet it may be overlooked and put aside because of the lack of interesting test and outlook. Advice to Dr Claywell: keep the writing, fix the typos, and add some pictures or something interesting to the audience."},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing Portfolios","review":"Written by Professor Gina Claywell, this book has been extremely helpful in compling a class portfolio for my English 104. This book has many strengths. The progression, from knowing what is expected to finishing the final product, leads the student through in a logical, user-friendly way. The step-by-step process brakes the otherwise overwhelming task of compiling a portfolio into manageable sized chunks. Perhaps the most helpful aspect of this book was its myriad examples. Both good and bad examples reinforce the concepts by showing what to and what not to do. Each chapter ends with questions, which serve as a review of the main points of the material. The charts included were also very helpful in review. The section on writing a reflection statement was invaluable! It guided one through the thought process of reflection adding tips along the way. This book has few weaknesses. These include minor typographical errors, which will undoubtedly be corrected in the next edition.

The comments on the films are extensive and instructive; unless you have seen at least \\"The Decalogue\\" and \\"La double vie de V&eacute;ronique\\", you'd certainly do best to read the filmography before reading the essays, but even if you have seen those, you'd probably still do best to have read the filmography first. Sadly, the essays, while interesting, aren't absolutely stunning, and after reading through the filmography, they seem in parts a bit redundant--unsurprisingly, the same concerns that occupy the author in the essays occupy him in the filmography, as well--and entirely too short. However, if what you're looking for is information about a film of Kieslowski's, this book will serve you very well."},{"Title":"To Be a Trial Lawyer","review":"A must read for every law student who is interested in trial law, or is unsure of his or her abilities to be a succesful trial lawyer.

I prefer the older editions, despite the numerous &quot;racial slurs,&quot; because they are the product that the author intended to present. I have heard from various sources that the later editions have been revised, removing the colloquiallisms and unifying Lloyd's speech patterns and mannerisms with those of the other characters. I call this a shame. Obviously, no harm was meant by the author when she portrayed the African-American servants as she did, and reading Lloyd say, &quot;...honah,&quot; rather than &quot;honor&quot; paints a lot more colorful picture of her character. In rating this series, I must declare it a &quot;must read&quot; for both boys and girls. The morals and lessons are invaluable, and would be a refreshing balm for the wounds today's youth are suffering from, even at the youngest age. I do believe if I had read the tale of &quot;The Three Weavers,&quot; as told in &quot;The Little Colonel At Boarding School,&quot; MY life would have been touched, sparing me much grief in later years.

A classic Shirley Temple movie of the late 1930's (I think) was based on the first book, but I enjoyed the later ones even more. I am delighted to see them reissued after all these years. Lloyd Sherman and the other characters introduced in the later books (The Little Colonel's House Party and succeeding titles) were almost as real to me, when I was 8 to 12 years old, as my own friends. My favorite character was not Lloyd herself, who seemed overprivileged and a little too perfect, but Elizabeth Lloyd Lewis (Betty), the daughter of one of Lloyd's mother's girlhood friends.

Her grandfather, a widower named Colonel Lloyd, who lives on a grand old estate named \\"Locust\\" near Lloydsborough in Lloyd (Pewee) Valley outside of Louisville, KY, had fought for the South in the Civil War, losing an arm, as did his son Tom who was killed in his first battle. The Colonel's daughter, Elizabeth, married Jack Sherman, and because he was a dreaded Yankee, Colonel Lloyd cut the Shermans off. However, Jack suffered some financial reverses and went West to see if he could recoup his fortune, so Elizabeth, their daughter, and Elizabeth's elderly African-American nurse Becky Porter (Mom Beck) return from their home in New York to live in a cottage just outside of \\"Locust\\" that had been left to her by her mother.The child's nickname comes from the fact that by the age of five her mannerisms seemed to echo the military traits of her grandfather. In spite of the animosity between the Colonel and his daughter, he falls in love with his granddaughter. Then Jack Sherman returns from the West and is very sick with typhoid fever. Will he survive? And can \\"The Little Colonel\\" do anything to bring peace between her parents and her grandfather? My first acquaintance with author Annie F. Johnston's name was through her book Joel, a Boy of Galilee, republished by Lamplighter Press. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. Set in the 1890s, The Little Colonel is probably her best known book. It is the first of a series of semi-biographical children's novels based on the real life of a young girl named Hattie Cochran, and dealing with the aristocracy of old Kentucky. The series includes novels about Mary Ware, The Little Colonel's Chum, and other books of Johnston's that were later rewritten to include The Little Colonel.The books are perhaps best known through the 1935 Twentieth Century Fox film starring Shirley Temple in the title role of The Little Colonel. Other than a couple of colloquialisms such as \\"Lordy\\" and \\"for the Lawd's sake,\\" there is nothing objectionable. Some newer editions have been revised to remove what are sometimes perceived as \\"racial slurs\\" and to modernize Lloyd's speech patterns (e.g., \\"honah,\\" changed to \\"honor\\"), but as usual I prefer the originals. I would agree with others that the morals and lessons in this book are invaluable."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE COLONEL.","review":"I bought the Little Colonel to remind me of the series I remember checking out of the public library as a child.

Only natural doubts, cause their friendship/relationship to falter...and interference from secondary characters. These characters, Carol's ex, and a brother, Lee's daughter, and fellow cops, as well as some &quot;bad guys&quot; help to add to the suspense of this page-turning read.This is one special read--sexy, as well as romantic and suspenseful..."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Carol a black women is shot accidentally by Lee a white police officer when she is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even though the case is under investigation Carol and Lee fall in love as he tries to protect her from a killer and deal with the department about him and her and the case. This story could have been so much more if only Sandra had focused more on Carol and Lee and not so much on other forces. I still loved the story because the storyline is my favorite type of story, but next time Sandra lets read abit more about the interaction of the couple and not so much about ex's and other things going on."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I just bought this book used. It was hard to come by but when I got it, I was quite excited to begin reading. It did not disappoint. I love the book and it's two main characters Carol Taggart and Lee Grafton. I read it in two days and I'm reading it again. Carol and Lee are two characters who were throw together after a police shooting. Lee one of the officers involved in the shooting could not seem to stay away from the victim, he was so drawn to her that he just had to see her. I could feel that they were going to fall in love with each other, he seems to be always there when she needs him or most often when he needs her.If you ever get a chance to read this book, you will not be disappointed, it's a really good read.Sandra Kitt is an excellent and she did a wonderful job with book and the characters involved in this story."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I'm an avid reader of Interracial romance novels, and I have to say that no one does it better than Sandra Kitt. The woman is a genius. Carol and Lee are some of her most memorable characters to date. This story has substance and of course romance. It's well written and the characters are well developed. I highly recommend this book. If I could give it 10 stars I would.Also read these others by Sandra Kitt:The Color of Love- Interracial romance classicBetween Friends- soon to be an Interracial romance classicShe's the One- not interracial but a classic nonetheless"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"This really was a classic feeling love story. The cop drama and all was awesome. I work in that field so I can absolutely relate to the stresses and the constant looking over your shoulder etc. Was very accurate portrayal. Would have liked a little racier intimate scenes but it was a great book all the same."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I read this book several years ago and I recently read it again. It didn't take me long to remember why I liked it so much. This book had me so caught up that I found it extremely hard to put down. Definitely a great read."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Even after reading this, I had no idea that there was a market for IR Novels. I thought this was as good as it got. I have had this book for years, actually when it first came out and I have read it several times. Now since finding out the market for IR, I have whipped it out again to compare. I did like this book alot. It was a great storyline. The characters were great. The relationship between Carol and Lee blooms from a traumatic experience. Race comes into play, only because of Carol and the tragedy she goes through. I haven't read another similiar type IR romance like this and I have read several IR's since this first purchase. I highly recommend her books."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I've read two of Sandra Kitt's books back-to-back: the first being, The Color of Love and I just finished this one, Close Encounters! What can I say?! Sandra Kitt leaves me breathless and wanting more everytime! She, once again, tackles an interracial relationship with ease and finesse! She makes the reader WANT these two characters that come from two different backgrounds to come together. Does she do so? Well, I'll leave that up to whoever chooses to read this book, but one thing's for sure, be prepared to NOT want to put this book down! I definitely want to become a writer exactly like Sandra Kitt! She pushes me to make my writing so much better!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I enjoyed the story of Carol Taggert and Lee Grafton, I would have liked her to be a little more comfortable with her family at her age, and he a little more satute. But overall it was a good read."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Sandra Kitt is the Shakespeare of contemporary romance writing. She brought together an emotional plot of police office and victim and surrounds you into an ethereal setting of enchantment. We put aside our hurts and had to encompass the effective of character's passions. We cried, weep, hated oh, yes this time around we actually was allowed to hate. But through it all Ms. Kitt ended with the Classy Shakespearean ending - HOPE!!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Sandra Kitt's Close Encounters. I have read two other books by Sandra Kitt (The Color of Love being my absolute favorite) and I liked the way that Kitt captivates the reader and keeps your attention. It was hard for me to put the book down once I started reading it. The romance makes you truly believe in love, regardless of circumstance. I would highly recommend this book! This story has everything, romance, action, and just the right amount of suspense to keep you glued to the book!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I just have to say that Sandra Kitt's Close Encounters was very good. I found myself so drawn into the world of Carol and Lee. This story was so wonderfully written. Sandra is definately a great writer of romance, true and bold! I had the experience to meet Sandra when she visted Arizona and I truly thank her for taking the time to sit with me and sign my books. She asked me what I liked and didn't like about the books and gave me the opportunity to ask her questions. Close Encounters is a wonderful book and I encourage all to read it. I have also read Between Friends, WONDERFUL!!!! I loved it!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"The main reason I enjoyed this story was because of Carol coming to terms with how she was raised and her family. Her near death experience made her finally realize that in this world you have to take love from wherever it comes from. I think her confusion as a child was to be expected, but to turn your back on your family just because you are not like them is wrong. Family is family, especially when there is genuine love.I liked Lee a lot and thought that he was an honorable man, but I thought they hooked up way too quickly in the relationship. Also, the secondary story with Lee's partner, Barbara, did nothing for me. I found that whole thing confusing.I liked Lee's inner thoughts about his daughter and trying to reach out for her before it was too late. I felt like he was taking steps to be a better Dad, listening to her and trying to help her see her Mom's POV of things. And his confusion and honesty with himself about the shooting, and what being a cop meant to him, was good. It gave me a better idea about what he was going through.Overall, pretty good. Sandra excels in the actual writing of the relationship, it's just some of the other details that are a little lacking."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I have read Sandra Kitt's &quot;The Color of Love&quot; and like that book - I couldn't put this down! I loved it! It was enjoyable - most of all real - and I loved that both characters throughout the story gained and lost by their association with, and love for, one another and no one lost more than the other which is sometimes the case in interracial romance. Go Sandra, go Sandra!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Sandra Kitt was my introduction to contemporary African-American romance fiction with her classic &quot;Adam and Eva.&quot; I have read (or tried to read) all her subsequent books, many of which, for reasons unknown, have started with the letter 'S'. Some I liked, some I didn't, some I had to struggle through and others I just couldn't get into at all. This is, in my opinion, the best of her mainstream books. It moved a bit slow, but was always interesting, and I never lost the desire to find out what happened next. I did find myself wondering if Carol or Lee had any friends; none were mentioned. But it was very enjoyable story, both sweet and grounded in stark reality, and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"first of all, i have to say i have read all of sandra kitts book and all of them was very remarkable and interesting and not only that but informative stories. i like the way she does her research on any topic she writes and how i enjoy her books. anyway close encounters was distinguis novel that covered an accidental shooting of an innocent victim and how the police and others were handling the case...it has interesting characters who leaves you guessing and wondering what will they do next..carol was an unbiased person, that even though her ex husband and brother was pressuring her to sue the city, she did a lot of soul searching for forgiveness and even though she hasnt forgotten the incident but she did forgive and fell in love...now that speaks a lot about a person's heart *S* lee has changed too and you'll love him for being a caring policemen because we sure dont emphasize enough on the ones who are dedicated to their job *S* its a very interesting story, go pick it up at a book store or library..i guranteed you will not be bored. *S*"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"This was a great book about a complicated relationship between a man and a woman. Several things make it complicated. One is the fact that the man is a police officer in NY and the woman is someone who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Another thing that makes this relationship complicated is that the police officer is white and the woman is black. Sandra Kitt handles this with relative ease and makes this book worth reading. Excellent!!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"The wonderful thing about Close Encounters is that the reader thinks she is reading about the development of an interacial couple. A few chapters into this book, she (the reader) will realize that this is just a tiny, almost unimportant part of the plot. The story unfolds during a police investigation of an accidental shooting. The main characters don't expect to become romantically involved, and are actually on opposite sides of the conflict. Their mutual attraction surprises both of them. As they get to know each other better, they see that they have much in common and that their differences are superficial. This is quite an emotional journey for the central characters, and you will enjoy watching them work things out."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"After scrolling through the other reviews, I'm almost positive that the book I read--although the title was &quot;Close Encounters&quot; and the author was Sandra Kitt--was not the same one.I have read two of Ms. Kitt's other novels (The Color of Love and Between Friends) and was not impressed. I found the heroines lacking common sense and believability. When I bought &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, I hoped that I would not find the same with this one. I cannot say that I did.Of the heroines from the three novels mentioned above, Carol Taggert was almost believable. (I say almost because I didn't understand how she could ignore threats after being shot and what she did after a serious attempt on her life was made continues to boggle my mind.) Carol's relationship with her older brother, Wesley, was good. Her relationship with her ex, Matt, was confusing, which made that realistic as well. The relationship with Lee was off to an interesting start and if the focus hadn't shifted to secondary characters in prime moments that would have been better suited for the main characters, I would have almost believed that Lee and Carol were in love. The chemistry existed between the two, but the relationship could have been developed a lot better. Just because two characters have sex early in their relationship does not automatically make what they have a grand love affair. It takes more than that. Other than the bullet that nearly killed Carol, what drew her and Lee together? This is not given in the pages and although I have an active imagination, I still couldn't &quot;imagine&quot; what the answer was in regards to Carol and Lee.As far as male characters go, Lee was okay. He didn't make me swoon and the pat responses he gave to his teen daughter's agonizing dilemma with her mother, didn't endear him to me either. In his thoughts, he wanted to be a good father, but where was the action? He told her he'd talk to her mother about their problems, but he never did. Sure, he hung out with her a few times, but so what? He should have done more. His lack of attention to his own flesh and blood didn't sit well with me and made it difficult for me to care about him.Finally, graphic violence towards women...is it really necessary? Hollywood has made millions from degrading women on film and TV. Must a female author follow their trend? I won't go into details, but what happens to Barbara (Lee's partner) towards the end of the book was unnecessary and added NOTHING to the story. The ending of the novel could have been the same without the sensationalism. Instead of adding to the story, those scenes lessened it.The novels that I find enjoyable, I tend to read again and again, refusing to part with them for anything. If I decide to keep this one, I may need a few years before I can pick it up again."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Close Encounters has a Danielle Steel feel to it, and it's clearly aimed at a female audience, though I have to admit I liked it. Author Sandra Kitt had a good police advisor (I am a retired police officer) as all of the police action and procedure is accurate.Kitt is a black woman. She says that she enjoys putting white and black people together in intimate relationships in all her books to see what happens. That is what made this book much more than an average police yarn.Good, easy read."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"While walking her dog,Carol Taggart is caught in the cross fire of a police sting gone awry. She is accidentally shot and almost killed by possibly one of two police officers. During her recovery, Carol and police lieutenant Lee Grafton find them-selves mutually drawn and attracted to each other. Complicating matters is the fact that Carol is black, Lee is a white policeman who stongly suspects he fired the bullet that struck Carol during the sting. Sandra kitt does a wonderful job of bringing all of the characters to life. The interactions between Carol and Lee are are sexy yet tender and romantic. However like some readers', I did feel that Carols's actions following her 2nd attack were not logical. As a result this does hamper the climax some. But despite that, this is a great story about an often overlooked subject-interracial relationships. This book would make a great movie if a good screenwriter gets hold of it. I picture Vivica Fox and Richerd Gere as Carol and Lee."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Very interesting &amp; captivating as always Sandra KItt is wonderful. Can't wait for her next one!!!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Few authors have the talent of a Sandra Kitt. Her body of work from the beginning proves that she deserves to be regarded with the same respect as authors such as Nora Roberts. Ms. Kitt grabs you from the first paragraph and doesn't let you go until the final word. If I find nothing else new on the mass market, I reread a Sandra Kitt novel, especially The Color of Love. What's really scarry is that Ms. Kitt doesn't even seem to have hit her stride yet. What we're encountering up close and personal in Ms. Kitt's work is a legend in the making."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Initially, I was thrown by the similarities between this book and the 'Color of Love'. In both books the protagonist is an artist, her lover is an older, divorced cop with a kid (Lee's kid's alive), the setting is NY. I enjoyed the story but I found myself reading it quickly and putting it aside.After a couple of weeks, I decided to read it again. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I got caught up in this wonderful story of self-discovery. Ms. Kitt is extremely talented, and she always entertains."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I READ THIS BOOK IN ONE DAY, I JUST COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS BOOK DEVELOP INTO A MOVIE. I READ THIS BOOK ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT IT. READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"&quot;The Color Of Love&quot; was my first SK read, and up until today, I would have said when it came to the genre of Interracial Romances (which is too often overlooked, IMO), COL was by far the best example of IRs on the market in that genre. But after finishing &quot;Close Encounters,&quot; I now feel compeled to add it to the list. The book was a quick, engrossing read (basically read it in 24 hours), with (main) characters that drew me in from their opening scenes. However, for as much as I enjoyed CE, like COL, there are a few complaints I have with the storyline(s):A. Granted, this is only my second SK novel, but I notice that as in COL, it seems (at least to *me*), the male leads are more fully developed/fleshed out characters than the female leads. I found myself caring far more about Lee Grafton than I did Carol Taggart.B. The female leads tend to show a serious lack of common sense w/regards to assertiveness (COL's lead re: the situation with her ex &amp; sister) and saftey (Carol's handling of the DANGEROUS events after the shooting in CE)C. The sub-plots re: the supporting characters seemed out of place, almost forced.D. While &quot;realism&quot; with regards to action IS necessary in fiction of this type, sensationalism is not, IMO; I'm referring specifically to the (violent) encounter between two of the supporting characters. Not only was it unnecessary, but in regards to the (male) character's behavior patterns which had been established, totally unbelievable.Yet, for the above shortcomings I found with &quot;Close Encounters,&quot; the book's saving grace is the tenderness and geniune EMOTION the progressing romance between Carol &amp; Lee invokes. I also enjoyed that Kitt TOOK HER TIME re: the romance. The progression was believable, IMO.Looking forward to the next SK novel. Perhaps the *third* time WILL be the charm!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"What can I say?! Do I even need to write a review for Ms. Kitt?! I've read almost all of her books and I can't put them down they're just that good---great!!! My only thing is that she needs to walk away from the policeman--New York theme, I would like to see our male characters have a different occupation sometime. But that is no reason to not still give this book 5 stars. A million handshakes to Ms. Kitt for her outstanding work, please continue."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I LIKED READING THIS BOOK. MOSTLY B/C I THINK SANDRA KITT IS A TALENTED WRITER. I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS B/C I'VE READ ANOTHER BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE LOVE BETWEEN HER CHARACTERS IN THAT BOOK WHERE BOTH PEOPLE WERE BLACK WAS MUCH MORE INTENSE.

It kept me interested, it wasnt very slow paced, and i loved the storyline.

Without omitting societal prejudices and stereotypical presupposes, Sandra blends a poignant love story that embraces more than the common obstacles that many interracial couples endure. Close Encounters over flows with vivid situations that will leave you anxious and intrigued.Carol Tagart and Lee Grafton are thrust together one night during a heinous situation that changes both of their lives forever. Against all odds, they fight unrelenting adversaries that threaten their relationship, their character, and their existence.What I like most about this novel is the engrossing and passionate story line that deals with a myriad of delicate subjects, and the graceful and pivoting way that the story is told. The added subplots of suspense were thrilling and riveting. Make sure that you block off plenty of time to read this book because once you start, you won't be able to stop reading until the very last page."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I first discovered Sandra Kitt when I read &quot;The Color of Love&quot; and was absolutely blown away by it. With &quot;Close Encounters&quot; Ms. Kitt continues to see and write about the world as it really is. She understands that while the world is Black and White there is no color boundary when it comes to love. As usual her characters are real. They could be the people next door.The herione Carol Taggert gets caught in police crossfire in more ways than one. As a Black women in NYC gunned downed by a stray police bullet, her first thoughts would be to sue the City wouldn't it? Carol's family background and the lessons taught to her by her father and mother keeps her from doing that, but it doesn't stop her from having misgivings about how she feels about the White police officer who may have been the person who shot her. For me, &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was more than a interracial love story, and I don't think that it was meant to be just that. This book is about understanding who you are, how you feel about yourself and how you fit into the scheme of someone else's life and how they fit, whether you like it or not, into yours. And how 10 seconds can change your life forever. After the shooting, Carol starts to think about her past, how she treated her loving adoptive parents and about the husband she had chosen for all the wrong reasons. Police Officer Grafton realizes that outside of his fellow police officers, the only other people he has any real contact with are women that he sees for one reason only and the &quot;scum&quot; of the City. His total tunnel vision focus on &quot;policing&quot; had a negative effect on his broken marriage and is now having the same effect on his daughter. Both characters go through a lot pain and suffering as they reasses their lives and try to fight what they both know is a losing battle. They are bound together by more than the accidental shooting. He realizes it first and together they fight the odds against them. This is the kind of novel that I will read again and again.This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Close Encounters is a wonderfully well written story. Sandra Kitt does a great job of pulling the reader into the story. I was positively mesmerized by the story. I read Close Encounters from cover to cover. I could not put this book down.Carol Taggert happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and is shot during a police undercover operation. Carol is a single African American woman who is struggling with family issues and still sleeping with her ex-husband.Lee Grafton is the cop who thinks he shot Carol during a drug bust by accident. He may or may not be the shooter but he visits Carol several times and realizes that they have a connection.Carol's ordeal is explosive because the cop who shot her is white and the NYPD has a horrible reputation in the black community. Carol realizes that the shooting has given her a second chance at life. Lee also struggles with his career choice. Can he continue to be a police officer?Close Encounters moves at a very fast pace. The supporting characters are involved up to their necks in action and the story proceeds full speed ahead. I can't wait to get my hands on another Sandra Kitt book."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"This is my second Sandra Kitt title, the first was The Color of Love. The story is current and interesting. The police involved in an accidental shooting and how this can be used or misused. I really enjoyed the fact that two sides: the police and the black victims were shown without bias. I also enjoyed that the romance developed slowly and in a logical manner. A great deal went on in this book but it was fast paced and kept my interest. If you are looking for a nice summer read this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"* Spoiler Alert* Carol Taggart is a Black Art teacher with a very unique background: She was abandoned at the age of 2 and then adopted and raised by two White activist parents. Lt. Lee Grafton is a police officer from the Special Operations and the Anti-Crime Unit. Carol is shot one night during a failed drug bust by an officer--Lee knows that it could only have been his partner or himself who shot her. They are returning fire in the line of duty. Though the shooting is by the book, this doesn't change the fact that Carol, who is entirely blameless, nearly lost her life in the process. Carol and Lee manage to start a relationship from the basis of their problematic connection. The question is will Carol and Lee be able to sustain the considerable outside pressures that make their possibility of success in a relationship against the odds?Though CLOSE ENCOUNTERS relies more on character development, the idea of the shooting and the bad cop angle rather than upon a developed plot--we don't know what the main characters want, what keeps them from getting it, (Well, maybe Lee wants to be a good father and his job is in the way, but this seems secondary), what they do to try to achieve it, etc.--it's a very interesting read that draws you in from the start.What doesn't make any sense is Carol's change-of-heart. The decision is made abruptly and then never logically rationalized. Personally, I don't see how Carol could claim to love Lee and sue the city--given that it will likely ruin a career that is the only one that he has ever seen himself doing, the career that gave him self-respect and taught him how to be a leader. And I don't see how he could claim to love Carol and not feel betrayed.Throughout the book, Carol is talking about not wanting to be a victim and how filing a suit against the city would make her feel like she had taken that role; she talks about how her life is more important than money; she says that she thinks that she was shot for a reason--that it was a blessing in disguise. Carol can't imagine any other way that Lee might have entered her life:\\"She'd almost been killed. She had survived, but everything had changed. Forever.... Her father had suggested that God had other plans for her. But during the past few days Carol had begun thinking that maybe she had been given a second chance to make some plans of her own.\\" (69 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).Carol says to Lee of the incident: \\"...I think what I went through might have been a blessing in disguise.\\" (123 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).Sandra Kitt writes: \\"Though [Carol] appreciated that her brother was acting in her best interests, she felt a great reluctance to do anything that might betray Lee's personal confession to her. She had no doubt that he had acted entirely on his own in telling her his role [that would be accidentally shooting her]. She had no intention of using it against him, and she didn't want anyone else to do so either....\\" (134 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).When her ex-husband points out that a law suit could make the city take accountability, saying: \\"You could always make them tell the truth....You know what they say about the truth. It can set you free.... []The fact that it was a black woman who was shot adds fuel to the fire,\\" Carol wants nothing to do with an \\"all-out protest\\". (159, 160 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).And later when her brother tries yet again to convince her to sue, she refuses: \\"...I'm alive.... [H]e apologized.... []The way I see it, I got a huge second chance that morning. Doesn't he deserve one too? []I'm telling you this because I want you to understand why I don't want to sue.\\" (178 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).And as Carol and Lee take the ultimate plunge into a sexual relationship, Kitt writes: \\"The time to be frightened or to set boundaries had been the morning they'd met. The time to be angry was in the distant past. Blame and recrimination were beside the point. What really mattered was this moment. Right now might be all they'd ever have.\\" (235 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS). So, my question is: what reason is left to sue and potentially destroy her lover's career?Don't get me wrong, as a victim of violent crime myself, I think these kinds of decisions are very personal and should be respected. But the character of Carol has been written so inconsistently. Dogmatically, she refused to sue and rebelled against any encouragement to do so. And then there is a quick flip-flop (right after Lee's ex-lover walks in on Carol and Lee and spews her petty venom) with next to no explanation for Carol's abrupt change in prerogative. It just didn't ring true. Neither did Lee's reaction. Nor did Carol's continued professions of love. The least amount of damage I could believe that would have been done with Carol making this decision--she did not even warn Lee that she intended to sue--would have been awkwardness and distance. The most amount of damage I could envision is the destruction of their fledgling relationship and either coldness or angry resentment being all that was left between them. The cozy, sweet climax Kitt set out didn't ring true at all. I give it 3 stars.It Was Almost Pretty Good, But It Turned Out Only Pretty Okay."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Sandra Kitt just keeps getting better. It's rare to find an author not afraid to write intelligent and moving romances that feature black/white couples. Keep em' coming, Sandra. If you haven't read her other books, you're missing out."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"This was my second book by Sandra Kitt (The Color of Love being the first) and it was just as good as the first, if not better. The characters were realistic (meaning flawed and human -- not perfect)and the story well researched as well. I look forward to more books by this author. Bravo, Ms. Kitt!"},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"This is my 5th novel by Kitt and she scores again with me. When a white male cop shoots, and almost kills, an innocent bystander black female, in a crossfire with drug suspects, an unusual bond is forged between the two people. They form a relationship they both feel impelled towards, although neither the police department nor her lawyer want the two to see one another at all. A lawsuit will have to flow from this event, which will make the cops in New York city look racist. I thought this was a very unusual story idea and Kitt managed to make it convincing and believable. Meanwhile, the criminal forces unleashed during the crossfire continue to menace the lead characters. Kitt also does kids well and the cop's daughter is a very good character trying to work out her adolesence after her parents' divorce. Signet also gives Kitt great graphic covers for her novels, depicting the characters. These are very reader-friendly for drawing a mixed-race audience. The cover subtly conveys the mixed races which photographs, used on her earlier books, did not. Kitt also wrote the equally terrific &quot;The Color Of Love&quot; and &quot;Between Friends.&quot; You can't go wrong with this author."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"I'm a big Sandra Kitt fan, and anxiously await each of her releases. Having followed her from her time with Harlequin to the present, I can honestly say that this is her best novel ever. I couldn't put it down until it was finished and then I reread several parts. The main characters, Lee a divorced, White homicide detective and Carol, a divorced, Black art teacher, meet under the most unusual circumstances. Their connection starts out as one thing, but is nourished and quickly grows into the committed love relationship that most people wish for. Ms. Kitt's portrayal of these two figures as emotionally mature and honest, lets the reader feel their anguish and their &quot;finest moments.&quot; The several minor characters play into the entire story, but vividly into suspenseful conclusion. A must read for lovers of suspense mixed with romance."},{"Title":"Close Encounters","review":"Sandra Kitt's newest novel exceeded my expectations. When I initially viewed it at a local bookstore, it struck me as intriguing and thought provoking. After reading this enjoyable, and yes thought provoking novel, I came away with a very good feeling. I believe that this author's writing has moved to a higher level, with this novel. The reader really gets a sense as to what it would be like to live in Lee and Carol's world and face their dilemmas. This is definitely recommended for anyone interested in exploring fiction that represents our world today, issues such as interracial relationships and ethical dilemmas. Readers that enjoyed Eric Dickey's &quot;Milk in my Coffee,&quot; (as I definitely did!), will likely enjoy this novel. I found myself prolonging my reading, as I did not want to reach the end. I also appreciated the intricacies of the plot that Ms. Kitt developed. I highly recommend this novel to all fiction readers! Sincerely, Eamiga"},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"Overall i felt the book accomplished most of what it was after. after seeing mr feinberg on television i was moved by him and how the experience made him more \\"humanistic\\" but upon reading the novel i felt it missed the pointIt gave a very raw reason unto why the fund was established.It offered great insight into how difficult a task it wasHis background wasn't that bad to read aboutbut what it did lack was the answer to his title \\"What is life worth?\\"It didnt answer that question and meerly glazed over it in like 3 sentences in the last 10 pages of the book.i bought the book hoping i would see 2 books, the Victims compensation fund how he handled that and why, and peoples' reactions and i wanted the second book to be about what he has learned about the human condition, about what makes a person a person about why he feels they do the things they do, seeing so much grief one has to notice a pattern somewhere.so in that aspect I'am dissapointed because the book failed to deliver on that, if someone wants to read about the Victims compensation fund, they are at the right place, if you want to study humanity from a person who spent 2 and a half years living and breathing peoples' lives, hopes, dreams and sorrows then you need to go somewhere else."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"After watching Mr. Feinberg being interviewed on television I was most anxious to read his book. It goes without saying that the topic is both fascinating and poignant. However, given that the author is extremely distinguished I was perplexed as to why he felt the need to continually bombard the reader with his credentials. I felt quite bogged down with his repeated self-aggrandizing and was rather turned off. He came across as very caring and obviously intelligent during the television interview so I can only conclude he communicates better orally than in written word."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"The book is well made.

This is his relatively brief, spare, unassuming, thoughtful memoir of that nearly impossible task. The best thing about this book is that it does not read as if it were written by a lawyer. Feinberg's empathy for the victims of this unimaginable tragedy becomes very clear. For him, the assignment was literally a life-changing event, as he closed down his law office and became a law school lecturer. Parts of the narrative were a bit slow, but this is an important book."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"Mr. Feinberg clearly tells the history of the 9/11 fund to compensate victims. While it is written very factually, which is how a lwayer's mind is trained, the part I found most fascinating was his candidcy with how his own life changed after this experience. He also shared the various attitudes of those who made claims and tired to understand with empathy and compassion their responses. He continually strived toward equity throughout and was willing to listen to critics in order to be as fair as possible. A short and necessary read!!"},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"It is clear from reading this account of the 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund that Kenneth Feinberg is a compassionate man who bore a tremendous burden in administering the Fund. It is less clear why he alone could have done it.This is because there is not much in this book about the legal aspects of the Fund. For example, the statute passed by Congress is Feinberg's contant response to criticism about the \\"economic loss\\" criteria for awards, but he does not quote it or even use it in the appendix. I would also have liked to read more about how the Fund differed from past compensation funds that Feinberg had worked with, such as the Agent Orange fund. Finally, for a person with such great discretion over awards, I would have liked to hear about how that discretion was exercised in some difficult or unusual cases -- not just that it was used to narrow the range of total awards.This criticism probably all comes from my legal background, and What is Life Worth? is not a book for lawyers. In place of the technical details is a measured and sympathetic description of the reaction of the victims' families to the 9/11 tragedy -- from a person who may have spend more time talking to more different families than anyone else. This is a very valuable contribution to the history of 9/11 from a unique perspective.While the book is a quick read at 190 pages, its emotional weight is much greater and is really its focus. Perhaps Feinberg or one of his colleagues will one day write a more academic assessment of the Fund that will satisfy the desire to understand some of the day-to-day decisions that the administrators had to make."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"I thought this book functioned as a \\"report to the taxpayers\\", perhaps a counterpart to Kenneth Feinberg's report to the president, on his administration of the compensation fund for victims of 9/11 created by Congressional statute immediately after the 9/11 attacks. The writing is clear and very articulate. Mr. Feinberg does not seem to me to be self-promoting, as another reader commented, but simply reiterating his qualifications and his rationale for the way he administered this fund. For purposes of this review, I am attempting to keep my feelings about the creation of the fund itself separate from Mr. Feinberg's administration of it and his account of that process. His account of it is a very engrossing read - something that came as a surprise to me. I read it twice, once to myself and once aloud to the family. I think this should be required reading in high schools and colleges because it is an extremely important facet of the whole event (which we are still in the throes of) that we speak of as \\"9/11\\". There are ethical, philosophical, political, legal and undoubtedly many other positions from which to view the fund and its administration vis a vis history, precedent, and so on. This book is an extremely important report to the taxpayers. I only wish there could be a countervailing report FROM the taxpayers! I do think Mr. Feinberg performed good service to Congress' wishes expressed in the statute creating the fund. However, to refer to the fund as reflective of the great generosity of American taxpayers is a bit disingenuous since American taxpayers did not have a say in the creation or any other aspect of the fund. It was created very quickly after 9/11 and was completely open-ended, an unprecedented action. Its creation raises far more questions than are answered and the implication that it was used to squelch asking many questions still haunts the whole process. However, that was not Mr. Feinberg's issue; he had the statute and the fund and the victims to deal with and his report covers his purview with excellent clarity. I highly recommend this book to every American and would like to see it on bestseller lists, ahead of Ms. Coulter's recently published rant. Mr. Feinberg is obviously an intelligent, dedicated, conscientious, fair-minded man whose very thoughtful account of this particular facet of 09/11 warrants widespread attention."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"I've met Mr. Feinberg a few times, casually and briefly, and although my favorable impression of him didn't influenced those I formed of his book while reading it, that impression did remove the sting of cynicism I'd almost certainly have brought to reading a stranger's account of a program that I thought was bad law.In the days following the 9/11 murders, congress wrote and President Bush signed into law the victim compensation fund, giving monetary awards to anyone who was killed or injured at the Pentagon or World Trade Center. The fund was created to protect the US economy by encouraging a return to business as usual and discouraging litigation against industry. There had been nothing like it in US law before. Congress set no limit on the awards, the special master had sole responsible in administering the fund, and the amounts were largely unregulated. Mr. Feinberg, former counsel to Ted Kennedy in his role on the Senate Judiciary committee, interviewed with attorney general John Ashcroft who gave him the job.I'll let the reader discover for himself the details given of the administration of the fund because that's not the heart of the book, its soul, although historians and legal professionals are repaid for reading it. The soul of the book is part of Mr. Feinberg's own. \`What's a Life Worth?' refers both to Mr. Feinberg's account of his prosecution of the role of special master determining the dollar amount awarded for each death or injury and his unfavorable opinion of the law's precedent, and the reflection his work caused him to make on the nature of life in America and a person's role in it. It's a part of the public record and a keen legal brief, as well as a discourse on the unique way of life Americans enjoy and reminder that each of us is part of the life of others and we have a role to play in public and private. Sitting here, typing this out, I suddenly realized that this is the most patriotic book I've read in years.\`What's a Life Worth'? will be read and referred to, with admiration, long after the story of 9/11 stops being part of living memory and the faces of the murderers forgotten or placed as bogeys in text books along with John Wilkes Booth or Lee Harvey Oswald. I'll vouch for the veracity of the man who wrote it and the genius for simplicity he brought to his role of special master and his philosophy, that work and life he shares with us here."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"Feinberg gives the reader two experiences in one book. First he explaind the rationale behind the compensation fund and provides thoughtful anlaysis and criticism of the fund legislation. This is a useful exercise even for persons experienced in alternate forms of dispute resolution.Second, and to my mind more importantly, he gives us a vivid perspective on how the victims of 9/11 reacted to their extraordinary loss. He does so in a factual, non-voyeuristic way, but his account is nonetheless very moving.It's a good book and it's an important book. That's not a combo you see often."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"I found the book fascinating. It may have been repetive at times and sometimes a little disjointed in its presentation and maybe even a bit self-serving in boosting Mr. Fineberg's rep but all in all the description of the dolts in Congress and the variety of responses of the victims and the families of victims was mostly heart warming. However why some people expected millions and millions of dollars from the government shows the dark side of human nature; greed even overcomes grief. I recommend this book to anyone interested in American society and how haphazard our government of the people, by the people and for the people works and doesn't work."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"In a book in which he assesses the worth and effectiveness of his own role in implementing a post 9/11 policy to compensate those whose loved ones died in the tragedy, it's not hard to see how Feinberg judges the job done to be an excellent one. Between patting himself on the back for how charming he is in a variety of social settings to the condescending way he looks at the worth assigned to the lives of those who died, this book resembles an extended version of a job interview more than it does a soul searching account of his role in a highly emotional process or a serious analysis of government policy. In short, don't believe the hype and don't waste your time."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"This book is about the process by which the federal government decided it would attempt to \\"compensate\\" the families of the victims of the 9/11 tragedy. While the title would have you believe that in its pages is some insight into answering the question - \\"What is life worth\\". I believe Mr. Feinberg makes a few valid points on the complexities of answering this question, his insights are not particulaly deep. He identifies a few of the challenges with coming up a dollar value for each life that was lost (or injured) such as: how to compensate the family of someone with a high income (e.g. bond trader) versus a lower-income individual (dish washer), do we compensate for heroism, pain or suffering, who do we compensate (spouses, children, parents, fiance(e)s, etc..), why do we not compensate for victims of Oklahoma city and other tragedies. These are interesting questions and he does a good job of presenting them with background stories that are generally compelling. Sometimes the anectodes begin to drift away from the topic of the book and these the story becomes a little long winded.The greatest value in the book is that is a great history lesson. He explains why the fund was created - to prevent a mass of lawsuits (not to \\"compensate the families\\" - which we all know could never happen). He states how this tragedy was different that others, and how America (its people and leaders) reacted to it.The weakest point of this book with the shameless self-promotion. While Mr. Feinberg makes a it VERY CLEAR he served the as the head of the fund Pro Bono (he did it for no pay), I believe it was an extremely lucrative deal in terms of public relations for his firm and for himself. I'm sure that he had the opportunity to make a few bucks with the book (I don't know if he donated proceeds from the book as well). The worst part was that he describes the program as a smashing succes because of the high participation rate (I think around 99%) and the \\"efficient\\" manner in which the fund was created. It cost $86 Million to figure out what each of 5560 familes should get. He states that 1.2% is a very low operating costs. He doesn't point out that payments at this level (7 billion dollars) have never been made. Because the payout was so high, even 120 Million or 190 million may seem to be a bargin because the percentage of the payout is still low.Overall, a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","review":"I used this book as a prime source for my graduate level thesis on the subject of the appropriateness of the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund, and whether it should be a model for future funds."},{"Title":"Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications","review":"This book provides excellent intuition into the fourier transform, discrete fourier transform, and fast fourier transform.

I bought the book at the Stanford University Book store for a whopping $19.95. The receipt is still in the book.The book was considered to be a DSP industry bible back then, and in my opinion, it is still the best DFT/FFT book on the market today.Mr. Brigham seems to be very detailed oriented. He methodically progresses from one subject to the next and explains each topic in a clear and concise manner. The book is loaded with extremely detailed graphics that give the reader a very good picture of the operation, properties, and mechanics of the Discrete Fourier Transform. His mathematical derivations of various DFT/FFT properties are straight forward and can be read and understood in short order.I consider Mr. Brigham's book to be an essential engineering resource. I have relied upon, and utilized the information provided in this book for over 30 years of successful DSP design.If I ever misplace my time worn book, would I purchase it again?

I get the feeling that Brigham had been frustrated by technical texts that were poorly written, and decided he wasn't going to commit the same sin. Plenty of carefully planned illustrations designed to help the reader start from a known place, and move step-by-step to an understanding of something new. Not just a bunch of faceless equations. I think this would be an excellent college text.Like any in-depth text dealing with a mathematically complex topic, there appear to be a number of mistakes left in to keep the reader on his/her toes.

You will understand why if you do sampling using the radian frequency(w) you will end up scaling in the frequency apart from the magnitude of the spectrum. Again the little devil hiding behind the bushes is the rather selcouth ability of the Dirac: delta(at)=delta(t)/a. This is the main disadvantage of the radian frequency. Most writers prefer the frequency(f) or the radian frequency(w) without caring to show to their readers why they have chosen to do so.

I got brain-lock, and couldn't even use them effectively in a package like Matlab or IDL. I got lost in integrals and delta functions and found myself rapidly sinking into mathematical quicksand. Evoking qliphotic demons from within a pentagram of power would have been simpler and less arcane.Then along came Brigham. Although his book had all the gnarly math of any other Fourier transform explanation I had ever seen, he also drew diagrams--diagrams which allowed me to &quot;get&quot; what the language of mathematics had so clearly expressed. All of a sudden the integrals were tamed. I wasn't in quicksand, just a damp sidewalk at Adventureland, waiting for the Jungle Cruise.And that was just the first couple of chapters! Brigham quickly moved into transform theory, applying the Fourier integral to convolution and correlation. Then into sampled waveforms and the discrete Fourier transform and its applications.Finally, he presented the Fast Fourier Transform. Once again, he clarifies without obfuscating. I found the FFT moving from the hyper-arcane to the land of &quot;Well, duh!&quot; (Beware: The actual FFT code included is not particularly efficient. Find source code for implementation *elsewhere*.) He extends the FFT to convolution and correlation, as well as to two dimensions. He doesn't skimp on applications, either. He clarifies interferometry, time-difference-of-arrival, power spectrum analysis, and beamforming.If you're not a signal processing wonk already, read this book. You may find it a powerful cure for DSP-phobia."},{"Title":"Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications","review":"I used the book to teach a Fourier Transform course for fellow engineers at Lockheed Martin. I taught straight from the book and only included some of my own personal FFT applications. The book gives a development of Fourier Transform &amp; Series Fourier Transform, along with practical knowledge on how to apply them, and also gives numerous application at various level of difficulty. This is my favorite FFT reference. I'm still studying some of the applications in the last three chapters. I like the author's figures for showing the convolution integral using Fourier Transforms. All the concepts were shown graphical with figures. The publisher needs to print this book in hard back since I used my paper back edition so much that its coming apart.I also would recommend &quot;Fourier-Related Transforms, Fast Algorithms and Applications&quot; by Norman Morrison and &quot;Introduction to Fourier Analysis&quot; by Okan Ersoy as good academic references but lacked the application focus I was looking for."},{"Title":"Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications","review":"I'm delighted to see that Brigham's book is in print. (I bought my first copy 20 years ago!) I'm planning to use as part of a course on signal processing. I've read several books on FT's and this is the best. It is one of the few technical books whose presentation is genuinely complete and clear. For example, the relationships between the discrete and the continuous FT, the role of the convolution integral, and the Nyquist theorem are presented logically with both algebraic proofs and graphical explanations. I'm always on the look out for monographs that focus on one subject and make you feel like you've become an expert on it when you're through. This fits the bill."},{"Title":"Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications","review":"This is an excellent, excellent text covering continuous and discrete-time signals/systems. Yes, it's ultimate focus is on the FFT, but about 50% of the content is basic continuous- and discrete-time signal analysis concepts, explained thoroughly, with superb graphic examples, and textual information from an obviously talented thinker, writer, communicator. It is extremely comprehensive but written 'patiently', bordering on the active voice style, which seems to be in short supply these days. If you had that well known and universally despised &quot;S&amp;S&quot; textbook in college, torch it, buy this text, clean the slate, start over. There's no need to live with spectrophobia. This text has none of the usual inward, regurgitated extra-academic nonsense, the author clearly set out to write a fresh and original book. Read it slowly, the examples are vivid. You'll attain a visual feel for just what a linear transformation is, what the Fourier Transform is, and you'll develop the necessary intuition to allow you to be able to imagine both time and frequency domain relationships in a qualitative, systems oriented way (and this is where you want to be, trust me). The sections on convolution, correlation, discrete sampling, DFTs, finite-length effects, well, they're just perfect, with numerous mind-altering graphic examples. Many of these examples show side-by-side what happens in time and frequency domains simultaneously. It's clear that the author, unlike so many others, had a genuine interest in teaching and communicating. There's plenty of rigorous stuff if you want to go in deep, and I recommend it. The FFT sections are from the ground up - after a time you'll be able to design your own FT strategies and implement them with confidence. The best engineering text on the planet.

Much of this is surprisingly applicable to the brain science area, as the revolutionary work of David Marr and other scientists showed a quarter of a century ago.But getting back to the present book, this is one of the best books I've read in the signal analysis area. Brigham's presentation of various aspects of the FT, including the continuous FT, digital FT, convolution integrals, and so on, is clear and concise, whether he's discussing theory or applications. Also, his disussion of the Nyquist sampling theorem is the best and easiest to understand I've read.Interestingly, this theorem has quite practical applications, not just in digital sample theory, but in real life. According to the Nyquist theorem, no information is lost in converting from analog to digital form if the sampling frequency is twice that of the highest frequency in the signal. Well, have you ever used those audio headphones they have on commercial jetliners? The Nyquist theorem means they can switch the audio outputs at high frequency using well-known time-domain switching techniques rather than run copper to each passenger's seat. I've read that this saves 300 pounds of copper wire in a typical plane, the weight savings of which can of course be more profitably used for transporting other things. If you consider that 300 pounds is about the weight of your average couple, you can see how the savings would add up after even a few flights.But getting back to the book, I first encountered this work 20 years ago, and I'm delighted to see it's still around. My neurobiology student friends and I all got turned on to this book early in grad school, and it was a great help. I still fondly recall the many enjoyable hours we spent talking about how Fourier analysis and other techniques such as the Laplace transform, temporal modulation transfer fuction, two-dimensional convolution integrals, two-dimensional point-spread functons, filter techniques such as the finite and infinite response filters, Kalman filter, Hammond filter, and so on, could be applied to our area. And it all started with this book. It's a true classic that has never been exceeded for it's clear and concise exposition of a very important mathematical tool in both engineering and neurophysiology."},{"Title":"Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications","review":"The book I have is ISBN 0-13-307496. It was published in 1974.I am very happy about this book, I first read it in 1979 when I was 19, and I found it really marvellous. I agree with the other reviewers, but I must add a note of caution - the edition I have contains some errors. They are as follows;p155, p157 - the factors w(11) and w(10) are incorrectly placed on the butterfly diagram 10.3 and 10.4 respectively,p166, p168, p169, equations 10-26 and most equations following to the end of the chapter - the factors R(N-n) and I(N-n) should be R(N-1-n) and I(N-1-n), respectively.I hope I'm right about this, but the convention is that the indices are from 0 to N-1, and therefore if n=0, then N-n is N - which not an allowed index.Apart from these sort of errors (I havn't been through the whole book with a fine toothcomb), its really very good, actually extraordinarily clear.One of its main benefits is that it doesn't veer away from the FFT to the very complicated developments such as fractional transforms and other developments which might confuse the sort of audience it's aimed at (which is definitely the graduates).But if you want to look deeply into FFTs for a real application you will need a lot more. I must mention,for instance, that the implementation of an FFT needs fairly careful error propagation and rounding analysis, and this isn't covered at all in the book. Neither are prime factor FFTs. In fact the chapter &quot;FFT algorithms for arbirary factors&quot; is only a method of factoring into powers of two, and certainly not the prime factor decomposition which was developed later by Winograd, Chuo, and others.It must also be said that while the DCT is practically a kissing cousin of the FFT, this naturally isn't covered in this text... but neither are the finite field implementations that are now taking many peoples imaginations to faster and faster FFTS.Also, there are jolly useful things to know about, such as the FFT when you only need a subset of the output data points.

The Discrete Fourier Transform - It is developed from the continuous Fourier Transform both graphically and theoretically. Its properties are examined as are numerous waveform classes via illustrative examples. Discrete convolution and correlation are defined and compared with the continuous equivalents via examples.3. The FFT - The FFT algorithm is developed along with an explanation of why the FFT is efficient. Computer programs are developed that can calculate the FFT.4. Basic Applications of the FFT - Presents the application of the FFT to the computation of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms. There is an emphasis on graphical examination of resolution and common FFT user mistakes such as aliasing, time domain truncation, noncausal time functions, and periodic functions. The applications examined include Laplace transform computation, discrete convolution and correlation, and two-dimensional Fourier transform convolution. Computer programs are provided.5. Signal Processing and System FFT Applications - The design and application of digital filters using the FFT are explored.

The story starts off placidly but you are told things are going to quickly change as all the players are in place. Stewart's writing is incredibly visual. Her sense of place is vivid to the point that you feel the heat and smell the flowers. Her use of analogy is wonderful. With only a few words, you know who these characters are. Her protagonist is strong, smart and very capable. Her friend, Louise, plays a minor role but is memorable in her own right. I don't always like the way children are portrayed but, again, Stewart has drawn a lovely character in the boy, David. Stewart creates and builds the suspense, but adds just a subtle, mostly off-scene, dash of romance to make a wholly satisfying read. Even the chapter headings add to the story. My only personal nit-pick is the use of portents, which is just a personal irritant for me, but so minor when compared with the rest of the story.

One thing she's really good at is description--you can almost hear the cicadas chirping (well, it was quite literal in my case--I had my window open and the cicadas were working overtime!). Mary Stewart is also known for her exotic locations, and this one definitely didn't disappoint. The car chase scene is especially well done; the tension is palpable, even as we find out what really happened all those years ago. Mary Stewart's books aren't by any stretch of the imagination, literature as such (even the cover looks a little bit romance-y), but they're definitely entertaining, and the perfect end-of-summer read."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"This was the second MS novel I read, having first read \\"Touch Not the Cat\\" in serialized form. I read MWYT while a lonely grad student, waiting for my husband to finish his degree and join me in California for his post-doc. Having little money, I checked out the cheap books at the bookstore (the library had only \\"serious\\" books) for fun. MWYT was there for a quarter. I was hooked. The writing is fast-paced, the chase descriptions thrilling, the mystery terrific, the descriptions of people, food, clothing wonderful. All these years later I re-read it to plan my own trip to Roman France. Who would know to watch a sunrise at Les Baux otherwise?"},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"If you appreciate an 'old fashioned' tale free of graphic intimacy and violence, if you appreciate vivid description, romance and intrigue this is for you. I read all but one of Mary Stewart's books in my early twenty's through late thirties. Now, nearing seventy, I am rereading them and cherishing the stories I read in my young years. I have divested myself of hundreds of books. Mary Stewart's remain a constant. Though I prefer some over others \\"Madam Will You Talk\\" is one of my favorites. It tells of a young widow vacationing in Southern France who accidentially stumbles on murder, betrayal and intrique. Of course there is a romantic touch, but who is the object of the heroine's affection?

Romance and tension. It was great pleasure to read this book."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"I found this book one of my favourites. While you're reading it, you feel like you're there, in the story. The way the book is written illustrates the story in your mind beautifully. A completely captivation story line. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, completely enthralled in the book. You can't put it down!!! The whole mystery/romance novel in itself is a mystery. Don't miss out on this one!!!"},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"Although I enjoyed reading \\"The Stormy Petrel\\" (5 stars), \\"Thornyhold\\" (4 stars) and \\"Touch...Cat\\", I was not too impressed with \\"The Ivy Tree\\" or \\"Madam, will you talk\\".They were still a better read than the Artus series though.Right now I'm rereading \\"Madam, will you talk?\\" after many many years again, but even on page 100 I'm wondering why this novel gets so many great reviews here on amazon.com. It's not bad, but it's not that good either.Two stars for the descriptions of Avignon, Nimes, Les Baux, Chateau d'If and all these beautiful places in Southern France, I've been to all of them more than twice, even to Marseille's Canebi&egrave;re and Vieux Port. However, I wish the plot wouldn't be as formulaic. Stewart always describes some young British woman who is trying to overcome her last unhappy relationship (or she is a widow in mourning) and going on a long trip to either Greece or France where she inevitably gets involved in some dangerous adventure while meeting Mr. Right."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"As I have always wondered why the BBC has not produced any of Ms. Stewart's wonderful novels as mini-series for public television, I cannot help but imagine how media rich such a production would be. Case in point, Ms. Stewart's first work of suspense fiction: \\"Madam Will You Talk?\\" Her heroine, Charity Shelbourne is instantly likeable--a WW2 war widow who lovingly carries a framed photo of Johnny, her fallen RAF pilot in her suitcase,gladly expends time from her own holiday to entertain a lonely 14-year-old boy and honestly is confident enough about her own looks to admit when another woman is breathtakingly beautiful. True to her name and her noble instincts, Charity plunges unwittingly yet rather intelligently into a post war intrigue involving the estranged boy, his agressively tenacious father and the boy's lovely yet frightened stepmother using all the wit and willpower that made the British so heroically stoic through WW2. The characters play against the lush backdrop of the walled hilltop villages of Avignon and Nimes and eventually the cosmopolitan splendour/squallor of Marseilles which we see, smell and hear from the passenger side of Charity's car in a chase sequence more harrowingly memorable than that in the film \\"The French Connection\\". Ms . Stewart delivers not only a nicely summed up tale of greed and murder, but neatly fills Charity's emotional void and our own as she allows Charity to utilize Johnny's devil-may-care driving tips, rebel savvy and masculine assuredity through each twist of the plot on her way to finding her way in the world without him while opening her heart to someone else. She is a woman all women want to be: vulnerable yet indispensible. The essential ingredients are all there for a most wonderful episodic film about a wily 20th century woman--get those cameras rolling! Highly recommended, especially in the unabridged audio format."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"I first read Mary Stewart as a teenager with her Merlin series, and it left such an impression on me that when I recently saw at a library book sale that she had other books I immediately picked them all up. Stewart is a master writer (and I didn't know she published in the 50's) who informs you as she writes, with eloquent references to geography, literature, and art. The story is about an attractive heroine who is thrown into close quarters with a man who may or may not be a murderer, who wants her to divulge the location of his young son. Like a play with a cast of characters, she is staying at a hotel that has a variety of people for whom you do not know what their real motives are. If you want a suspenseful romantic novel, you could not do better than Mary Stewart."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"Nobody does it better. Nobody ever will. Even in this, Stewart's first novel, her prose is so compelling that you overlook some of the new-author awkwardness. Some scenes go on too long, and her fascination with cars/driving/car chases (a staple in each of her books) can get a bit tiresome. But you only notice that on your third or fourth reread. It's a shame that romance novels aren't permitted to be intelligent nowadays; authors are expected to write at a junior-high school comprehension level. No such rules in Stewart's day, and that's why she'll never be bested."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"From the inside cover - \\"The whole affair had begun so quietly. No hint of danger in the air. Only a picturesque vacation resort in the south of France, a very lovely...and very rich...young widow on a holiday tour, and a group of amiable strangers lazing about the little hotel with its elegant, old-world charm. How was Charity Selbourne to know of the dark, sinister forces that lay behind this pleasant scene, and that they were, at the very moment of her arrival, uncoiling for a final, deadly thrust?\\"From the back cover - \\"When Charity Selbourne arrived in the picturesque French resort town of Avignon, she had no way of knowing that she was to become the principal player in the last act of a strange and brutal tragedy. Most of it had already been played. There had been love-and lust-and revenge and fear and murder. And now the killer, with blood enough on his hands, was waiting in the wings.\\"This reader believes that this is classic Mary Stewart action, in which her readers become irresistibly involved with admirable characters suddenly caught up in intricate webs of danger and deceit. As always, her settings are so spectacular and described in such detail that I can see, smell and touch as clearly as if I were there as well. It is because of this superb sense of detail that a half dozen reads may not even be enough."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"As much for the times about which it is written as for the adventure into which a young war widow stumbles while on holiday in France with her best friend.It is about a boy &amp; his dog, a father &amp; his quest for his son &amp; a painting for which people have killed.Woman's Hour on BBC radio was serializing Madam, Will You Talk? when I was packing to emigrate to America &amp; I bought a copy to take with me because I had to know how it turned out.Mary Stewart's adventure books about young women tossed into dangerous adventures are always well written, well researched &amp; give you a taste of the countries in which they are set."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"Charity Selborne looks forward to a wonderful holiday with her friend Louise in the South of France -- Charity's first holiday since her husband's death. But her dream of lazy days on the beach and lovely afternoons sightseeing come to an end when she befriends a sweet but troubled young boy. From that moment on, her life becomes a nightmare when Richard Byron, the boy's father, begins to stalk her, hoping to find his boy through her. Young David is with his stepmother, who is hiding from Richard. Richard is a dangerous, crazy murderer who shouldn't be allowed to be near his son. But as Charity goes out of her way to protect David, she discovers that things are far more sinister than she had ever imagined.Mary Stewart is a clever writer of literary romantic suspense. I loved Nine Coaches Waiting and The Ivy Tree but hated Thornyhold. The aforementioned book had magic elements and was sketchy and dull to me. Stewart is in her element with this novel, writing the genre she does best, and I couldn't put Madam, Will You Talk? down. An atmospheric tone is big in Stewart's novels, and this one is not an exception. Suspense and tension are in every page, but the backdrop of the South of France plays a major role as well. I enjoyed Charity's descriptions of caf&eacute;s, beaches and the Provencal landscapes. The best part is when Charity, in an effort to avoid Richard, travels to Marseilles and takes a tourist ferry ride to the Chteau d'If. The scene is short, and full of suspense, but I like that the author added that into the mix. All in all, I absolutely LOVED Madam, Will You Talk? First published in 1955, this dark, suspenseful, romantic, and quite surprising novel is a definite page-turner. The plot is a little similar to Nine Coaches Waiting, but only in superficial ways (heroine going beyond her call of duty to protect a child, falling for a man she cannot trust, etc.). My one and only complaint is that this novel is too short (only 191 pages -- at least that was the page count of the used out of print paperback edition I bought). More of a novella than a novel, really. It ended too soon for me and I'm going to experience some Mary Stewart withdrawal. Alas, I have Airs Above the Ground and My Brother Michael on my TBR pile and I look forward to reading those soon."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"I first read this nearly 30 years ago (yikes), and it left such an indelible impression that when I recently started visiting this genre again, I had to have another taste of this story. There are a couple points where it's obvious this is an early work, but they are few and do not detract from the vivid descriptions and characterizations. By the end of the novel, I have been to Avignon and Marseilles, and I'm quite fond of Charity and her friends. Even Louise, a minor character, is well drawn and you feel you know her.Time to revisit all of Mary Stewart's books, I think. I remember the Merlin series fondly as well. If you like this genre, you may also like the works of Victoria Holt, Susan Howatch, and Phyllis Whitney. And if you liked the Merlin series, I highly recommend The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"Few authors can tell a story that weaves a spell the way Mary Stewart does.

This novel has the beautiful settings, fast-paced mystery and charming protagonist of all her suspense novels, plus an edge-of-your-seat climatic car chase that will leave you wanting to rush out and get her other books."},{"Title":"Madam, Will You Talk?","review":"Yes, yes, yes to all the earlier reviewers! That's why I put Madam, Will You Talk? on my listmania list of favorite romances - along with my alltime Stewart favorite: Nine Coaches Waiting. They both hold all the essential ingredients for a good read - not the least being excellent writing. It's all too true that most contemporary love stories, suspense thrown in or not, are written at an elementary school literary level. I've submitted 3 manuscripts to Avalon, all of which were returned with comments that my writing was excellent and my characters engaging but I spent too much time on plotlines and peripheral characters outside of the central love story - which is exactly what I prefer in a story! Thank goodness Stewart never followed Avalon's \\"Rules for Writing\\"! Unlike some other reviewers, I lost interest in Stewart with her Merlin series. It's her early first-person narratives that enthralled. Her sense of place, plot, and people cannot be beat in this genre! Sad to say, my local library does not carry a single one of her early romantic suspense novels, so I'm on a quest to build my own Stewart library. I don't reread many authors - but Stewart just gets better with time. Madam, Will You Talk? holds a line I've never forgotten over 30 years: \\"Who's Johnny?\\" Not what I expected the hero to ask in that scene but what an impact! Read the book and see if you agree.Lily's Sister"},{"Title":"A Journey to Moriah","review":"&quot;A Journey to Moriah&quot; is unequivocally the finest book I've ever read by the mother of a gay child. This is a story of a mother who takes responsibility for her own feelings, faces her demons, and grows as a woman. Too often parents of gay children project their own fears onto their children. Rhea Murray is clear from the start that she loves her son unconditionally and any demons she faces are her own demons - not her son's. Her turmoil over facing the church, facing family, facing her son's school, facing her small suburban community in Indiana, is her &quot;own&quot; turmoil - not her son's. To watch Rhea unfold as a human being as she faces these demons, is to watch a woman with a capital &quot;W&quot; come into her own strength and wisdom. The book's title refers to the biblical story of Abraham who was tested by God with the command that he sacrifice his son Isaac. Rhea realizes that she can have the approval of her church and the parishioners she has called &quot;friends,&quot; if she sacrifices her son - if she turns her back to him as they have. &quot;I will not sacrifice my son for the approval of a few people,&quot; she says. Rhea knows from the beginning that she will not sacrifice her son to church,school, family, or community - not to anyone. She honors her power and her ability to think for herself. Rhea faces her fears of public speaking, speaking out as the mother of a gay son, and facing authority. One of the most powerful moments in the book comes when she stands up to the school principal who is doing nothing to protect her son. At that moment she blossoms into a full and powerful woman. &quot;A Journey to Moriah&quot; is the story of a mother's fierce love for her son. It is a woman's journey to finding her own truth, facing her fears, finding her own power and strength, and growing as a human being. Rhea's story is a lesson to us all that the love for our children should not be compromised by any external forces and that finding our truth will unleash our power as human beings."},{"Title":"A Journey to Moriah","review":"Rhea Murray's heartfelt, honest, and utterly compelling story of her family's journey is one of the best books I have read in quite some time. As others who have read the book claim, it isn't something one can put down after a chapter or two. Life in Sunnyside, Indiana seems quiet, steady, and predictable, until Murray's son is identified as &quot;gay&quot; by a narrow-minded cleric. After this, life in the idyllic small-town metamorphoses into something more akin to south Georgia in the 1960's. And while the reader is sure to share the feelings of anger and betrayal of the Murray family, this is no diatribe written from bitterness or revenge. Murray looks within her own heart, exposes her own doubts and biases, which makes the journey all the more poignant and believable. &quot;Journey to Moriah&quot; has a different feel to it than most narrative and biographical works that cover such rough emotional terrain. The fair, even voice evokes real compassion in the reader without the use of sentiment, and Murray's charm and humor shine through in several chapters, most noteably as she chases a pickup truck down the small town street. In the light of the political backlash against gay and lesbian rights and the recent violent death of Matthew Shepard, Murray's book seems all the more moving and motivating. Murray's transformation reminds us that there are mothers, fathers, friends, and organizations out there that are working each day to make a place for the safety and acceptance of anyone who bears the mark of &quot;difference&quot; in this culture of conformance. I recommend this book highly for anyone who has loved a gay or lesbian, who has questioned their faith against the traditional christian backdrop of exclusionism, or who has ever weathered a journey that opened their whole heart to the world."},{"Title":"A Journey to Moriah","review":"Rhea's book best describes the struggles of a gay teen in rural America. Coming from a town like Sunnyside, Indiana, only 100 miles north, I too have been through the struggles that Bruce had experienced.Rhea is a priceless asset to the gay community, not only in rural Indiana, but also to gays and lesbians all over the country. Her dedication and stamina, sometimes seeing the events first hand, has often left me with a sense of pride and a restored faith in humanity. It is very uplifting to read of the positive live that she had provided to her gay son, and I truly believe that this book is a requirement for ANY parent who's son or daughter recently came out of the closet!Here's a standing ovation for Rhea - Thank you for the memories, and thanks for the help over the past years.

Will order from this vendor again. Future customers should highly consider this item and vendor. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Islam (International Islamic Federation of Student Organizations. [Publications])","review":"This book I think is for the student wishing to learn about or is interested in becoming a muslim (I'm not one of them, I was just curious about the religion, and also happened to have the book lying around - something I bought on sort of a whim in my college days I guess while visiting a faire about the religion). Gives a brief history of Islam, the conduct and requirements of what being a muslim infers, and also how and what is expected in terms of prayers and behavior is required. There is also an brief introduction to Arabic text.This book will not make a convert probably of anyone who already has made up their mind on what they think about Islam. Nor is it a book that looks at too much concerning the controversy surrounding Islam's practical application throughout history. It is sort of a propaganda piece of course, but not one towards trying to convince the listener to become a Muslim. It paints Islam in a good light and makes one or two quips against other religions. But it is done in a rational and practical manner and reveals the practical nature of the religion.What I've learned from the book is that Islam is a religion not only of behavior, but also one of governance. I can see why it can appeal to many people because it addresses the major sins of life - lust, alcohol, social/economic inequity and to a lesser extent on food (which has roots probably in practical concerns with toxins, disease, and parasites). It gives people regiment and a routine and a purpose to their lives, and keeps them busy enough about remind themselves of their spirituality to keep society hopefully as moral and stable as possible. You could say that this system of religion/governance addresses a lot of the major problems in a society. Whether or not one agrees as to whether or not it is the right way of addressing the issues is another discussion entirely."},{"Title":"Introduction to Islam (International Islamic Federation of Student Organizations.

This book is a must have for any fan of UFO or Michael Schenker. \\"Shoot Out The Lights\\" covers the bands entire career from the semi-dreadful spacerock of UFO \\"1\\" to the present. Every album gets it's own spin here with direct quotes from the band members themsleves. The insightful quotes, stories & reviews are too numerous to mention, but will provide more than one epiphany for any \\"true\\" UFO fan. The book's delvings into the psyche of the \\"enigma\\", \\"The Mad Axeman\\", aka Michael Schenker are worth the purchase price alone. If you've have read Martin's book on Blue Oyster Cult, this one is written in a similar style; and is just a good. If you haven't read Martin's book on BOC, buy it now along with \\"Shoot Out\\" and save on shipping. Better yet, head over to MP's website and get yourself personalized, autographed copies from the Lester Bangs of the new millenium himself! BONUS!!"},{"Title":"UFO: Shoot Out The Lights","review":"As far as I know, this is the only book out there on UFO, in my opinion one of the very best rock'n'roll bands of all time, and far more influential than most people realize. If you're a fan, you'll want to read this. You aren't likely to find this much information on UFO in one place anywhere else. Outside of Martin Popoff, Classic Rock magazine is about the only other source in print covering this band (it would be great if they would compile all the articles from their archives into a book).This isn't a band biography. You won't find out where and when Phil Mogg was born or the names of his parents, etc. This does contain band history about the formation of the group and the various line ups and how they came about. Like all of Popoff's books, this is mainly about the music. Every album is discussed in detail from Phenomenon to You Are Here, with song by song discussions and criticisms, and commentary from the band when it could be obtained. UFO's early work with Mick Bolton scores only brief mention and is more or less dismissed as demos. Personally, I think they rate better than that, and certainly deserve more space than what they were given. Edge Of The World, which was released under the Mogg/Way moniker for legal reasons barely gets a paragraph. Chocolate Box at least got 3 pages. I felt they deserved as much space as any other UFO album, which in truth is what they were. The other albums all rate an entire chapter. There's also info on the recordings of Michael Schenker, Waysted, Paul Raymond Project, etc.Unfortunately, unlike Martin's other books, there are no photos outside of black and white copies of album covers. There are a lot of great stories about the band in the studio and on the road. Popoff uses quotes from articles and interviews by others, and also conducted numerous interviews of his own. Unfortunately he was unable to interview Phil Mogg for this work. There is still some fantastic stories and anecdotes and you will find yourself rereading this again and again. Grab this book along with theToo Hot to HandleDVD, which contains some great interviews and concert footage. If you're into UFO, it's essential!"},{"Title":"UFO: Shoot Out The Lights","review":"I really like this book quite a bit, but I think I would enjoy it more if I was a bigger UFO fan. I think one of the reasons I like Popoff's books about Blue Oyster Cult and Rush so much is that I am a huge fan of both of those groups, and have all of their albums and know all of their songs. I can't say the same about UFO. I have all of their albums up until Making Contact and only one after that, Walk On Water. I realize now that my all time favorite era of UFO were the initial Michael Schenker years, from 1974 to 1978 (or '79). I recommend all of the albums from that era. None of what they have done since has really grabbed me.Okay, all of that being said (some of which had to do with the book and some of which probably did not), I still find this book a terrific read and will probably go back and read it from start to finish at least half a dozen more times. Like he did in his book about B.O.C., Popoff goes through every song and every album that UFO did, and even takes time to talk about the shoot-off bands, like Waysted and The Michael Schenker Group. Popoff has got a plethora of quotes from the band members, particularly guitarists Michael Schenker and his replacement Paul Chapman, and vocalist Phil Mogg and bassist Pete Way (though absolutely none from drummer Andy Parker). Popoff throws in his personal opinions about the albums and the songs, and though I find myself disagreeing with him more than usual (I don't share his enthusiasm for 'No Place To Run' and the MSG album 'Assault Attack'), and wish he spent more time talking about classic albums like 'Phenomenon' and 'Force It' than lesser known albums like 'No Place To Run' and 'The Wild, The Willing and the Innocent', this doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. Popoff has a very conversational and flowing writing style that makes it both fun and easy to read his books. And there is just a ton of information stuffed into this tiny book. And I'm glad to see that he includes a discography at the end, something he did not do for his B.O.C. book.Criticisms? The type is awful small, making me have to squint sometimes while reading (of course, that may have to do with the fact that I haven't updated my glasses subscription in over ten years!). And, even though he gives a good thorough explanation for his reasons for not including photos, I wish he would reconsider that stance, especially for this group. I'm sure many people might not even know what the band members look like, and there are no other books (that I'm aware of) about this group, so...yes, photos would have been nice.Back on the positive side, since reading this book, I have bought one more UFO album and two more albums by The Michael Schenker Group...and I have also gone back and gave another listen to albums like Walk on Water and Making Contact. Another thing I like is that Popoff has so many quotes and anecdotes from the members of UFO ,that by the end of the book I really felt I knew these guys as people much better. Of course, having PICTURES of them would have made me feel like I knew them better, but I already complained about that earlier. And it does include ONE picture of the group, which is one more than shown in the B.O.C. book.Overall, this is a great book!"},{"Title":"UFO: Shoot Out The Lights","review":"Martin Popoff has done it once again as he turns in a great read with Shoot Out The Lights. Everything you wanted to know about this classic British band is in Martin's book. There are a lot of fantastic insightful interviews with all the main players and no subject of the bands colorful history is left out. You've got detailed discographies and coverage of the band's side projects such as Waysted and MSG as well, so what are you waiting for? Go and get a copy of this book."},{"Title":"UFO: Shoot Out The Lights","review":"After enjoying his various heavy metal review books, I was thrilled to learn that Martin Popoff had a book on UFO available. As he mentions in the prologue, this is less a bio and more an oral history of the creation of each album. Many great, funny stories emerge, as well as the details of how each album was created. Just about every current and former member is involved, with plenty of emphasis on the Schenker years (classic and reformation), as well as the Chapman and Atomic Tommy eras. The book is a blast from start to finish, and now I\`m looking forward to getting Martin\`s Rainbow book. Highly recommended to all UFO/Schenker fans!"},{"Title":"UFO: Shoot Out The Lights","review":"This is perhaps the best of Popoff's critical biographies of rock bands (e.g., Rush, Rainbow, BOC). Full of detail and insider antecedotes, the book is a fast and entertaining look at UFO's progression over 4 decades. The material is extremely current and draws upon the recollections and perspectives of almost everyone who has been in the band. The only criticism I have is that Popoff seems too quick to write off the band's mid 80s to early 90s work. I recommend this if you are either looking for an introduction to this interesting group or if you are long-time fan. It is well-worth seeking out.."},{"Title":"UFO: Shoot Out The Lights","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT.

An enjoyable and gripping novel overall."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"I also salute the author's contribution in WWII. However, \\"The Pilots\\" is just too disjointed and -- quite frankly -- predictable to recommend. Apparently much of the book was written as short stories, which is fine. But there should have been some effort to edit these into a seamless whole, rather than just slap them together between covers. As a result, we often hear the same bits of information over and over. Trust me, Mr. Spencer, by page 228 we KNOW that \\"Blake Hurlingame was Steve's boyhood friend who now flies B-24s!\\" And too many of the incidents were telegraphed far in advance. When Addie finds the .45 automatic in her nightstand drawer, we KNOW she's going to need it in just a few pages! On the plus side, some of the flying sequences were quite enjoyable. There just weren't enough of them. It seems to me that if you're writing a novel about combat flying in WWII, you pretty much know who your audience will be. And it's not women. Therefore, I would suggest cutting down on the \\"romance\\" and jacking up the action. Just one guy's opinion. Still, it's a quick, painless read and flying novels are hard to find.(By the way, one positive: The new trade paperback edition has the appropriate P-38 on the cover.)"},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"This is just a super book. Well written, warm, and yet frightening in its description of combat flying. Jim Spencer has a wonderful way of getting into the stories and making them real for us. Having lived just a bit of that life (USMC pilot)I felt in the cockpit and in the ready room with Jim. The out of combat R&amp;R in Australia was just the right tone, and the craziness that permeates everything was right on.All the guys I know would love this book. There is hardly a pilot alive or that has lived that has not dreamed of air-to-air combat. This is a piece of that dream."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},j={key:1};function H(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",q,[(e(!0),t(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const C=d(A,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-c718c2f4"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/13.md","filePath":"quotesmag/13.md"}'),O={name:"quotesmag/13.md"},P=Object.assign(O,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(C)]))}});export{E as __pageData,P as default};
