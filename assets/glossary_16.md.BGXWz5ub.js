Handling the press seems to be no problem, but when a rising star in the company is killed during the performance--dropped from thirty feet above the stage, crashing to her death in a perfect fifth position--Sargent has a real case on his hands. As he ingratiates himself with the players behind the scenes (especially one lovely young ballerina), he finds that this seemingly graceful ballet company is performing their most dramatic acts behind the curtain. There are sharp rivalries, sordid affairs, and shady characters. Sargent, though, has no trouble staying on point and proving that the ballerina killer is no match for his keen eye and raffish charm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DdY4u2J5N5YC&dq=Death+in+the+Fifth+Position&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sense of the Call: a Sabbath Way of Life for Those Who Serve God, the Church, and the World","description":"In \\"Keeping the Sabbath Wholly,\\" Dawn introduced the vital Sabbath aspects of resting, ceasing, feasting, and embracing.

They are the very simplest things, and because it takes a man's life to know them the little new that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave. In the winter of 1933, Ernest Hemingway and his wife Pauline set out on a two-month safari in the big-game country of East Africa, camping out on the great Serengeti Plain at the foot of magnificent Mount Kilimanjaro.  I had quite a trip,  the author told his friend Philip Percival, with characteristic understatement. Green Hills of Africa is Hemingway's account of that expedition, of what it taught him about Africa and himself. Richly evocative of the region's natural beauty, tremendously alive to its character, culture, and customs, and pregnant with a hard-won wisdom gained from the extraordinary situations it describes, it is widely held to be one of the twentieth century's classic travelogues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZdFQAQAAQBAJ&dq=Hemingway+in+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down The River","description":"Down the River is a collection of essays both timeless and timely.

At the same time, it is an impassioned condemnation of what is being done to our natural heritage in the name of progress, profit, and security. Filled with fiery dawns, wild and shining rivers, and radiant sandstone canyons, it is charged as well with heartfelt, rampageous rage at human greed, blindness, and folly.

It's for any of us who want to understand one of the most important forces shaping American life. How did America's government become so much more conservative in just a generation? Compared to Europe-or to America under Richard Nixon-even President Howard Dean would preside over a distinctly more conservative nation in many crucial respects: welfare is gone; the death penalty is deeply rooted; abortion is under siege; regulations are being rolled back; the pillars of New Deal liberalism are turning to sand. Conservative positions have not prevailed everywhere, of course, but this book shows us why they've been so successfully advanced over such a broad front: because the battle has been waged by well-organized, shrewd, and committed troops who to some extent have been lucky in their enemies. John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, like modern-day Tocquevilles, have the perspective to see this vast subject in the round, unbeholden to forces on either side. They steer The Economist's coverage of the United States and have unrivaled access to resources and-because of the magazine's renown for iconoclasm and analytical rigor-have had open-door access wherever the book's research has led them. And it has led them everywhere: To reckon with the American right, you have to get out there where its centers are and understand the power flow among the brain trusts, the mouthpieces, the organizers, and the foot soldiers. The authors write with wit and skewer whole herds of sacred cows, but they also bring empathy to bear on a subject that sees all too little of it. You won't recognize this America from the far-left's or the far-right's caricatures. Divided into three parts-history, anatomy, and prophecy-The Right Nation comes neither to bury the American conservative movement nor to praise it blindly but to understand it, in all its dimensions, as the most powerful and effective political movement of our age. Chapter One FROM KENNEBUNKPORT TO CRAWFORD Sir Lewis Namier, the great historian of English politics in the age of George III, once remarked that \\"English history, and especially English parliamentary history, is made by families rather than individuals.\\" The same could be said of American political history, especially in the age of George I and George II. There is no better introduction to the radical transformation of Republicanism in the past generation-from patrician to populist, from Northeastern to Southwestern, from pragmatic to ideological-than the radical transformation of Republicanism's current leading family, the Bushes. Grandfather Prescott The Bushes began political life as classic establishment Republicans: WASPs who summered in Kennebunkport, educated their children at boarding schools and the Ivy League and claimed family ties to the British royal family (Queen Elizabeth II is the thirteenth cousin of the first President Bush). George W.'s paternal great-grandfather, Samuel P. Bush, was a steel and railroad executive who became the first president of the National Association of Manufacturers and a founding member of the United States Chamber of Commerce. His maternal great-grandfather, George Herbert Walker, was even grander. The cofounder of W. A. Harriman, Wall Street's oldest private investment bank, Walker's stature was summed up by his twin Manhattan addresses: his office at One Wall Street and his home at One Sutton Place. There was certainly muck beneath this brass: both Walker and Bush had their share of Wall Street shenanigans and cozy government deals, but in the age...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ho9PEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Right+Nation:+Conservative+Power+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Generation Divided: German Children and the Berlin Wall","description":"An inquiry into the lives of children of similar, if not identical, historical an cultural heritage who today find themselves in radically opposed ideological worlds, regarding one another across the concrete manifestation of their considerable differences, the Berlin Wall. Under these circumstances, what are the significant factors that contribute to the development in children of feelings of loyalty to or alienation from their nation? How do they view not only themselves, but the \\"other\\" Germans as well? How do they come to terms, emotionally and cognitively, with a unique, frequently painful, and frustrating reality? What are the lessons intended for them by their societies, and what lessons do they in fact learn? How do these children persist as Germans while at the same time becoming something else -- \\"communists? or \\"capitalists\\"? Thomas Davey conducted interviews with children both sides of the Wall, participated in their daily lives, collected their drawings, talked with their teachers and families and grew aware of just how attentive children can be to moral and political subtleties of national life. The result is a revealing and dramatic portrait of a young generation coming to terms with complex national and historical circumstances of the two cites of East and West Berlin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mQnqMzDMPFAC&dq=A+Generation+Divided:+German+Children+and+the+Berlin+Wall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's cook with Gail","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NYHVnQEACAAJ&dq=Let%27s+cook+with+Gail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Applied Sport Psychology: Personal Growth to Peak Performance","description":"Applied Sport Psychology was written to introduce readers to psychological theories and techniques that can be used to enhance performance and personal growth of sport participants from youth to elite levels.

In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Lanny Budd s financial acumen and his marriage into great wealth enable him to continue the lifestyle he has always enjoyed. But the devastation the collapse has wrought on ordinary citizens has only strengthened Lanny s socialist ideals much to the chagrin of his heiress wife, Irma, a confirmed capitalist. In Germany to visit relatives, Lanny encounters a disturbing atmosphere of hatred and jingoism. His concern over the growing popularity of the Nazi Party escalates when he meets Adolf Hitler, the group s fanatical leader, and the members of his inner circle. But Lanny s gravest fear is the threat a national socialist government poses to the German Jewish family of Hansi, the musician husband of Lanny s sister, Bess a threat that will impel the international art dealer to risk his wealth, his future, even his life in a courageous attempt to rescue his loved ones from a terrible fate. Winner of the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Dragon s Teeth brilliantly captures the nightmarish march toward the Second World War.

Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American individualism","description":"In this book, Hoover expounds and vigorously defends what has come to be called American exceptionalism: the set of beliefs and values that still makes America unique.

Once hailed as a \\"wonder borough\\" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became--during the 1960s and 1970s--a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history. From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bkurAgAAQBAJ&dq=Electronic+and+Online+Publishing+(By+the+Numbers)+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silence of the Spheres: The Deaf Experience in the History of Science","description":"A deaf scientist, who teaches deaf physics students, writes about deaf people throughout history who overcame negative attitudes to contribute significantly to various fields of science.

Following in the footsteps of Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, Bekoff has spent the last 30 years studying animals of every stripe--from coyotes in Wyoming to penguins in Antarctica. He draws on this vast experience, as well as on the observations of other naturalists, to offer readers fascinating stories of animal behavior, including grooming and gossip, self-medication, feeding patterns, dreaming, dominance, and mating behavior. Many of these stories are truly incredible--chimpanzees medicating themselves with herbal remedies, elephants clearly mourning a dead group member--but this is not simply a catalog of amazing animal tales, for Bekoff also sheds light on many of the more serious issues surrounding animals. He offers a thought-provoking look at animal cognition, intelligence, and consciousness and he presents vivid examples of animal passions, highlighting the deep emotional lives of our animal kin. All this serves as background for his thoughtful conclusions about humility and animal protection and animal well-being, where he urges a new paradigm of respect, grace, compassion, and love for all animals. Marc Bekoff has gone deep into the minds, hearts, spirits, and souls of animals, giving him profound insight into their lives, and no small insight into ours. Minding Animals is an important contribution to our understanding of animal consciousness, a major work that will be a must read for anyone who loves nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hevhW5lvEBsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This is My House: Wisdom, motivation and inspiration for the home owner planning a renovation","description":"This is My House is the inspirational street guide for anyone preparing for a home renovation, written by a Professional Engineer who has lived it.With over twenty years of Structural & Forensic Engineering experience, Eric W.

He tells of the many rejoicings in Europe over the successes of the Crusaders in A.D. 1221. But little did Europe know that two decades later, the Mongol hordes organized by Genghis Khan would turn the Middle East into a heap of ruins and spread terror throughout the West. A work of enduring scholarship and literary excellence, The Mongol Empire is a classic on the rise and fall of the world's largest empire. It describes the incredible ascent of the Mongol people, which, through the political and military genius of Genghis Khan, overwhelmed and subdued the nations of most of the world. It demonstrates the transformation of barbarous nomads into the most efficient rulers of their time and describes the crumbling of their vast empire and the assumption of its legacy by the formerly subjugated China and Russia. Maurice Collis in Time and Tide said of The Mongol Empire: \\"It has the rare merit of being both scholarly and exciting...The entire world comes on to his canvas, romantic and fantastical persons pass in our view, and at the conclusion we realize that we have seen the whole of what Marco Polo saw only in part. \\" while The Observer commented, \\"it is a fine book, full of dramatic occasion well used, clear in proportions.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_m5QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Janice VanCleave's 201 Awesome, Magical, Bizarre, & Incredible Experiments (Science for Every Kid)","description":"How do honeybees find their way home?

Angela Davis is herself a woman of undeniable courage. She should be heard.  The New York Times Angela Davis provides a powerful history of the social and political influence of whiteness and elitism in feminism, from abolitionist days to the present, and demonstrates how the racist and classist biases of its leaders inevitably hampered any collective ambitions. While Black women were aided by some activists like Sarah and Angelina Grimke and the suffrage cause found unwavering support in Frederick Douglass, many women played on the fears of white supremacists for political gain rather than take an intersectional approach to liberation. Here, Davis not only contextualizes the legacy and pitfalls of civil and women s rights activists, but also discusses Communist women, the murder of Emmitt Till, and Margaret Sanger s racism. Davis shows readers how the inequalities between Black and white women influence the contemporary issues of rape, reproductive freedom, housework and child care in this bold and indispensable work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=74QzFiv1w10C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ink Of Heaven","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S9NUAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Ink+Of+Heaven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parametric Modeling with Mechanical Desktop 6","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G6p0swEACAAJ&dq=Parametric+Modeling+with+Mechanical+Desktop+6&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Garden of Roman Verse (Getty Trust Publications: J.

Ella is nearing thirty, and not yet living the life she imagined. Her artistic ambitions as a student in Minnesota have given way to an unintended career in caregiving. One spring, Bryn--a retired carpenter--hires her to help him care for Jill, his wife of many years. A car accident caused a brain injury that has left Jill verbally diminished; she moves about the house like a ghost of her former self, often able to utter, like an incantation, only the words that comprise this novel's title. As Ella is drawn ever deeper into the couple's household, her presence unwanted but wholly necessary, she is profoundly moved by the tenderness Bryn shows toward the wife he still fiercely loves. Ella is startled by the yearning this awakens in her, one that complicates her feelings for her girlfriend, Alix, and causes her to look at relationships of all kinds--between partners, between employer and employee, and above all between men and women--in new ways. Tightly woven, humane and insightful, tracing unflinchingly the most intimate reaches of a young woman's heart and mind, Say Say Say is a riveting story about what it means to love, in a world where time is always running out.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QoNyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dorothy Day: Portraits by Those Who Knew Her","description":"A unique and intimate biographical celebration of a radical saint for our times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gEbZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dorothy+Day:+Portraits+by+Those+Who+Knew+Her&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"He's Got the Whole World in His Pants","description":"A humorous collection of music's most widely misunderstood lyrics, from traditional folk songs to cutting-edge rock.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qYe-PAAACAAJ&dq=He%27s+Got+the+Whole+World+in+His+Pants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Longest War: The Iran-Iraq Military Conflict","description":"In The Longest War, Dilip Hiro describes the causes and courses of the Iran-Iraq military conflict and its effect on the two antagonists, as well as the rest of the world.

What happened to the Allied armies in Normandy in the months after D-Day, 1944? Why, after the initial success of the landings, did their advance stall a few miles inland from the beaches? Why did the British take so long to capture Caen? Why did the US infantry struggle so much in the bocage south of Omaha beach? Who was right about the conduct of the land campaign - Eisenhower or Montgomery? How did the Germans, deprived of air support, manage to hold off such a massive Allied force for more than two months? And if Enigma was allowing the Allies to read German battleplans, why did things go wrong as often as they did? THE BATTLE OF NORMANDY re-examines the demands and difficulties of the campaign and sheds new light on both with the aid of accounts from veterans on both sides. (Oral history forms a large part of the book.) It also analyses in detail the plans and performance of the commanders involved: Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Montgomery, Crerar and, of course, Rommel. Controversial and at times catastrophic, the Battle of Normandy was the last great set-piece battle in history and is long overdue for reassessment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hA6AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Cooking Today","description":"Everyone's favorite cooking expert Betty Crocker has completely revised and updated the perennial favorite, Betty Crocker's Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Cooking Today, with updated information about fat and cholesterol, and lots of easy-to-understand tips for establishing a healthy eating lifestyle.

This original study challenges Orientalist text-based scholarship, which has overlooked these lived practices of Tibetan dialectics. Kenneth Liberman brings these dynamic disputations to life for the modern reader through a richly detailed, turn-by-turn analysis of the monks' formal philosophical reasoning. He argues that Tibetan Buddhists deliberately organize their debates into formal structures that both empower and constrain thinking, skillfully using logic as an interactional tool to organize their reflections. During his three years in residence at Tibetan monastic universities, Liberman observed and videotaped the monks' debates. He then transcribed, translated, and analyzed them using multimedia software and ethnomethodological techniques, which enabled him to scrutinize the local methods that Tibetan debaters use to keep their philosophical inquiries alive. His study shows the monks rely on such indigenous dialectical methods as extending an opponent's position to its absurd consequences, \\"pulling the rug out\\" from under an opponent, and other lively strategies. This careful investigation of the formal philosophical work of Tibetan scholars is a pathbreaking analysis of an important classical tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H9O57AB42yoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiki Road Trip: A Guide to Tiki Culture in North America","description":"The 2nd edition of Tiki Road Trip has been completely updated, expanded, and globalized.

We know our actions affect the physical world we depend on, so why must we be faced with catastrophic problems--overpopulation, the loss of bio-diversity, global warming, and the like--before we act to protect the planet's ecosystem--and then often inadequately? With astute analysis Peter Seidel explores the complex convergence of psychological, social, economic, and political factors that keep us from acting in our own self-interest. An environmental and human relations visionary, Seidel proposes adoption of a new \\"world model,\\" a \\"universal ethic,\\" and long-term societal goals. Educators and journalists must give us a better understanding of ourselves-creatures evolved to function in a hunter-gatherer society, not in the complex, hazardous world we have created. We must learn to use our minds to control our primitive drives rather than to satisfy them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IojWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Invisible+Walls:+Why+We+Ignore+the+Damage+We+Inflict+on+the+Planet--And+Ourselves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cervantes: A Biography","description":"Hailed by Choice as \\"a fascinating story,\\" this profile of Cervantes will captivate both scholarly and lay readers.

Boston Herald  [A] well-researched and well-written cultural and ecological history of stubborn perseverance.  USA Today For more than four hundred years the people of coastal Maine have clung to their rocky, wind-swept lands, resisting outsiders  attempts to control them while harvesting the astonishing bounty of the Gulf of Maine. Today s independent, self-sufficient lobstermen belong to the communities imbued with a European sense of ties between land and people, but threatened by the forces of homogenization spreading up the eastern seaboard. In the tradition of William Warner s Beautiful Swimmers, veteran journalist Colin Woodard (author of American Character: A History of the Epic Struggle Between Individual Liberty and the Common Good) traces the history of the rugged fishing communities that dot the coast of Maine and the prized crustacean that has long provided their livelihood. Through forgotten wars and rebellions, and with a deep tradition of resistance to interference by people  from away,  Maine s lobstermen have defended an earlier vision of America while defying the  tragedy of the commons  the notion that people always overexploit their shared property. Instead, these icons of American individualism represent a rare example of true communal values and collaboration through grit, courage, and hard-won wisdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YEc_iQ74rkgC&dq=The+Lobster+Coast:+Rebels,+Rusticators,+and+the+Struggle+for+a+Forgotten+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rhineland 1945 (Campaign)","description":"'The last great heave of war,' according to Churchill, took place with the crossing of the Rhine in 1945.

Gunn reclaims and refurbishes elements of the pragmatic tradition that either have been lost or have undergone important changes and shows how newer critical approaches have strong roots in the pragmatic tradition. For Gunn, pragmatism is no longer concerned solely with the nature of knowledge and the meaning of truth. Because of its insistence on critical self-awareness, its opposition to closed systems of thought, and its concern with the ethical, political, and practical contexts of ideas, pragmatism offers a blueprint for performing intellectual work in a world without absolutes. The world Gunn's pragmatism recognizes is one of multiple truths, unstable interpretations, and competing interests. After critically reexamining the nature and scope of the pragmatic legacy, Gunn explores the way pragmatism successfully responds to conceptual and methodological controversies, from the rebirth of ideology, the spread of interdisciplinarity, and the development of the new historicism, to the revolt against theory, the erosion of public discourse, and the problematics of American civil religion. Drawing throughout on the work of William James, Henry James, Sr., John Dewey, Kenneth Burke, W. E. B. Du Bois, Richard Poirier, Stanley Cavell, Clifford Geertz, Frank Lentricchia, Richard Rorty, Richard J. Bernstein, and others, Gunn shows that pragmatism, because it offers a way of thinking across the categories of modern intellectual specializations, is located at the intersection of these critical, and often competitive, discourses. The postmodern challenge for the pragmatist thinker is not only how to render these different discourses conversible with one another, but how to turn the salient insights of each into elements of a new democratic and critical public culture, one able to counter the twin threats of ideology and solipsism. Giles Gunn is one of our most acclaimed contemporary critics, and this broad and ambitious book is certain to become one of the central works in the current revival of critical pragmatism and cultural studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TpEOTIa1vg0C&dq=Thinking+Across+the+American+Grain:+Ideology,+Intellect,+and+the+New+Pragmatism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Education in Murder","description":"Nancy found herself on a flight 32,000 feet over Tennessee.

In 1914, following disagreements with the Kaiser, Moltke was dismissed from his post. This led to a great inner crisis in the General, that in turn drew him closer to Steiner. When Moltke died two years later, Steiner maintained contact with his excarnated soul, receiving communications that he passed on to Moltke's wife, Eliza. These remarkable and unique messages are reproduced here in full, together with relevant letters from the General to his wife. The various additional commentaries, essays and documents give insights to themes of continuing significance for our time, including the workings of evil; karma and reincarnation; life after death; the new millennium and the end of the last century; the hidden causes of World War I; the destiny of Europe, and the future of Rudolf Steiner's science of the spirit. Also included are Moltke's private reflections on the causes of the Great War (\\"the document that could have changed world history\\"), a key interview with Steiner for Le Matin, an introduction and notes by T. H. Meyer, and studies by J rgen von Grone, Jens Heisterkamp and Johannes Tautz.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QK_EAwAAQBAJ&dq=Veil+of+Light,+The:+The+New+Millennium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Scented Veil: Using Scent to Awaken the Soul","description":"Carly Wall has done extensive research into both the history of the use of scent and the advice on their use from the Cayce readings.

To the uninformed eye the skeletons of glittering palaces and temples would have been barely detectable in the glare of the punishing sun. French archaeologist Andre Parrot, however, was not such an oblivious passerby. Tramping through these wind-scoured wastes in the 1920s, Parrot heard, as he put it, the 'overtones' of humanity's earliest achievements, 'an orchestration of mighty names: Hammurabi, Nebuchadnezzar,' that evoked for him not only such giants of ancient history but also whole scenes out of the Bible. On a scorching day in January 1934, on a mound called Tell Hariri in Syria, a dozen miles from the Iraqi border, he gazed down at the small white statue he cradled in his hands and saw in it affirmation that all the travail had been worthwhile.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9KJ_PwAACAAJ&dq=Mesopotamia:+The+Mighty+Kings+(Lost+Civilizations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Loren To Marimar: The Philippine Media in the 1990s","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mj9iAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+Loren+To+Marimar:+The+Philippine+Media+in+the+1990s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ENEMY AT HIS PLEASURE: A JOURNEY THROUGH THE JEWISH PALE OF SETTLEMENT DURING WORLD WAR I","description":"The Jewish World War I journalist and politician traces his four-year endeavor to raise funds, lobby, and bring relief supplies to Jewish towns ravaged by the warring Russian, German, and Austrian armies.

What she got was the one call she had never wanted, and didn't expect. As the snow continued to fall, Kate's mind drifted back, to the moment when she and Joe first met. She had been just seventeen and he was young, powerful, dazzling, and different from any man she'd ever known. It was just days before Christmas, 1940. The war is raging in Europe when Kate Jamison makes her debut in New York City. In a room filled with the scions of East Coast society and the leading political figures of the day, it is Joe Allbright who catches Kate's eye. At twenty-nine, Joe is the brilliant protege of Charles Lindbergh, and already a legend in flying circles for his record-breaking speed and state-of-the-art airplane designs. All Kate sees is a tall, strikingly handsome man who seems at once awkward and larger-than-life, like a shining star- just out of reach. Joe, too, is caught off balance by his response to Kate, seeing in this beautiful young woman vitality and youth, the lifelong soulmate he never expected to find. As the months pass, they will meet again, forging a bond that will set the course of both their lives. Kate will go off to study at Radcliffe. Joe will skyrocket to fame in modern aviation. Joe's planes are his life, his passion. But irresistably drawn to her, moth moth to flame, he always comes back to Kate. Even after the long dark years of World War II, when Kate was sure she had finally lost him completely, Joe returns. Never willing to stay, always needing to fly away. As planes are for him, Joe is the passion in her life. When the war is over, at twenty-four Kate wants marriage and a family. Joes wants the world, his limitless horizon, and the unique aviation empire he is building. Unwilling to wait any longer, Kate moves on with her life. But when a chance encounter brings them together again, the time has finally come to make a choice, one that will have profound consequences for them both for the rest of their lives. Against a vivid backdrop of war and thrilling innovation, Danielle Steel breaths life into history, weaving an intensely human story that spans three decades, of two intensely different people who, in spite of themselves, are irrevocably woven into the fabric of each other's lives. With rare insight and emotional power, she brings to life a tale of unconditional love, sacrifice, and compromise. The joinging of two remarkable halves into a single far more powerful whole. It is a novel of extraordinary grace and compassion from a master storyteller, perhaps the best story she has told.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GcjoTjyKZZkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tipsy Marsh: The Story of a Woman","description":"Tipsy Marsh is the story of a woman who battles against the odds in a man s world the stark, harsh world of the Australian bush in the pioneering gold-mining days.

Joe Maddy came to Interlochen, Michigan in 1928 to found the first national summer music camp. A Professor of Music at the University of Michigan, he was short on financial support, but not on enthusiasm and skill. In 1961 the music camp was reorganized as the year  round Interlochen Arts Academy.... The activities at Interlochen now embrace art, drama, dance, and other academic subjects, but the teaching of music remains the primary purpose.

Therefore the spatial and economical externalities of one of the stepchildren of the urban planning should be examined. To show the economic backgrounds the market developments will be described from the demand and support side. How do societal, technological and time changing factors or processes like concentration, globalisation and privatisation determine the development of the entertainment market? According to the changed demands, the market has produced constantly new forms of leisure time facilities. But only a certain number of types like musical theatres or leisure parks has a spatial importance because of its amount and size. But the main focus keeps on Urban Entertainment Center as the new generation of those facilities. A short introduction into the history and the main appearances should help to define this almost inflationary used term. Emphasising the differences concerning the major components and the location the influence of UECs to processes like suburbanisation will be discussed. The core of this work is concentrating the externalities within the urban development in the fields of the city structure, local economy as well as traffic issues and how planners and politicians could handle the phenomenon of Urban Entertainment Center.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FHhqrTjhNwQC&dq=Developing+Urban+Entertainment+Centers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels In America Part 1: Millennium Approaches","description":"\\"ANGELS IN AMERICA has proved to be a watershed drama, the most lyrical and ambitious augury of an era since Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie.\\" John Lahr, The New Yorker \\"The most influential American play of the last two decades.\\" Patrick Healy, The New York Times \\"Daring and dazzling!

For five years, no American runner could beat him at any distance over a mile. But at the age of 24, with his best years still ahead, long-distance runner Steve Prefontaine finally lost. Driving alone at night after a party, Prefontaine crashed his sports car, putting a tragic, shocking end to the life and career of one of the most influential, accomplished runners of our time. More than 20 years later, Pre continues to influence the running world. From his humble origins in Coos Bay, Oregon, Pre became the first person to win four NCAA titles in one event. Year after year, he was virtually unbeatable. Instead of becoming one of the new breed of professional track athletes, Pre chose to stay amateur and fight for the adequate funding he felt American amateur athletes deserved. A man of incredible desire and energy, Pre trained relentlessly. In his drive to be the best, he spurred others to do their best. As one racer said, \\"He ran every race as if it were his last.\\" But Pre not only touched runners; his exciting technique as well as his maverick lifestyle made him a favorite of the fans. A race with Prefontaine in it was automatically an event. His brief but brilliant life documented by author Tom Jordan is the tale of a true American hero. This is his story. \\"Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run. I like to make people stop and say, 'I've never seen anyone run like that before.' It's more than just a race, it's style. It's doing something better than anyone else.

The work illustrates the agonizing search that young men undergo to understand the loves that make them who, and what, they are. It describes the conflicts with nature that help men to understand the world and the battles within them that color their actions. Men are loathe to risk heart, soul, and body by opening themselves up and canvassing the world around them with the art and poetry that flow through them. This work makes known the disjointed, difficult to understand, and vague thinking that lead men through their journeys. The work's gallant mission is to paint for women what men cannot; the wondrous art that exist in men's thoughts. The hope is that as our society struggles to redefine the role of man within it, The Truth About Me will add to the body of understanding driving the evolution of men in our culture. The work is an assemply of poetry and prose written during the middle and high school years of the author. It purposely retains the flow, style, and feel constructed at the time of the writing. To be clear, these are the thoughts that existed within a man's man moving through the world in silence of what was battling within him. The author is reflecting on the world of violence, sex, poverty, destruction, longing, and fear that exists within a young man fighting the world alone. Know for certain that the young teenage men in your life have poetry and prose that is even deeper, more beautiful, and even more heart-wrenching than that presented within this work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IGfAiYc4wYMC&dq=The+Truth+About+Me:+Thoughts+of+a+Lost+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Odds against tomorrow","description":"NEW YORK CITY, the near future: Mitchell Zukor, a gifted young mathematician, is hired by a mysterious new financial consulting firm, FutureWorld.

As Clive Barnes wrote, \\"Time catches up with genius. . . . \\"Waiting for Godot\\" is one of the masterpieces of the century.\\" The story revolves around two seemingly homeless men waiting for someone--or something--named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree, inhabiting a drama spun of their own consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes, and nonsense, which has been interpreted as mankind's inexhaustible search for meaning. Beckett's language pioneered an expressionistic minimalism that captured the existential post- World War II Europe. His play remains one of the most magical and beautiful allegories of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KGSttwEACAAJ&dq=Waiting+for+Godot,+(French%27s+acting+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trophy Hunt: A Joe Pickett Novel","description":"In this thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling Joe Pickett series, the Wyoming game warden is up against a vicious killer who's more beast than man...

One of Atisha's main accomplishments in Tibet was his writing of the seminal text, A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, in which he extracted the essence of all 84,000 teachings of the Buddha and organized them into a clear, step-like arrangement that makes it easy for any individual practitioner to understand and practice the Dharma. This genre of teachings is known as lam-rim, or steps of the path, and forms an essential part of every school of Tibetan Buddhism. In this book, His Holiness the Dalai Lama gives a commentary to not only Atisha's revolutionary work but also to Lines of Experience, a short text written by Lama Tsongkhapa, who was perhaps the greatest of all Tibetan lam-rim authors. In bringing together Atisha, Lama Tsongkhapa and His Holiness the Dalai Lama, this book offers readers one of the clearest and most authoritative expositions of the Tibetan Buddhist path ever published, and it is recommended for those at the beginning of the path, the middle and the end. This book is made possible by kind supporters of the Archive who, like you, appreciate how we make these teachings freely available in so many ways, including in our website for instant reading, listening or downloading, and as printed and electronic books.

In doing so, it reaffirms that the vast majority of people do not migrate as isolated individuals, but are members of families. There is no quintessential immigrant experience, as immigrants and their families arrive with different levels of economic, social, and cultural resources, and must navigate various social structures that shape how they fare. Immigrant Families highlights the hierarchies and inequities between and within immigrant families created by key axes of inequality such as legal status, social class, gender, and generation. Drawing on ethnographic, demographic, and historical scholarship, the authors highlight the transnational context in which many contemporary immigrant families live, exploring how families navigate care, resources, expectations, and aspirations across borders. Ultimately, the book analyzes how dynamics at the individual, family, and community levels shape the life chances and wellbeing of immigrants and their families. As the United States turns its attention to immigration as a critical social issue, Immigrant Families encourages students, scholars, and policy makers to center family in their discussions, thereby prioritizing the human and relational element of human mobility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u9cQDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social Choice and Individual Values.

My own thinking has also evolved somewhat, although I remain far from satisfied with present formulations. The exhaustion of the first edition provides a convenient time for a selective and personal stocktaking in the form of an appended commentary entitled, 'Notes on the Theory of Social Choice, 1963, ' containing reflections on the text and its omissions and on some of the more recent literature. This form has seemed more appropriate than a revision of the original text, which has to some extent acquired a life of its own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lo2uCECV__8C&dq=Social+Choice+and+Individual+Values.+Second+Edition.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Elementary Structures of Kinship","description":"Professor L vi-Strauss s first major work, Les Structures  l mentaires de la Parent , has acquired a classic reputation since its original publication in 1949; and it has become the constant focus of academic debate about central theoretical concerns in social anthropology. It is, however, a long and difficult book for many students to read in French, and its arguments have consequently become known, even among professional anthropologists, largely through critical analysis. It was republished in a revised French edition in 1967 with a new foreword by the author, and it is this text with his further emendations that has been used in this translation. L vi-Strauss applies his intellectual powers to the perennial problem of incest, which he elucidates by means of the concept of exchange as formulated by Marcel Mauss in his famous analysis of the gift (Essai sur le don, 1925). He distinguishes two elementary modes of exchange which govern not only the conventional variety of goods and services but also the transfer of women in marriage: these are  restricted  and  generalized  exchange. With a mass of ethnographic evidence he demonstrates how the formidable intricacy of marriage customs, comprising moral and jural ideas and institutions (which appear to be essentially arbitrary), can be seen as local and historical rules of exchange. Charles L vi-Strauss traces these rules throughout a vast range of simple societies, chiefly in Australia and mainland Southeast Asia but also in the Americas, in Oceania, and in other parts of the world. To this survey he adds two extended sections on the great civilizations of China and India. He continues with a briefer consideration of the passage from elementary to complex structures, with particular reference to African societies, and concludes with a stimulating chapter on the principles of kinship, exchange as the universal basis for marriage prohibitions, and the formal relations between the sexes as part of a universe of communication. Although much of the work is technical, consisting of detailed analyses of types of social organization with which social anthropologists will be most familiar, it also contains much that will be of interest to psychologists, linguists, and philosophers, and to all who are interested in the possibility and the technique of the structural analysis of human activity. After the successes, moreover, of L vi-Strauss s subsequent books notably Structural Anthropology, Tristes Tropiques, Totemism, and The Savage Mind this new edition of the work which founded his present outstanding reputation will have additional value as a further means of contact with one of the original minds of this century. The translation has been made by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer, of the University of New England, Australia, and by Rodney Needham, of the University of Oxford. Dr. Needham also acted as general editor and supplied the work with a new general index. He is the translator of L vi-Strauss s Le Totemisme aujourd hui and author of Structure and Sentiment (1962) and numerous papers which have contributed to the recognition of Professor L vi-Strauss s work in the English-speaking world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ubsIDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HIDDEN FLORIDA KEYS AND EVERGLADES","description":"A Simon & Schuster eBook.

Drawing upon historical examples, Norman Friedman first explains how and why naval strategy differs from other kinds of military strategy and then provides a sense of the special flavor of a maritime or naval approach to national security problems. The various uses of navies are described and illustrated by extended case studies covering the last quarter-millennium. Friedman presents these observations in the context of U.S. post-Cold War security concerns and concepts. He explains how and why the United States currently espouses a maritime strategy and argues that navies are likely to regain a dominant position due to changes both in their own technology and in air and ground forces. He urges countries with the appropriate geographical and economic advantages, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia, to use their inherent maritime leverage. Rare among books on naval strategy, this work combines an examination of the vital role of coalition partners, especially those with significant ground forces, with a comprehensive survey of relevant technology and the way that strategy can be reflected in the design of an evolving fleet. The author is known for his ability to explain modern technology to lay audiences, and his book is suitable for all those interested in public policy questions as well as national security professionals and students of strategy. The book's publication at a time of potential change in U.S. national strategy only reinforces its value as a document worthy of study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7jHIwAEACAAJ&dq=Seapower+as+Strategy:+Navies+and+National+Interests&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maximum Energy: Top Ten Health Strategies to Feel Great, Live Longer and Enjoy Life","description":"These dynamic health keys present a strategic energy advantage that will make a clear and unmistakable difference in one's vitality and quality of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=87J4EJX7x0QC&dq=Maximum+Energy:+Top+Ten+Health+Strategies+to+Feel+Great,+Live+Longer+and+Enjoy+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This is My World: the Life of Helen Martins, Creator of the Owl House","description":"An illustrated biography of Helen Martins, creator of the Owl House in Nieu Bethesda, one of South Africa's foremost examples of Outsider art.

While work in this field remains quite active, the time has come to collect under one cover spanning tree properties, classical results, and recent research developments. Spanning Trees and Optimization Problems offers the first complete treatment of spanning tree algorithms, from their role in classical computer science to their most modern applications. The authors first explain the general properties of spanning trees, then focus on three main categories: minimum spanning trees, shortest-paths trees, and minimum routing cost spanning trees. Along with the theoretical descriptions of the methods, numerous examples and applications illustrate the concepts in practice. The final chapter explores several other interesting spanning trees, including maximum leaf spanning trees, minimum diameter spanning trees, Steiner trees, and evolutionary trees. With logical organization, well chosen topics, and easy to understand pseudocode, the authors provide not only a full, rigorous treatment of theory and applications, but also an excellent handbook for spanning tree algorithms.

For them, perhaps, it is worth the cost. But when tragedy strikes, what happens to the people left behind? Why would anyone choose to invest in a future with a high-altitude risk-taker? What is life like in the shadow of the mountain? Such questions have long been taboo in the world of mountaineering. Now, the spouses, parents and children of internationally renowned climbers finally break their silence, speaking out about the dark side of adventure. Maria Coffey confronted one of the harshest realities of mountaineering when her partner Joe Tasker disappeared on the Northeast Ridge of Everest in 1982. In Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow, Coffey offers an intimate portrait of adventure and the conflicting beauty, passion, and devastation of this alluring obsession. Through interviews with the world's top climbers, or their widows and families-Jim Wickwire, Conrad Anker, Lynn Hill, Joe Simpson, Chris Bonington, Ed Viesturs, Anatoli Boukreev, Alex Lowe, and many others-she explores what compels men and women to give their lives to the high mountains. She asks why, despite the countless tragedies, the world continues to laud their exploits. With an insider's understanding, Coffey reveals the consequences of loving people who pursue such risk-the exhilarating highs and inevitable lows, the stress of long separations, the constant threat of bereavement, and the lives shattered in the wake of climbing accidents. Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow is a powerful, affecting and important book that exposes the far reaching personal costs of extreme adventure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y52JVH9KSFAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Further Adventures of Nils","description":"Selfish and lazy, fourteen-year-old Nils learns kindness and wisdom after he is bewitched into an elf-sized boy and carried off by a barnyard goose to join the migration of wild geese across Sweden to Lapland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_b6MAAACAAJ&dq=The+Further+Adventures+of+Nils&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Satori and the New Mandarins","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7IUAPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Satori+and+the+New+Mandarins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Amante De Lady Chatterley / Lady Chatterley's Lover (Spanish Edition)","description":"Banned, burned, and the subject of a landmark obscenity trial, Lawrence's lyric and sensual last novel is now regarded as \\"our time's most significant romance.\\" -- \\"The New York Times. \\"This classic tale of love and discovery pits the paralyzed and callous Clifford Chatterley against his indecisive wife and her persuasive lover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eDnzjgEACAAJ&dq=El+Amante+De+Lady+Chatterley+/+Lady+Chatterley%27s+Lover+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Modern World (Classics of Western Thought Series, Volume III)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pVg8zwEACAAJ&dq=The+Modern+World+(Classics+of+Western+Thought+Series,+Volume+III)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghost Stories from the American South (American Storytelling)","description":"Collects Southern legends and folk tales about haunted houses, supernatural events, and the appearances of ghosts","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mOCvWe5iRh8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arts of the Amazon (Braun, Barbara)","description":"Describes and illustrates examples of the arts produced by Indians of the Amazon rain forest, including both ceremonial and utilitarian objects ranging from feather headdresses and body ornaments to ceramic sculptures and fine basketry","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NHFhQgAACAAJ&dq=Arts+of+the+Amazon+(Braun,+Barbara)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The vision and the way: An interpretation of Jewish ethics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D_rwMAAACAAJ&dq=The+vision+and+the+way:+An+interpretation+of+Jewish+ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trapp's War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Eg2aHAAACAAJ&dq=Trapp%27s+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seals Top Secret: Operation Shell Game (Seals Top Secret, 4)","description":"An  infuriating, fast-paced  (The Washington Post) account of the Navy SEALs of Alpha platoon, the startling accusations against their chief, Eddie Gallagher, and the courtroom battle that exposed the dark underbelly of America s special forces from a Pulitzer Prizewinning reporter WINNER OF THE COLORADO BOOK AWARD ?  Nearly impossible to put down.  Jon Krakauer, New York Times bestselling author of Where Men Win Glory and Into the Wild In this  brilliantly written  (The New York Times Book Review) and startling account, Pulitzer Prizewinning New York Times correspondent David Philipps reveals a powerful moral crucible, one that would define the American military during the years of combat that became known as  the forever war.  When the Navy SEALs of Alpha platoon returned from their 2017 deployment to Iraq, a group of them reported their chief, Eddie Gallagher, for war crimes, alleging that he d stabbed a prisoner in cold blood and taken lethal sniper shots at unarmed civilians. The story of Alpha s war, both in Iraq and in the shocking trial that followed the men s accusations, would complicate the SEALs  post-9/11 hero narrative, turning brothers-in-arms against one another and bringing into stark relief the choice that elite soldiers face between loyalty to their unit and to their country. One of the great stories written about American special forces, Alpha is by turns a battlefield drama, a courtroom thriller, and a compelling examination of how soldiers define themselves and live with the decisions in the heat of combat.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t2IkEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamtime: A Collection of Short Stories","description":"Dreamtime: A Collection of Short Stories dissects a wide range of social problems by merging realism with fantasy and the supernatural.

But for most Canadians, the CBC is not its backroom movers and shakers, nor even its boardroom masters. The CBC is its programs and its stars. And now Nash has written their book. Based on interviews with more than 120 performers, producers, and behind-the-scenes players, Cue the Elephant is packed to the covers with revelations and surprising anecdotes that range from the serious to the plain ridiculous, from the hilarious to the very poignant. Goofs, gossip, peeves, and rivalries sprinkle the pages as Nash relates hundreds of memorable incidents: Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau changing his baby s diaper backstage at  Front Page Challenge ; the professional battles between Wayne and Shuster; Juliette s struggle to keep cameramen from  shooting up her nose ; Tommy Hunter s fights with producers; announcer Allan McFee s creative use of a can of asparagus and his attempt to asphyxiate a producer; Barbara Frum s devotion to her messy dog, Diva; Peter Mansbridge s worry about going bald; and the long-mysterious expense account acronym PACR, which was finally discovered to stand for Pissed Away, Can t Remember. Whether you re curious about the real reason for the cancellation of  Front Page Challenge,   The Beachcombers,  and  Street Legal,  or want to know what Anne Murray, Gordon Pinsent, and Cynthia Dale are really like, Cue the Elephant provides an engrossing, funny, and nostalgic look at the stars of the CBC  from the radio days of Foster Hewitt, the Happy Gang, and Rawhide to the current hit television shows.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p-phNgAACAAJ&dq=Cue+the+Elephant:+Backstage+Tales+at+the+CBC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family (All Four Collector's Item Issues in One Volume)","description":"With Robin dead at the hands of the Joker, Batman must try to move on from his loss and return to being a lone crime fighter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ohqYuAAACAAJ&dq=Batman:+A+Death+in+the+Family+(All+Four+Collector%27s+Item+Issues+in+One+Volume)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For Heaven's Sake","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3xpc0JGO-7gC&dq=For+Heaven%27s+Sake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragon Wing; Volume One","description":"Wolf Haas' Detective Brenner series has become wildly popular around the world for a reason: They're timely, edgy stories told in a wry, quirky voice that's often hilarious, and with a protagonist it's hard not to love. In this episode, Brenner-forced out of the police force-tries to get away from detective work by taking a job as the personal chauffeur for two-year-old Helena, the daughter of a Munich construction giant and a Viennese abortion doctor. One day, while Brenner's attention is turned to picking out a chocolate bar for Helena at a gas station, Helena gets snatched from the car. Abruptly out of a job, Brenner decides to investigate her disappearance on his own. With both parents in the public eye, there's no scarcity of leads-the father's latest development project has spurred public protest, and the mother's clinic has been targeted by the zealous leader of an anti-abortion group. Brenner and God is told with a dark humor that leaves no character, including Brenner, unscathed. Haas tells the story of a fallible hero who can be indecisive and world-weary, baffled and disillusioned by what he finds, but who presses forward nonetheless out of a stubborn sense of decency-a two-year-old is kidnapped, so you find her, because that's just what you do.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nY1PnwEACAAJ&dq=Dragon+Wing%3B+Volume+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel Customers and Demon Customers: Discover Which is Which and Turbo-Charge Your Stock","description":"Challenges the belief that all customers are valuable, inviting companies to manage themselves as a customer portfolio in order to get the most out of critical customer segment, and citing the examples of such companies as Best Buy and Fidelity Investments. 30,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JOE0_MrxU2oC&dq=Angel+Customers+and+Demon+Customers:+Discover+Which+is+Which+and+Turbo-Charge+Your+Stock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stage Makeup","description":"The ninth edition of this classic in its field, widely considered the \\"bible of stage makeup,\\" includes new sections on film and television makeup, as well as new makeup techniques.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zKZSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Stage+Makeup&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Long Season of Rain","description":"When an orphan boy comes to live with her family, eleven-year-old Junehee begins to realize that the demands placed on Korean women can destroy their lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jxjhAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Long+Season+of+Rain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stalin vs. Me (The Bandy Papers, Vol. 9)","description":"At long last -- the ninth and final volume of the Bandy Papers, Stalin Versus Me, in which quintessential Canadian hero Bartholomew Wolfe Bandy has one final fling with death, despair, and destruction, in the final year of the Second World War. In the aftermath of the Normandy invasion, Bandy continues to bob through the ranks like a cork at sea, persecuted by one of his pilots and pursued by Gwinny, who just can't understand why her attempt to have him convicted of treason has soured their relationship. Love rears its (elegant, Belgian) head again, the King needs a man of tact and discretion for a delicate post-war job in Germany, and there's an embarrassing parcel of ladies undies to explain, not to mention just why a half-clothed Bandy (unfortunately, not the right half) is in bed with George Garanine, that lazy, loveable, failed Bandy-assassin. From Normandy to Brussels to Yalta to Moscow, Bandy's career path is as labyrinthine as ever, strewn with bottles, battles, and brasshat blood-pressure. Of most crucial concern to our hero, as 1944 draws to a close and 1945 sees the last grim push of the war beginning -- boozing pal Philby of the SIS couldn't possibly have any reason to get Bandy sent to the Yalta Conference except as a translator, right? And Stalin can't really be out to get Bandy, just because he happens to know that a certain Soviet leader was once a Tsarist agent provocateur. After all, we all know Uncle Joe isn't the type to hold a grudge. Will Bandy survive? Will he get the, er, mature, middle-aged lady (unaccountably still in love with her lazy, loveable, long-lost husband?) Will a plane be purloined?

In 1912, a young E. M. Forster traveled to India to serve as a secretary to the Maharajah of Dewas, a small Indian state. He was elevated to the rank of a minor noble, and eventually given the state s highest honor, the Tukoji Rao III gold medal. This brief episode in Forster s life became the basis for his masterwork, A Passage to India. In the letters included in The Hill of Devi, he shares his personal journey of discovering his beloved India for the first time. Forster paints a vivid, intimate picture of Dewas State a strange, bewildering, and enchanting slice of pre-independence India. In this collection, Forster shares insight into the lives of Indian royalty and accounts of the stark contrast between their excesses and the poverty he encounters. From letters that set the scene for Forster s lifelong friendship with the Maharaja, to an essay on the Maharaja himself and Forster s experiences as the Maharaja s personal secretary, The Hill of Devi is a fascinating chronicle of the author s experience in the land he called  the oddest corner of the world outside Alice in Wonderland.

Perhaps the most widely read thinker of all time, Confucius transformed Chinese philosophy with his belief that the greatest goal in life was pursuit of 'The Way': a search for virtue not as a means to rewards in this world or the next, but as the pinnacle of human existence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PpfqPt3InGoC&dq=Penguin+Great+Ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to C Programming: A Modular Approach (2nd Edition)","description":"Programming Fundamentals - A Modular Structured Approach using C++ is written by Kenneth Leroy Busbee, a faculty member at Houston Community College in Houston, Texas.

But what exactly is a rogue state? Does the concept foster a sound approach to foreign policy, or is it, in the end, no more than a counterproductive political epithet? Robert Litwak traces the origins and development of rogue state policy and then assesses its efficacy through detailed case studies of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. He shows that the policy is politically selective, inhibits the ability of U.S. policymakers to adapt to changed conditions, and has been rejected by the United States' major allies. Litwak concludes that by lumping and demonizing a disparate group of countries, the rogue state approach obscures understanding and distorts policymaking. In place of a generic and constricting strategy, he argues for the development of \\"differentiated\\" strategies of containment, tailored to the particular circumstances within individual states.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tpd_ykOXXeUC&dq=Rogue+States+and+U.S.+Foreign+Policy:+Containment+after+the+Cold+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ace: The Very Important Pig","description":"Farmer Tubbs' amazing pig, Ace of Clubs, eventually winds up on television for his cleverness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6hjhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ace:+The+Very+Important+Pig&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Proverbial Language in English Drama Exclusive of Shakespeare, 1495-1616: An Index","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oYDMndXNWlUC&dq=Proverbial+Language+in+English+Drama+Exclusive+of+Shakespeare,+1495-1616:+An+Index&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amsterdam (AAA Spiral Guides)","description":"An innovative series of pocket-size travel guides featuring lay-flat spiral bindings and full-color illustrations provides valuable information on a wide range of popular travel destinations, including recommendations for restaurants and lodging, locator maps, attractions and landmarks, shopping tips, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BPOXAAAACAAJ&dq=Amsterdam+(AAA+Spiral+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literature of Nature: An International Sourcebook","description":"Sixty-five contributions discuss historical and contemporary nature writing--nonfiction, fiction, and poetry--in the US and Canada; Europe; Asia and the Pacific; Africa and Arab nations; and Latin America.

Is warring an ancient evolutionary adaptation or a relatively recent behavior--and what does that tell us about human nature? In War, Peace, and Human Nature, editor Douglas P. Fry brings together leading experts in such fields as evolutionary biology, archaeology, anthropology, and primatology to answer fundamental questions about peace, conflict, and human nature in an evolutionary context. The chapters in this book demonstrate that humans clearly have the capacity to make war, but since war is absent in some cultures, it cannot be viewed as a human universal. And counter to frequent presumption the actual archaeological record reveals the recent emergence of war. It does not typify the ancestral type of human society, the nomadic forager band, and contrary to widespread assumptions, there is little support for the idea that war is ancient or an evolved adaptation. Views of human nature as inherently warlike stem not from the facts but from cultural views embedded in Western thinking. Drawing upon evolutionary and ecological models; the archaeological record of the origins of war; nomadic forager societies past and present; the value and limitations of primate analogies; and the evolution of agonism, including restraint; the chapters in this interdisciplinary volume refute many popular generalizations and effectively bring scientific objectivity to the culturally and historically controversial subjects of war, peace, and human nature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RnIRDAAAQBAJ&dq=War+Peace+Western+Aust&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small Dolls of the 40s and 50s Identification and Value Guide","description":"A complete remake of the popular book Ginny An American Toddler, this new version has all color photographs with many new pictures of Ginny dolls that have never been published before.

Our Modern Study Bibles have outlines for every book except the Psalms. The Two Plots Against The Lord is the fi rst and only book that provides outlines identifying the subject matter of each Psalm. Psalm 1 and 2 serve as an introduction to the entire book. Both Psalms refer to a plot to take the Lord's life. But God concealed in Psalm 1:1 that the wicked council was the Jewish Sanhedrin. Because of this plot, Psalms 3-30 present a prophetic account of the Lord's suffering, resurrection, and ascension. The plot in Psalm 2 remains unfulfi lled. This second plot is detailed in Psalms 9, 60-64, 75-83 and 90-91. Chapters 1-3 of this book make known why the Psalms are not understood and chapter 4 reveals what men have done to the Psalms which increases the diffi culty to understand them.

In the case of John Scott's Treasure of the Squeaky Wheel, the title and theme it represents is essential. This work is a rich and realistic investigation into American life during the depression years of 1930's. Scott skillfully weaves together the early foundation of an Up-State New York farm-boy, who leaves home at a young age to begin life, the struggle for survival and the ultimate maturity of this main character, named Homer. In artfully describing the travels of Homer across the continental United States, the author also depicts many other significant aspects of depression life unknown to today's generation. Besides being fun to read, and realistic, John Scott provides genius adventures and situations for the young farm-boy Homer to encounter. At times, sadness and tears fill the pages, mystery and adventure also abound throughout the book. As a reader, one becomes part of the story, engulfed by the creative style of the author. Finally, Treasure of the Squeaky Wheel by John Scott is well-written, well-plotted, informative, and very readable. I highly recommend this unique and talented piece of work to all readers. John Scott's sister, Kay Buttles, is co-author of Treasure of the Squeaky Wheel.

Fast approaching his 30's, he is an outsider observing the vibrant, frenetic, and dark lives of his small circle of friends. Deeply immersed in the drug abuse, club life, and black garbed Gothic culture; Tom's friends cling doggedly to the hedonistic pleasures of youth. Through Tom's eyes, we see their descent into darkness. We meet Tom's best friend Dre, and Kevin, a near psychotic skinhead. Both play with the idea of guns, armed robbery, and the commission of the perfect crime. We also meet Lydia, a waif-like vampire wannabe who loses herself in the numbness of drugs and the sharply exquisite pain of sadomasochism. Amidst this turmoil, Tom must choose between the two women he loves and his own desires to grow up and leave behind the frivolity of youth. Set against the backdrop of Cleveland, or Ohio's 'North Coast', the story winds through the clubs, coffee shops, and ethnically diverse neighborhoods that epitomize both the desperation of the American Midwest and the decaying morality of what was once known as the buckle of the Rust Belt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xEYPAAAACAAJ&dq=North+Coast+Gothic:+A+Grim+Fairy+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Banking in Britain: Theory, Experience and Debate 1800-1845","description":"Free banking, generically speaking, denotes a monetary system without a central bank, under which the issuing of currency is left to private banks. This book explores how this could work in practice by examining how this has worked historically, specifically in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century. After building a theory of free banking, its central chapters explore the history of Scotlands experience of free banking and the contemporary policy debate over the question of whether Parliament should allow free banking in England. The final chapters bring the debate forward and examine how free banking could work in modern times. The result is a significantly revised and update edition of a book about privately issued currency.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wPMdAAAACAAJ&dq=Free+Banking+in+Britain:+Theory,+Experience+and+Debate+1800-1845&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An American Primer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hellsing, Vol. 5","description":"Chronicles the exploits of the secret Hellsing Organization, formed by the Hellsing family to protect England and the Protestant church from vampires and other monsters, and its top operative, the vampire Alucard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xj6bPwAACAAJ&dq=Hellsing,+Vol.+5&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It All Happened in Renfro Valley","description":"For sixty years, Renfro Valley has highlighted some of the biggest and most influential names in country and folk music. The show began in the 1930s as a combination radio broadcast and stage performance, and today it has grown into an array of shows and headliner concerts featuring old-time country music, country gospel, modern country, bluegrass, and comedy acts. John Lair, the ambitious and deeply committed founder of Renfro Valley, was fascinated with the past. He created the Renfro Valley Barn Dance to give radio listeners the experience of an old-fashioned rural hoe-down. He resisted the encroachment of popular \\"cowboy songs\\" and kept the stage and the airwaves filled with authentic Kentucky mountain music. Lair's vision struck a chord with music fans: on some Saturday nights, more than ten thousand people arrived at Renfro Valley and performances went on all night to accommodate the audiences. Pete Stamper, a forty-seven year veteran of Renfro Valley, traces the show's history from its early radio days in Cincinnati and Chicago, through the glory years in the 1940s, the lean times in the 1960s when rock and roll seemed to take over the music scene, to its renewed popularity in the 1990s. Once known as \\"the valley where time stands still,\\" Renfro Valley has updated its programming while maintaining the feel of the folk culture on which it was founded. Red Foley, the Coon Creek Girls, Slim Miller, Pee Wee King, Old Joe Clark, and a host of other musicians and performers helped shape the development of Renfro Valley. Stamper describes the role of the Valley in the commercial history of country music and highlights John Lair's invaluable contribution to country music as a talent scout, businessman, and collector of traditional music of the South.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xEooEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Workbook to Accompany Surgical Technology: Principles and Practice","description":"This convenient, money-saving package is a must-have for students training for a career as a Surgical Technologist.

Nunberg has a wonderful ear for the new, the comic and the absurd. He pronounces that: \\"'Blog' is a syllable whose time has come,\\" and that \\"You don't get to be a verb unless you're doing something right,\\" with which he launches into the effect of Google on our collective consciousness. Nunberg hears the shifting use of \\"Gallic\\" as we suddenly find ourselves in bitter opposition to the French; perhaps only Nunberg could compare America the Beautiful with a Syrian national anthem that contains the line \\"A land resplendent with brilliant suns...almost like a sky centipede.\\" At the heart of the entertainment and linguistic slapstick that Nunberg delights in are the core concerns that have occupied American minds. \\"Going Nucular,\\" the title piece, is more than a bit of fun at the President's expense. Nunberg's analysis is as succinct a summary of the questions that hover over the administration's strategy as any political insider's. It exemplifies the message of the book: that in the smallest ticks and cues of language the most important issue and thoughts of our times can be heard and understood. If you know how to listen for them. Nunberg has dazzling receptors, perfect acoustics and a deftly elegant style to relay his wit and wisdom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Doxh1e87V-UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing the Book of Ester","description":"The prominence of Holocaust themes in the media testifies to their compelling grip on contemporary consciousness and memory, particularly for a younger generation of Jews who never experienced the Nazi genocide first-hand but were raised amid its ashes. Mathieu, the narrator of this novel, is one such person, drawn by his sister's suicide to confront the effects of his family's tragic past. Esther, the narrator's gifted older sister, a teacher and aspiring writer, was born in France to Polish-Jewish refugees in 1943, narrowly escaping the deportations that claimed the aunt after whom she is named. Growing up in the Jewish immigrant quarter of Paris, she is haunted by the Holocaust, obsessively reliving - in her fantasies, dreams, troubled behavior, and abortive struggle to write - the family trauma she has absorbed but not actually experienced. Born after the war, Mathieu is left to grapple with recovering his sister's memory - which he had resolutely tried to deny - and with it the meaning of his own identity, family origins, and historical predicament. Piecing together other people's memories, conjecture, conversations, and eyewitness accounts, Mathieu attempts to write the book, and tell the tale, that Esther and his family failed to transmit. A result of his effort is the novel itself, which interweaves multiple layers of time, identity, memory, and experience. Mathieu's intense relationship with his sister is provocative for its deep psychological and moral resonance. Being neither victim, survivor, nor witness, does he have the right to give voice to the unlived and unimaginable? Or is he a voyeur or imposter, usurping the lives of the real victims? Placing in bold relief the hidden thoughts, obsessions, conflicts, and creative struggles of the second generation that has inherited the anger, sadness, guilt, and fear - but not the actual memory - of the Nazi genocide, Henri Raczymow gives an authentic and powerful voice to its grim legacy in our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IRksAQAAIAAJ&dq=Writing+the+Book+of+Ester&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conquest and Survival in Colonial Guatemala: A Historical Geography of the Cuchumatn Highlands, 1500-1821, Third edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J7LfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Conquest+and+Survival+in+Colonial+Guatemala:+A+Historical+Geography+of+the+Cuchumatn+Highlands,+1500-1821,+Third+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"False Colours","description":"\\"Reading Georgette Heyer is the next best thing to reading Jane Austen.\\"-Publishers Weekly A missing twin Something is very wrong, and the Honourable Christopher \\"Kit\\" Fancot can sense it.

This truth comes down through the entire history of the Christian faith, as well as in the Bible. Yet there is very little teaching or promotion of this truth in organized religion. This lack of a presentation of the message of God as our Father results in a corresponding lack of power and freedom for effective daily living in the Christian community. Sadly, many people in religious organizations (not to mention people outside the religious system) doubt if a personal relationship with God is even possible. This is even sadder when we consider the Bible is very clear on this point. The Bible tells us that a personal relationship with God as our Father is not only possible but this relationship is God's greatest desire for us. It is Bill Landon's hope that this book will be an encouragement for those people who seek a spiritual life that has more practical impact on their daily living. For those who wish to explore the possibilities of a greater peace and fullness in their living, this book can be a help.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A0uydNH9aAgC&dq=My+father,:+Personal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kawasaki Z & KZ 900-1000cc Chain & Shaft Drive 1973-1981","description":"Having this book in your pocket is just like having a real marque expert at your side.

His influence on the worlds of comedy, jazz, and satire is incalculable, and How to Talk Dirty and Influence People--now republished to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Lenny Bruce's death--remains a brilliant existential account of his life and the forces that made him the most important and controversial entertainer in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5Zr0CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Centuries of Santa Fe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YjaVngEACAAJ&dq=The+Centuries+of+Santa+Fe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christian faith (Harper torchbooks.

But when an encounter with a young woman running for her life results in the murder of Hagen the White s brother, he vows to find the perpetrators, no matter how highborn or powerful, and take his revenge. His hunt will carry him into the royal circle of the Basileus Irene, a ruthless despot who blinded her own son to force him off the throne. The beautiful and calculating empress is fascinated by this supposed barbarian who has sworn allegiance to the great Charlemagne, and she welcomes him into the imperial court and into the dangerous fires of countless royal conspiracies.

It was also a calculated move within, and a dramatic public definition of, the Truman administration's concurrent turn from accommodation to confrontation with the Soviet Union. It provoked a response from Stalin that goes far to explain the advent of the Cold War a few weeks later. This book is at once a fascinating biography of Winston Churchill as the leading protagonist of an Anglo-American political and military front against the Soviet Union and a penetrating re-examination of diplomatic relations between the United States, Great Britain, and the U.S.S.R. in the postwar years. Pointing out the Americocentric bias in most histories of this period, Harbutt shows that the Europeans played a more significant part in precipitating the Cold War than most people realize. He stresses that the same pattern of events that earlier led America belatedly into two world wars, namely the initial separation and then the sudden coming together of the European and American political arenas, appeared here as well. From the combination of biographical and structural approaches, a new historical landscape emerges. The United States appears at times to be the rather passive object of competing Soviet and British maneuvers. The turning point came with the crisis of early 1946, which here receives its fullest analysis to date, when the Truman administration in a systematic but carefully veiled and still widely misunderstood reorientation of policy (in which Churchill figured prominently) led the Soviet Union into the political confrontation that brought on the Cold War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-6KR_y2r5RAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids","description":"A catalog of an exhibition highlighting ancient Egyptian art and architecture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mxAZpKoo-YwC&dq=Egyptian+Art+in+the+Age+of+the+Pyramids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Male Bodies: A Photographic History of the Nude","description":"From paradigms of physical perfection to gay icons, this illustrated survey of male nude photography presents various portrayals of masculinity as seen through the eyes of the world's most renowned photographers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LuhTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Male+Bodies:+A+Photographic+History+of+the+Nude&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Qualitative Methods in Social Research","description":"This accessible, engaging introduction to qualitative research methods covers a wide range of qualitative methods including ethnography, observation, interviewing, content analysis, and unobtrusive measures.

It touches four generations of a well-to-do family and relates the tragic and humorous occurrences in the life of each member of that family. The story is narrated by a young girl, Marianna, whose romantic ideals and openness are often in conflict with the secretive and reserved nature of her family. Marianna loves the more salubrious and rustic lifestyle of the land-workers as opposed to the refined and sophisticated lifestyle of her aristocratic family. She feels the former to be an honest way of life and the latter a pretentious and artificial one. Marianna, with the exuberance of youth, would like to see a radical change in the way her family deals with certain issues. She herself represents a slowly changing society. However, the people whose beliefs have been forged and impressed into their very soul by generations of tumultuous historical events, are resistant to change. Eventually, Marianna learns to appreciate the island's cultural richness and its paradox. A sense of history and mythology, superstition and religion, in fact, often exist alongside one another and are portrayed in the novel. The novel touches also on both the First and Second World Wars because two members of Marianna's family, her grandfather and father, fought in each war respectively. It depicts every human emotion by means of adopting humor and tragedy throughout. One might say that in the novel The Island of the Elyms there is a book within the book as the lives of Marianna's great grandparents and grandparents emerge. The former being read by Nonna from her mother's memoirs and the latter narrated by Nonna herself. When finally Marianna is comfortable with who she is - different from the rest of her family, she is torn away from her birthplace for the great unknown which happens to be Australia. The story ends with the uprooting of the girl by the family, who, inturn, has to forfeit and abandon every dream, and thus becoming the innocent victim of the tragedy of emigration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1Bmuw2G1260C&dq=The+Island+of+the+Elyms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Experience of war: The United States in World War II (Mainstream of America Series) (2 Volumes)","description":"This unique work presents an extraordinary breadth of contemporary and historical views on Asian America and Pacific Islanders, conveyed through the voices of the men and women who lived these experiences over more than 150 years. ?

This book explores up-to-the-minute research and biblical truths to help you understand why beauty is an important spiritual issue for so many women. In a recent survey, 48 percent of American women said they felt  wholesale displeasure  about their bodies. Many of the rest disliked some part of their appearance, such as their thighs, tummy, or hips. Meanwhile, most Christian women recite what they ve been taught to believe: how you look doesn t matter; inner beauty is what counts. The truth is, few women know what the Bible really says about beauty, so we re at a loss when a daughter reveals an eating disorder, a friend says she hates her body, or we find ourselves anxious about another birthday or another ten pounds. Why Beauty Matters explores current research that has made Newsweek headlines, delves into the breadth of biblical wisdom about beauty, and listens to real women as they struggle with the tough issues that make physical appearance one of the most important spiritual issues of our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pfx4zBFbsasC&dq=Why+Beauty+Matters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets: Self, Love and Art","description":"This study closely analyses sonnets to bring out what they can tell us of different kinds of love, particularly self-love, the relation of these to the world of natural growth and temporal succession, and finally the ways in which art can properly be defined as a form of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VDnbhyTSFdEC&dq=Shakespeare%27s+Sonnets:+Self,+Love+and+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Research Methods in Psychology (Non-InfoTrac Version)","description":"This text displays the authors' commitment to ensuring that the student has a thorough understanding of the research process from the very beginning.

While LGBT populations often are combined as a single entity for research and advocacy purposes, each is a distinct population group with its own specific health needs. Furthermore, the experiences of LGBT individuals are not uniform and are shaped by factors of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical location, and age, any of which can have an effect on health-related concerns and needs. The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People assesses the state of science on the health status of LGBT populations, identifies research gaps and opportunities, and outlines a research agenda for the National Institute of Health. The report examines the health status of these populations in three life stages: childhood and adolescence, early/middle adulthood, and later adulthood. At each life stage, the committee studied mental health, physical health, risks and protective factors, health services, and contextual influences. To advance understanding of the health needs of all LGBT individuals, the report finds that researchers need more data about the demographics of these populations, improved methods for collecting and analyzing data, and an increased participation of sexual and gender minorities in research. The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People is a valuable resource for policymakers, federal agencies including the National Institute of Health (NIH), LGBT advocacy groups, clinicians, and service providers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4dDNNYmoqScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peeling Potatoes, Painting Pictures: Women Artists in Post-Soviet Russia, Estonia, and Latvia The First Decade (Dodge Soviet-Nonconformist Art Publication)","description":"How do women artists in Russia, Estonia and Latvia view themselves in the post-Soviet era?

However, Edgar Allan Poe s unnamed narrator, after suffering innumerable tortures upon his body and soul in the hands of his tormenters, sees the light of the day at the very end of his sanity s tether. Even despite the lack of supernatural elements, \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" (1842) has enjoyed and influenced several notable movie adaptations. Animations such as The \\"Flinstones\\", TV series like \\"Crime Scene Investigation\\", to films like Roger Corman s \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" (1961), starring Vincent Price and some torture methods found in the \\"Saw\\" franchise, the story s famous pendulum scene is a rather fruitful source of inspirations. Yet, despite the terrific torments, the story focuses primarily on how terror is implicitly depicted through the workings of the mind. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American poet, author, and literary critic. Most famous for his poetry, short stories, and tales of the supernatural, mysterious, and macabre, he is also regarded as the inventor of the detective genre and a contributor to the emergence of science fiction, dark romanticism, and weird fiction.

The past two decades have witnessed no fewer than six crises against the backdrop of a vigorous nuclear arms race. Except for the Kargil war of 1998-9, all these events were resolved peacefully. Nuclear war was avoided despite bitter mistrust, everyday tensions, an intractable political conflict over Kashmir, three wars, and the steady refinement of each side's nuclear capabilities. Sumit Ganguly and Devin T. Hagerty carefully analyze each crisis, reviewing the Indian and Pakistani domestic political systems and key decisions during the relevant period. This lucid and comprehensive study of the two nations' crisis behavior in the nuclear age is the first work on Indo-Pakistani relations to take systematic account of the role played by the United States in South Asia's security dynamics over the past two decades in the context of unipolarization, and formulates a blueprint for American policy toward a more positive and productive India-Pakistan relationship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eSTiCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War In A Time Of Peace - Bush, Clinton, And The Generals","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The TALE OF THE RESTLESS HOUSE (ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK 3)","description":"Plotting to scare Adam Ingram out of his wits, Nathan asks his friend Kendra to bring Adam to a reputed haunted house where he will play a practical joke, but when Kendra and Adam arrive at the appointed time, Nathan has disappeared.

Your intellect or your survival instinct? Are you smart, sophisticated and evolved, or are you an insecure, emotional group-thinker like the rest of us? Evolutionology represents a new approach to understanding the evolution of the human mind and our psychology. It describes how our survival instinct actually works, how it makes us think and behave, as well as how to regain control and heighten our emotional intelligence. We humans like to believe that we are already evolved, civilized creatures because we are intelligent, but we are clearly not living intelligently. Our lives and world are filled with stress, anxiety and dysfunction. The reason is that our choices are not made by our intelligence, but rather by our survival instinct. Our fears and emotions are behind our decisions, and every action we take is designed to make us feel safer. We do what is comforting, not what is right. We seek corroboration, not truth. We react instead of choosing, thinking emotionally and declaring it intelligent. Seeing this is a necessary first step in order to evolve consciously. Until we do, our inner animal will continue holding the reins and controlling our thoughts and actions, while we will congratulate ourselves on our superiority, correctness, and wisdom. Evolutionology describes self-evident truths that can empower us to better understand people. When we understand how the mind works, we gain deeper insight into the human condition, and with it, the power to effectively and consciously change our lives. FEATURING: The Evolutionology Quiz. In order to bring this to a very practical level, this book features a simple, online multiple choice quiz that will allow you to measure your degree of evolution. But, beware.

Like the first edition, its focus is on the development of precisely formulated grammars whose empirical predictions can be directly tested. There is also considerable emphasis on the prediction and evaluation of grammatical hypotheses, as well as on integrating syntactic hypotheses with matters of semantic analysis. The book covers the core areas of English syntax from the last quarter century, including complementation, control, \\"raising constructions,\\" passives, the auxiliary system, and the analysis of long distance dependency constructions. Syntactic Theory's step-by-step introduction to a consistent grammar in these core areas is complemented by extensive problem sets drawing from a variety of languages. The book's theoretical perspective is presented in the context of current models of language processing, and the practical value of the constraint-based, lexicalist grammatical architecture proposed has already been demonstrated in computer language processing applications. This thoroughly reworked second edition includes revised and extended problem sets, updated analyses, additional examples, and more detailed exposition throughout.

When it exploded onto the literary scene in 1945, Black Boy was both praised and condemned. Orville Prescott of the New York Times wrote that  if enough such books are written, if enough millions of people read them maybe, someday, in the fullness of time, there will be a greater understanding and a more true democracy.  Yet from 1975 to 1978, Black Boy was banned in schools throughout the United States for  obscenity  and  instigating hatred between the races.  Wright s once controversial, now celebrated autobiography measures the raw brutality of the Jim Crow South against the sheer desperate will it took to survive as a Black boy. Enduring poverty, hunger, fear, abuse, and hatred while growing up in the woods of Mississippi, Wright lied, stole, and raged at those around him whites indifferent, pitying, or cruel and Blacks resentful of anyone trying to rise above their circumstances. Desperate for a different way of life, he headed north, eventually arriving in Chicago, where he forged a new path and began his career as a writer. At the end of Black Boy, Wright sits poised with pencil in hand, determined to  hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo.  Seventy-five years later, his words continue to reverberate.  To read Black Boy is to stare into the heart of darkness,  John Edgar Wideman writes in his foreword.  Not the dark heart Conrad searched for in Congo jungles but the beating heart I bear.  One of the great American memoirs, Wright s account is a poignant record of struggle and endurance a seminal literary work that illuminates our own time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1oTEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choose a College Town for Retirement: Retirement Discoveries for Every Budget (Choose Retirement Series)","description":"Travel, investment, and living opportunities for every budget.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eAAuvgAACAAJ&dq=Choose+a+College+Town+for+Retirement:+Retirement+Discoveries+for+Every+Budget+(Choose+Retirement+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gay Galliard;: The love story of Mary, queen of Scots (Ljus English library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fDxtzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Gay+Galliard%3B:+The+love+story+of+Mary,+queen+of+Scots+(Ljus+English+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jerusalem at Time of Jesus Map","description":"Created for map lovers by map lovers, this rich book explores the intriguing stories behind maps across history and illuminates how the art of cartography thrives today.

By merging the study of photography and the study of Zen philosophy, one learns to use a camera a way of connecting more fully with the world. Consequently, a camera is not used as a wall between what is seen and what is experienced, but is a tool that serves to unite the photographer with what is experienced through the photographic process. This book teaches that photography is much more than f-stops, shutter speed and aperture settings, film choices, and camera purchases. If photography were merely a technical operation, robots could take great pictures. Learning is about readiness. Because you are a loving, thinking person who found this book, you want to be inspired to elevate your picture taking to a level in which you learn from the moments you observe and teach others to be moved by those moments. This book is ready for you. AUTHOR BIO: Paul Martin Lester is a Professor of Communications at California State University, Fullerton.

It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625-740 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. The red color of blood comes from the protein hemoglobin, while ripe strawberries, red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins.Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red also became the color of revolution; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries.Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love and joy. In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color of symbolizing happiness and good fortune.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8th5zQEACAAJ&dq=Shades+of+Red&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snow Angel (Book with Charm)","description":"Children smile with surprise when little Beth's Christmas snow angel comes to life!

H. Green (Lines of Thought)","description":"David Brink presents a study of T. H. Green's classic Prolegomena to Ethics (1883) and its role in his philosophical thought. Green is one of the two most important figures in the British idealist tradition, and his political writings and activities had a profound influence on the development of Liberal politics in Britain. The Prolegomena is his major philosophical work. It begins with his idealist attack on empiricist metaphysics and epistemology and develops a perfectionist ethicaltheory that aims to bring together the best elements in the ancient and modern traditions, and that provides the moral foundations for Green's own distinctive brand of liberalism. Brink aims to restore the Prolegomena to its rightful place in the history of philosophy by providing a prolegomenon to the Prolegomena - one that situates the work in its intellectual context, sympathetically but critically engages its main themes, and explains Green's enduring significance for the history of ethics and contemporary ethical theory. Brink examines Green's life and work, his idealist attack on empiricism, his conception of agency, his perfectionist ethics of self-realization, the connections he draws between perfectionism and the common good, his conception of the differences between perfectionism and utilitarianism, and the connections between his perfectionism and his defense of a new form of political liberalism. Because Green develops his own views out of an examination of other traditions in the history of ethics, a fair assessment of Green's own contributions must compare his claims with the traditions that he examines and sometimes criticizes. Brink's study examines Green's relation to Aristotle, Locke, Hume, Butler, Mill, Kant, Hegel, Bradley, and Sidgwick, and concludes by examining Green's legacy for ethical theory. Perfectionism and the Common Good will be of substantial interest to students and scholars of the history of ethics, ethical theory, political philosophy, and nineteenth century philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LEQVDAAAQBAJ&dq=Perfectionism+and+the+Common+Good:+Themes+in+the+Philosophy+of+T.+H.+Green+(Lines+of+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circus Days and Nights","description":"Though many hold him to be one of the greatest American poets of this century, Lax has maintained a low profile, living and writing in seclusion on the Greek island of Patmos.

Mogador's Book,?? and  Sunset City?? are collected together for the first time, placing this early masterwork in the position within American literature that it so richly deserves. Each of the three poems in this collection expresses a reverence for the acts of daring, beauty, and grace that make the circus the singular event it is. What also emerges is the drawing of a link between this world of the circus wherein a tent is erected, acts are performed, and then the tent is disassembled only to be re-erected the next day and Lax's faith.

But they ve noticed you. They notice everything. That s their job. Sitting quietly in a nondescript car outside a bank making note of the tellers  work habits, the positions of the security guards. Lagging a few car lengths behind the Brinks truck on its daily rounds. Surreptitiously jiggling the handle of an unmarked service door at the racetrack. They re thieves. Heisters, to be precise. They re pros, and Parker is far and away the best of them. If you re planning a job, you want him in. Tough, smart, hardworking, and relentlessly focused on his trade, he is the heister s heister, the robber s robber, the heavy s heavy. You don t want to cross him, and you don t want to get in his way, because he ll stop at nothing to get what he s after. Parker, the ruthless antihero of Richard Stark s eponymous mystery novels, is one of the most unforgettable characters in hardboiled noir. Lauded by critics for his taut realism, unapologetic amorality, and razor-sharp prose-style and adored by fans who turn each intoxicating page with increasing urgency Stark is a master of crime writing, his books as influential as any in the genre. The University of Chicago Press has embarked on a project to return the early volumes of this series to print for a new generation of readers to discover and become addicted to. Parker goes under the knife in The Man with the Getaway Face, changing his face to escape the mob and a contract on his life. Along the way he scores his biggest heist yet: an armored car in New Jersey, stuffed with cash.  Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.

A patrol of British troops, in the vanguard of an invading column, was ambushed by the Zulu, and fled, leaving three men dead on the field. Among them was Prince Louis Napoleon, the exiled heir to the Imperial throne in France, the last of the Bonapartes. What curious combination of circumstances had brought the Prince Imperial to southern Africa, wearing the uniform of - of all things - a British office? His was a romantic and melancholy story. Chased out of France after the debacle of the Franco-Prussian War, the Emperor Napoleon III had sought refuge with his family in England, where they were befriended by Queen Victoria. Napoleon's son, Louis, had grown to manhood in exile, succeeding on his father's death to the title of Napoleon IV, and awaiting a call to reclaim his throne, which might never have come. Raised in the shadow of the reputation of the great Napoleon, he hungered for military glory, and by special dispensation was allowed to train as a British officer. As a foreign Prince, however, and a Bonaparte, there was never any hope that he might serve in the British army, but when the Anglo-Zulu War broke out in 1879 he was allowed to go to Africa as an observer, attached to General Lord Chelmsford's staff. The war seemed to offer him the perfect chance for military experience without European political repercussions, and with a minimum of danger. This was not to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ajygAAAAMAAJ&dq=WITH+HIS+FACE+TO+THE+FOE:+The+Life+and+Death+of+the+Prince+Imperial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Wings of Light: Finding Hope When the Heart Needs Healing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Anna, Woman of Miracles: The Story of the Grandmother of Jesus","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AixRDwAAQBAJ&dq=Anna,+Woman+of+Miracles:+The+Story+of+the+Grandmother+of+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tour of the Calculus","description":"Were it not for the calculus, mathematicians would have no way to describe the acceleration of a motorcycle or the effect of gravity on thrown balls and distant planets, or to prove that a man could cross a room and eventually touch the opposite wall.

Mencius was active during the Warring States Period (403-221 B.C.E.), in which competing powers sought to control the declining Zhou empire. Like Confucius, Mencius journeyed to one feudal court after another, searching for a proper lord who could put his teachings into practice. Only a leader who possessed the moral qualities of a true king could unify China, Mencius believed, and in his defense of Zhou rule and Confucian philosophy, he developed an innovative and highly nuanced approach to understanding politics, self-cultivation, and human nature, profoundly influencing the course of Confucian thought and East Asian culture. Mencius is a record of the philosopher's conversations with warring lords, disciples, and adversaries of the Way, as well as a collection of pronouncements on government, human nature, and a variety of other philosophical and political subjects. Mencius is largely concerned with the motivations of human actors and their capacity for mutual respect. He builds on the Confucian idea of ren, or humaneness, and places it alongside the complementary principle of yi, or rightness, advancing a complex notion of what is right for certain individuals as they perform distinct roles in specific situations. Consequently, Mencius's impact was felt not only in the thought of the intellectual and social elite but also in the value and belief systems of all Chinese people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4tDaS1WfJwoC&dq=Waiting+for+the+Wind:+Thirty-Six+Poets+of+Japan%27s+Late+Medieval+Age+(Translations+from+the+Asian+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miracle Super Foods That Heal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FI5JJwAACAAJ&dq=Miracle+Super+Foods+That+Heal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LECTURES ON GEOPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Treasury of Best-Loved Poems","description":"An expanded new edition of the popular anthology of poetry encompasses two hundred poems--by Dickinson, Whitman, Shakespeare, Poe, Sandburg, Milton, and others--arranged in nine subject categories.

This book is built around developing a decarbonised electricity mix for Britain which reduces fossil fuels from 50% of supply in 2018 down to levels within 2030 carbon targets. Crossland explores the idea of a future energy storage mix which blends domestic batteries, vehicles, thermal stores and pumped hydro to provide a flexible, responsive electricity system. He then goes on to look at how much storage can contribute to decarbonisation in a multitude of contexts  from domestic to national electricity. This book also discusses how efficiency and self-sufficiency can bring about a decarbonised electricity use within our homes today. Britain is used as the main example, but the themes and conclusions are applicable to a global audience, and each chapter draws on practical case studies from around the world to illustrate key ideas. Drawing on the author s experience in delivering and analysing low-carbon energy projects in the UK, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Oceania, this book will be of great relevance to students, scholars and industry specialists with an interest in energy technology, policy and storage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J96iDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Botanical Illustration in Watercolor (Practical Art Books)","description":"Capture the fascinating beauty of plants.

Since the First World War, however, his literary reputation has sunk and he is now little read. Bulwer Lytton is the first modern biography of an extraordinary man whose literary output was prodigious. It ranged from novels, such as The Last Days of Pompeii, and poetry to plays, biographies and extensive political commentaries and journalism. A dandy to rival Disraeli, he lived life in London, at Knebworth, his country house, or more frequently abroad, with hectic intensity. Arousing strong emotions in public, his private life was turbulent in the extreme; his acrimonious and bitter divorce from his wife Rosina providing one of the most public and prolonged marital disputes of the period. Despite this, he became Secretary for the Colonies in 1858 and was responsible for the setting up of Queensland. Leslie Mitchell's biography, written to mark the two hundredth anniversary of Bulwer Lytton's birth, is an account of an eminent and very remarkable Victorian.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-SMtrShlsoMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flesh & Bones","description":"Ali has been hiding in an attic since civilization collapsed eight weeks ago.

But Sherlock Holmes, the cultural icon to whose exploits Michael Atkinson gives new readings, became famous by taking nothing for granted. Holmes's adventures can be read in new ways, including ways that he himself would have found startling, but which can give contemporary readers satisfaction. In clear, accessible prose that will engage specialists and lay readers alike, Atkinson engages in \\"a series of flirtations\\" with nine of Arthur Conan Doyle's favorite detective fictions, using the tools of modern literary theory, from depth psychology to deconstruction. Bluebeard, the kundalini serpent, and Conan Doyle's mother pop up alongside Jung, Nietzsche, and Derrida as guides to new understandings of these classic stories. Just as Holmes uses treatises on tobacco ash and tattoos to give fresh readings to puzzling facts, Atkinson employs widely different critical strategies to unravel the mysteries of reading itself. \\"What a delightful book! This is surely the most interesting writing you will ever read about Sherlock Holmes, but it is much more. Michael Atkinson gives us literary criticism at its best: the sheer fun of watching a bold and imaginative reader breathe into well-loved, but well-worn, fictions new and enchanting life. Atkinson's mind races as nimbly as Holmes's own, and he makes the stories our hansom cab through human nature itself. A tour de force!\\" ---Norman N. Holland, author of Murder in a Dephi Seminar \\"A book that speaks directly to readers. . . Atkinson sees far beneath the surface of the Sherlock stories to provide fascinating commentary.\\" ---Cincinnati Post \\"Atkinson demonstrates a love and knowledge of the Holmes stories. . .

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions.

Anthony Lukas PrizeShortlisted for the 2017 Hurston/Wright Foundation AwardFinalist for the 2017 Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in JournalismLonglisted for the 2017 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Non Fiction On an average day in America, seven children and teens will be shot dead. In Another Day in the Death of America, award-winning journalist Gary Younge tells the stories of the lives lost during one such day. It could have been any day, but he chose November 23, 2013. Black, white, and Latino, aged nine to nineteen, they fell at sleepovers, on street corners, in stairwells, and on their own doorsteps. From the rural Midwest to the barrios of Texas, the narrative crisscrosses the country over a period of twenty-four hours to reveal the full human stories behind the gun-violence statistics and the brief mentions in local papers of lives lost. This powerful and moving work puts a human face-a child's face-on the \\"collateral damage\\" of gun deaths across the country.

So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), \\"Bartelby the Scrivener\\" (1853), \\"Benito Cerino\\" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RFpSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomorrow's God : Our Greatest Spiritual Challenge","description":"Furnishing an outline for a new form of spirituality, the best-selling author of Conversations with God creates a question-and-answer dialogue between the author and God in which he describes a new form of spirituality that will enhance each individual's life and discusses such topics as sex, relationships, politics, and other timely topics.

What is a temple (and its art) to the people who make and use it? Noted anthropologist Hildred Geertz attempts to answer these and other questions in this unique look at transformations in material culture and social relations over time in a village temple in Bali. Throughout Geertz offers insightful glimpses into what the statues, structures, and designs of Pura D sa Batuan convey to those who worship there, deepening our understanding of how a village community evaluates workmanship and imagery. Following an introduction to the temple and villagers of Batuan, Geertz explores the problematics of the Western concept of \\"art\\" as a guiding framework in research. She goes on to outline the many different kinds of work ideational as well as physical undertaken in connection with the temple and the social institutions that enable, constrain, and motivate their creation. Finally, the \\"art-works\\" themselves are presented, set within the intricate sociocultural contexts of their making. Using the history of Batuan as the main framework for discussing each piece, Geertz looks at the carvings from the perspective of their makers, each generation occupying a different social situation. She confronts concepts such as \\"aesthetics,\\" \\"representation,\\" \\"sacredness,\\" and \\"universality\\" and the dilemmas they create in field research and ethnographic writing. Recent temple carvings from the tumultuous and complex period that followed the expulsion of the Dutch and the increasing globalization and commercialization of Balinese society demonstrate yet again that any anthropology of art must also be historical.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-5oBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primal Scenes","description":"Primal Scenes is concerned with those elements in the thought of Freud and Heidegger which make us continue to regard them as our contemporaries.

Wells, and the periodic table. In this endlessly charming and eloquent memoir, the author of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Awakenings chronicles his love affair with science and the magnificently odd and sometimes harrowing childhood in which that love affair unfolded. In Uncle Tungsten we meet Sacks  extraordinary family, from his surgeon mother (who introduces the fourteen-year-old Oliver to the art of human dissection) and his father, a family doctor who imbues in his son an early enthusiasm for housecalls, to his  Uncle Tungsten,  whose factory produces tungsten-filament lightbulbs. We follow the young Oliver as he is exiled at the age of six to a grim, sadistic boarding school to escape the London Blitz, and later watch as he sets about passionately reliving the exploits of his chemical heroesin his own home laboratory. Uncle Tungsten is a crystalline view of a brilliant young mind springing to life, a story of growing up which is by turns elegiac, comic, and wistful, full of the electrifying joy of discovery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jfUJAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recovering Stolen Dreams","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fqLnPgAACAAJ&dq=Recovering+Stolen+Dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gorgias","description":"The struggle which Plato has Socrates recommend to his interlocutors in Gorgias - and to his readers - is the struggle to overcome the temptations of worldly success and to concentrate on genuine morality. Ostensibly an enquiry into the value of rhetoric, the dialogue soon becomes an investigation into the value of these two contrasting ways of life. In a series of dazzling and bold arguments, Plato attempts to establish that only morality can bring a person true happiness, and to demolish alternative viewpoints. It is not suprising that Gorgias is one of Plato's most widely read dialogues. Philosophers read it for its coverage of central moral issues; others enjoy its vividness, clarity and occasional bitter humour. This new translation is accompanied by explanatory notes and an informative introduction.

I have always felt that the beauty and power of Quakerism is that it exhorts us to live more simply, more truthfully, more charitably.\\" Taking his inspiration from the teaching of the first Quaker, George Fox, and from his own nine generations of Quaker forebears, Smith speaks to all of us who are seeking a way to make our lives simpler, more meaningful, and more useful. Beginning with the Quaker belief that \\"There is that of God in every person,\\" Smith explores the ways in which we can harness the inner light of God that dwells in each of us to guide the personal choices and challenges we face every day. How to live and speak truthfully. How to listen for, trust, and act on our conscience. How to make our work an expression of the best that is in us. Using vivid examples from his own life, Smith writes eloquently of Quaker Meeting, his decision to fight in World War II, and later to oppose the Vietnam War. From his work as an educator and headmaster to his role as a husband and father, Smith quietly convinces that the lofty ideals of Quakerism offer all of us practical tools for leading a more meaningful life.

Virtually every day in the fall of 1907, Rainer Maria Rilke returned to a Paris gallery to view a Cezanne exhibition. Nearly as frequently, he wrote dense and joyful letters to his wife, Clara Westhoff, expressing his dismay before the paintings and his ensuing revelations about art and life. Rilke was knowledgeable about art and had even published monographs, including a famous study of Rodin that inspired his New Poems. But Cezanne's impact on him could not be conveyed in a traditional essay. Rilke's sense of kinship with Cezanne provides a powerful and prescient undercurrent in these letters -- passages from them appear verbatim in Rilke's great modernist novel, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge.

With intimate detail, author Maria Riva reveals the rich life of her mother, Marlene Dietrich, the charismatic star of stage and screen whose career spanned much of the twentieth century. Opening with Dietrich s childhood in Sch?neberg, Riva s biography introduces us to an energetic, disciplined, and ambitious young actress whose own mother equated show business with a world of vagabonds and thieves. Dietrich would quickly rise to stardom on the Berlin stage in the 1920s with her sharp wit and bisexual mystique, and wearing the top hat and tails that revolutionized our concept of beauty and femininity. She comes alive in these pages in all her incarnations: muse, collaborator, bona fide movie star, box-office poison, lover, wife, and mother. During World War II, Dietrich would stand up to the Nazis and galvanize American troops, eventually earning the Congressional Medal of Freedom. There were her artistic relationships with Josef von Sternberg (The Blue Angel, Morocco, Shanghai Express), Colette, Erich Maria Remarque, No?l Coward, and Cole Porter, as well as her heady romances. And in her final years, Dietrich would make herself visibly invisible, devoting herself to the immortality of her legend.

She uses her skill as a philosopher to enter into an illuminating reflection on the difference between the two symbols of cross and night. Pointing out how entering the night is synonymous with carrying the cross, she provides a condensed presentation of John's thought on the active and passive nights, as discussed in The Ascent of Mount Carmel and The Dark Night. All of this leads Edith to speak of the glory of resurrection that the soul shares, through a unitive contemplation described chiefly in The Living Flame of Love. In the summer of 1942, the Nazis without warrant took Edith away. The nuns found the manuscript of this profound study lying open in her room. Because of the Nazis' merciless persecution of Jews in Germany, Edith Stein traveled discreetly across the border into Holland to find safe harbor in the Carmel of Echt. But the Nazi invasion of Holland in 1940 again put Edith in danger. The cross weighed down heavily as those of Jewish birth were harassed. Sr. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross's superiors then assigned her a task they thought would take her mind off the threatening situation. The fourth centenary of the birth, of St. John of the Cross (1542) was approaching, and Edith could surely contribute a valuable study for the celebration. It is no surprise that in view of her circumstances she discovered in the subject of the cross a central viewpoint for her study. A subject like this enabled her to grasp John's unity of being as expressed in his life and works. Using her training in phenomenology, she helps the reader apprehend the difference in the symbolic character of cross and night and why the night-symbol prevails in John. She clarifies that detachment is designated by him as a night through which the soul must pass to reach union with God and points out how entering the night is equivalent to carrying the cross. Finally, in a fascinating way Edith speaks of how the heart or fountainhead of personal life, an inmost region, is present in both God and the soul and that in the spiritual marriage this inmost region is surrendered by each to the other. She observes that in the soul seized by God in contemplation all that is mortal is consumed in the fire of eternal love. The spirit as spirit is destined for immortal being, to move through fire along a path from the cross of Christ to the glory of his resurrection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IBdzaPpDvs8C&dq=The+Science+of+the+Cross+(The+Collected+Works+of+Edith+Stein+Vol.+6)+(Stein,+Edith//the+Collected+Works+of+Edith+Stein)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith In History: Armenians Rebuilding Community","description":"and history as the cornerstones of their culture.

What is prayer, anyway? The practical: How long should I pray? How often should I pray? The personal: How does God answer prayer? How come I have never heard God's voice? The family: What should I tell my children about prayer? How do I pray with my children? Answers are offered with respect for the seriousness of the questioner & with a clarity the questions deserve. There is also a sense of affection & humor as well, offering a kind of you're-not-alone reassurance. Yet, Wolff's answers do not give a sense of \\"now you've got it right so there's no need for further discussion.\\" Instead, he helps people resolve a tension that may have brought their prayer life to a halt, releasing the seeker to proceed. His answers build a reader's confidence to go to the same sources - the great \\"prayers\\" of biblical times, the saints & mystics of Christian tradition, contemporary spiritual leaders, representatives of the world's great religions - & see for themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f8RRAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hungry+Heart:+Answers+to+the+20+Most-Asked+Questions+About+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mark 1-8: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1RbuAQAACAAJ&dq=Mark+1-8:+A+New+Translation+with+Introduction+and+Commentary+(Anchor+Yale+Bible+Commentaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's Paris from $80 a Day 2001 (Frommer's Paris from $... a Day)","description":"\\"Written in the spirit of discovery, as Frommer's guides always have been, and it bears the time-tested pedigree.\\" Chicago Sun-Times Familia Hotel, Latin Quarter From $33$48 per person, per night, for two Frommer's?

Sebastian Barry's latest novel, Days Without End, is now available. In 1914, Willie Dunne, barely eighteen years old, leaves behind Dublin, his family, and the girl he plans to marry in order to enlist in the Allied forces and face the Germans on the Western Front. Once there, he encounters a horror of violence and gore he could not have imagined and sustains his spirit with only the words on the pages from home and the camaraderie of the mud-covered Irish boys who fight and die by his side. Dimly aware of the political tensions that have grown in Ireland in his absence, Willie returns on leave to find a world split and ravaged by forces closer to home. Despite the comfort he finds with his family, he knows he must rejoin his regiment and fight until the end. With grace and power, Sebastian Barry vividly renders Willie s personal struggle as well as the overwhelming consequences of war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B73wDUgCSk0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Corporate Identity 2000","description":"The seventeenth edition of a highly respected resource, this impressive volume displays the most exemplary corporate design work produced in the United States over the past year.

Ellen Lupton has written, \\"In Fella's work, the unfettered mind of a Dada/Fluxus hippie confronts the dextrous hand of a traditional commercial artist.\\" Bruce Mau calls him \\"brilliant.\\" Peter Hall says Ed Fella is \\"an agitator, an experimentalist, an educator, and an inspiration to a new generation of type designers\\" and says his \\"anti-slick, rule-breaking designs\\" are \\"eccentric to the point of being impossible to imitate.\\" Clearly everyone agrees that Ed Fella is one of the most daring and extreme graphic designers in America today.Famous for his obsessive hand-drawn alphabets and glyphs, Fella creates work with the power and spontaneity of raw art that nonetheless is born from a great knowledge of the theory and technique of typography and graphics. As Rick Poynor says, \\"Fella doesn't so much take his line for a walk as force-feed it hallucinogens and release it babbling on to the page.\\" This first book on Fella, designed by Lorraine Wild, contains numerous examples of the designer's work, including his radical typeface designs, which have been described as \\"spun, tilted, stretched, sliced, fractured, drawn as if with a broken nib, and set loose among fields of ink-blotter doodles and networks of rules.\\" This title also features Fella's collection of Polaroid snapshots of the signs and symbols he sees on the streets. These photos, taken over a period of many years, serve as a record of vernacular architecture around the world as well as inspiration for Fella's own designs.

Yet the origins of these revolutionary changes are murky and their outcomes unclear. Have we witnessed the demise of an archaic authoritarian order and the rise of pluralism and democracy, or are the tumultuous events of the post-Mao era and the period of perestroika more usefully viewed in light of broader patterns of power and politics in Chinese and Russian history? Considering these questions with a new interpretation of power relations and political processes in China and Russia, Mark Lupher explores the imperial era, the communist period, and the current situation in both countries. Rather than speaking of  reform,  which too often is understood as liberalization along Western lines, his discussion is focused on power restructuring the ebb and flow of state power; the centralization and decentralization of political and economic power; and the three-way struggles between central rulers, various elites, and nonprivileged groups that drive these processes. Lupher s power-restructuring analysis is noteworthy in combining broad comparative-historical analysis and conceptualization with a closely focused discussion and reinterpretation of the Chinese Cultural Revolution the core of his book. By comparing and bringing new light to bear on a series of pivotal episodes in Chinese and Russian history, he furthers our understanding and assessment of processes that will continue to unfold in China, Russia, and the former Soviet republics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p__EDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garage/Yard Sales...

But he's finally ready to move on with his life-and after a few late-night, hands-on sessions with Tess, he's eager to prove he's the ace she wants. But this match comes with challenges: She's forty, and at twenty-six, he's barely old enough to rent a car. Worse, they only have two weeks together before Tess returns to her assistant-principal life in Virginia. During that brief time, they'll have to play hard, take a few risks, and find out whether their chemistry is a one-shot wonder...or whether they're meant to be doubles partners for life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9s6AzQEACAAJ&dq=Forty+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legion of the Damned","description":"The first novel in William C.

Based on David Cronenberg's screenplay, starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Willem Dafoe, this is the graphic novel of the movie eXistenZ, drawn by talented graphic artist Sean Scoffield. The story revolves around eXistenZ, a virtual reality game of wild and unpredictable fantasy invented by the gaming goddess, Allegra Geller. Using biotechnic adaptations, her new game is plugged directly into each player's spinal cord. Because the gaming pod has access to the memories, anxieties and preoccupations of its players, the direction each game takes depends entirely on who's playing. The game is so realistic that players often cannot tell which dimension they are inhabiting. While gaming devices plug in at the unveiling of eXistenZ, an assassin tries to kill Allegra Geller with a strange but deadly gristle gun made of human flesh that fires human teeth. In the confusion, Allegra is rescued by bodyguard Ted Pikul, and so begins an adventure in which nothing is what it seems and rival guerrilla factions fight and kill for who will control the dangerously intriguing game of eXistenZ. At stake is the very notion of what we know as the real world. In this disturbingly labyrinthine world of morphing realities, master fantasist David Cronenberg holds us spellbound as we weave toward the unexpected climactic ending to this tale about the fragility of reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aEwfAQAAIAAJ&dq=eXistenZ:+A+Graphic+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family of Woman","description":"An illuminating visual essay on female life and being around the world, this collection of photographs explores the changing and unchanging nature of the universal woman at work, at home, with friends, lovers, parents, and children","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=66fuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Family+of+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Universe of Worlds : Exploring the Frontiers of the Afterlife","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Te8MAAAACAAJ&dq=Universe+of+Worlds+:+Exploring+the+Frontiers+of+the+Afterlife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament","description":"This thoroughly revised edition of Bruce M.

Because Max shuns the use of force, the ingenious methods he must use to accomplish his missions are the stuff of legend he's employed a witch doctor in Haiti, tricked armed guards off a ship in Honduras, and rented a brothel in Mexico, all to thwart the designs of ship-thieves. Seized! is an intense, fast-paced window on the underbelly of ocean shipping, where all power comes from the barrel of a gun, and the only law is the law of survival. -- \\"Max Hardberger, maritime repo man extraordinaire ... Using a combination of ingenuity, stealth and good old-fashioned derring-do, he has made his name retaking vessels which have been hijacked or which, through local corruption, are impounded by authorities hungry for bribes.\\" ? -- Sunday Express ? \\"With most people, the longer you spend talking to them, the more normal they appear. With Hardberger, the reverse applies. Just when you think you've heard it all, he comes up with something wilder ... Over the years, he's distracted crews with prostitutes and witch doctors, bribed officials to look the other way, conned Russian mobsters and hidden from naval radar by riding out thunderstorms at sea; he's even taken a 10,000-tonne freighter out of Haiti while the 2004 revolution was going on around him.\\" ? -- Guardian ? \\"Required reading, fascinating. Maritime Repo Man Hardberger does it tough; his life is flown by the seat of his pants, or shipped, much like his profession ... This book delivers.\\" ? -- Paul Carter, bestselling author of Don't Tell Mum I Work On The Rigs and This Is Not A Drill ? \\"In this heart-stopping account of his work recovering stolen (or otherwise illegally-seized) ships from 'hellhole' ports, commercial captain Hardberger proves himself tough as a tank and articulate as a poet ... [He] has a seafarer's gift for atmospheric storytelling, layering details to create a sense of place, history, and foreboding ... Hardberger's escapades make undeniably fun reading.\\" ? -- Publishers Weekly ? \\"One of the strengths of Hardberger's book is his prose, which is lucid, entertaining and dramatic.\\" ? -- Daniel Sekulich, author of Terror on the Seas: True Tales of Modern Day Pirates","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_VwzDAAAQBAJ&dq=Seized&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Regan'S Pride (Celebration 1000!)

F. Skinner found himself at a dinner sitting next to Professor Alfred North Whitehead. Never one to lose an opportunity to promote behaviorism, Skinner expounded its main tenets to the distinguished philosopher. Whitehead acknowledged that science might account for most of human behavior but he would not include verbal behavior. He ended the discussion with a challenge: \\"Let me see you,\\" he said, \\"account for my behavior as I sit here saying, 'No black scorpion is falling upon this table.'\\" The next morning Skinner began this book. It took him over twenty years to complete. This book extends the laboratory-based principles of selection by consequences to account for what people say, write, gesture, and think. Skinner argues that verbal behavior requires a separate analysis because it does not operate on the environment directly, but rather through the behavior of other people in a verbal community. He illustrates his thesis with examples from literature, the arts, and sciences, as well as from his own verbal behavior and that of his colleagues and children. Perhaps it is because this theoretical work provides a way to approach that most human of human behavior that Skinner ofter called Verbal Behavior his most important work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v4CeAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Money Secret","description":"Burley found that the books on money either went one of two ways.

Steeped in the classical, republican tradition, Warren was a strong proponent of the American Revolution. She was also suspicious of the newly emerging commercial republic of the 1780s and hostile to the Constitution from an Anti-Federalist perspective, a position that gave her history some notoriety.

For the past two decades, young women (and men) have found their way to feminism through Riot Grrrl. Against the backdrop of the culture wars and before the rise of the Internet or desktop publishing, the zine and music culture of the Riot Grrrl movement empowered young women across the country to speak out against sexism and oppression, creating a powerful new force of liberation and unity within and outside of the women s movement. While feminist bands like Bikini Kill and Bratmobile fought for their place in a male-dominated punk scene, their members and fans developed an extensive DIY network of activism and support. The Riot Grrrl Collection reproduces a sampling of the original zines, posters, and printed matter for the first time since their initial distribution in the 1980s and  90s, and includes an original essay by Johanna Fateman and an introduction by Lisa Darms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gqh9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"110 People Who Are Screwing Up America (and Al Franken Is #37)","description":"The authors examine the best-selling books of the past 16 years, exploring common thematic threads that resonate with American readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ugMEvHHxYBQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus and the Word","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pHGpvQEACAAJ&dq=Jesus+and+the+Word&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An amateur's guide to the Messier objects","description":"Every amateur astronomer has at least heard of the many different catalogs of deep-sky objects; the most well known are the Messier, the Caldwell, the Herschel, and the NGC.

Wodehouse)","description":"An English comic novelist and short story writer, P. G. Wodehouse is best known as the creator of the young bachelor Bertie Wooster and his effortlessly superior manservant, Jeeves. Wodehouse penned over 90 books and secured a devoted readership across the world. His first success came as a writer of public school stories, based on his own childhood experiences, most notably introducing the strikingly original character, Psmith. These were followed by light romances, but in 1913, with the publication of the first Blandings Castle novel,  Something New , he turned to farce, which became his preferred genre of work. Wodehouse is celebrated for his scholarly command of the English sentence, blended with vivid, far-fetched imagery and the uproarious slang of the late Edwardian era.

Yet the literature and paintings of the nineteenth century depicted Hagar as white. During this period, she became a popular subject for writers and artists, with at least thirteen novels published between 1850 and 1913 taking Hagar as their theme. Dreaming Black/Writing White examines how, for white feminists, Hagar became a liberating symbol to empower their own rebellion against patriarchal restrictions. Hagar's understood blackness allowed her to represent a combination of sexual passion and artistic creativity that empowered women in the process of taking on male roles of economic power in American society. Because of Hagar's ethnic complexity, she stands as an ironically positive figure at the center of several southern proslavery women's novels such as The Deserted Wife, Hagar the Martyr, and The Modern Hagar. Through the persona of Hagar, women novelists felt free to create heroines whose suggestive blackness allowed readers to imagine themselves in rebellion against a restrictive patriarchy, but whose recoverable whiteness provided a safety hatch through which blackness could be disavowed. By exploring these complex and often contradictory depictions, Janet Gabler-Hover contends that the figure of Hagar is central to the canonized romance of nineteenth-century New England literature. The book also affirms Toni Morrison's claim that blackness--indeed black womanness--lies at the heart of the white literary imagination in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CtBZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dreaming+Black/Writing+White:+The+Hagar+Myth+in+American+Cultural+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghost Hollow mystery;","description":"A tall, dark ghost with one arm and one big red eye and a stolen rocking chair provide an exciting summer for Bucky and Christopher spending the summer at their grandmother's home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wfh0GQAACAAJ&dq=The+Ghost+Hollow+mystery%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ASP.NET Development with Dreamweaver MX: Visual QuickPro Guide","description":"In clear, direct language, reinforced by lots of visual aids, this task-based guide shows readers how to use Macromedia's popular Dreamweaver software (completely updated to support ASP.NET) within the .NET framework to create more powerful Web applications than ever before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3sJKeFNMDv8C&dq=ASP.NET+Development+with+Dreamweaver+MX:+Visual+QuickPro+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Mood","description":"Robert was surprised when he saw the atom blast on film, the mushroom cloud billowing up to the sky, so peaceful and final-looking.

Him sitting on one of the chairs against the wall, entranced, not just by the glimpses of thigh and garter belt, her skirt in a perpetual flying ruffle, but her energy, her hips and hands and every part of her so alive.

But then parenting needs caused her to make a decision to give her more time for her family. The reactions to her choice to leave Washington because of her kids led her to question the feminist narrative she grew up with. Her subsequent article for The Atlantic, 'Why Women Still Can't Have It All,' sparked intense debate and became one of the most-read pieces in the magazine's history. Now, in her refreshing and forthright voice, Anne-Marie Slaughter returns with her vision for what true equality between women and men really means, and how we can get there. She uncovers the missing piece of the puzzle, presenting a way in which both men and women can advance and thrive. With moving personal stories, individual action plans, and a broad outline for change, Anne-Marie Slaughter reveals a future in which all of us can finally finish the business of equality for women and men, work and family.

Her candid diary chronicles Kentucky's invasion by Confederates under General Braxton Bragg in 1862, Lexington's monthlong occupation by General Edmund Kirby Smith, and changes in attitude among the enslaved population following the Emancipation Proclamation. As troops from both North and South took turns holding the city, she repeatedly emphasized the rightness of the Union cause and minced no words in expressing her disdain for \\"the secesh.\\" Peter articulates many concerns common to Kentucky Unionists. Though she was an ardent supporter of the war against the Confederacy, Peter also worried that Lincoln's use of authority exceeded his constitutional rights. Her own attitudes toward Black people were ambiguous, as was the case with many people in that time. Peter's descriptions of daily events in an occupied city provide valuable insights and a unique feminine perspective on an underappreciated aspect of the war. Until her death in 1864, Peter conscientiously recorded the position and deportment of both Union and Confederate soldiers, incidents at the military hospitals, and stories from the countryside. Her account of a torn and divided region is a window to the war through the gaze of a young woman of intelligence and substance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7twPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fusebox: Developing ColdFusion Applications","description":"Developers face a constant struggle to launch projects on time and under budget, especially without pulling all-nighters.

Set within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett's mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret. \\"All good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we'd taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.\\" It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it's not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance and the subsequent cover-up will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt. In entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a \\"what if\\" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1PE0DwAAQBAJ&dq=Mothers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WORD BY WORD PRIMARY PHONICS PICTUR DICTNRY","description":"A systematic, phonics-based vocabulary development program in a lively and motivating picture dictionary format!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MQAyAAAACAAJ&dq=WORD+BY+WORD+PRIMARY+PHONICS+PICTUR+DICTNRY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Macroeconomics: A Primer","description":"This is a newly revised second edition of a key macroeconomic textbook.

Andrew Sean Greer, Pulitzer prize-winning author of Less \\"Heaven and Earth is a stunning achievement and confirms him as an electrifying presence in contemporary fiction.  Andr  Aciman, author of Call Me By Your Name and Find Me Every summer Teresa follows her father to his childhood home in Puglia, down in the heel of Italy, a land of relentless, shimmering heat, centuries-old olive groves and families who have lived there for generations. She spends long afternoons enveloped in a sunstruck stupor, reading her grandmother's paperbacks. Everything changes the summer she meets the three boys who live on the farm next door: Nicola, Tommaso and Bern - the man Teresa will love for the rest of her life. Raised like brothers on a farm that feels to Teresa almost suspended in time, the three boys share a complex, intimate and seemingly unassailable bond. But no bond is unbreakable and no summer truly endless, as Teresa soon discovers. Because there is resentment underneath the surface of that strange brotherhood, a twisted kind of love that protects a dark secret. And when Bern - the enigmatic, restless gravitational centre of the group - commits a brutal act of revenge, not even a final pilgrimage to the edge of the world will be enough to bring back those perfect, golden hours in the shadow of the olive trees. An unforgettable story of enduring love, the bonds between men, and the all-too-human search for meaning, Heaven and Earth is Paolo Giordano at his best: an author capable of unveiling the depths of the human soul, who has now given us the old-fashioned pleasure of a big, sprawling novel in which to lose ourselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lq2-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Until...","description":"In 1958 Detroit, pregnant Grace, best friend Julia, and stylish Malina are terror-stricken by the disappearance of a childlike neighbor under their care whose fate reveals sinister elements in their community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=debYCwAAQBAJ&dq=Until...&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort: Mothers, Professionals, and Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder","description":"Drawing on both poststructural discourse analysis and feminist standpoint theory, Malacrida makes a critical contribution to qualitative methodologies by developing a feminist discursive ethnography of the construction of AD(H)D in two divergent cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UkEhAVJAkjwC&dq=Cold+Comfort:+Mothers,+Professionals,+and+Attention+Deficit+(Hyperactivity)+Disorder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"la chatte","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rTN7nQAACAAJ&dq=la+chatte&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Portuguese Complete Course","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MyH6MgEACAAJ&dq=Teach+Yourself+Portuguese+Complete+Course&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anguish of the Blacksmith's Forge","description":"Larry Jaffe is one of my favorite poets.

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jesuits in North America in the seventeenth century (France and England in North America.

Made up of ascending levels of jungles, plains, medieval cities, and, at the top, a Garden of Eden, and populated by fantastical creatures, from nymphs and centaurs to merpeople and strange amalgams nonexistent on Earth, it s beyond anything Wolff could have imagined in his previous humdrum existence.

Wolff s journey to find Jadawin, the Lord of this world, will lead to answers about his own identity and determine his fate. Wolff and Kickaha will face off against feuding Lords who hold the power to control private worlds of their own design and the depraved Bellers. Devices originally created in the biolabs of the Lords, the Bellers are now conscious entities waging war on the Lords and their  pocket universes.

An evocative drama about a woman caught leading a double life after one husband murders the other, and the true-crime writer who becomes obsessed with telling her story this masterful work of literary suspense marks the debut of an extraordinary new writer The dance becomes an affair, which becomes a marriage, which becomes a murder... In 1985, Lore Rivera marries Andres Russo in Mexico City, even though she is already married to Fabian Rivera in Laredo, Texas, and they share twin sons. Through her career as an international banker, Lore splits her time between two countries and two families until the truth is revealed and one husband is arrested for murdering the other. In 2017, while trawling the internet for the latest, most sensational news reports, struggling true-crime writer Cassie Bowman encounters an article detailing that tragic final act. Cassie is immediately enticed by what is not explored: Why would a woman a mother risk everything for a secret double marriage?

First, we need to ask some questions about the rationale of the criminal sanction. What are we trying to do by defining conduct as criminal and punishing people who commit crimes? To what extent are we justified in thinking that we can or ought to do what we are trying to do? Is it possible to construct an acceptable rationale for the criminal sanction enabling us to deal with the argument that it is itself an unethical use of social power? And if it is possible, what implications does that rationale have for the kind of conceptual creature that the criminal law is? Questions of this order make up Part I of the book, which is essentially an extended essay on the nature and justification of the criminal sanction. We also need to understand, so the argument continues, the characteristic processes through which the criminal sanction operates. What do the rules of the game tell us about what the state may and may not do to apprehend, charge, convict, and dispose of persons suspected of committing crimes? Here, too, there is great controversy between two groups who have quite different views, or models, of what the criminal process is all about. There are people who see the criminal process as essentially devoted to values of efficiency in the suppression of crime. There are others who see those values as subordinate to the protection of the individual in his confrontation with the state. A severe struggle over these conflicting values has been going on in the courts of this country for the last decade or more. How that struggle is to be resolved is a second major consideration that we need to take into account before tackling the question of the limits of the criminal sanction. These problems of process are examined in Part II. Part III deals directly with the central problem of defining criteria for limiting the reach of the criminal sanction. Given the constraints of rationale and process examined in Parts I and II, it argues that we have over-relied on the criminal sanction and that we had better start thinking in a systematic way about how to adjust our commitments to our capacities, both moral and operational.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gncxJvRGyR0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Danish, Compact: Learn to Speak and Understand Danish with Pimsleur Language Programs","description":"Beginner's Danish offers basic language instruction in the national language of Denmark, presenting grammar, vocabulary, and common phrases in clear, concise lessons.

Burmese Days focuses on a handful of Englishmen who meet at the European Club to drink whisky and to alleviate the acute and unspoken loneliness of life in 1920s Burma where Orwell himself served as an imperial policeman during the waning days of British imperialism. One of the men, James Flory, a timber merchant, has grown soft, clearly comprehending the futility of England s rule. However, he lacks the fortitude to stand up for his Indian friend, Dr. Veraswami, for admittance into the whites-only club. Without membership and the accompanying prestige that would protect the doctor, the condemning and ill-founded attack by a bitter magistrate might bring an end to everything he has accomplished. Complicating matters, Flory falls unexpectedly in love with a newly arrived English girl, Elizabeth Lackersteen. Can he find the strength to do right not only by his friend, but also by his conscience?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iWMHl07OUoUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows Nt 4 Advanced Programming (Windows Nt Professional Library)","description":"Accompanying CD-ROM has all the source code and executable files from the book in the Book subdirectory.

In order to exploit BIM methods to their full potential, a fundamental grasp of their key principles and applications is essential. Accordingly, this book combines discussions of theoretical foundations with reports from the industry on currently applied best practices. The book s content is divided into six parts: Part I discusses the technological basics of BIM and addresses computational methods for the geometric and semantic modeling of buildings, as well as methods for process modeling. Next, Part II covers the important aspect of the interoperability of BIM software products and describes in detail the standardized data format Industry Foundation Classes. It presents the different classification systems, discusses the data format CityGML for describing 3D city models and COBie for handing over data to clients, and also provides an overview of BIM programming tools and interfaces. Part III is dedicated to the philosophy, organization and technical implementation of BIM-based collaboration, and discusses the impact on legal issues including construction contracts. In turn, Part IV covers a wide range of BIM use cases in the different lifecycle phases of a built facility, including the use of BIM for design coordination, structural analysis, energy analysis, code compliance checking, quantity take-off, prefabrication, progress monitoring and operation. In Part V, a number of design and construction companies report on the current state of BIM adoption in connection with actual BIM projects, and discuss the approach pursued for the shift toward BIM, including the hurdles taken. Lastly, Part VI summarizes the book s content and provides an outlook on future developments. The book was written both for professionals using or programming such tools, and for students in Architecture and Construction Engineering programs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t3dvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Find It Fast Bible Topics","description":"When you want to find a key Bible topic fast, turn to Explore Your Bible it provides nearly 2,500 references on 199 important subjects.

Witness, for the first time in this series, a duel between two great samurai, in the slow, contemplative tradition. Observe Asa's extremely precise sword stroke. And read a charming story of a young peace officer who practices the use of his specialized weaponry to the point of utilitarian, life-saving perfection.

But McClendon has a chauffeur, Ronnie Gordon, and Ronnie Gordon has an enemy, Peanut Shoke, whom Gordon ratted out and who subsequently spent several very unpleasant years in prison. More to the point, Peanut has a friend and partner in petty crime, Ray Justus, and if the two of them could somehow step on Ronnie Gordon and at the same time step between his boss and a pile of money, so much the better. But there's also Dunbarton Oakes, ineffectual director of the soon-to-be-defunct foundation, whose Ivy League veneer will crack when he realizes that Schiller has gone \\"off the reservation.\\" And there's Plank, Schiller's demented lieutenant.

Jung and she was also a part of his Zurich circle from the 1930's through the 1950's. She kept a diary, recording the details of her psychoanalytic sessions with Jung along with her inner and outer experiences. 'Onkel' (Uncle), as Jung was known to her, became an integral part of her life in those years and he, his family and their friends all figure prominently in her life story as it unfolds in these pages. The journals include descriptions of therapy sessions, interpretations of dreams, sketches, letters, fragments of dialogue and Katy's reflections on how her life was developing. There are stories from the famous Psychological Club of Zurich, the Eranos Conferences in Ascona and other historic occasions in the circle around Jung. This fascinating account provides a rare portrait of Jung's Zurich in those creative years and of the life of a unique individual as she - with the help of her psychoanalyst - coped with life's vicissitudes.

Many decades before George R. R. Martin s Game of Thrones, Grand Master Fritz Leiber ruled the sword-and-sorcery universe. These three short story collections chronicle the unconventional adventures of Leiber s endearing antiheroes: barbarian Fafhrd and former wizard s apprentice, the Gray Mouser. Swords and Deviltry: Fafhrd, a handsome barbarian of the Steppes, is seduced by a beautiful prostitute and her equally intoxicating city, while the Gray Mouser, a slum rat wizard-in-training, is tempted by the dark arts. The two men meet on a night of multiple thieveries and an enduring partnership is born. Swords Against Death: Rogue swordsmen and devoted companions Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser pursue ill-gotten fortunes within the confines of Lankhmar. They cross paths with two wizards, Sheelba of the Eyeless Face and Ningauble of the Seven Eyes, and a most violent clash ensues. Eventually, following further adventures, the two antiheroes end up as indentured swordsman servants to their former foes.

In this book, William Cooper outlines a theory of rationality in which logical law emerges as an intrinsic aspect of evolutionary biology. This biological perspective on logic, though at present unorthodox, could change traditional ideas about the reasoning process. Cooper examines the connections between logic and evolutionary biology and illustrates how logical rules are derived directly from evolutionary principles, and therefore have no independent status of their own. Laws of decision theory, utility theory, induction, and deduction are reinterpreted as natural consequences of evolutionary processes. Cooper's connection of logical law to evolutionary theory ultimately results in a unified foundation for an evolutionary science of reason. It will be of interest to professionals and students of philosophy of science, logic, evolutionary theory, and cognitive science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VW0Gzwx2O3IC&dq=The+Evolution+of+Reason:+Logic+as+a+Branch+of+Biology+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Philosophy+and+Biology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Knight : The Twilight of the Middle Ages and the Birth of the Modern Era","description":"There may not be a more fascinating a historical period than the late fourteenth century in Europe. The Hundred Years' War ravaged the continent, yet gallantry, chivalry, and literary brilliance flourished in the courts of England and elsewhere. It was a world in transition, soon to be replaced by the Renaissance and the Age of Exploration -- and John of Gaunt was its central figure. In today's terms, John of Gaunt was a multibillionaire with a brand name equal to Rockefeller. He fought in the Hundred Years' War, sponsored Chaucer and proto-Protestant religious thinkers, and survived the dramatic Peasants' Revolt, during which his sumptuous London residence was burned to the ground. As head of the Lancastrian branch of the Plantagenet family, Gaunt was the unknowing father of the War of the Roses; after his death, his son usurped the crown from his nephew, Richard II. Gaunt's adventures represent the culture and mores of the Middle Ages as those of few others do, and his death is portrayed in The Last Knight as the end of that enthralling period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zCTkufnT__AC&dq=The+Last+Knight+:+The+Twilight+of+the+Middle+Ages+and+the+Birth+of+the+Modern+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pierre et Gilles: Sailors & Sea (Icons Series)","description":"Bizarre and full of obscure significance, glitter, flowers, and hearts, these portraits are reminiscent of still from film.

Traditioning has been ineffective thus far because the richness of Pentecostal faith and experience has been inadequately captured in the classical Pentecostal doctrines of Spirit-baptism and glossolalia. A more adequate understanding of the key theological symbol of Pentecostalism, glossolalia, emerges when it is interpreted in the light of Christian spiritual tradition. Within this larger tradition glossolalia can be seen as bringing together both the ascetical and contemplative dimensions of the Christian life.

Covered in detail is Dogme's genesis, when, in 1995, Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier, acclaimed director of Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, and three fellow Danish directors swore to reject the norm of slick, emotionally manipulative, high-concept, and bombastic movie productions. Explained is the Dogme95 philosophy, which entails a return to basic filmmaking through the use of natural lighting and handheld cameras, and the refusal to use special effects, soundtracks, and movie sets. The films and filmmakers of the Dogme movement are discussed, including Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration), Harmony Korine (Julien Donkey-Boy), Lone Scherfig (Italian for Beginners), and Susanne Bier (Open Hearts). Dogme's debt to previous film waves is explored, as is the impact Dogme has had on current trends in cinema and on today's young filmmakers.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=alcbAQAAIAAJ&dq=Dogme+Uncut:+Lars+von+Trier,+Thomas+Vinterberg,+and+the+Gang+That+Took+on+Hollywood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day the Cowboys Quit (Texas Tradition Series)","description":"The conflict between the Eastern investor and the Yankee character results in the 1883 West Texas cowboy strike","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jQw6Khkvc9oC&dq=The+Day+the+Cowboys+Quit+(Texas+Tradition+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NASCAR Track and Travel Guide","description":"With 70 million fans, NASCAR is the #2 spectator sport, after football.

But democratization does not ensure better representation for everyone, and indeed some sectors of society are ill-equipped to take advantage of these new opportunities. Small industry in Mexico, Kenneth Shadlen shows, is an excellent example of a sector whose representation decreased during democratization. Shadlen s analysis focuses on the basic characteristics of small firms that complicate the process of securing representation in both authoritarian and democratic environments. He then shows how increased pluralism and electoral competition served to exacerbate the political problems facing the sector during the course of democratization in Mexico. These characteristics created problems for small firms both in acting collectively through interest associations and civil society organizations and in wielding power within political parties. The changes that democratization effected in the structure of corporatism put small industry at a significant disadvantage in the policy-making arena even while there was general agreement on the crucial importance of this sector in the new neoliberal economy, especially for generating employment. The final chapter extends the analysis by making comparisons with the experience of small industry representation in Argentina and Brazil. Shadlen uses extensive interviews and archival research to provide new evidence and insights on the difficult challenges of interest aggregation and representation for small industry. He conducted interviews with a wide range of owners and managers of small firms, state and party officials, and leaders of business associations and civil society organizations. He also did research at the National Archives in Mexico City and in the archives of the most important business organizations for small industry in the post-World War II period.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxLrCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Grows the Heather in Devon (Secrets of Heatherleigh Hall, 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The life power and how to use it","description":"The sun gives forth to us heat and light rays, without which this old world could never be.

Michener the Japanese print has found its ideal commentator. Combining the finished literary style of an outstanding novelist with a mature knowledge of his subject, he is able to bring this great art form to life in words, directly communicating his understanding, love, and enthusiasm rather than obscuring his subject in pedantry. In fact, it might almost be said that he here lets the prints speak for themselves, in a wealth of magnificent illustrations and apt but unobtrusive commentary. It is only when one has finished the book that he realizes he has been conducted on a tour of three centuries of art, a tour so carefully arranged as to give a deep understanding of the history and aesthetics of Japanese prints, a new appreciation of a superlative art. The book has many other unique features. So far as consonant with his aim of presenting a full survey, Mr. Michener has illustrated the book with lesser-known masterpieces rather than with those few prints that have been reproduced almost ad nauseam. Unlike earlier books, this does not stop with the past century, but brings the subject completely up to date, introducing, in the modern Japanese print, some of the most exciting art being created in Japan and in the world today. The book also becomes a revealing account of the collecting of Japanese prints, with many valuable hints to collectors based upon the author's own experiences in gathering together one of the best print collections of recent years: it is a collecting field in which many hints are needed, with prices varying from $5 to $5,000 per print, and with forgeries and doubtful attributions on every hand.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JZLTAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Bonnie Bride","description":"New York Times bestselling author Hannah Howell traverses the embattled border between England and Scotland, where two warring families prolong centuries of discord. . .

InWomen and Dieting Culture, sociologist Kandi Stinson asks how these values are transmitted and how the women who join such organizations actually think about their bodies and weight loss. As part of her research, Stinson fully participated in a national, commercial weight-loss organization as a paying member. Her acute analysis and sensitive insider's portrayal vividly illustrate the central roles dieting and body image play in women's lives. As she experiences the program and interviews other members, Stinson discovers that the women view the causes and cures of being overweight according to five distinct, though often overlapping, concepts: self-help, work, religion, addiction, and feminism. Drawing extensively on the dieters' own words, Stinson explores each of these concepts and outlines how they form interrelated patterns which, when analyzed, yield an exciting new perspective on the transmission of cultural values.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AOC4SOD4Yq0C&dq=Women+and+Dieting+Culture:+Inside+a+Commercial+Weight+Loss+Group&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Trust: How to Get It!

The book examines six countries Chile, China, India, Mexico, Singapore, and the United States exploring how each one defines, supports, and cultivates those competencies that students will need in order to succeed in the current century.

This book s crucial contribution to the burgeoning field of international education arises out of its special attention to first principles and thus to first questions: As Reimers and Chung explain,  much can be gained by an explicit investigation of the intended purposes of education, in what they attempt to teach students, and in the related questions of why those purposes and how they are achieved.  These questions are crucial to education practice and reform at a time when educators (and the students they serve) face unique, pressing challenges.

They oil the wheels of diplomacy, smooth the paths of the ambitious, and spread joy at family celebrations. They lift the spirits, involve all our senses and, at times, transport us to other fantastical worlds. Some feasts have given rise to hilarious misunderstandings, at others competitive elements take over. Some are purely for pleasure, some connect uncomfortably with death, but all are interesting. Nichola Fletcher has written a captivating history of feasts and entertaining throughout the ages that includes the dramatic failures along with the dazzling successes. From a humble meal of potatoes provided by an angel, to the extravagance of the high medieval and Renaissance tables groaning with red deer and wild boar, to the exquisite refinement of the Japanese tea ceremony, Charlemagne's Tablecloth covers them all. In her gustatory exploration of history's great feasting tables, Fletcher also answers more than a few riddles, such as \\"Why did Charlemagne use an asbestos tablecloth at his feasts?\\" and \\"Where did the current craze for the elegant Japanese Kaiseki meal begin?\\" Fletcher answers these questions and many more while inviting readers to a feasting table that extends all the way from Charlemagne's castle to her own millennium feast in Scotland. This is an eclectic collection of food and feasts from the flamboyant to the eccentric, the delicious to the disgusting, and sometimes just the touchingly ordinary. For anyone who has ever sat down at a banquet dining table and wondered, \\"Why?\\" Nichola Fletcher provides the delicious answer in a book that is a feast all its own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-v5kAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bohemian Style","description":"Bohemian style is characterized by free-flowing fabrics, bright colours and a multitude of clashing patterns.

Forget about famous designers and carefully planned decorating schemes - boho is a style often built up over time and is the antithesis of trend-following.

Working through the house one room at a time, it highlights classic items of furniture and signature accessories, from chandeliers and kilims to plants and lanterns.

Yeats fell in love with a young Irish actress, Maud Gonne. Despite her refusal to marry him, he continued to write poems that ensure her lasting fame. The majority of his letters to Gonne were destroyed by the British when they ransacked her Dublin home, but those that remain show how deeply distressed he was when she married John MacBride. Yet he celebrated her beauty, shared her devotion to the Irish cause, interested her in mysticism, shared visions with her and entered into a spiritual marriage with her. Her own letters reveal her tempestuous private life involving a love affair with Lucien Millevoye, a French politician and journalist and father of their two children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pihkAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Gonne-Yeats+Letters+1893-1938+(Irish+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bess and Bella","description":"Bess is feeling terribly lonely when out of the sky tumbles a bird named Bella, her tiny suitcases packed with all manner of wonderful things.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ti9aAAAAYAAJ&dq=Bess+and+Bella&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rimming the Mediterranean","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EGKYGQAACAAJ&dq=Rimming+the+Mediterranean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Usborne History of the Twentieth Century (History of the Modern World)","description":"Introduces the major events and people in world history in the twentieth century, and discusses developments in technology, the arts, and society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5wPEdhOdEuYC&dq=The+Usborne+History+of+the+Twentieth+Century+(History+of+the+Modern+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lorax (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Easy-to-read, rhyming text introduces the Lorax and the place he calls home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T8G7YZUVHooC&dq=The+Lorax+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The making of a frontier: Five years' experiences and adventures in Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Chitral, and the eastern Hindu-Kush","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i6pJAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time to Say \\"Please\\"!","description":"Narrated by a group of friendly mice, an amusing book provides preschoolers with an entertaining introduction to manners through helpful demonstrations of when certain words and phrases, such as \\"excuse me\\" and \\"please,\\" are used in social situations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hc8-nwEACAAJ&dq=Time+to+Say+%22Please%22!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aeschylus: Eumenides (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)","description":"Professor Sommerstein presents here a freshly constituted text, with introduction and commentary, of Eumenides, the final play in Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XNTMyBWUxnIC&dq=Aeschylus:+Eumenides+(Cambridge+Greek+and+Latin+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-New Hints from Heloise Updated (Perigee)","description":"For over thirty years Heloise's column \\"Hints from Heloise\\" has been an American institution, read by millions daily.

Many times this happens with or without any actual input by that unsuspecting human being. Frank E. Burdett is one such person. He volunteered and joined the New Zealand Army to fi ght the Terrorists in the jungles of Malaysia. In one single night, his life changed forever when a man-eating tiger chose him as its next victim. Frank was attacked, mauled and dragged backwards along the rough and uneven jungle fl oor. This experience is related in his book,  Sons of the Brave . Frank was diagnosed with terminal metastasized melanoma cancer. In July 2010 he was given 6 months to live after surgery and radiation treatment for cancer of both lungs, liver and bowel; but he then decided to undertake an alternative medical treatment and has been, to date, four years free of any cancer. He was encouraged to write his story by a leading oncologist in Brisbane in order to help other cancer victims. That book is entitled  I Survived Metastacised Melanoma Cancer!   The Purple Tree  was written during his recovery period and allowed him to freely research his material, through friends, neighbours and well-meaning Australians.

Perry and Ashton B. Carter, two of the world's foremost defense authorities, draw on their experience as leaders of the U.S. Defense Department to propose a new American security strategy for the twenty-first century. After a century in which aggression had to be defeated in two world wars and then deterred through a prolonged cold war, the authors argue for a strategy centered on prevention. Now that the cold war is over, it is necessary to rethink the risks to U.S. security. The A list--threats to U.S. survival--is empty today. The B list--the two major regional contingencies in the Persian Gulf and on the Korean peninsula that dominate Pentagon planning and budgeting--pose imminent threats to U.S. interests but not to survival. And the C list--such headline-grabbing places as Kosovo, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti--includes important contingencies that indirectly affect U.S. security but do not directly threaten U.S. interests. Thus the United States is enjoying a period of unprecedented peace and influence; but foreign policy and defense leaders cannot afford to be complacent. The authors' preventive defense strategy concentrates on the dangers that, if mismanaged, have the potential to grow into true A-list threats to U.S. survival in the next century. These include Weimar Russia: failure to establish a self-respecting place for the new Russia in the post-cold war world, allowing it to descend into chaos, isolation, and aggression as Germany did after World War I; Loose Nukes: failure to reduce and secure the deadly legacy of the cold war--nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union; A Rising China Turned Hostile: failure to shape China's rise to Asian superpower status so that it emerges as a partner rather than an adversary; Proliferation: spread of weapons of mass destruction; and Catastrophic Terrorism: increase in the scope and intensity of transnational terrorism.They also argue for better management of the defense establishment so the United States will retain a strong military prepared to cope with all contingencies, deter aggressors, and win a conflict if deterrence fails.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IWKa4BLJ8WIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Urban Geography: A Global Perspective","description":"For the first time in the history of humankind, urban dwellers outnumber rural residents and this trend is destined to continue.

And it is the only account afforded full access to the designers, engineers, dealers, and company leaders who molded the cars and the brand.The Lexus Story takes readers deep inside the making of first-class automobiles, from the creative sparks kindled in Lexus' far-flung design studios to the engineering refinements that translate ideals of performance and luxury into steel, glass, and rubber.

This monograph is devoted to a number of these problems, namely, to studies of the radioactive fallout composition, the formation of the aerosol particles that transport the radioactive products and to the analysis of the external radiation doses resulting from nuclear explosions and/or accidents. Problems of restoration and rehabilitation of contaminated land areas are also touched upon in the monograph. To solve such problems one requires knowledge of the mobility of radionuclides, an understanding of their uptake by plants, their transportation within the food chain and finally their uptake by animal and/or human organisms. The results of many years of study of radioactive fallout from atmospheric and underground nuclear explosions and accidents are summarized in this book. It is intended for various specialists - geophysicists, ecologists, health experts and inspectors, as well as those who are concerned with radioactive contamination of natural environments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LItzN3tYwBIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ugly Russian","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XF4pv-jDWa0C&dq=The+Ugly+Russian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history and power of mind","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WmJSnQEACAAJ&dq=The+history+and+power+of+mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Czech","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H_MKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Contemporary+Czech&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Family's Changing (A First Look At Series)","description":"Inevitably divorce is difficult for children.

In a word: that they may live the blessed Eucharist, the sacrifice and the sacrament, in its entirety, and that by living it they may sanctify themselves more and more, for that is the will of God: Haec est voluntas Dei, sanctificatio vestra (I Thess. IV, 3). In writing these pages, I have been inspired by a heartfelt desire to do something for the good of souls: to make the holy Mass better known and consequently more deeply loved and lived, for it is the centre of all our worship, the soul of our religion, the complete programme of our sanctity and a wonderful summary of dogma and morals. If I succeed in this I shall have co-operated in spreading the kingdom of God among men and disposed recognition of God's rights over their lives. - From the Preface","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bOomzgEACAAJ&dq=Mass+and+the+interior+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dharma: That Illuminates All Beings Impartially Like the Light of the Sun and the Moon","description":"The Dharma is the first major collection of teachings by Kalu Rinpoche, a great meditation master in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.

Strengthening this link is key to building a strong sense of affiliation and a more productive workforce. The author provides frameworks for characterizing the workforce, listening to the organization, using inclusion as a key differentiator, and applying mathematical modeling techniques to explore and quantify related areas. We are entering an era when it makes sense to move away from mere retention strategies of control and toward more mutually beneficial strategies of affiliation. This trend can be traced to the recognition of the knowledge worker's influence and the value of human capital in today's economy. To succeed in this emerging work world, organizational leaders and human resource professionals must create new relationships with individuals built around the concept of affiliation. This will mean changed roles and behaviors that respect mutual interests, and will require a culture of inclusion expressed internally through workforce diversity, externally through workforce partnerships, at a community level through philanthropy, and globally through the pursuit of a greater good.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VSXsr7twqO4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A+ Certification DVD CertTrainer","description":"A comprehensive A+ Computer Based Training (CBT) and exam simulator software package offers in-depth coverage of all new A+ Core Hardware and Operating System Technologies exam topics, more than 350 questions on CD-ROM, instructor training on DVD-ROM, an electronic A+ glossary, and other valuable features.

Have you ever noticed that in just about every Mac book, the author will include a couple of tips in each chapter (you'll usually find them in the sidebar, or at the bottom of the page in a tinted box). Sometimes it's a shortcut, a faster way to do something, or a clever workaround that just makes your life easier. People really love those tips, but there's only one problem--there's never enough of them. That's why Scott Kelby, bestselling author and Editor-in-Chief of Mac Design magazine came up with the idea to create a book that?s nothing but ?sidebar? tips. That's right--this entire book, cover-to-cover is packed with nothing but those cool inside secrets, slick workarounds, undocumented shortcuts, and sneaky little tricks that will make you faster, better, and have more fun using Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger).

By turns searing and meditative, these are lyrics concerned with the matter of the world, its physicality, but also attuned to the proximity of each moment, each thing, to the spiritual. Here, there is sex, grief, and loss, but also a committed dedication to life, hope and renewal. Drawing on the religious, the sacred and the profane, this is a collection in which men meet in the woods, where matter is corrupted and remade. There are prayers, hymns, vespers, incantations, and longer poems which attempt to propel themselves towards the transcendent. In this book, there is always the sense of fragility allied with strength, a violence harnessed and unleashed. The collection ends with a series of elegies for the poet's father: in the face of despair, we are met with a fierce brightness, and a reclamation of the spiritual. 'This is when / we make God, and speak in his voice.' Paying close attention to altered states and the consolations and strangeness of the natural world, this is the first book from a major poet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-9SnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gamma-rays of radionuclides in order of increasing energy.","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Responding to the challenges brought by colonialism and modernization, they propose new conceptions and interpretations of Islam consonant with the age. Although their specific concerns and emphases vary, their thought shares certain features; a reconsideration of the relation between religion and politics; an easy incorporation of modern Western ideas; a reinterpretaton of sacred sources which highlights their more universalist elements; and a conception of Islam as moving with historical change whilst remaining rooted in Qur'anic values. Disputing the widespread view of modern Islam as essentially political, the book shows a quite different face of the tradition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5jnYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Islam+and+Modernity:+Muslim+Intellectuals+Respond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sequential Spelling 7 (Sequential Spelling)","description":"Teacher's guide for Sequential Spelling level 2, revised edition","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OMyFuQAACAAJ&dq=Sequential+Spelling+7+(Sequential+Spelling)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Body Talk System: The Missing Link to Optimum Health","description":"What do you get when you combine the wisdom of advanced yoga, the energy dynamics of acupuncture, the clinical findings of applied kinesiology, and Western medical expertise?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JpKZ4fc9inUC&dq=The+Body+Talk+System:+The+Missing+Link+to+Optimum+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I love a Roosevelt","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HW9-QgAACAAJ&dq=I+love+a+Roosevelt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind the green door ([Penny Parker mystery stories)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_uenQEACAAJ&dq=Behind+the+green+door+(%5BPenny+Parker+mystery+stories)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor No","description":"In 1998, Dr. Louis J.

The fact to which he pointed was the loss of a feeling for the divine majesty, for the infinite and terrifying character of God's mystery, for the divine holiness which transcends everything intellectual and moral. The problem of the hidden God is the focus around which the divinity of the divine has been rediscover in our time. This makes Professor Dillenberger's book extremely important. By showing the diverse ways in which modern theologians understood and used Luther's notion of the hidden God, this book discloses the struggle for a new understanding and the two main ways in which the concept is conceived. Sometimes God is understood as hidden behind his revelation in Christ, as abysmal, ineffable, as the \\"naked God\\" before whom no man can stand. Included is the God of the mystery of predestination and of the eternal destiny of man. There is, however, another understanding of the hiddenness of God. The paradox of the cross and the working of God according to the law of contrast, make him hidden and leave him open only for faith. Power in weakness, glory in suffering, life in death show how hidden he is. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

As a fresh recruit to an Alaskan touring company, he faces a summer of unknown adventure and, along with two of his companions from the  Outside,  gets to know southeast Alaska through his tour-guiding, excursions to sites of  local color  and the occasional fishing mishap. Kris returns for another summer of touring in 1987, this time to Skagway, Alaska, launching site of the Klondike Gold Rush. Here, Kris and his friends take up residence in a retired Gold Rush-era brothel and begin to dig deeply into the local experience, not only through touring but also via Slow-Bicycle Racing, sauna expeditions in the Dyea bush, Hot Red Onions and a backcountry trek over the historic Chilkoot Trail. In the summer of 1988, Kris is assigned as a guide out of Fairbanks, Alaska. He is quickly accepted into the fraternity of long-haul tour drivers as he begins to make the circuit among Fairbanks, Dawson City, Denali National Park and many other locales. Then, in the tiny hamlet of Tok, Alaska, he meets a very unlikely person: Genna, the woman of his dreams. Their ensuing romance takes them from midnight gardening to a Summer Solstice party, through a devastating forest fire and, ultimately, to a promise to spend an Alaskan winter together, in a remote cabin near Skagway. The winter of 1988-1989 tests Kris  mettle in a wholly new way, as he and Genna explore the vagaries of living  among the elements  together. They manage to survive, and even thrive, despite indiscriminate icestorms, unheated Volkswagens and frosty outdoor privies  with their relationship, and their sanity, more or less intact. And, as the springtime finally dawns, Kris begins to realize that, rather than being  just  a tour guide, he is becoming a true Alaskan, in every sense.  How Heavy Is The Mountain  is a palette of tones, styles and themes. At once it is erudite and offbeat, informative and entertaining. Within its pages a reader encounters narrative travel writing, miniature wildlife treatises, poetry, pointless drinking songs and highly personalized storytelling. Overall, the story is told with warmth, humor and an affection for its subjects: in particular, the great land that is Alaska.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O2KbnmF5OlsC&dq=How+Heavy+is+the+Mountain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Take a Chance on Me (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1599)","description":"\\"WILL YOU MARRY ME?\\" Those were the words Jenny Farber had always longed to hear Zack Decker say.

Wright organized the majority of these exhibitions himself and viewed them as crucial to his self-presentation as his extensive writings. He used them to promote his designs, appeal to new viewers, and persuade his detractors. Wright on Exhibit presents the first history of this neglected aspect of the architect s influential career. Drawing extensively from Wright s unpublished correspondence, Kathryn Smith challenges the preconceived notion of Wright as a self-promoter who displayed his work in search of money, clients, and fame. She shows how he was an artist-architect projecting an avant-garde program, an innovator who expanded the palette of installation design as technology evolved, and a social activist driven to revolutionize society through design. While Wright s earliest exhibitions were largely for other architects, by the 1930s he was creating public installations intended to inspire debate and change public perceptions about architecture. The nature of his exhibitions expanded with the times beyond models, drawings, and photographs to include more immersive tools such as slides, film, and even a full-scale structure built especially for his 1953 retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. Placing Wright s exhibitions side by side with his writings, Smith shows how integral these exhibitions were to his vision and sheds light on the broader discourse concerning architecture and modernism during the first half of the twentieth century. Wright on Exhibit features color renderings, photos, and plans, as well as a checklist of exhibitions and an illustrated catalog of extant and lost models made under Wright s supervision.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u0ZpEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dairy Cow Today: U.

The life of Sarah Towles Reed (18821978) illuminates and parallels many of these transformations. Over the course of her long public life as a teacher, labor union lobbyist, and activist for the rights of public school teachers, Reed emerged as a groundbreaking leader, unafraid of taking on the educational and political hierarchies of the South. A Will of Her Own is the life story of a woman who had a lasting impact on her times as well as the story of the times themselves. Reed engaged the most significant concerns of the liberal reformers during the first half of the twentieth century the struggle for economic independence for women and the fight for women's rights, the effort to maintain intellectual freedom in the face of cold war paranoia, and the pursuit of racial justice. Her successes, as well as her failures, lend a personal perspective to these national trends. Her career also helps to clarify what it meant to be a southern liberal in the twentieth century and how the region's peculiar circumstances shaped the politics and strategies of southern reformers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T1CQJVLEhI0C&dq=A+Will+of+Her+Own&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of the Old Railwaymen","description":"Steam trains hold a nostalgic appeal for a great many people.

Iran's contact with Europe in the nineteenth century produced largely imaginary ideas about European culture and literature. In a series of textual maneuvers and cultural contestations, successive generations of Iranian intellectuals sought to recast the classical tradition in a mold at once modern and relevant to their concerns. In particular, Karimi proposes a revision of the view that sets the Modernist poet Nima Yushij as the single-handed inventor of \\"New Poetry.\\" This view, he argues, has resulted in an exaggerated sense of the esthetic gulf between the modernist poetry of Iran and classical Persian poetry. Through a number of close readings of works by Nima's predecessors, Karimi makes visible a century-old Persian poetic tradition with Nima as its culmination.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d4CBAAAAIAAJ&dq=Recasting+Persian+Poetry:+Scenarios+of+Poetic+Modernity+in+Iran&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Western Civilization: Since 1789","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mi cocina, a la manera de Caracas (Spanish Edition)","description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of The End of Power comes an edge-of-your-seat political thriller about rival spies, dangerous love, and one of history's most devastating revolutions. Venezuela, 1992. Unknown colonel Hugo Ch vez stages an ill-fated coup against a corrupt government, igniting the passions of Venezuela's poor and catapulting the oil-rich country to international attention. For two rival spies hurriedly dispatched to Caracas--one from Washington, DC, and the other from Fidel Castro's Cuba--this is a career-defining mission. Smooth-talking Iv n Rinc n of Cuba's Intelligence Directorate needs a rebel ally to secure the future of his own country. His job: support Ch vez and the revolution by rallying the militants and neutralizing any opposing agents. Meanwhile, the CIA's Cristina Garza will do everything in her power to cut Ch vez's influence short. Her priority: stabilize the greatest oil reserves on the planet by ferreting out and eliminating Cuba's principal operative. As Ch vez surges to power, Iv n and Cristina are caught in the fallout of a toxic political time bomb: an intrepid female reporter and unwitting informant, a drug lord and key architect in Ch vez's rise, and personal entanglements between the spies themselves. With everything at stake, the adversaries find themselves at the center of a game of espionage, seduction, murder, and shifting alliances playing out against the precarious backdrop of a nation in free fall.

Bonny Norton demonstrates that a poststructuralist conception of identity as multiple, a site of struggle, and subject to change across time and place is highly productive for understanding language learning. Her sociological construct of investment is an important complement to psychological theories of motivation. The implications for language teaching and teacher education are profound. Now including a new, comprehensive Introduction as well as an Afterword by Claire Kramsch, this second edition addresses the following central questions: - Under what conditions do language learners speak, listen, read and write? - How are relations of power implicated in the negotiation of identity? - How can teachers address the investments and imagined identities of learners? The book integrates research, theory, and classroom practice, and is essential reading for students, teachers and researchers in the fields of language learning and teaching, TESOL, applied linguistics and literacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4dkDAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elsie's Motherhood (Elsie Dinsmore Collection)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qjkCAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete book of chess openings (Chess students' library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F82CMQEACAAJ&dq=Complete+book+of+chess+openings+(Chess+students%27+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hop on Pop (I Can Read It All by Myself Beginner Books (Prebound))","description":"Join Dr. Seuss's Thing One and Thing Two as they give thanks for the simple pleasures of the season--from the leaves they rake to the pies they bake!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SPNIEAAAQBAJ&dq=Hop+on+Pop+(I+Can+Read+It+All+by+Myself+Beginner+Books+(Prebound))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Titanic: The Complete Book of the Musical","description":"(Applause Books).

Readers will find informative entries on slang terms such as Beltway bandit and boondoggle, angry white male and leg treasurer, juice bill and Joe Citizen, banana superpower and the Big Fix.

Each entry includes the definition of the word, its historical background, and illuminating citations, some going back more than 200 years.

Investors are looking for downside protection while maintaining good returns--and market-neutral investing has become one of the hottest methods to meet that need. In this book, industry expert Joseph G. Nicholas explores new approaches to return enhancement and risk reduction through market-neutral strategies. Market-neutral investments are attractive because they have produced substantially better risk-adjusted returns than the market during the past ten years. The complexities created by the combination of longs, shorts, and leverage, however, make market-neutral strategies very different from conventional investments. Getting to know how these strategies work involves breaking them down into their basic components and then examining how those parts interact as a system with specific behavior characteristics. This book examines eight key strategies, revealing the source of their past returns and giving the investor tools with which to measure the possibility of repeat performance. Nicholas draws extensively on his company's database of over three thousand hedge funds and from the daily portfolio analysis conducted for hedge fund portfolios. He has also incorporated extensive input and actual investment examples provided by managers and practitioners of each of the strategies discussed in the book.

Hard on the heels of Dead I Well May Be -- which Booklist named \\"one of the top ten crime fiction debuts of the year,\\" and which established Adrian McKinty as the perfect new find for fans of Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly -- McKinty's tightly paced Hidden River displays his unerring gift for crafting powerhouse literary thrillers. Alexander Lawson is a former detective for Northern Ireland's police force and a rising star at cracking difficult cases. After he is assigned to the force's dangerous, corruption-ridden drug squad, he becomes addicted to heroin -- under unusual circumstances. Forced to resign in disgrace, Alex is twenty-four and still entrapped by the needle when he learns that his high school love, beautiful Victoria Patawasti, has been murdered in drought-scorched Denver, Colorado. Victoria's family begs Alex to investigate the case, and he seizes the opportunity to fly to America for a chance at redemption. Soon the bodies begin to pile up, and Alex is forced to go on the run after the only credible lead to Victoria's murderer is accidentally killed. Wanted by both the Colorado cops and the British police, who believe he has information about a corruption scandal, and with the murderer closing in all the time, Alex will have to fight just to stay alive, never mind solving the terrifying case. Critics have called Adrian McKinty's work \\"explosive,\\" \\"violent yet virtuous,\\" and \\"always enthralling.\\" Hidden River is a riveting novel of characters, including a sadistic English cop who puts out cigarettes on other people's eyebrows, a billionaire's son with political aspirations, and a sexy Ethiopian girl living illegally in a squat. All manner of sinners converge on Denver's notoriously seedy Colfax Avenue against the breathtaking backdrop of the Rocky Mountains. Gritty, with spot-on dialogue and black humor, Hidden River is a dynamic thriller from a storyteller who writes \\"in prose that is a kind of poetry\\" (The Washington Post), and confirms his reputation as a dazzling literary voice in crime fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HGorSwAACAAJ&dq=Hidden+River:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FIFTH ELEPHANT (DISCWORLD)","description":"Everyone knows that the world is flat and supported on the backs of four elephants.

Now, he's been invited to attend a royal function as both detective and diplomat. The one role he relishes; the other requires, well, ruby tights.

Scott Fitzgerald, Billy Lee Brammer was once one of the most engaging young novelists in America.  Brammer s is a new and major talent, big in scope, big in its promise of even better things to come,  wrote A. C. Spectorsky, a former staffer at the New Yorker. When he published his first and only novel, The Gay Place, in 1961, literary luminaries such as David Halberstam, Willie Morris, and Gore Vidal hailed his debut. Morris deemed it  the best novel about American politics in our time.  Halberstam called it  a classic . . . [a] stunning, original, intensely human novel inspired by Lyndon Johnson. . . . It will be read a hundred years from now.  More recently, James Fallows, Gary Fisketjon, and Christopher Lehmann have affirmed The Gay Place s continuing relevance, with Lehmann asserting that it is  the one truly great modern American political novel.  Leaving the Gay Place tells a sweeping story of American popular culture and politics through the life and work of a writer who tragically exemplifies the highs and lows of the country at mid-century. Tracy Daugherty follows Brammer from the halls of power in Washington, DC, where he worked for Senate majority leader Johnson, to rock-and-roll venues where he tripped out with Janis Joplin, and ultimately to back alleys of self-indulgence and self-destruction. Constantly driven to experiment with new ways of being and creating often fueled by psychedelics Brammer became a cult figure for an America on the cusp of monumental change, as the counterculture percolated through the Eisenhower years and burst out in the sixties. In Daugherty s masterful recounting, Brammer s story is a quintessential American story, and Billy Lee is our wayward American son.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gv1jDwAAQBAJ&dq=THE+GAY+PLACE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The amateur astronomer","description":"This 2000 Edition of Sir Patrick Moore s classic book has been completely revised in the light of changes in technology.

It uses both in-depth exploratory interviews with language learners and a cross-sectional survey to provide a unique glimpse into the identity dynamics that learners need to manage in their interaction with contradictory relational contexts (e.g. teacher vs. classmates; parents vs. friends), and that appear to impair their perceived competence and declared achievement in language learning. Furthermore, this work presents a new model of identity which incorporates several educational psychology theories (e.g. self-discrepancy, self-presentation, impression management), developmental theories of adolescence and principles of foreign language teaching and learning. This book gives rise to potentially policy-changing insights and will be of importance to those interested in the relationship between self, identity and language teaching and learning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hxOg5FBiUBMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handprint on the Window","description":"Offers nineteen true tales of Chicago's most famous ghostly sites, including Horace Greeley Elementary School, Montrose Point, and Graceland Cemetary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HpJaL7t7IyIC&dq=Handprint+on+the+Window&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kent Co., MD: Street Map Book","description":"Large scale atlas with street level detail showing ZIP Codes, block numbers, schools, hospitals, points of interest, shopping centers, airports, parks and more.

Ellingham Academy must be cursed. Three people are now dead. One, a victim of either a prank gone wrong or a murder. Another, dead by misadventure. And now, an accident in Burlington has claimed another life. All three in the wrong place at the wrong time. All at the exact moment of Stevie s greatest triumph . . . She knows who Truly Devious is. She s solved it. The greatest case of the century. At least, she thinks she has. With this latest tragedy, it s hard to concentrate on the past.

The deaths in the past. The missing Alice Ellingham and the missing David Eastman. Somewhere in this place of riddles and puzzles there must be answers. Then another accident occurs as a massive storm heads toward Vermont. This is too much for the parents and administrators. Ellingham Academy is evacuated.

Ian has just been diagnosed with HIV. Victor, to his great relief, has tested negative. Henrique has been living with HIV for the past three years. When Victor finds himself getting tested for HIV for the first time, he can't help but question his entire relationship with Henrique, the guy he has -- had -- been dating. See, Henrique didn't disclose his positive HIV status to Victor until after they had sex, and even though Henrique insisted on using every possible precaution, Victor is livid. That's when Victor meets Ian, a guy who's also getting tested for HIV. But Ian's test comes back positive, and his world is about to change forever. Though Victor is loath to think about Henrique, he offers to put the two of them in touch, hoping that perhaps Henrique can help Ian navigate his new life. In the process, the lives of Ian, Victor, and Henrique will become intertwined in a story of friendship, love, and self-acceptance. Set in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this utterly engrossing debut by Brazilian author Lucas Rocha calls back to Alex Sanchez's Rainbow Boys series, bringing attention to how far we've come with HIV, while shining a harsh light on just how far we have yet to go.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jJ2wDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Learning : A Student Workbook","description":"This unique workbook promotes an active, hands-on, constructivist approach to the study of the Psychology of Learning, one that follows Bloom's (1956) taxonomy of instructional objectives.

This approach assumes that, for information to be remembered, the reader must discover information and manipulate it by checking new information against old information, revising assumptions, beliefs, and knowledge when the old information no longer seems to work.

In Dwarf's Blood, Olivier has crafted a moral tale, reflecting the Victorian values of her upbringing while also incorporating a psychological study of her main character, Sir Nicholas Roxerby, who comes to England from Australia after inheriting the estate of Brokeyates from his great-uncle. Happy in his ancestral home, with the backing of his mother's millions behind him, Nicholas marries into the local gentry and lives a satisfying life until the birth of his second child. Hans is full of persuasive charm and gifted genius, but to Nicholas's horror carries the 'dwarf's blood' of the title, and he cannot find it within himself to accept a child that brings with him the reminder of a family skeleton he would rather forget. In Nicholas's eyes, Hans suffers in comparison to his elder sister Portia, who is tall, healthy and beautiful, despite being completely insensitive, overbearing and unloveable; and for Althea, his wife, the cold-hearted rejection of her son by his father ruptures her happiness. Though a vivid work of realism, Dwarf's Blood incorporates a touch of the eeriness found within Olivier's first work, The Love Child, and was described as a masterpiece among contemporary novels upon first publication in 1931.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XtQ8BAAAQBAJ&dq=Dwarf%27s+blood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playtime in Phoenix: The Ultimate Guide to Learning & Having Fun With Kids!","description":"Playtime in Phoenix: The Ultimate Guide to Learning and Having Fun with Kids is an invaluable resource helping families grow, have fun and discover more than 1,600 things together.

Jay M. Savage has studied these fascinating creatures for more than forty years, and in The Amphibians and Reptiles of Costa Rica he provides the most comprehensive, up-to-date treatment of their biology and evolution ever produced. Savage begins with detailed discussions of the natural and cultural history of Costa Rica, setting the stage for a detailed treatment of each of the 396 species of amphibians and reptiles that may be found there. Each species account synthesizes and analyzes everything that is known about the animal's anatomy, behavior, geographic distribution, systematics, and evolutionary history and provides keys for identifying amphibians and reptiles in the field. In addition to distribution maps and systematic and morphological illustrations, the book includes color photographs of almost every known species, many taken by the distinguished nature photographers Michael and Patricia Fogden. Because Costa Rica has played, and continues to play, a pivotal role in the study of tropical biology as well as in the development of ecotourism and ecoprospecting, and because more than half of the amphibians and reptiles in Costa Rica are also found elsewhere in Central America, The Amphibians and Reptiles of Costa Rica will be an essential book for a wide audience of nature lovers, naturalists, ecotourists, field biologists, conservationists, and government planners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HDNQ2bba3QcC&dq=The+Amphibians+and+Reptiles+of+Costa+Rica:+A+Herpetofauna+between+Two+Continents,+between+Two+Seas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thunder in the Rockies: The incredible Denver post","description":"\\"A candid insider's story of the paper that has done so much to shape 20th century Denver.

Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families the Trasks and the Hamiltons whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. The masterpiece of Steinbeck s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. Adapted for the 1955 film directed by Elia Kazan introducing James Dean, and read by thousands as the book that brought Oprah s Book Club back, East of Eden has remained vitally present in American culture for over half a century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Viva Chicano (Laurel-Leaf Library)","description":"Keeny, a Mexican-American on parole, feels he must not return to the atmosphere of his home and neighborhood and devises a solution to the problem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DH88AAAAYAAJ&dq=Viva+Chicano+(Laurel-Leaf+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Advertising: Realities and Myths","description":"In this comprehensive handbook of theory and practice of international advertising, the subjects are not treated in isolation, but rather linked to overall trends in business globalization.

Despite early successes, however, his ambitious northern campaign foundered and ultimately failed. Adam Claasen for the first time reveals the full story of this neglected episode and shows how it helped doom the Third Reich to defeat. Hitler and Raeder, the chief of the German navy, were determined to take and keep Norway. By doing so, they hoped to preempt Allied attempts to outflank Germany, protect sea lanes for German ships, access precious Scandinavian minerals for war production, and provide a launchpad for Luftwaffe and naval operations against Great Britain. Beyond those strategic objectives, Hitler also envisioned Norway as part of a pan-Nordic stronghold a centerpiece of his new world order. But, as Claasen shows, Hitler's grand expectations were never realized. Gring's Luftwaffe was the vital spearhead in the invasion of Norway, which marked a number of wartime firsts. Among other things, it involved the first large-scale aerial operations over sea rather than land, the first time operational objectives and logistical needs were fulfilled by air power, and the first deployment of paratroopers. Although it got off to a promising start, the German effort, particularly against British and arctic convoys, was greatly hampered by flawed strategic thinking, interservice rivalries between the Luftwaffe and navy, the failure to develop a long-range heavy bomber, the diversion of planes and personnel to shore up the German war effort elsewhere, and the northern theater's harsh climate and terrain. Claasen's study covers every aspect of this ill-fated campaign from the 1940 invasion until war's end and shows how it was eventually relegated to a backwater status as Germany fought to survive in an increasingly unwinnable war. His compelling account sharpens our picture of the German air force and widens our understanding of the Third Reich's way of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f-FmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hitler%27s+Northern+War:+The+Luftwaffe%27s+Ill-Fated+Campaign,+1940-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amphibians of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia","description":"Amphibians are provided, including: habitat preferences, tips for finding them, planning amphibian surveys, guidelines for handling and measuring them, their activity through the seasons, photography tips, a table that compares confusing species, current status.

Leading unconventional lives, the siddhas include some of the greatest Buddhist teachers; Tilopa, Naropa, and Marpa among them.

In consultation with contemporary teachers, he gives a commentary on each of the Great Adepts and culls from available resources what we can know of their history. Dowman?s extensive Introduction traces the development of tantra and discusses the key concepts of the Mahamudra. In a lively and illuminating style, he unfolds the deeper understandings of mind that the texts encode.

While much has been written about his built works and his philosophies, most books focus on one or the other aspect. By structuring this volume around the concept of form, Stefano Corbo links together Eisenman s architecture with his theory. From Formalism to Weak Form: The Architecture and Philosophy of Peter Eisenman argues that form is the sphere of mediation between our body, our inner world and the exterior world and, as such, it enables connections to be made between philosophy and architecture. From the start of his career on, Eisenman has been deeply interested in the problem of form in architecture and has constantly challenged the classical concept of it. For him, form is not simply a cognitive tool that determines a physical structure, which discriminates all that is active from what is passive, what is inside from what is outside. He has always tried to connect his own work with the cultural manifestations of the time: firstly under the influence of Colin Rowe and his formalist studies; secondly, by re-interpreting Chomsky s linguistic theories; in the 80 s, by collaborating with Derrida and his de-constructivist approach; more recently,by discovering Henri Bergson's idea of Time. These different moments underline different phases, different projects, different programmatic manifestos; and above all, an evolving notion of form. Taking a multi-disciplinary approach based on the intersections between architecture and philosophy, this book investigates all these definitions and, in doing so, provides new insights into and a deeper understanding of the complexity of Eisenman s work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L_MFDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Famous Last Words","description":"Alphabetically arranged death-bed utterances of famous people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jrkOAQAAIAAJ&dq=Famous+Last+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ginger Jumps","description":"Ginger the dog loves performing in the circus, but she is unable to summon the courage for a new trick until she finds the little girl companion about whom she has been dreaming.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-6EKPwAACAAJ&dq=Ginger+Jumps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night of clear choice","description":"For fifteen years the Talbots seek their kidnapped daughter Anne until a deathbed confession leads them to a pretty teenager also named Anne, but someone has targeted Anne for murder","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e7O_7WmZ764C&dq=Night+of+clear+choice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kindred Hearts: Nurturing the Bond Between Mother & Daughter","description":"Kindred Hearts is written to help mothers and daughters experience all of the joy their close bond can bring.

When archaeologist Angelo Morelli asks Ruth Galloway to come to the Italian countryside to help identify bones found in picturesque Fontana Liri, she jumps at the chance to go and brings her daughter along for what she assumes will be a working vacation. Upon arriving, Ruth hears murmurs of Fontana Liri s strong resistance movement during World War II, and begins to sense that the townspeople are harboring an age-old secret. But how, if at all, could this chapter in history be connected to the human remains that Angelo has unearthed? Just as she s getting her footing in the dig, DCI Nelson appears, unexpectedly and for no clear reason. When Ruth s findings lead her and her crew to a modern-day murder, their holiday turns into anything but as they race to find out what darkness is lurking in this seemingly peaceful place. . .and who may be on their trail.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pn8sDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"March Battalion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MP7fo78e0wcC&dq=March+Battalion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Saw the Sea and the Sea Saw Me","description":"A girl enjoys using all of her five senses to explore the ocean, but when a jellyfish appears she discovers that the sea is not always nice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8jdaAAAAYAAJ&dq=I+Saw+the+Sea+and+the+Sea+Saw+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boats Against the Current","description":"F.
