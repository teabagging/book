His reciting of his poem about his dog named Beau on the Tonight show was so moving that even Johnny Carson reached for a tissue. The poem about his late dog Beau, along with a few more of his best ones, make this one of the best books of poetry around. Simple in design and message, they are a joy to read.

(Elementa 71)","review":"Schalow's book explores the relationship between Heidegger and German idealism and introduces the distinct approaches of Hegel and Heidegger as a basis for developing a new basis for today's politics. Using Heidegger's concept of Gelassenheit and his critique of totalizing and systematizing, Schalow develops a Heideggerian critique of Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism, and then uses the positive results of Heidegger's conversation with German idealism to re-structure the philosophical conception of political ideas such as free speech and civil disobedience. The possibility of a new basis for these concepts is found by investigating the \\"unsaid\\" in Heidegger's thought, just as Heidegger himself \\"appropriates the tradition by engaging his predecessors and eliciting what remains \`unsaid' in their philosophies through a \`thoughtful conversation.'\\" (181)This method is itself grounded in Heidegger's concept of Dasein, which reveals itself in the other only by being attentive to the other and allowing the other its (her / his) own voice. Schalow's careful analysis shows how in Heidegger's thought the individual accomplishes an authentic discourse through a linguistic openness with others, an openness in which one listens to that which is most other. Inauthentic discourse, trapped in everyday conventions, is closed off to the possibilities of discovering new meanings through listening to what is not conventionally heard. A Heideggerian \\"social conscience\\" emerges, then, with the responsibility to preserve the role of language as authentic discourse in listening for the possibilities of new meanings outside of everyday conventions (das Man).The result is a very different philosophical understanding of concepts in the liberal tradition. A free discourse is not merely characterized negatively as not being restricted in one's freedom to speak, but the positive aspect, hearing and being heard, is now emphasized. Freedom is now understood as freedom from convention, a freedom which must remain open to the voice of the other. Tradition is now a thoughtful listening to and appropriation of the past, by means of which established social convention may be critiqued and rejected.In today's world, where free speech itself has become a conventional watchword (but maybe for that very reason not understood), a Heideggerian critique as suggested by Schalow could bring us to rethink the essence of our political notions. In going beyond historical interpretation and contributing to today's philosophical issues, this book should be of interest beyond the realm of Heidegger specialists."},{"Title":"Language And Deed.Rediscovering Politics through Heidegger's Encounter with German Idealism.

Well, I'm not an expert in the field of Australian history. But these complaints seem very political in nature, and I would have hoped for something a little more scholarly.The authors say, \\"This is not an important historical debate. This is a political debate in which Windschuttle equips the Right with a version of the national past that denies Aboriginal rights to land in the post-Mabo present.\\" That does not sound very scholarly to me! I want to know if what Windschuttle says is historically correct. If it is, fine. If not, let's get it right. Either way, we could then ask if what he says is relevant to some political issue. And if it is, that's the way it goes.Suppose a child quite properly points out to a crowd that the Emperor isn't wearing any clothes. It is irrelevant to sass the child by saying \\"You're not wearing much either!\\" The child is not the problem. The Emperor is. And I think that some of the complaints in this article are a little like that. The authors are the ones who want to use what they call \\"history\\" to support a political stance. I think the burden of proof is on them, and I think Windschuttle has merely pointed out that they haven't come up with it so far.When the authors of this article claim that \\"the debate over Australian history is inextricably linked to the politics of colonial-Aboriginal power relations now,\\" I have to wonder just what logic they use to establish such a link. And I also wonder if they intend to paint a distorted picture of the past to support their political views. I'm not at all impressed by this article."},{"Title":"Advanced trauma life support program for physicians: ATLS","review":"The ATLS book for sure is not a book for those who are interested in the art of trauma support, as it is extremely superficial in its comments, as well as having not the really necessary informations that we, physicians, need.

I highly recommend it to every Muso Shinden practicioner, not only because it's maybe the only book that dares to show how the MS ryu katas are performed, but also because it feels it was made with great disposition and love for Iaido.A nice plus I found in this book was the explanations on Sei Tei Iai, which I am also a student. Please do not atempt to learn Iaido by only using this or any book. It just makes no sense. Not even with a video !!! The presence of a sensei it's a must !!Finally, one of the things I learned from this book, it's that MUSR it's not as homogenous as I tought. There are variations in some positions, which I found to be expected. On the other hand, I would be amazed if it wasn't, even tough it's a koryu, etc. Each master tries to leave a fingerprint in the art which he has mastered. Each master seem to have a different theory of what works and what doesn't.

The 12 katas of the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei Iai (SeiTei Iai) and the 4 series of the Muso Shinden Ryu are precisely described in the text and abundantly illustrated with clear photos and graphics as are all the corresponding bunkais.

Definitely recommend this to iaido practitioners."},{"Title":"Iaido Sword: Kamimoto-Ha Techniques of Muso Shinden Ryu","review":"Like any physical skills text, it is difficult to actually learn how to perform sword techniques without an instructor. What this great text does is show the basic history and basic techniques of Muso Shinden Ryu Iaido. For those not involved in the sword arts, Iaido is the art of drawing out the sword and cutting in one smooth flowing manner. It is important to train under a competent Iaido/Iaijutsu instructor to learn the finer points. Swords are sharp and one should not practice these movements without expert guidance. This volume is organized into five sections: Section one covers the history, section two deals with preparation, section three shows how to bring your sword into action, section four teaches basic movements, and section five, which is the longest, covers the various Iaido katas of Muso shinden Ryu.In conclusion, this is a book that will be of interest to students of Kenjutsu and Iaijutsu or Iaido.Rating: 5 Stars.

I must agree with L. Vassallo, in that the teaching of a sensei is indispensible. This book is best suited for students who need to have a reference to look at so they can keep up with the training they recieve at intervals in the dojo. I do believe it is possible to learn a great deal from this book in conjunction with a good video guide on MSR, but I won't recommend trying it unless you have no possibility of joining a dojo. Some of us might live in a region where Iaijutsu is not practiced anywhere nearby. If that is the case, I won't discourage anyone from doing what they can. However, mastery in this case would be an unrealistic goal."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"\\"Black Sun\\" by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke feels like the unofficial sequel to \\"The occult roots of Nazism\\", another book by the same author.\\"Black Sun\\" gives a broad overview of the post-war Nazi underground. American and British Nazism are covered, including Lincoln Rockwell and Colin Jordan. So are Julius Evola, Savitri Devi and Miguel Serrano. There are also chapters on black metal music, Nazi Satanism and neo-paganism, and the bizarre Christian Identity and Creativity groups.What's particularly striking are the cultic, occultist and pseudoreligious traits of post-war Nazism. In many ways, neo-Nazism looks like a strange blend of original Nazism and interwar Ariosophy (which was scorned by Hitler). Even Nazi leaders I assumed were purely secular, such as Lincoln Rockwell, had a pseudoreligious, Satanistic streak. Sometimes, the \\"spiritual\\" aspect is downright bizarre, as when Savitri Devi proclaimed Hitler to be an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, or when other neo-Nazi groups expressed a belief in UFOs. Yet, Devi was a leading member of the neo-Nazi international network WUNS. Another example of the religious connection is the neo-pagan group Wotansvolk, whose leader David Lane was involved in the Nazi terrorist group The Order.While this is nauseating, even scary, it's also strangely comforting. After all, the reason why Nazism became a network of political and religious cults after the war, was that secular Nazism had failed, and that a secular (or \\"Christian\\") Nazi mass movement was no longer possible. In post-war Europe, fascist groups must mimic right-wing populism or conservatism to gain a mass following - witness the Front National in France, the Alleanza Nazionale in Italy, or J&ouml;rg Haider's \\"Freedom Party\\" in Austria. Groups which openly proclaim their Nazi or fascist affinities remain small. And, almost by natural law, weird people are drawn to such groups. During my childhood, the most notorious Nazi group in Sweden, the NRP, was very small and consisted of people who dressed in Nazi garb even in private, attempted to mimic \\"Mein Kampf\\" in their own writings, and so on. In Denmark, a similar group insisted on vegetarianism, etc. Today, Swedish Nazi groups are terroristic and hence more dangerous, but they remain minuscule, and many members are behind bars (one of them a Black African!).It seems that Nazism is experiencing its midnight in the century.Let's all hope this situation is here to stay..."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"Th author writes well, but his inability or unwillingness to do some basic fact checking brings most of his conclusions into question. For example, the author states in the first chapter that George Lincoln Rockwell maintained his American Nazi Party headquarters in his \\"house\\" on Franklin Road. No true. Rockwell first established the headquarters in a house on Williamsburg Road and later moved it to North Randolph Street while maintaining a \\"barracks\\" on Upton Hill several miles away. It was not until after Rockwell's death that the successor organization (NSWPP) moved into a storefront, not a house, on Franklin Road where it later changed its name to The New Order before moving to Wisconsin in the mid-1980s. Now a coffeeshop, the Franklin Road address today gets an undo amount of media attention for being the site of Rockwell's former headquarters when in fact Rockwell never set foot in the place. A minor detail? Perhaps, but it goes to prove that relying on the accuracy of sensationalistic newpaper articles which are notorious for oversimplying and getting basic facts wrong is not how a serious author should approach any topic. Nice try, but no cigar. This is not the definitive overveiw of Nazi occultism that it pretends to be."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"The book keeps your attention going, exploring both things that most people interested in the topic already knew, and also material that was not known. Very interesting indeed."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"This book is basically an attempt to get Americans all worried about a pretty harmless and pathetic bunch of right-wing cranks. Goodrick-Clarke blows their antics up to gargantuan proportions--along the way getting detail after detail wrong. Those who know anything about the American Right will find inaccuracies on--literally--every page... This book is pure sensationalism, not scholarship. It is also obviously a shameful attempt to capitalize on the hysteria following Sept. 11, by raising the bugaboo of \\"terrorism\\" throughout. Americans have little to fear from people who practice rune yodeling and believe that Nazi saucers are docked in Antarctica. In addition, the writing is dull. The whole thing is shoddy and seems hastily slapped together. Do not waste your time with this book!"},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"A handbook for anyone interested in contemporary Nazism and the far political right. It is, however, becoming a little dated as some of the movements have changes names and directions, and some of the personalities have moved to new things.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke writes with an air of intelligence and knowledgeability, so I was somewhat puzzled to find a reference on page 296 to the ENGLISH Royal Family. As far as I am aware, there is no such thing ! Perhaps the author is American and does not know that England is just one part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The correct term would have been the United Kingdom Royal Family, and British Royal family would have been acceptable, but English, never !The author leads the reader through the whole gamut of the extreme right, from the sinister to the plain ridiculous. From large worldwide organisations to the individuals with ludicrous conspiracy theories. Fascinating reading which will give you lead after lead for personal research.Goodrick-Clarke's conclusion highlights the negative consequences which could result if the current trend of forcing multiculturalism on a reluctant indiginous population continues to be pursued. Disaffection with mainstream politics, and a new rise of the extreme right, could bring major divisive change. Here in Europe we are already seeing the beginnings of what he warns of, with the entry of the extreme right into mainstream politics via political parties with rapidly growing memberships."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"I just wasted $21.00Interesting book, but it reeked of Black tainted dissinformation.Tried to fascinate with occult stuff and instead just threw in satanism and everything else into the same pot.I do not recommend this book for serious students of history who don't want their heads twisted."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke has written two outstanding books on Nazism and its links to religious/occult philosophies and figures: \\"The Occult Roots of Nazism\\" and \\"Hitler's Priestess.\\" In both of those previous books (the first based on his doctoral dissertation at Oxford), he engaged in prodigious original source research and showed a bright light on subjects that had previously received either little attention or sloppy sensationalistic treatment.If \\"Black Sun\\" is a trifle disappointing, it is so only by comparision with his own earlier achievements. This latest work is much more journalistic and relies, unfortunately, on others' research more often than not. Moreover, Goodrick-Clarke, in attempting a survey of current aryan/Neo-Nazi/Satanic/far right groups and writings, ends up covering ground already covered in books like Joscelyn Godwin's \\"Arktos,\\" Kevin Coogan's \\"Dreamer of the Day,\\" and his own \\"Hitler's Priestess\\" (which is about Savitri Devi, who combined Hinduism and Hitlerism).It is not as if Goodrick-Clarke didn't spend his time in the trenches: it appears that he engaged in extensive correspondence with a number of his subjects and, as always, he has obviously read and digested much of the material that he summarizes in a clear-cut fashion. His chapter on Miguel Serrano breaks new ground in reporting on the extent of that author/diplomat's eccentric Hitler worship. But on other figures of the neo-nazi fringe, such as David Myatt, one is left with the impression that Goodrick-Clarke may have given too much credence to their own self-presentation or, conversely, to the hyperbole of their critics.Make no mistake, this is as good a summary of present neo-nazi, extreme right ideas and personae as one is likely to find, but in dealing with the current scene - in a book that was written over the course of nearly a decade - \\"Black Sun\\" falls prey to the criticism, (voiced in some other reviews here,) that it is not entirely accurate or up to date. Especially in dealing with the knotty and ambiguous area of neo-nazi and Satanic overlaps, Goodrick-Clarke would have benefitted from inside information which was apparently beyond his grasp.Still, it is never quite cricket to criticize a book for what a critic thinks it should be or might have been. There is much information here that cannot be found anywhere else, and with the caveat that one should double check any facts that may have been superceded by subsequent events, \\"Black Sun\\" is a compelling read."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"This book is an obvious attempt at an 'apology' for his most popular book, _The Occult Roots of Nazism_, which became required reading for many of the neo-Nazi groups he speaks of in his latest offering. You would think Goodrick-Clarke would have seen this coming after sensationalising the title from its original (his doctoral thesis), and then plastering the black and red front cover with the swastika and dagger emblem of the Thule Society!_Black Sun_ is simply an overview of the very marginalized groups that form the extreme neo-Nazi right, and a lot of the material is regurgitated from his book on Savitri Devi.Nazi/UFO's/Antarctica/The Coming Race etc... is a very fun topic, but trying to ascribe its loony adherents with the terrorist label is sensationalism at best, and completely factually inaccurate at worst.The nice front cover featuring a 'Black Sun' struck with the Sig rune will sell many copies at Aryan white-power rallies until they figure out what it's really about."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"In this book, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke tries to give an account of the continuation of much of the Nazi philosophy after the demise of the Third Reich. However, after his previous work _The Occult Roots of Nazism_ this book is surely a large disappointment. The book presents chapters on the American NeoNazis (especially Rockwell), British Nazis (including Colin Jordan and \\"Combat 18\\"), Julius Evola, Francis Parker Yockey and James Madole, Savitri Devi, a collection of \\"mysterious\\" and occult phenomena surrounding the Third Reich, Wilhelm Landig, UFOs and Antarctic underground bases, Miguel Serrano, black metal, Nazi Satanism, Christian Identity, Nordic paganism, and conspiracy beliefs regarding the New World Order. Unfortunately, there is very little holding this book together and it is rather poorly written. Although the book is entertaining, some of the weirdest things you are likely to read about, it fails to achieve any sort of conclusion at all and resorts to gratuitous references to terrorism (the events of September 11, unconnected with Nazism at all).For a much better account of NeoNazi and far right beliefs read either: _Arktos_ by Joscelyn Godwin or _Dreamer of the Day_ by Kevin Coogan."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"Savvy fundraisers that they are, it has always been the policy of watchdog groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center to pretend that their 'intelligence gathering' is necessary to ferret out sinister neo-Nazi conspirators, tucked away within ultra-secret underground enclaves and communicating through hidden networks only the watchdogs can sniff out. The reality, of course, is that anyone with access to the Internet can get the goods on the secret Aryans. The truly adventurous hate-hunter need only open a P.O. Box, sign a few postcards with a friendly \\"Sieg Heil,\\" and prepare to be inundated in a sea of third-generation Xeroxed flyers, poorly-written fanzines, homemade stickers and other powerful and dangerous hate propaganda. The secret Aryans love to talk about themselves and their ideas. Despite Goodrick-Clarke's calculated and constant allusions to \\"terrorism,\\" that's pretty much all they ever do.Which brings us to the obvious question: Why does one get the impression that Goodrick-Clarke hasn't talked to any of these people? How is it that virtually every \\"factual\\" statement in his book is confused or incorrect? And what does George Lincoln Rockwell -- a fairly conventional, old-timey hatemonger in a Nazi Halloween costume -- have to do with \\"esoteric cults?\\"Goodrick-Clarke is at his worst when trying to maneuver his way through the various youth culture phenomena vaguely relevant to his topic. This is a trait I've noticed with other academic writers, who tend to lose their bearings even around more innocuous genres like Punk Rock or Hip-Hop. The charitable explanation is that a tweedy old fogey like Goodrick-Clarke is simply out of his element. The less charitable explanation is that he hasn't bothered to do any research, being well-aware that the people he's writing about will never be in a position to contradict him.An interesting book could have been written on the esoteric currents within the Far Right, and maybe someday one will be. It's not even important what sort of spin one might put on this (and here's one of many confusing things about Black Sun -- after going on and on about how bad the Aryans are, Goodrick-Clarke concludes his study very nearly expressing sympathy with many of their fundamental grievances). If Black Sun had managed to get the facts straight or provide some type of unique (or even coherent) insight as to \\"what it all means,\\" it might have been a worthwhile read. But it does neither. A sloppy, poorly researched mess, which might make its author a few quick bucks, but has little to offer the rest of us. Avoid."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"...BLACK SUN is a lurid attempt to magnify a few dozen neo-Nazis with occult beliefs into an alarming threat to Western Civilization, all in order to sell books. Jumping on the post-9-11 bandwagon, Goodrick-Clarke constantlyplays the terrorism card as if it were neo-Nazis who flew those planes on the fateful day.All of Goodrick-Clarke's authorial decisions seem guided by sensationalism rather than a committment to sound and scrupulous scholarship. For instance, in his chapter on Nordic Paganism, he devotes a good deal of space to amateurish writings of David Lane, a jailed member of the terroristgang The Order, but he neglects the vast scholarly literature produced by genteel men with Ph.D.s. like Edred Thorsson. In his chapter on music, he devotes a good deal of space to skinhead music. Skinheads do not, of course, have any connection to the \\"cult\\" theme of the book, but they have a reputation for violence. But he ignores such bands as Death in June and Current 93, who fit nicely into the cult theme. Maybe they were left out because none of their members are in prison. Or maybe Goodrick-Clarke is such a spotty researcher that he has never heard of them.The book also reads like it was hastily slapped together. The writing is dull and repetitive. Large chunks of two chapters are lifted almost word-for-word out of Goodrick-Clarke's biography of Savitri Devi. The selection of photographs also seems hasty.Yes, BLACK SUN contains some interesting information, and it is sometimes amusing in spite of its dull style. I found the chapter on the Nazi UFO theories to be particularly informative. But overall, this book is a waste of time and money, of interest only to the few dozen cranks who are puffed and profiled in its pages. Goodrick-Clarke might even convince them that they are somebody, but he does not convince me."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"_Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity_ by the scholar Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke is an excellent overview of the extremely bizarre beliefs and personages involved in neo-Nazi occultism. I will keep this review short for the sake of not flogging a dead horse.The cover features the \\"Black Sun,\\" supposedly a mystical Aryan symbol representing the pure and undiluted blood and power of the Germanic race, inscribed on the floor of Himmler's SS castle-headquarters. The book itself is very well written and logically organized. Neo-Nazi and pagan cosmology, Christian Identity beliefs regarding the Bible and New Age (i.e. anti-Christian) conspiracy theories (best exemplified by anarcho-libertarians Bill Cooper and David Icke) have striking similarities to the ancient dualist heresies of Gnosticism and Manicheanism. _Black Sun_ is an excellent book for anyone interested in the world's dark undercurrents of religious extremism and elitist beliefs about the cosmic clash of good versus evil manifested on the material plane."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"Maybe you've read some stuff by Nicolas Goodricke-Clarke, his most well known books are The Occult Roots of Nazism, which I have never found. My local library has his follow-up, The Black Sun. It's a pretty good read, although considering the amount of credibility lent to his name by other writers on such topics (e.g. Levenda) I find him a li'l bit sensationalist and ready to jump to conclusions. It starts with the fall of a certain Reich and the creation of a literary defense of it actions, especially on the racial and occult levels. Dude does give a really good survey of writers pre- and post- Third Reich who shared the Elitist views of European culture in decline with populism, socialism, Marx and Jews in general being the main culprits. Goodrick-Clarke goes a long way to define and spotlight such threads as Occult Nazism, Nazi Satanists, the weird germination of Nazism in America and how that, more than an unbroken thread of native German Nazism gave way to today's current Racist Right in Europe.Still, as mentioned before, I think there is more than a whiff of sensationalism, in that despite his careful definitions of the strands mentioned above, he kind of wants to lump most occultists with Satanists (which should really be a screaming red flag of sloppy research, or some Xian fundie roots to his thinking) as well as at least 3 instances of dude equating a Mithraic reconstruction with occultic white supremacy, but you can see my transparent bias in that matter. How would an Aryan white-power Mithras have such huge resonance in the very multicultural Roman army? Still, if you want to find about every facet of Hitler's disembodied brain commanding the legion of flying saucers from his Antarctic base, this book is the first place to go."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"Black Sun is a follow-up book to Goodrick-Clark's seminal workThe Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology. It is a sweeping history of the miasma of dark fantasies, id monsters and chimeras born in the rubble of the Third Reich and lurking in the postmodern subconscious.Pros- Very thorough and very academic- Alien abductions, UFO's, Hitler surviving WWII, Antarctic U-Boat bases, Aldebaran, the Illuminati, ZOG, etc. - it's all here!- Like the cast of characters in an Agatha Christie novel, all the usual neo-fascist fantasy fetishist suspects and are introduced and scrutinized under Clark's expert microscope: the Christian Identity Movement, Julius Evola, Wilhelm Landig, Arnold Spenser Leese, George Lincoln Rockwell, Saint Loup, Miguel Serrano , Otto Skorzeny, et. Al.- Demonstrates how odd ideas and conspiracy theories are often the fruits of baser bowers: lust for power, desire for meaning and purpose, and justification for racism and hatred.- Good investigation of how a fringe of people perpetuate a fantasy mythology of a white's-only utopiaCons- Very thorough and very academic. In an effort not to be sensational, Clark goes to far the other way - the writing is pedantic. Fascism is a movement of the heart more than the head, and that fact is unfortunately lost in his bone-dry prose.- Clark doesn't explain well that, similar to Freud's choice of smokes, sometimes a crackpot is just a crackpot.OVERALL:Definitely a worthwhile read for those wanting a deeper exploration into the phenomena of Holocaust denial, occultism, conspiracy theory and far-right fringe movements.Black Sun will be fascinating for folks who have a fairly in-depth knowledge for the Third Reich, 20th Century occultism and of course conspiracy theories.It will seem dry for the average reader more accustomed and perhaps wanting more sensationalist treatment of these topics."},{"Title":"Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity","review":"The Black Sun is a very good book.

It was the only thing I really regretted having to give up. I didn't miss cigarettes and alcohol was a good thing to learn to live without. I've always felt like marijuana is a tremendous gift from God. When my physicians prescribed narcotics for my chronic pain I decided it was time to try using my old friend, MaryJane, for relief. First thing I did was read everything I could get my hands on about MJ. This book is a Gold Mine of information. Of all the books, pamphlets and stuff on the internet I've read, The Great Book of Hemp was the most comprehensive and informative. Prohibition of marijuana is wrong in SO many ways. Since reading this book (over & over & over - the library finally recorded it as lost! I took it back and bought my own.) I am Excited to do what I can to help change the laws regarding marijuana. I think that if people who aren't familiar with MJ as a medicine or recreational intoxicant learned about it's many benefits, they too would see how ridiculous and EXPENSIVE it is to keep it as an illegal substance. The economic benefits that legalization would bring would not just save jillions of dollars in legal expenses it would ADD money to our government funds by way of taxation. I believe this book is a valuable tool to educate the public as they ponder whether or not to vote for or otherwise support legalization."},{"Title":"The Great Book of Hemp: The Complete Guide to the Environmental, Commercial, and Medicinal Uses of the World's Most Extraordinary Plant","review":"I should have paid more attention to the reviews here. This book is mostly about marijuana, and not so much about Industrial Hemp. I was expecting the exact opposite. Also, the guide is not very thorough. A book ten times this size could be written on just growing hemp. While it may cover a wide range of topics, it does not go into any great depth. Maybe I just knew to much already about Hemp, and simply couldn't learn anything new from this volume...It reads like an apologetic for 'stoners', which frustrated me personally because I have absolutely no interest in hemp for it's THC content. I'm 80% interested in the health aspects of hemp (primarily the live seed) and 10% interested in the mechanical/industrial uses of hemp. The last 10% is just because it's illegal.According to the author nearly every religion started with people who were smoking weed, and nearly every person who's ever used hemp for any application also secretly smoked weed. Which is fine, great, whatever, it may all be true. I just got tired of the same message while trying to learn about nutrient content and decorticators.I recommend this book for those interested in Marijuana.

This is interesting, of course - this is the sort of thing that goes on today, but somehow I just think they could have given more usable information.

It delivered on about half of those.The quasi-autobiography of Tracy Quan shares with the reader some of the problems a married call girl in New York faces. The core of problem, other than being a prostitute, is that her high profile banker husband doesn't know about her career. She has to live a double life, avoiding her husband and his family while maintaining her working relationships with fellow prostitutes and her customers. She masks her business by only making appointments in the day, checking her e-mail and voice mail only while she's alone, keeping her old apartment (while sub-letting it to another working girl) and pretending to be taking French classes. The funny thing is that her husband never really shows an interest in what she is doing during the day.There are lots of sex scenes. An I mean a lot of them. But other than that there's no real motive to the book. It comes off as bland and tasteless with no real emotional content to it. There are places that will cause a reader to chuckle, but there's nothing overly funny occurring.Which is a shame. A book about a woman that sells sex for a living and is good enough to live very well, but has to keep it a secret from her husband is full of potential. It could have explored the reasons behind choosing a life as a sex worker beyond the token excuse of a young girl running away from home. It could have been turned into a comical farce of the first order. Instead what the reader gets is Quan attempting to disguise her own life story behind a thin veil of fiction.

This is a nice combination of both a special coloring book, that also tells a timeless story.My grandaughters now can appreciate the original story because they are coloring each page as we read the book."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland Coloring Book (Dover Classic Stories Coloring Book)","review":"My daughter was going through an Alice in Wonderland phase after being exposed to the Disney movie, and we desired to acquaint her with the original work on which the movie had been based. Problem was she was younger than three, and not yet on to chapter books, so the original work would have been a bit overwhelming to her.After looking at and reading portions of many Alice adaptations, we found this coloring book was the perfect solution. The illustrations are Tenniel's original ones from the book, though are larger scale than any of the Alice books we own, so you get the full effect of the detail. It still wasn't readable all in one sitting, but my daughter sat with rapt attention as we read 10 or so pages at a time.It's too nice to use as a children's coloring book, but it serves well as a reading copy, and at a very reasonable price.

While it is a lovely book, I disagree with a lot of the comments saying it is a good introduction to Alice in Wonderland for very young kids. The illustrations are not the usual solid black line images, they are blown up pen/pencil illustrations therefor already have a lot of detail, and every other page is the text of the book which is almost exactly that of Alice in Wonderland. It says 'Abridged' but I doubt much has been changed, the text is therefore totally unsuitable for a young child to understand. Instead I would recommendThe Nursery \\"Alice\\"- this is a much better introduction for younger kids (0-5 is what Carroll suggested), it has beautiful colorful illustrations but more importantly the text has been completely rewritten.

Fortunately, towards the end of the book it all came together, and the story became very exciting and appealing, and worth four stars.My reservations were due to several factors. The start of the book is rather strange and the main character seemed like he was keeping a distance from his own life. There are many coincidences that make the plot hard to swallow, and there were a few unbelievable things happening, like a foursome of top-level intelligence agents holding a summit meeting in a car.The story is set during the fighting in ex-Yugoslavia, and is about an attempt to identify a war criminal who has killed all of the inhabitants of a Moslem village. At the same time the main character and his former girlfriend smuggle an orphaned child out of ex-Yugoslavia and give her to a potential adoptive family of Americans living in Germany. But then the war criminal tracks the child down with the intention of killing her, and to top it all off the main character is being targeted by an IRA gunman.In conclusion, another solid thriller by Geoffrey Archer, although one that starts rather slowly and contains some irritating elements.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Destiny Whispers: Through Poetry","review":"I just finished reading Destiny Whispers.

When I became aware of David Lavender's The Great West, I thought it would be a simple retelling of some of what I had read earlier, starting with the fur trade and focusing on events West of the Mississippi River. But no, this book starts in 1750, prior to the French and Indian War, with colonial migration southward from Philadelphia down the Great Wagon Road. I wish I had started my study here for this is the finest, most complete work on America's Manifest Destiny that I have yet to discover.It is easy to see Lavender's primary calling was teaching. He delivers a better understanding of how regional events, for example the early 1800 political unrest in the then trans-Appalachian West, fit into the larger geopolitical picture of the contention between Spain, France, Britain and the United States as America's trans-Appalachian migration drives the Louisiana Purchase. The Purchase was quite a dynamic event: It united America for the first time, pushing America's frontier across the Mississippi River to a new set of expansion challenges. As Lavender describes it, \\"Doubling the geographic area of the country through the Louisiana Purchase seemed to reduce in proportion the wits of some frontiersmen. Local stump orators forgot that they had recently been agitating for a separate Republic west of the Allegany Mountains and began crying for still greater expansion by the Stars and Stripes.\\" That's Lavender: Informative, pithy, sarcastic and humorous. He does not tell events in isolation but rather delivers them as part of the whole cloth, providing seamless transitions between events.This is the type of analysis you can expect from Lavender in all aspects of this interpretation of America's Western migration and he answers a myriad of unanswered questions in this excellent work. His explanations of the key drivers of the settling of Texas, Indian Removal, the Black Hawk War, the beginnings of the fur trade, the Santa Fe Trail, Taos and the Oregon and California Trails are all interrelated and he leaves no stone unturned in his explanation of these migration drivers.David Lavender covers our Manifest Destiny like no other and in the process he conveys a better learning experience than any other author I have had the good fortune to enjoy. You can expect succinct and original analysis, insights and conclusions, remarkably interesting color and a superb read!"},{"Title":"The Great West,","review":"This book has something for every history buff. The beginning chapter focuses on the movement beyond the Alleghenies in 1763, initially it was agreed upon by legislators as belonging to Native Americans. Soon however, a greater understanding of how vast the land beyond was, creating a temptation to explore and exploit.The book is very systematic in covering the time periods based on various Congressional Acts and Wars as well as further development of the lands.Along side the narrative is a wide variety of pictorials that demonstrate the story told. Many Photographs of Pioneers including \\"Mountain Man\\" Jim Baker a scout who worked along side Kit Carson; a lawless woman; Survivors of Smallpox exposure; Entertainers for the 49er's; Indians from Different Tribes; Advertisements for Land for Sale; Religious Artifacts (including a tract put out by Catholics showing Protestants \\"withered ends of the branches of the true church\\"; San Francisco photos in the 1850's; Railroads; Clearing the Land; Indian Pictorial of Custer's Last Stand; Daguerreotype of Santa Anna, the Mexican ruler at the Battle of the Alamo; Maps of territories at the time they were starting to be settled; and many more.What I really appreciated about this book is that it doesn't read like a dry, factoid filled book you had in seventh grade, the author and other collaborators enjoyed their subject.

Several of the stories really stayed with me and I've been trying to find the book ever since. Finally, I asked the librarian at my school (who is nothing short of amazing) what little I remembered about this book - it was published sometime in the 1930s or 40s, it was a collection of work from Esquire and that it included Hemingway's \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\". Shockingly, she was able to find it and via Amazon Marketplace, I had it in my hands three days later.It was worth waiting for.These are essays and stories that for the most part, would never be included in an anthology today - they are too much of their time; their humor is too quirky - but that is exactly why I love them.

ISBN: 1587051044. This title covers Virtual Private Networking of many flavors. The term Virtual Private Network is a term used very loosely in the industry, so it's good to clarify the 'type' of VPN that's covered in this book. The type of VPN's covered in this books are essentially network based VPNs. The reason I mention this is because some folks call a software utility named SSH a form of VPN. Others stretch the term and call the use of HTTP over Secure Socket Layer (SSL) a VPN. To me the network layer VPN is the only true VPN and are the type covered in this title.The book covers all the major protocols used to accomplish VPNs. From the Cisco proprietary Layer 2 Forwarding protocol to Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol to the more widely deployed IP Security (IPSEC) Protocol. There is a wealth of information cover Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) and its variation. The authors' goal was to compile as much useful information into one text covering all type of VPN flavors. The author, for the most part, has succeeded in developing a great one-stop reference for Network Layer VPNs.The author wastes little ink when covering a given protocol. The organizations of the sections are very well laid out. Each section takes you from the fundamentals of the protocol, to configuration and finally troubleshooting the technology. The format makes for an excellent representation of each technology.There are plenty of protocol diagrams, supporting figures and tables to augment the text. I found the debug and screen output that where used in most all the sections very useful in understanding what to expect when troubleshooting and applying the techniques yourself.I think this book is best suited for Service Provider Network Engineers responsible for developing and maintain VPN solutions. Enterprise Engineers will also find valuable information in the text as well. However, the majority of the protocols covered in the title are typically used in the Service Provider space.I found the chapters that covered MPLS Layer 3 VPN and Any Transport over MPLS Based VPNs very interesting. The author explains the technologies very well. It really made me think outside of my box. Those chapters expanded my thinking.You won't find information pertaining to Cisco VPN Concentrators in this title.There are two appendices in the book that augment the book's wealth of information on VPNs. The first appendix has Review questions and answers for each chapter covering the different VPN technologies. This section is a great source of reference for review or even picking up key notes. The other appendix contains lab configurations that the reader can build to reinforce the technologies learned in the book. This depends on the lab equipment available to the reader. Most of the equipment is common and likely that anyone with a few pieces of equipment can workup most of the labs. There are a few labs that call for ISDN interfaces, but the reader can be creative and work around it in order to get the idea of the technology.Over all this is a good title. Enterprise Professionals may find more useful information in the title \\"Network Security Principles and Practices (CCIE Professional Development)\\" by Saadat Malik. ISBN: 1587050250."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting Virtual Private Networks (VPN)","review":"Troubleshooting VPNs by Mark Lewis (Cisco Press, 2004) demystifies the major protocols used to create Virtual Private Networks. VPNs use a form of encapsulation called tunneling, or additions to packets or frames to make them distinguishable as part of a unique connection, to transmit different protocols or encrypted data across the wide area network.The cost savings over dedicated leased line access-extended connectivity with potentially more bandwidth for less money-were compelling from the start, and the standardization process to secure VPNs and make them easier to implement moved quickly. But VPNs also meant that many disparate protocols (PAP/CHAP, LCP/NCP, ATM, IP) with many different functions (authentication, negotiation, and transport) would have to play together in new ways. The inevitable free-for-all that results from these \\"forced parties\\" has opened up a world of opportunity for network engineers with troubleshooting skills. That's where this book comes in to help.The book begins by establishing some basic rules of thumb for VPN troubleshooting. These include bottom up and top down troubleshooting (the \\"up\\" and down\\" parts refer to the OSI stack) and end-to-end analysis of \\"what might have gone wrong where.\\" Then the book moves on to quickly address older, less secure VPN-creation methods such as Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), which is widely used for dial access, and Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F), before continuing on to more common protocols such as such as Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), IP Security (IPSec), Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), and an emerging practice to adapt existing WAN protocols (especially ATM but also PPP and HDLC) to MPLS called Any Transport over MPLS (AToM).For every protocol discussed, the book introduces the technology in some depth for those who might have only a cursory knowledge of what they're getting into. It offers deep detail on control messages, connection and session establishment, configuring and maintaining the VPN tunnel, and (of course) troubleshooting common failure scenarios known to occur with these technologies. All topics include a detailed glossary of common troubleshooting commands (show and debug), with tips on how to employ them and caveats on what to watch out for in terms of the amount of output they might generate or the effect they might have on the devices they are executing on.In addition to very descriptive visuals walking you through such complex inner-workings as tunnel setup sequences (from initial channel establishment, through negotiation and authentication, and on to frame forwarding) the author has devised detailed troubleshooting flowcharts for every major VPN technology. These flowcharts include questions you should ask yourself while fixing a broken configuration; for instance, a PPTP flowchart instructs you to ask (in order, working up the stack) if LCP negotiation, PPP authentication, and NCP negotiation was successful. In working up through the data link sublayers in this way, any answer of \\"No\\" or \\"Not Sure\\" sends you to a section describing how to verify or correct what is happening at that sublayer.Similarly, for AToM VPNs, you are asked whether CEF (required for MPLS) is enabled for internal (LSR) routers, and then whether MPLS and LDP are correctly enabled on these routers as well. A \\"Not Sure\\" sure answer directs you where to correct the problem.Of course, there is an art to troubleshooting, and these flowcharts are guidelines rather than something that can be automated. But they are very well thought out, and combined with some practice and experience on the learner's part, can help foster a very strong knowledge of how to debug these tricky technologies.For those who have the resource to set them up and the time to do them, there are labs with some invaluable assistance on handling common configurations gone wrong. The problems include incorrect IP addressing, password or protocol mismatches, or access lists blocking a needed protocol. The MPLS labs are especially useful, as there are a lot of dependencies on a successful MPLS VPN: MPLS itself has to be fully operational and stable before the VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) tables are established.In describing the different protocols, the book ultimately illustrates some of the tradeoffs between Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPNs. Things have moved rapidly from L2F forwarding to IPSec and MPLS based services; however, Layer 2 VPNS (via L2TP) will continue to be developed because they're so much easier to implement and maintain and because they scale adequately and satisfy the requirements for most customer applications.The need for Layer 3 comes into play when there's a large number of very small sites, but the tradeoff of a Layer 3 VPN service is that providers need to keep with changes in a customer's routing tables-a potentially costly operations expenditure. To automate some of the transfers of information needed at layer 3, a protocol called Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) was developed for Layer 3 VPNs. This advertises customer routes and associated labels in the MPLS environment. The book includes a section on troubleshooting these Layer 3 VPNs with a variety of interior gateway protocols (RIPv2, EIGRP, or OSFP) working with the EGP. The nuts and bolts of multicast VPNs, another Layer 3 technology that facilitates one to many applications such as distance learning or conferencing, are also covered.This book is entirely service provider focused - this makes sense considering the subject matter, but there are many separate issues in the enterprise arena that are not covered here. By and large, these are probably simpler problems, and might not warrant this level of treatment. They also include other devices such as VPN concentrators and the unique problems of terminating different VPN types (remote access versus site to site) in the enterprise edge, and positioning these termination solutions with a firewall or a server farm. Whether this belongs in another book (which would be my vote) or as a separate chapter here is a judgment call and doesn't take away from the quality of what is covered in the book, but rather just stands out as an open question.Simply put, the numerous examples in this book are well thought out and acutely illustrative of real world problems, and the author always walks through detailed scenarios on how to solve them. Lewis is a CCIE who works in the service provider space and specializes in VPN technologies; the material in this book is clearly based on his experience and he has taken the trouble to make it as accessible as possible. Given the technical depth and how relatively new much of this material is, combined with the pressing need for expertise in troubleshooting VPNs in the service provider arena, this book gets five stars out of five."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting Virtual Private Networks (VPN)","review":"Troubleshooting Virtual Private Networks presents by computer hardware and software expert Mark Lewise is a 1000 page systematic troubleshooting methodology \\"how to\\" manual specifically intended for the use of network engineers, administrators, and architects tasked with managing and deploying Cisco IOS VPNs.

After reading it, one will see why. It stayed in the #1 slot until the publication of the \\"Kinsey Report\\" one year later- Prof. Alfred Kinsey's, et al., block-buster science report on human sexual habits.Overstreet gives us such gems as: [\\"All children, Diderot once observed, are essentially criminal. It is merely our good luck that their physical powers are still too limited to permit them to carry out their destructiveness.\\" Had he lived today, Diderot might have expanded his remark. He might have said that all childish minds are dangerous, but particularly when those minds are housed in adult bodies; for then they have the power to put their immaturities fully and disastrously into effect.\\"]- i.e., war mongering, wanton destruction of our shared environment, destructive relationships, selfishness in politics and business, etc. Here, begins the message of the critical need for children to be taught socialization (including sex education), care and awe of nature, love of self, family, community, etc.\\"The Mature Mind\\" brings up many of the more contemporary ideas of universal maturing of consciousness put forth in Duane Elgin's books: \\"Awakening Earth\\", \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\", et al.I rate \\"The Mature Mind\\" as one of the most important books in history and in these times of contentious unrest, environmental destruction, socio-economic-religious-political predation, the message about the importance of human maturation cannot be overstated."},{"Title":"The Mature Mind","review":"The Mature mind is centered on the intriguing idea that real maturity is not based on physical growth but entirely about mindset. The premise is best defined by a quote in the book: \\"All children are essentially criminal. It is merely our good luck that their physical powers are still too limited to permit them to carry out their destructiveness.\\" Overstreet goes on to deduce that not all adults develop fully mature minds, and the resulting combination of immaturity and physical growth dangerous.Too often growth is determined to be based on age, power, and wealth, instead of the real maturity explained in this book. The mature mind is exemplified by a number of things; humility, empahty, mental control, temperment, and self control. Some develop these attributes early, even as children, and do very well by them. Others, even at times those who hold power or are held in high regard, are severely lacking in these areas even as adults. As Overstreet clearly illustrates with numerous examples throughout the book, until society puts proper emphasis and focus on developing mature minds the world is going to continue to be subjected to a litany of issues such as war and political power grabs based on the continual promotion of immature minds in adult bodies.The book is deep and of psychological content, thus it is not easy reading if you do not have a direct interest in the topic. Yet if most of the message inside this book was able to be adsorbed by the common person, the world would surely be far better off as a result. Few books offer a new manner of thinking in science or a message so profound its ideas could potentially improve humankind, yet the Mature Mind accomplishes both."},{"Title":"The Mature Mind","review":"My dad bought this book years ago, in a mass-market paperbackedition, but somehow, I myself nevergot around to reading it.

The teacher approved use of older editions which he said were actually better versions since the information hadn't changed but the layout was better with the pictures provided next to the text rather than having to refer to the pictures from an appendix in the back of the book. The textbook was very well written and the pictures of the art very good quality. However, it was the book itself that deserved a lower rating because as I opened it up for the first time, the pages fell away from the spine as I turned from page to page. So now I am constantly trying to keep the individual pages from falling out of what has become a folder rather than the cover to a textbook. But I paid only 18 cents for the book plus around $8.00 for shipping and handling as compared to the $89.00 the book store wanted for a used copy of the same book.

I really enjoyed it in spite of it's disturbing revelations, the author's sometimes awkward writing style and on occasion, his questionable conclusions. For anyone with an interest in world affairs - past, present &amp; future - or the political ambitions of the Vatican (which Phelps argues is really one in the same) this is a valuable perspective to gather.Phelps does a very good job illustrating the ubiquitous nature of Jesuit insidiousness throughout modern political, economic &amp; cultural history. In highlighting the diabolical essence of the order, he sheds light on the unequivocal and nearly universal distain for the Jesuits by heads of state since their inception in the late 1500s. These include Napoleon Bonaparte (who, in his memoirs, called them a military order, not a religious one), Oliver Cromwell, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.Although the rational for many the arguments is well documented, I don't know if the veracity of all of the conclusions can be tested. The book contains endless quotes and citations, yet not everything comes together as tightly as I would have liked (at least after one read). That said, I still think Phelps is on target and proves more than enough of his points to be taken seriously.The book is well organized however it covers so much territory it's easy to become overwhelmed. This is a function of the subject more than anything else. While it can be considered both an introductory text and more of an advanced study, the average reader will likely need to do additional reading and investigation outside of what Phelps gives (thus the reason for the several full length books included on the CD-ROM that comes with VA).According to Phelps (and I think he makes his case) ignoring the Jesuits &amp; the Vatican as a political, financial, cultural and spiritual force, is perilous to a free society and free people everywhere. Its a very timely read and is one of those books you'll want to read many times if you take the topic of world affairs (including economic/cultural globalization and the 'War on Terrorism') seriously at all. Definitely buy it."},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"When I first started to read about the Society of Jesus, Knights of Malta and Vatican I was not drawn into it as I was with the other so called \\"alternative\\" history. I would read it and put it off for another day sort of. But one day after watching Eric Phelps' video I finally understood where it is all at. Like many people who either stumbled or were lead to Eric's works, I was not 100% in agreement with some of his ideas. To me things like \\"no race mixing\\" and \\"country for each race\\" were kind of strange to hear. After all I have no beef with any other races, so what is the problem I thought.But of course as with many things you first have to give it a time. Those not familiar with a computer would find simplest things unmanagable and difficult to perform, but with time they will master them and will look back at their struggles and laugh. So was it with me and Eric's views. I would point to Eric's work and tell people not to pay attention to some race related material as the topic that I was trying to talk to them about was the main theme and race related writings were just personal views. But as I delved deeper into Eric's work - 1860+ page book, video lectures, and of course his 5 day a week radio show on LibertyRadioLive site - I realized how wrong I was.Eric is not a \\"racist\\" as some of you label him, well actually as Eric points out, he is not a \\"hateful racist\\". Some of you reading reviews might think that he is some kind of Grand Inquisitor of the KKK. Eric believes in \\"Biblical racism\\", each race living in their own country. He advocates that we here in North America should have a \\"Black country\\", \\"White Protestant country\\", \\"Catholic country\\" etc etc. If you would listen to his radio shows and video interviews, you would hear how he calls out all these organizations like KKK, Nation of Islam, ADL, as all having the same master. Never did he utter any hateful words towards any race, ethnicity or religion. It is easy to call him (hateful)\\"racist\\" if you just heard a minute or two of his show, or read his work without further follow up. Of course if somebody would hear a person say \\"I want to live amongst white people\\" the first thing majority would think of is \\"that person must be a racist\\". But is that where you would stop? Did you hear the whole context, did you listen to more of his shows, shows where you would hear more and more of what Eric and his work is all about?Shame on people making fun of his writing style. So what that you have a masters degree in English Mr. Byk, does that mean that you can go ahead and thrash persons writing skills because you have this fancy paper and I'm sure technique to write and speak in a very, super awesome, unbeliavably jaw dropping way? Shame on you Mr. Byk. I would think spreading vital information to all corners of the Earth is of the utmost importance, be damned a style, technique or vocabulary.I must also say that hate which is coming towards Eric Phelps, from real and not agent types is because a very big majority of us here in U.S. are not Nationalists. We might scream that we love this country, we might thump our chests and wave our flags and act all \\"Patriotic\\" on certain holidays, but 90% of those people don't even know what being a real Patriot and a Nationalist really means. That is why when he talks of our country coming first and us loving our country 100% without any mental reservations (favorite Jesuit trick), when he says that we will not have any international corporations and organizations, that we will be a moral and Bible believing country, people just cannot take that. We love our lust for money, our fornicating ways, our UN, our numerous immoral organizations that grand stand as if they give a damn about us, we love acting homo/bisexual, using drugs, not showing any respect towards others. So it is understood that when a man comes along and tells you to stop that foolishness, you gang up on him and open a barrage of baseless accusations.But that is alright, united states of America is right where you want it to be. Be proud of it. Maybe some people indeed just cannot have freedoms given to them by those same Calvinists, Baptists and Presbyterians, people that you love to hate so much. I was not born into a religious family, nor do I practice any religion - though with Eric's preaching on his show it just might change, as I have bought a Bible for starters - but I sure do have respect for all those people that gave us this country and that were fighting hellish inquisition for well over 800+ years to bring us this place of real freedom, freedom that you almost all gave away, as day by day we have more and more chunks of it taken from us.This book will cover Society of Jesus (Jesuits) history, from their inception in 1542 to the present time. You will see all their demonic works laid out in front of you on these pages, works that were covered by hundreds of writers in 1600-1900's, but yet some of you would still say that Eric Phelps pulled all his info out of you know what. You will see their fingerprints all over the globe and world events whether they being small or big. Most of you know of many historical events especially of military nature that were/are dubbed \\"unexplainable\\" or \\"BLUNDERS\\", well in these pages you will read about the \\"BLUNDERS\\" of American Uncivil War, you will read of \\"BLUNDERS\\" of WWII, and you will see info that will make you forever erase the word \\"BLUNDER\\" that was always associated with it as you will see the light of day. I don't have space to write about JFK Assassination chapter, that is over 100's of pages long, which details what exactly happened and who was really involved. Might as well not waste your money on specifically JFK assassination related books, just get this one.Do not forget who was arrested and tried after Lincoln assassination as well, and who pulled all the strings so as to slow down and confuse the arrest/trial of conspirators. As you should know, it was right after Lincoln assassination that U.S. broke off their diplomatic ties with the Vatican for well over 100 years until 1980's and Ragan. Do not forget that Lincoln was in correspondence with his best friend Charles Chinique and said that the Jesuits were behind the war, but if he were to tell this to public, the war would turn into a religious war and massacre would ensue.Do not also forget that it was JFK who told Archbishop of NY Cardinal Spellman to never attend White House and barred him from CIA briefings, YES cardinal seating at the briefings, gotta love it!!!!Again, listen to Eric Jon Phelps' radio shows, give him time, do not just disregard him and his work. Same people that were burning, quartering, torturing people for well over 1500 years, still cling to same ideals and goals. After all, they never even closed down the Holy Office of the Inquisition, nor did any of the popes ever canceled Council of Trent doctrines and what came out of it."},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"This is a first-class history book. Mr. Phelps covers all the bases beginning with the reformation, and continuing all the way to the present.He uses endless sources, including sources that almost cannot be found in print. Some of these books, such as Cusack's \\"The Black Pope,\\" cannot be found save in the complementary CD which comes with the book.Although some of his claims are not backed up with direct evidence (such as that the government keeps hidden technology in Area 51), it is certainly plausible, and fits appropriately with the over conclusions.Be aware, the Jesuits were the most evil people in history, and we have reason to believe there has been no change. Phelps develops this brilliantly. Be sure to study the Kennedy Assassination!"},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"This book is neither anti-Catholic nor anti-Jewish. In fact, if you actually read the book (excellent material by the way), you may notice that Phelps claims that most of the anti-Semitic propaganda is purposefully fabricated by the Jesuits (not Catholics) so that any bad aftermath can be blamed on the Jews and they (the Jesuits) can remain hidden. Phelps, furthermore, claims that it was the Jews who many times blocked Jesuits plots. He also claims that some of the bravest men who confronted the Jesuits are Catholics such as JFK.Finally, Phelps also explains that one of the main weapons of Jesuits is the \\"divide and conquer\\" technique, for which they use deceptions to create and then manipulate conflicts."},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"Those who've given this only ONE star on here either didn't read this book or have an agenda to discredit this wonderful, informative, well-written book.Very informative and also very explosive.

Every red blooded American should have this book in their library to correct their neighbor when they try to blame the Jewish people, \\"neocons\\", Muslim Arabs or any other group or peoples for the destruction and confusion we see taking place at home and abroad.Being an ex-catholic myself it was hard for me to digest at first. But as I continued to do my own research I was amazed at what I found.Knowledge truly is power. And when you read this book you will begin to see so clearly exactly WHAT is going on in current events and WHY!"},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"This is a serious part of history that in my opinion everybody needs to know about, I feel phelps has brought the darkness into the light with this incredible work on the history of the Jesuits to the present date. The book contains many quotations from numerous authors who have written on the subjects of the Jesuits. After reading the purpose of their oath it doesn't really stand to wonder what this sinister organisation is all about.From a historical point of view to nobleman and women who have stood up against relentless tyranny from the society of Jesus, it is poignant to say the least that our hero's who stood up to this filth such Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Benito Pablo Juarez, JFK and Oliver Cromwell to name a few, ended their lives by either the poison cup or the lead bullet from the Jesuits.I take my hat off to the author for sharing his profound work. If people want to understand the war on terror as it stands today I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"I have read it and the book is available on CD for a fraction of these prices atCuttingEdgeMinistries.comSomeone has taken the trouble to make sure that the average person cannot get a hold of this book.

WTH? Amazon is listing one for $77 and the other for $499. Whoever is listing that, You are an idiot.Ok, I haven't read it (it cost too much), but I just spent 3 hours reading an incredibly long interview with this guy. The interview was fascinating! I must say, this guy is definitely a racist and I think that might skew some of his interpretations.. Like his implication that the Vatican is somehow trying to damage society by backing the Civil Rights Act and encouraging race-mixing.. What??? That's just stupid and moronic implications will just damage your credibility, Eric.First of all, there's only one race, according to the Bible (He's a Calvinist). Every person is an extension of one man, Adam. He obviously had within him the genetic variation for every ethnic \\"look\\" that you see. And by the way, none of the ancient ethnic groups exist anymore! They've all been mixed or annihilated through wars or intermarriage that led to mixing. Thats the nature of ethnic groups that coexist.. they evolve and change over time.Also, the book of Acts says God made every nation of One blood.. So go race-mix that!Anyway, I don't doubt the validity of most of the accusations Phelps has against the Jesuits. I learned about their evil deeds years ago, but I was under the impression that their power had waned. Now to discover that they control the international bankers that control the world's economies... That's very interesting."},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"We all the know (even devout Catholics) that the church, and many of their more promenant arms such as the Jesuits, do not have a lily-white history. The church, often through the Jesuits, has supported ruthless regimes, semi-totalitarian religious rulership, murderous inquisitions, and have tried to manipulte world events in their favor.Unfortunately for this book, that's about the only useful conclusion you will reach, which you probably knew already. And you'll reach that conclusion on the basis of very questionable historical analysis. The text is littered with illogical, poorly drawn, and at time fantasical conclusions that are not even supported by the information the author presents.This is another in a long line of intricate, arcane, and ultimately ignorant works that attempt to revision history in the light of the authors fairly deluded fantasies. The church, like any other ancient power (e.g. the UK, the Muslim world) attempts to look after its own interest, some of which are beneficial to the world, other of which are not. These ill-formed conspiracy theories help no-one."},{"Title":"Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends","review":"This is pure trash.

Likely not for undergrads, Giddens is able to tie together in novel ways some of the key concepts that connect the writings of Marx, Weber and Durkheim. A good deal of the book summarizes the key writings of each author-- which is useful in itself-- and supports much of the summary material with compelling quotes and citations of both the author in question, as well as others who have done secondary analyses. Giddens also devotes a few chapters to analyzing the three authors in comparison, and spends a good deal of time teasing out differences between the three that were not, for me at least, apparent right away. In other words, a solid and original analysis. Not five stars because there was less on similarities of thought between the authors than I would have liked to have seen (and no explicit comparative analysis of Weber and Durkheim, only Marx vis-a-vis the other two), but this is probably due to the fact that Marx, Weber and Durkheim diverge in so many fundamental ways. Nevertheless, truly a must read for those who want to begin to get a grip on classical western social theory in a more sophisticated fashion than what most textbooks (which this is not) might have to offer. Get it, because if it's this old and still in print in the academic world, there's a reason for it..."},{"Title":"Capitalism and modern social theory;: An analysis of the writings of Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber","review":"Well, to sort of disagree with the previous review, I feel that this book is great for Undergrads! I, myself had the opportunity to read this book in a social theory class and have since relied upon Giddens excellent analysis of these theorists! It really helped me grasp the detailed (and often times confusing) ideas and theories of the classical theorists. After reading the book, I was able to more fully understand the actual works of these individuals. I use this book as reference guide to refer back to what Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber said."},{"Title":"Capitalism and modern social theory;: An analysis of the writings of Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber","review":"Giddens outdid himself for sure! He definitely knew that me and my friends would use this book in our Sociology theory assignment as supplemental reading to aid out paper. Although I did not read this book from cover to cover, it found the Durkheim commentary very useful. Two of my friends also used the Weber and Marx sections, and thanked me so much for purchasing the book. Giddens gets straight to the point, explaning himself very clearly to the reader . . . which is often difficult in theory. The best way to use the book is to look up your subject of interest in the index while you have your primary source in front of you. Enjoy it and save it . . . it'll come in handy een after you're done with your theory class."},{"Title":"Capitalism and modern social theory;: An analysis of the writings of Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber","review":"Giddens is the most well-known British social scientist after Keynes and one of three masters in sociology with Bourdieu and Habermas. This book has been widely used as textbook in classes on the history of sociology, while his more recent book, &iexcl;Introduction to Sociology&iexcl; ahs occupied most introductory classes of sociology.1. Giddens might be the best and deepest understander of three father of sociology. The prestige and appeal of his structuration theory might be rooted in that mastery. Before proposed the outline of structuration theory in &iexcl;New Rules of Sociological Method&iexcl;, he spent about ten years in digging into three founders: Marx, Weber, and Durkheim. This book is the fruit of that effort.Unlike usual textbook, this book us not simple introduction to classical theorists. The need to read classics lies in the problem sociology poses to itself: &iexcl;what is the modernity?&iexcl; Whereas other sister disciplines pose somewhat narrower problems-capitalism for economics, democracy for political sciences- sociology questions the modernity itself. That&iexcl;s the very problem three fathers posed over a century ago. But still we question the same problem in the way they set. So we should always return to classics when meeting the fundamental problem.2. The style of this book is clear, easy-to-follow, and jargon-free enough to be used in undergraduate introductory class. But it doesn&iexcl;t mean that there is no depth in this book. Giddens argues that thoughts of Weber and Durkheim should be understood as the reaction to Marx. His emphasis is convincing and offers a good standpoint to look up three fathers as a whole. Such a point is invaluable to beginners. Moreover, his interpretations are opposite to conventional wisdom, with solid grounds. He contends that there is no discontinuity between young Marx and late Marx, against humanist views like Frankfurt school&iexcl;s and structuralist exposition like Althusser&iexcl;s; there is no inconsistency I Weber. He was always a radical neo-Kantian; the relationship of Weber and Marx should be seen as creative tension rather than antagonism; Durkheim&iexcl;s point lies in not primarily in &iexcl;the problem of order&iexcl; but in the changing nature of order in the context of social development."},{"Title":"Capitalism and modern social theory;: An analysis of the writings of Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber","review":"i brought this for my assessment yet to see how well I went. Thereis lot of informartion there that could be useful for someone studying sociology."},{"Title":"Capitalism and modern social theory;: An analysis of the writings of Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber","review":"If the reader will permit, I'd like to use this review space to reflect upon the indirect consequences of this text's popularity for the discipline of sociology.Giddens was certainly not the first to canonize the \\"founding fathers\\" of sociology. Talcott Parsons did that in \\"The Structure of Social Action\\" and elsewhere. He conjectured that Weber, Durkheim, Pareto, and Marshall unwittingly converged on a theory of human action. Of course, Parsons left Marx out of the picture, and that serious mistake would be drastically corrected with the explosion of \\"Western Marxism\\" following the first English translations of Marx's early writings. Raymond Aron included Marx (as well as Comte, Montesquieu, and de Tocqueville) in his account of the \\"Main Currents of Sociological Thought\\". His vision of sociology was that of a river which sprang from the onset of modernity (in France) and later diverted into distinct but often parallel streams. Anthony Giddens, in the work in question, takes up much the same task as Aron, but seemingly dismisses the work of early French thinkers. Instead, sociology is crowned the science of modernity because all other sociologists of importance are reactionaries to Marx, and Marx is the preeminent analyst of capitalism.My point is this: whether by Aron's or Giddens' account, sociology is understood as the science of modernity. It is understood as the largely retrospective study of social change and transformation. Because of Giddens' theoretical genius in later works like \\"The Nation-State and Violonce\\" and \\"The Constitution of Society\\", his account of the sociological tradition has been given further credibility. But why must sociology be so focused on the past? We have discarded Marx's philosophy of history and thus the historical inevitability of certain social transformations, but does that mean we should stop looking to the future?Both classical sociological theory and political theory are, or will soon, be challenged by three important developments: contemporary race theory, biotechnology (both genetic and pharmaceutical), and robotics/artificial intelligence. Race theory has made the greatest influence thus far. New histories have shown just how integral race is to our understanding of statehood, citizenship, social engineering and the like. New analyses have shown the scientific impotence of race as a human category. And the contemporary demographic developments in the U.S. and Western Europe make these intellectual assessments all the more real.Bioscience has also moved above the radar as a real of concern for sociologists. If we choose to seriously consider the \\"garden conception\\" of the state (one in which the state, as steward, must prune human flowers and eliminate human weeds), then the implications of bioscience are truly incredible. Here, sociologists and political theorists have taken up the line of thinking pioneered by philosophical ethicists, dystopian novelists, and science fiction writers. They understand how in an age of genetic and chemical manipulation, the definition of normal and the treatment of those who are abnormal take on increased significance.The sociological and political consequences of significant developments in robotics and artificial intelligence have been given the least attention. Of course we can read interesting treatises on \\"liquid modernity\\", \\"organs without bodies\\", and a global \\"network society\\", but these works tend to emphasize cultural innovation and changes in popular values. To vulgarly characterize such accounts: they assert that new technologies provide new human possibilities that in turn encourage new values and practices. The human organism (I dare not say subject!) remains intact although his physical and cultural stimuli are changing rapidly. But, in differing ways, race theory, bioscience, and robotics/AI all help us define what the human organism is. If personality can be situated outside of (or in a small fraction of) the human body, doesn't that require a rehauling of action theory? Of the idealist/materialist dialectic? Of the whole subject matter of sociology?While Giddens' \\"Capitalism and Modern Social Theory\\" is a wonderful exposition on three great theorists, it is also a reiteration of sociology's conservative self-definition as the science of modernity. Even though they often call our current society \\"post-modern\\", sociologists are still caught up in the same old game. Only now they want to understand the transition from modernity to post-modernity. And while that is an incredibly valuable line of research, it should not be the only one that is given credence by sociological orthodoxy. As it stands, the sociological implications of robotics/AI are only discussed by science fiction writers, animated characters from Japan, and less-than qualified \\"futurists\\". This is valuable territory that could be better explored with the help of trained sociologists. And there is endless research to be done at the intersection of the three intellectual developments in question.Thank you for reading, and please contact me if you'd like to discuss the subject further."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Advisors: Protecting Your #1 Asset - Creating Fortunes from Your Ideas","review":"Not as captivating as most other rich dad books I read but I'd put the house up that the information is accurate and very detailed.

I ordered this book on CD to listen in my car. It is almost painfully hard to listen to and even harder to follow.The reader sounds almost like Casey Kasem (which you would think is a good thing, but it's not) and his voice almost never changes tone. He barely inserts appropriate pauses, and the information is just brutally hard to pay attention to and follow.While the actual information to the book may be alright, I would not recommend the audiobook to anyone.The only information I've truthfully ascertained is that at the end of the day, if you have a serious idea or trademark issue, you need to find a patent attorney.

Considering that the book is written by an attorney who is bound by the rules of ethics not to disclose his client's confidential matters, I found the book to have ample specifics and examples of different types of intellectual property protection.My personal impression is that it is a book that can help business owners looking to protect their intellectual property as well as those who are interested in a more scholarly approach. That is the genius of this book. It can be very useful to many different kinds of readers.

Also, I was attracted to the book because of an introduction by Robert Kiyosaki, whose work I am very familiar.Although the book gives a broad brush about intellectual property (IP) protection from many different perspectives, and offers some useful guidelines to help protect your intellectual interests, it is somewhat incomplete as far as the protection of ideas or intellectual capital is concerned.It does not give any specific illustration and/or example on how to protect your intellectual capital from the standpoint of goodwill, reputation, expertise, (especially accumulated practical skills), data and know-how...more specifically, your ideas and/or \\"working methodologies\\" which are embodied in products and services.Take an example from the book, on page 58, under Utility Patent Protection, the author talked about:\\"Business method is patentable if:- it produces a useful, concrete, and tangible result; and- it is novel and not obvious;but the book stops short of giving specific business cases or product examples to illustrate this key point. This is, to me, intellectual capital, and I want to know how to protect it!As a matter of fact, the author talked about how he came to know Robert Kiyosaki...from the CashFlow game. Funny enough, the author did not even bother to give any detailed account on the IP protection scheme pertaining to the game. Nothing at all, period. I thought this would have been a very appropriate subject, because of the need for the protection of intellectual capital behind the development of the game - and the gameplay procedure - from pirates.The book listed a lot of other IP stuff, which were not covered in the book, but the author directed the reader to his website. For example, the author introduced his IP self-audit checklist, among other things, which sounds interesting. When I checked his website, I realised I had to fork out US$129/- to buy a CD-ROM containing the stuff.My overall personal impression of the book is that both Michael Lechter and Robert Kiyosaki are using each other to sell each other's products and services! (which are well-illustrated on many end pages of the book!) The poor reader is expected to fork out more effort and money...maybe that's why the Rich Dad series of products are so lucrative for the author.On the whole, this book falls short of my personal expectations. I am very disappointed with the author and also, Robert Kiyosaki.To be fair to the author, I feel that the book, even though it is incomplete from my personal viewpoint, still provides a broad-brush about IP, - especially on copyrights, patents,and trademarks, - from many different perspectives."},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Advisors: Protecting Your #1 Asset - Creating Fortunes from Your Ideas","review":"Protecting Your #1 Asset is one of the most helpful introductions to the legal side of intellectual property acquisition and management that I have seen. Few who are not intellectual property attorneys have this knowledge. As a result of ignorance, many well-meaning individuals make substantial mistakes that cost them substantial incomes. This book will \\"alert you to the pitfalls that can strip the rights from the unwary.\\"This book covers the primary ways to protect intellectual property, including trade secrets, utility and design patents, mask work protection, copyrights, trademarks, and trade dress. This is done in the context of maximizing your revenue and income by creating protected intellectual property and creating competitive barriers, while minimizing the risk of receiving and being harmed by third-party claims against you.The book's set piece is Robert Kiyosaki's experience with inventing what he called a \\"shoe pocket\\" which was Velcro and nylon wallet that is now called a \\"surfer shoe.\\" Mr. Kiyosaki did not protect his idea, and was soon put out of business by competitors who copied and outperformed him. The book then goes into a number of horror story examples of how simple mistakes can cost a person or a company its intellectual property. Some mistakes can be as simple as not properly dating invention notes, while others can involve \\"abandoning\\" the invention by not continuously working on it.The book gives you a lot of guidelines of what you need to do to obtain and retain protection, and helps you understand the pros and cons (and availability of these protections).As someone who studied intellectual property in law school, I found the book impressive. I intend to recommend it to those I know who are developing intellectual property but have limited knowledge of the field.The book's main weakness is that it doesn't give you a sense of what the costs are related to these protections. If you have intellectual property worth a billion dollars and lots of cash now, that's not a problem. Go for the best protection! On the other hand, if you have something that you're not sure what the value is and not much cash, you may want to take the less expensive routes. Top intellectual property legal advice will usually cost hundreds of dollars an hour. A worldwide patent position can cost well into six figures in dollars. So if you need intellectual property counsel, get into those cost issues at the beginning of your relationship. If trade secret and copyright protections are enough, the advantage they have is that they are not very costly to obtain and maintain. In seeking out intellectual property help, do try to find an attorney who is experienced and has educational credentials in the field in which you are seeking protection for your work. A small percentage of the bar (less than 5 percent) is well qualified to work in these areas as Mr. Lechter implies. Within that small group, one person in 30 will probably be much better suited to your issues. Take the time to find that person.After you finish reading and thinking about this book, I suggest that you also consider how you could build a business out of just creating intellectual property. That business model may be one of the most valuable in the decades ahead.Seek ideal improvements daily!"},{"Title":"Rich Dad's Advisors: Protecting Your #1 Asset - Creating Fortunes from Your Ideas","review":"Background: I've read all of the RD books, 6 of the Rich Dad's Advisors series, and other books by the RDA authors. For all of the RD/RDA books, I have found the conversational style to be very readable and an effective manner in which to convey information. With this book, however, it was a struggle to get through it. In terms of readability and value, this is the worst RD book I've read.Coverage of Material: I am not knowledgable about IP law, and I felt that this book provided a basic coverage of the issues.Organization: One frustration I had was that a lot of material was repeated, and obviously so. Rather than organizing the book in a more efficient manner, the author instead chose to repeat certain passages. When I've paid for a book, I don't care for the same half-page passage repeated three or four times.Writing Style: The first part of the book was well written. I especially liked the initial horror stories and phone conversation, both of which were written in a conversational style. If that style had been maintained throughout the book, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. However, the writing quickly degraded to being almost unbearable. Some parts of the book were written with a condescending tone, and it seemed that Mr. Lechter was stroking his ego. I also found the lengthy discussion on the Internet's structure to be tedious and unnecessary, perhaps a filler to increase the page count. This information was not relevant to the subject; a one or two page summary of the Internet would have been sufficient.Other Comments: I've enjoyed Robert Kiyosaki's books, but as a whole they are full of contradicting information. This book was no exception. In the foreword, Mr. Kiyosaki uses the same quote three times, wording it differently each time, and giving two different references (Rich Dad for two, himself for one).Bottom Line: I read this book because I want to read all of the Rich Dad and Rich Dad's Advisors books. In general, although a few of them are blatant advertisements, I've learned something from each one. In the case of this book, I would strongly suggest you find an alternative, unless you want this book because of the series affiliation.

I agree with many of the other reviews here, in that it really isn't helpful to someone interested in protecting their ideas, but only helpful to Kiyosaki and the author.

Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer. The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book. Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me. And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical \\"horror stories\\" that he relays at the beginning of the book. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down.

I think the lawyer also appreciated that he did not have to spend time and explain to me (what was obvious to him) the different strategies to protect intellectual property. I think this made him willing to help me with better advice.Of course, I needed to learn more about drafting patents, and also the different geographic regions granting protection to different patents. I had to learn more about trademarks and the right strategy to registering trademarks in different regions.

His description of those four years of the regimen at the Academy is the best I have ever read and a stark contrast from the current coed/liberal/college atmosphere which has prevailed at the Naval Academy since the seventies. For Cooper the traditional curriculum, discipline and ethos of Service which had been unchanged at the Academy since its founding in 1845 provided the foundation for building an exemplary career of Service for his country.The heart of his story, and the remainder of the book, begins the day after graduation as a Marine Corps second lieutenant. In less than ayear he was in Korea, a platoon leader, replacing a lieutenant who had been killed several days before. In the next three chapters Cooper tells about his combat as an infantry man in the rugged mountainous terrain as they kept pressure against the retreating Chinese and North Koreans. An all out assault was ordered to take Hill 907 with Cooper's platoon leading the attack. Hill 907 was the command post of the 10th North Korean Division and was serving as the rear guard of the Chinese Corps.As Cooper signaled what was left of his platoon (12 to 15 Marines) to move forward with him the volume of fire swelled and he heaved his last white phosphorous grenade as far as he could to mark the enemy position for two Air Force F-80s overhead with napalm. The grenade had flown some thirty yards when a massive blow on his left side flattened him. Cooper was grievously wounded but the corpsman moved like a fash and stuffed his kidney back into a large hole in his lower back. What happened next as the North Koreans counter-attacked is best told by Cooper himself. \\"We couldn't kill them fast enough and, heavily out numbered, were about to take on the North Korean counter-attack in hand-to-hand combat. As they started moving my carbine was hit on the stock and literally blown out of my hands. Conscious but unable to move my legs, I drew my fighting knife. It would be the last resort. There was nothing else left. We never heard it coming. Hell exploded through the trees. The napalm bombs burst in the branches directly over the North Korean troops, not thirty yards away. Fire and flames were everywhere. The heat was unbelievable. We had burns and almost suffocated, but the North Korean counter-attack had been incinerated en masse. It was no more.\\"Lieutenant Cooper, to the utter disbelief of the doctors not only survived those wounds and fractures and a tortuous medvac under fire and recovered completely to have a lively and highly successful career in the Marine Corps, retiring as a Lieutenant General, and also another combat tour in another war, Vietnam. Which leads us back to the beginning of the book and his introduction titled \\"The Day It Became the Longest War\\"This five page piece was originally published in the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings magazine in 1996 (Cheers and Tears was published six years later) and describes in detail a private meeting the Joint Chiefs of Staff had with President Johnson in the Oval Office in November 1965. Cooper was the Marine Aide to Admiral McDonald, the Chief of Naval Operations and had prepared a map of Vietnam mounted on plywood to be used to show the president graphically their recommendations regarding Vietnam. The easel which was to be provided by the White House was not available and so the president told Cooper to stand \\"over there\\" holding the map and so was privy to everything said in that meeting. It was an ugly nasty meeting with Johnson shouting, cursing, swearing, using language that even a Marine seldom hears, finally ending the conference by shouting \\"Get the hell out of my office!\\" Proceedings is not a widely read magazine and an account of this raucous meeting of the Joint Chiefs and the Commander-in-Chief was essentially not in the public domain until the publication of \\"Cheers and Tears.\\"All in all it is a great story, very well written and it carries a message that conveys hope, honor and pride.Thomas W. Schaaf Commander U.S. Navy (Retired)In 1949 Schaaf was a plebe at the Naval Academy when Cooper was a first classman. Schaaf graduated in 1953"},{"Title":"Cheers and Tears: A Marine's Story of Combat in Peace and War","review":"An excellent read of an impressive military career and human being. I came across this book while searching for information about my brief 2 year career in the Marine Corps. Turns out that in 1966, then Lt Col Cooper and I both reported for duty a few days apart with the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines at Camp LeJeune, N.C. He reported as the Commanding Officer of 2/8 and I reported as a lowly 19 year old Private. As it turned out, I would see him in action almost daily for 18 months. I worked in Battalion Headquarters as a clerk/typist first for the Adjutant, Lt Dean Aggers and then for Major Joe Cody, S-3 Operations. Col Cooper's office was just a few steps down the hall, so we were all immersed in his dedication to duty.These three Marine officers along with Capt Steve Leroux literally changed my life. They were all excellent role models for a young Marine -- strong discipline, work ethic, and leadership that trickled down to all those in the battalion. I found Gen Cooper's account of his time at 2/8 to be descriptive and totally accurate in details - exactly as I remembered 45 years ago.I have about 50 photographs of my time at 2/8 and the CARIB 4-66 exercise. I regret that I only found this book now, 2 years after Gen Cooper died. I would have enjoyed sharing my photos of that time in our lives with him.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in military history post WWII, especially from the perspective of a combat Marine officer who rose to the top echelon in the officer corps. Gen Cooper's recollection of his attendance at the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with President Lyndon Johnson is worth the price of the book alone."},{"Title":"Cheers and Tears: A Marine's Story of Combat in Peace and War","review":"I stumbled across this book and I was astonished to see that the author had served as Staff Secretary at III MAF Headquarters in Danang, Vietnam. I worked for the Staff Secretary of III MAF but my tenure there was from December of 1967 to December 25, 1968. As a corporal I had trained all the members of the message processing group by the time I left including those that outranked me. General Robert E. Cushman, Jr. (later Commandant of the Marine Corps) was in command when I was there and he gave me a letter of commendation and the Chief of Staff gave me a plaque of appreciation. I found General Cooper's description of the place very accurate. We endured rocket attacks while I was there during the Tet Offensive and his description of the attacks he experienced brought back memories for me. My office chief (a Master Gunnery Sergeant) was killed in one of those attacks. Fortunately I was gone by the time the author arrived but this book informed me about events after my departure which I appreciated. In particular it gave me a greater appreciation of the job my boss (the Staff Secretary) was doing. The book is well written and covers periods in the history of our country and the Marine Corps from an interesting perspective. I wish I had been able to meet the author before he died."},{"Title":"Cheers and Tears: A Marine's Story of Combat in Peace and War","review":"A very thoughtful and inciting biography of a great American hero and man.

His commands were exceptional as noticed by his rise to the top of his profession....The first time I noticed Gen Cooper was when he had a co.at the Basic School.

One could guess this was an adult book.Davis is a black American and of a general liberal bent. As you read, you can tell the side he favored in this war--the Loyalists. He generally glosses over the abuses the Republican government commited during the Civil War, but expands on the attrocities perpetrated by Franco's forces. Oh well, Davis can slant the way history is perceived.I would say this is a well written book, if one overcomes the slant of Davis's writing.

Aside from that, I loved the dialect given the characters. They became so real to me. The story line from beginning to end was very satisfactory.

The book begins by showing how idealists and romantics tried and failed to unite Germany, but Bismarck was a realist and based his methods on the strengths and weaknesses of individuals.First Bismarck used cunning diplomacy to isolate the Austria, Prussia's rival for control of the German states. The Franco Austrian war demonstrated Austria's weakness, and increased worries among northern Germans about French strength. This improved Prussia's hand, and later Bismarck's hand.Pflanze follows Bismarck's tactics step by step through his labyrinthine maneuvers as heplayed France against Austria during the Schleswig Holstein situation Bismarck wanted to separate Austria from the German confederation and inspire the northern German states to unite into a Northern German confederation.After Bismarck unified northern Germany he designed the constitution to allow him to play the Reichstag against the Prussian chamber of deputies. There was also a balance of power between the state and confederate governments. We also see domestic political and economic background to Bismarck's actions. Pflanze shows the domestic politics after Bismarck created the northern German confederation.Bismarck used relations with France to make advances toward the southern German states. Pflanze carefully shows how Bismarck cleverly tried to use the Luxemburg crisis to woo the southern German states. But the southern German states were afraid of being overwhelmed by Prussia. The only thing that the southern German states admired about the northern German confederation was the Prussian military expertise.Relations between France and Prussia worsened when the throne of Spain was offered to a Hohenzollern Kaiser William did not care if any of his relatives got the Spanish throne or not. But when Bismarck made it seem that the French had demanded that Kaiser William renounce any attention in the Spanish throne, he angrily refused. The nationalist French responded by declaring war.Bismarck wanted a war with France to inspire the southern Germans to join the northern confederation against the threat of France. In this he succeeded. But nationalist anger of many, and political reasons of Bismarck caused Germany to annex Alsace Lorraine, which resulted in permanent hatred from France.The only faults of this book are that Pflanze should have described the people more. He also should have included more maps and a bibliography."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears by the Sea (Step-Into-Reading, Step 2)","review":"In &quot;The Berenstain Bears by the Sea,&quot; co-authors Stan and Jan Berenstain take Mom, Dad, and the two cubs to a vacation by the seashore. The cartoony illustrations of the humanoid bears are visually delightful, and the easy-to-read text is great for younger readers.Although this book is meant for an audience of young children, I must admit that, as an adult reader, I found it quite enjoyable. How can you resist lines like &quot;May we? May we? / May we, please, / dip our tootsies / in the seas?&quot;This book portrays a family that genuinely enjoys spending time together. And it even teaches a lesson in the virtue of patience. This Bears romp is a great choice for the beginning reader."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears by the Sea (Step-Into-Reading, Step 2)","review":"The book called By the Sea is funny.

The 5 star rating is for the author but the company that sent it to me should get an \\"INCOMPLETE\\". The minute you get this product listen to the first few minutes of EVERY CD. You will probably find at least one either defective or a duplicate of one or more of the others, even though they are correctly labeled. Three of us bought this set and all three of us have either a duplicate cd or blank cd in our sets. I received the product promptly and promptly discovered that tape 7 was defective, an associate found #7 (labeled as #7) to be same recording as #2. All three of us have sent the company emails advising them of the defects and requesting replacement CD's and as of today (over a month later) none of us have received a replacement CD nor an acknowledgement of any kind. Since I travel extensively it is very inconvenient to return the entire product for a refund but I will get to it ASAP. NOW, ABOUT THE PRODUCT. EVERY MESSAGE ON EVERY CD is motivating and filled with reminders of how to think and feel if you want to get things accomplished and it is delightful to feel his dynamic personal energy and enthusiasm coming through the speakers as I gobble up hundreds of miles of asphalt every month. Because I travel between my offices in AZ and CA I like to fill (and feel) my mind with motivational material rather than negative talk radio or music during some of the 7 hour drive.

I got published after 12 years of trying and failing.after this one, I brought the rest of his work."},{"Title":"Personal Power!","review":"I could talk about the tapes / cd's but that's been done. Let's talk about the man, with some analysis of his work to support, of course. Some of the reasons Tony Robbins is so succesful is that he not only puts into practice what he preaches, but he has also learned from his experiences and has applied them to his work. For example, his company was in debt and all of his employees were yelling the sky is falling, the sky is falling, that he should declare bankruptcy. However, Robbins was able to shine through with a unpopular, going against the grain perception, that there was \\"a way\\" and that he was going to find a way to bring his company out of the ashes. Which as we all know, he did.Another important factor in his success was overcoming his own personal detractions. He thought he was too young or not educated enough to be a personal trainer. However, he overcame these negating beliefs.I will now give you some of the limitations in my life to let you see that it is not whether or not we can do it but resides in the belief that we can do it. Most who want to become successful, unfortunately, become seminar, books and tapes junkies, never going beyond just dreaming. Being a dreamer is fine but there has to be a reason for motivation to make change. What's the biggest motivation? Most self-helpers don't bring this up. I'll get to it in a moment. Let's get back to some more examples of \\"desperate overcomers\\", the newest shoe on television.Growing up, I was the shyest, most introverted person ever to walk the face of the earth. I know. I've checked with the dead. When some of my classmates met me in my twenties they were impressed with my voice, a voice they never heard. When confronted by strangers, or an angry parent, what I would do in response was this: say absolutely nothing. I believed in my miranda rights--even though I had no idea they existed. (I have made similar complaints to my college students that dead authors, whose works I read after writing a particular novel, had stolen my ideas. Typical dead people. Remember, I know them well. Back to the story.)At one point in my life, in my pre-self-help days (I had never read a self-help book until I was well into my forties), I decided to use the Elenor Roosevelt method of total immersion (an amazing woman, along with others: read all about why women have overcome their political and social limitations through two other amazing women [ladies, get your tattoos now!]: Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.) At about the age of 25, whenever in public, I began volunteering any time I was attending an event and someone was needed to come before the audience. I then performed in bands, as a stand up comic, college professor (humor comes in handy in keeping student's heads in an upright position: eyes forward,oxygen masks overhead, isles clear please), and teacher / lecturer in classrooms, auditoriums, churches and so on. This is where I began to slowly, very slowly, move beyond abject fear. You know the kind, where you're so scared you can't think? Well, it only took me about eight years of constantly being in front of people before I was able to turn a weakness into a strength. Where I was able to not be paralyzed by a thought about how the big, bad, mean people in the audience were going to join in a chorus of \\"We're just gonna poke some fun . . . at this guy who's so damn dumb.\\" Maybe Tony Robbins could have helped here, but I had to do it on my own. The THINGS I LEARNED WERE PRICELESS AND HUNDRED TIMES MORE INSTRUCTIVE THAN ALL THE SEMINARS, BOOKS OR TAPES I COULD EVER PURCHASE.What's my point. Tony? Great. Mark Victor Hansen? Great. Jack? Great. T Harv Ecker? Great. Og Mandino? Great. Zig Ziggler? Great. What's my point? Regardless, YOU, yes YOU, are solely responsible for finding what motivates you and how. Tough assignment? Sure. Is life tough? Hell yeah! But the toughest, most depressing, debilitating thing you can NOT do is grow. If you remain stagnant (and I've seen an alllllllll too great a number of stagnant people in my life) you will get to the end of this one-time-only opportunity and feel as depressed, as sad, as useless, as used up and pointless as you could ever feel. Don't ever even come close to sucking up to that kind of depression. I've been there. Looking down from the tops of buildings and parking lots. It's hell. Leave hell here on earth. Take some heaven with you when you go. Get the led out and go, go, go, until you get there. The alternative? It really sucks. Love. Peace out.Oh, another point: do you find yourself depressed? Your life pointless? Well, the answer? Give. Give until it hurts. Find as many people as you possibly can and tell them the truth, the truths. The truth will not only set you free but you'll make a lot of friends along the way. And it's really cool because they own stuff you can borrow and play with. That reminds me, I've got to return my neighbors poodle. Me and the kids were playing Beauty and the Beast in the backyard. Poodles really know how to act beastly. I'm guessing it has to do with working through an inferiority complex. Stay big."},{"Title":"Personal Power!","review":"I thought this cassette was useless.

What is unusual is his approach, and the specific targets of his barbs.'Court', by the way, seems to have the sense of 'Imperial Court' rather than 'Court of law'. Animals of the several kinds meet, and Shoeki creates clear precedence among the lords and under-lords, the generalissimo (I wish I knew what word led to that translation), and all the other ranks within each kingdom. Shoeki establishes the proper role for animals of each type - including the roles of predator for the larger and prey for the smaller. The humor lies in showing how behavior proper to an animal is quite unsuitable for a human, no matter how common it may be.The whole story is backed by hundreds of years of folklore about each animal, combined with alchemical beliefs about the five elements (fire, air, water, metal, and wood), plus a huge mythology or philosophy of Shokei's own. The story was written in the 18th century. Scientific thought was well established in Europe back then, but seems not to have been as strong in Japan of that day. The contrast is fascinating, even if Shoeki is not an accurate representative of his time.Most interesting, though, was Shokei's choice of targets. Shinto priests came under fire. Buddhists of the half-dozen major schools took more of his sarcasm, as did doctors. Shokei outdid himself, though, in repainting Confucius, Mencius, Lao Tzu, and Chuang Tzu as criminals against the proper humnan spirit, as parasites on society, and as breeders of other human parasites. Other historical masters are less well-known to Western readers, but suffered the same fate at the hands, paws, wings, and fins of Shokei's menagerie.As I said, I wonder about parts of the translation. I also wonder whether Shokei had trouble sustaining his initial writing energy. Each chapter is shorter than the one before and, I think, less sharply written. Still, the book as a whole is delightful. The commentary within is interesting, but the 18th century social and scientific Japanese thought behind the book is what really held my interest."},{"Title":"The Animal Court: A Political Fable from Old Japan","review":"This is another boonie dog book review from Wolfie and Kansas. We like the Japanese people, because the Japanese tourists we have met on Guam pet us and pose for pictures with us. Ando Shoeki's fable &quot;The Animal Court&quot;, written in the eighteenth century, gives us another reason to like Japan and its people. In Shoeki's parable, the birds, beasts (mammals), creatures (insects, reptiles and amphibians) and fish each hold an assembly to discuss human society and compare it to their own. Some of Shoeki's ideas are strange, both by the standards of his time and place and ours. Nonetheless, he has a positive attitude towards animals. For example, he asserts that we dogs are sages, because both dogs and human sages yap at shadows.The blurb on the back cover of this book describes it as Swiftian. In some ways, it would be more accurate to describe &quot;The Animal Court&quot; as Orwellian. In George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, &quot;[t]he creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, but it was already impossible to say which was which.&quot; The animals in Shoeki's tribunals compare human society to their own, and find very little difference. One of the few differences, according to Shoeki, is that the behavior of beasts is largely guided by instinct, while humans make a conscious choice to behave in a beastly manner"},{"Title":"Understanding Management Research: An Introduction to Epistemology","review":"This text should be required reading for every aspiring management or organizational researcher.

Given my beliefs, am I a \\"postmodernist\\", \\"Critical Theorist\\", \\"symbolic/interpretivist\\", \\"constructionist\\"? I know I'm not a positivist anymore. To sort this out, I had read directly in philosophy (difficult going), social theory (less difficult but still not easy), and management theory but I was having trouble getting a handle on it. Then I found Hatch & Cunliffe's book on Organizational Theory and I thought it was great, that is, until I discovered Understanding Management Research by Johnson and Duberley.Johnson and Duberly not only clearly define and describe the various views but more importantly they clearified two issues that had been bothering me. First, what is the role of ontology? To me that seemed to be a bifurcation point but this wasn't clearly laid out in Hatch & Cunliffe's book or the other readings. Johnson and Duberley make it very explicit in a table in the last chapter and I think they've got it right. Second, I was having trouble placing ethnography and other qualitative types of research. They are often placed in the constructivist/hermeneutical realm but I knew some of it was clearly positivistic. Johnson and Duberley clarified that it can be in either area.

The fact that she always has something intriguing to say makes her work all that much better.This audiobook is about ninety minutes long, and the focus is on subjectivity. Dictionaries of dream analyses can't work, because ten people dreaming the same dream would make ten different associations to it. Dr. Estes is very careful in emphasizing that, above all, we have to place our own subjective interpretations on everything we dream. After forty-some years of reading dream dictionaries with no success, I was glad to hear this.Although Dr. Estes is a Jungian and does not believe, for example, that a snake represents a phallic symbol, she does give thirteen universal archetypes and their \\"typical\\" meanings. I had a problem with this section. For instance, she tells us that one common dream concerns hair loss, which is universally interpreted as losing one's power or strength. The only example she gives is the biblical one of Sampson losing his physical strength when his hair is cut. I had a dream of losing hair decades ago when my angry mother threatened to cut my long auburn curls, and I don't think it had anything to do with strength, as short hair was in style and I'd looked fine with short hair before. I was afraid of my mother, and to me, that was obvious. Also, not everyone believes in the Judeo-Christian bible, so assuming hair loss equals strength loss just doesn't seem like a universal connection.I had another problem with the audiobook. Dr. Estes tells us to write down the nouns (people, places, and things) in our dreams. Many of my dreams involve emotions; sometimes there aren't even nouns involved. I've spoken to other people who experience nausea dreams or jasmine-scented dreams, and none of us know how to interpret them.The problems I've listed are small in comparison with the impact this dream interpretation guide had on graphic, semi-lucid, recurring dreams I'd been experiencing. Using what Dr. Suzette Hadin Elgin calls a \\"thought map,\\" I used what nouns I could remember and interpreted these dreams with the help of Dr. Estes's information. That was about a week ago, and those graphic nightmares have stopped.If you're tired of reading that a dark shadow indicates impending death, and that rosebuds mean you're about to \\"bloom\\" a new idea, give Dr. Estes a try. She provides the sanest information on dreams I've come across in my almost sixty years.Thank you, Dr. Estes, for another excellent bit of insight."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Guide to Dream Interpretation","review":"This is great instruction on interpreting your own dreams.

And then retelling the dream with those meanings substituted. \\"I stepped into a brightly lit open field...\\" might become \\"I stepped into brightly lit freedom...\\" I applied this to a dream that did not seem very significant. It was about characters from a TV show having a conversation. I figured I had the dream because I'd watched the show before bed that night. I did what she said to do, replacing personal associations for the elements of the dream. I realized that the dream actually spoke to a relationship I was in and emotions I was feeling concerning it."},{"Title":"The Beginner's Guide to Dream Interpretation","review":"This book is a practical and sensible introduction to the process of dream interpretation, from the Jungian perspective.

You probably should go over it several times over some months as there is a learning curve, and I still pick up new insights even having listened to it several times.But it is for beginners and does not make one an expert. Don't let anything worry you. If you are concerned see a psychologist. If you specifically want a Jungian psychologist, there are C.J.

An educated layperson or non-Christian could read this with profit. Soards keeps the technical matters of lexicography, archaeology and grammar to endnotes. In the text itself he gives a careful, if conventional, verse-by-verse commentary. This volume surpasses Morris in the Tyndale series."},{"Title":"1 Corinthians: New International Bible Commentary","review":"Marion Soards' work is part of the New International Biblical Commentaryseries published by Hendrickson. Its copyright date is 1999.Despite its inexpensive price tag, the commentary by Soards contains a numberof rich exegetical discussions and some intensely pleasurable didacticsections on Greek words. I have found this commentary to be more valuablethan works costing three times as much and I must say that Soards'objectivity is quite refreshing.While Soards tries to avoid an anachronistic view of Christological subordinationism, he nevertheless explains Jesus' role inthe New Testament within the context of divine agency (God acting through Christ who serves as the divine intermediary). According to Soards, Paul doesnot seem preoccupied with Trinitarian concerns and seems to view God theFather as the one God of Christianity. On the other hand, Jesus is called KURIOS by Paul (indicating the apostle's \\"uneasiness\\" with calling Jesus QEOS in thefullest sense of the word). But Soards does not press the Christological discussion too far in his attempts to avoid imputing later ideas to an earlier writer.Another aspect of Soards' commentary worth calling attention to are hisobservations on 1 Corinthians 11:1ff. While D.A. Carson confidently asserts thatKEPHALH in 1 Cor. 11:3 unequivocally means exercising authority over anotherperson, Soards reexamines this lexical issue, thereby giving his readers pause forreflection. While I may not fully agree with Soards' final analysis of 1 Cor. 11:3, the section is highly instructional to say the least, and it caused me to domore research on the terms at issue (KEFALH, ROSH (Heb.), ARXH, ARXWN).Finally Soards ends on a climactic note with a discussion of 1Cor. 15. As most Bible students are aware, Paul's delineation of theresurrection (the TELOS of the age) and the time when God becomes \\"all inall\\" has been the locus classicus for numerous debates on the nature of theresurrection and the intra-trinitarian relations of the triune Godhead. Explaining 1 Cor. 15:24ff, Soards again writes that Paul was not doctrinally concerned with the Trinity--but thinks of Jesus as the one through whom God works (i.e., Jesus is the divine agent). In view of the quality discussions in this book, I can heartily recommend it. Anyone who purchases Soards' book will not be disappointed if he/she enjoys new angles on familiar topics."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"This historical-critical text of some 350 pages took me longer to read than I'd expected: many of the subjects discussed tend to be complex, even though Scholem's prose is always comprehensible. Fortunately, the book is partitioned into more or less independent chapters on different subjects, so you don't have to read through the entire thing uninterrupted to avoid losing a particular train of thought.In numerous places, Scholem compares the various schools of Jewish mysticism to Gnosticism. Like the Gnostics, most of the Kabbalists -- even really strange thinkers like Sabbatai Zevi -- pursued hidden knowledge, rather than faith, as a means of establishing a direct relation with God. And like the Gnostics, many Kabbalists assumed that the soul of man exists in a state of exile from the true God, as a result of a primordial cosmological imbalance. The Sabbatians went as far in Gnostical thinking as to assume the existence of two Gods, a hidden one and a revealed one; although the Sabbatians reversed the traditonal Gnostic interpretation by preferring the revealed God (the God of Israel, whom the Gnostics opposed) to the hidden God. This striking set of similarities between Gnosticism and Jewish mysticism was the strongest impression I came away with from reading the book.I found the Jewish mystics to be a colorful and profound group of thinkers. While just a bit dry in a few places, this book engagingly describes an impressive, energetic theological tradition."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"When reading Scholem I often feel like I am reading an old testament prophet; his writing and words seem to convey a great dignity and authority and power beyond their age.Major Trends is basically a set of lectures Scholem gave on Jewish mysticism. Scholem was one of the first scholars to apply scientific methods of criticism to Jewish mystical texts and traditions and their sources, which had been neglected to a large extent in favour of the rational Jews like Moses Maimonides. The age of Reason had little time for religion, myth and mysticism and it was really only in the latter part of the 20th century people began to return to their mystical traditions.Scholem made many important discoveries, including showing the author of the Zohar (which supposedly came from the 2nd century) was written by Moses de Leon, a 11th century Spanish Jew. Also in this collection are some valuable studies of the relationship between Kabbalah and Christian Gnosticism, and on Isaac Luria's bizarre theosophic ideas, and of chariot mysticism which influenced early Christianity and many apocryphal biblical books such as the Books of Enoch.Scholem's study remains the most important 20th century study of Jewish mysticism."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"This text is simply indispensible for anyone interested in Kabbalah's history and development.

It began as a series of lectures, so the presentation is on the dry side, but the contents more than compensate.It's ironic that Gershom Scholem became famous as a scholar of mysticism, because he embodied old-fashioned Jewish suspicion of anything mystical, Romantic or high-flown. This points to the puzzle we face here: that Judaism, a religion of the practical and actual, emphasising the distance and disparity between God and man, should even have produced mysticism. Jews extracted their mysticism from the Torah and the Prophets as arduously as Marie Curie extracted radium from pitchblende.This helps to explain the diversity and near-surrealist strangeness of Jewish mystical spirituality. Shiur Komah mystics visualised the Physical body of God: His arms so many billion miles long, and so on. Hekhaloth visionaries ascended to graduated Celestial Palaces (a practice St. Paul must have been familiar with.) Merkavah mystics concentrated on the vision of the Divine Throne/Chariot in Ezekiel Chapter 1, with its inconceivable Living Creatures and Wheels within Wheels.The proto-Kabbalah of the Book \\"Bahir\\" with its clumsy dream-like myth-making. The full-blown Kabbalah of the vast, untellably strange \\"Zohar\\" or \\"Book of Splendour\\", a whole universe reverently explored by generations of pious Jews. Then the new Kabbalah of Isaac Luria, with its (astonishingly) far from omnipotent God who bungles crucial stages of the process of Creation, and (still more astonishingly) needs Jews to help repair His gaffes.Mystics were always a minority. Most literate Jews were preoccupied with Talmud, ever-more refined discussions of the Sacred Law governing practical conduct. But just as someone's dreams may tell you more about them than they are prepared to admit out loud, this book is a window on the hidden life of Jews during their centuries of dispersal, expulsions and persecution.You may be familiar with \\"magical\\" pseudo-Kabbalah, the Sephiroth and the Tree of Life torn up from their roots in Torah; or with New Age Kabbalah.

The only question is if the author consciously lies or subconsciously avoids problems, which still remain out of the Israeli national concensus."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"Gershom Scholem was President of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and a Professor of Jewish mysticism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem until his death in 1982. He wrote the standard collage textbook on Jewish mysticism ('Major Trends...'). He is also the author of 'Origins of the Kabbalah', 'Kabbalah', 'On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism', 'On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead', 'The Messianic Idea in Judaism', and 'Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah'. Every book is a treasure in and of itself. Mr. Scholem put the Kabbalah back on the 20th century map. His studies on the 'Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation)', The Bahir (Bright)', and 'The Zohar (Splendor)' show the brillance of this unique individual.'Major Trends...' is broken down into nine lectures. He covers everything from the beginings of Jewish mysticism up to modern times. He traces its origen from the Second Temple era, through the apocalyptic/pseudepigrapha period, and right into Jewish gnosticism with the Thrown (merkabah) mysticism. The 'Hekhaloth Books' (hekhaloth: the heavenly halls or palaces the visionary passes through on his way to the seventh heaven where there rises the thrown of divine glory) are well known for the their similarity to standerd gnostic works. The caves around Khirbet Qumran are another (Dead Sea Scrolls). He covers all aspects of this; the 'Song of Songs' and its mystical meaning (it was banned until a man reached 40 years old), the Shi'ur Komah (Measure of the Body of God), and all the magical elements that encompassed this, also theurgy, and so on.All of this, of course, was several hundred years before the epoch 'Sefer Yezirah' was conceived of. The Jewish nation had to suffer through the loss of their Second Temple, the messianic revival of the infamous Bar Kokhba (the Star of Jacob) and Rebbe Akiva's endorsment of him, the loss of their country to the Romans, the loss of their 'restablished' country under Mar Zutra (in their 'new' capital of Mahoza, near Bagdad) in 502, and so on.He covers the mystic Abraham Abulafia and his prophetic Kabbalism (and how it broke Kabbalism in two), the Zohar and Moses de Leon, En-Sof (the hidden God), the ten Sefiroth (numbers) and Sefirotic development through the years (from Sefer Yetzirah to the Zohar), also the Shekhinah (the female side of God), Isaac Luria (the Lion) and his students (his Cubs), and the stunning impact the exile from Spain had on the Kabbalah in general.The last two lectures cover Sabbatai Sevi and the disaster he brought on the Jewish people. He very nearly destroyed Judaism itself for 250 years afterwards. The impact is still felt to this day. He also shows the modern Hasid's (the Ultra-Orthadox Jews) and how the Kabbalah and the Zohar influance their teachings and beliefs. He also shows why regular Orthadox Jews avoid the Kabbalah (calling it Jewish witchcraft) and why they considear the Hasid's to be cultists of a sort (even though the Kabbalah WAS Orthadox Judaism for 300 years before the advent of Sabbatai Sevi - which Mr. Scholem painfully points out).I have only scrached the surface of the things this book contains. If you can buy one book on Jewish mysticism, this is it. It is well worth the purchase.Sincerly, Shawn W. Ooten"},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"For those of you who want to understand where and how the major trends in Kabbalism developed, look no further. This book covers all of the major ideas in their proper historical context, from Gnosticism to Hasidism.The author's concept or purpose is to dispel many of the misleading, and speculative notions on the nature of Jewish mysticism. In the process, taking the mystical/magical portions for the most part out of the equation.What I like best about Scholem's work is that he is not so concerned with what the meaning of each Kabbalistic notion but is primarily concerned with where it originated and what circumstances allowed for the development of an idea. This allows for an objective and unbiased consideration of the concept being studied.What you won't get in this book that you will find in most others about this subject is the promotion thereof. No evangelical tendencies exist which make for a more throrough reading."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"With these nine snapshots of Great Moments in Jewish Mysticism, Scholem gives an amazing crash course in an immense &amp; complex spiritual tradition. His chapter on the Zohar is especially helpful, with concise explanations of tricky concepts like Sefiroth and the Shekinah, God's female aspect (I had no idea! Though since reading this I've heard Leonard Nimoy say that he copped Spock's split-finger greeting from synagogue, where it signaled the Shekinah's presence).Scholem's affection for the Kabbalists stems from his belief that they kept alive a mythic, almost pantheistic, vision of God against the more rationalizing tendencies of mainstream Judaism. The mystics as he describes them, despite their arcane systems, were closer to popular beliefs and aspirations than the 'official' rabbinical tradition. In 1938, when Scholem gave these lectures, he hoped for a spiritual revival from within Jewish mysticism at a moment of crisis. I don't know if the New Age hipness of the Kabbalah was what he had in mind, but for all the measured, scholarly prose his heart is clearly with the weirdos.I knew almost nothing about Jewish mysticism going into this book. I put it down with a new respect for one of the human mind's more intricate and neglected creations."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"Gershom Scholem transformed Kabbalah into an acceptable academic discipline. Today many writers/scholars/professors follow in his footsteps (e.g. Wolfson and Idel). He, no doubt, did us a great service. It should be noted, however, that he was an historian--neither scientist nor Kabbalist. He appears to have faithfully presented Kabbalistic doctrines, teachings, etc. Nonetheless, the reader should be sensitive to a certain lack of scientific viewpoint on the one hand and mystical/experiential knowledge and orientation on the other--in all of his works. That said, this is a wonderful book, probably his best (certainly his most famous) and one of the best available today on Kabbalah per se. If you like this book, I'd recommend you also read, \\"Jewish Gnosticism-Merkabah Mysticism-and Talmudic Tradition,\\" \\"On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead,\\" and his voluminous entry in a Jewish Encyclopedia on Kabbalah published as a stand-alone volume entitled, \\"Kabbalah.\\" Both this last work and \\"Major Trends\\" illuminate most of the main Kabbalistic concepts (e.g. the Shekinah, the female Presence or Immanence of God). Any serious student of Kabbalah will find the present work a necessary addition to his/her repertoire. It's probably the best known contemporary work on the subject. The historical data has great breadth and considerable depth. However, it does suffer from Scholem's lack of mystical or scientific background. For example, near the very front of the book, he asserts that no on would consider the prophets to be mystics. This is untrue. Since I consider it so (and he's broken the non-all ness principle), he is simply wrong. Since a mystic has direct knowledge or contact with God, and prophets have such, they are most definitely mystics. In set theory they would be a subset of mystics (a circle within a circle on a Venn Diagram). This does not, of course, imply that all mystics are prophets. My favorite quotation from this book is on page 229:\\"It says something for its [the conception of the Shekhinah as the feminine element in God] vitality that, despite the opposition of such powerful forces [the philosophers and the strict Talmudists as well], this idea became part and parcel of the creed of wide circles among the Jewish communities of Europe and the East.\\" Thus, Scholem points out the innovative content of Kabbalah vs. normative, Rabbinical Judaism with its emphasis on the transcendence of a male God. This book is a close as you get to required reading in Kabbalah for both the scholar and the practitioner. After all, a mystic needs the balance of having his/her feet on the ground (of good scholarship=good theory) as well as his/her head in the clouds (of meditation and mystical attunement)."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"Although the print is kind of small and the notes are inconveniently at the end, this book is an excellent resource! I'm a Christian, and not a mystic. I bought this book to better understand some odd Christian teachings floating around in several modern church movements that I suspected, from other reading I'd done, are kabbalistic. The contents of this authorative book clearly delineate the relationship of Jewish mysticism and magic to the main features of these new Christian movements. (For instance, the current emphasis on holy spirit \\"anointings\\", visitations of the shekinah, and \\"the bride of Christ\\" clearly come from Judaica.) Christians interested in embracing their Hebrew roots need to read this, order to properly discern and divide what is scripture from what is tradition. (A copy of Abraham Cohen's \\"Everyman's Talmud\\" is very helpful too!)Despite the esoteric topics, Gershom Scholem is fairly easy to understand, and the book is organized into logical topics. It also has a good index and tons of bibliographical references. A must for your reference shelf."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"I learned a great deal from this text, and further my spiritual understanding has been enhanced by Herr Doktor Gershom Scholem's (1897-1982) book, &quot;MAJOR TRENDS IN JEWISH MYSTICISM&quot;. This text is of a type which transcends criticism. In the forward, professor Robert Alter describes this pioneering work as &quot;an enduring contribution to the study of religion&quot; which &quot;stands out as one of those rare intellectual achievements of the middle decades&quot; of the twentieth century. A great deal of territory is covered here. The historical and theosophic development of the Qabbalah with respect to its role in Judaism begins before the building of the second temple (roughly 538 BCE) and continues into the 19th century after the founding of the Hasidic movement by Israel Baal Shem (d 1760). In a stimulating and engaging presentation, Herr Doktor Scholem explains the major trends which span more than 2 millenia. They include Merkabah Mysticism &amp; the roots of Jewish Gnosticism (100BCE - 1100CE), Mediaeval German Hasidism (1150-1250CE), Prophetic Kabbalism (1200-1300), the development and influence of the Book of Zohar (1276-1400), Lurianic Mysticism (1391-1650), the Sabbatian Heresy of the 17th century and finally, 19th century Hasidism. The breadth of this development is awe inspiring. Just as important for me are the details. I was excited when I learned of the Lurianic Kabbalah's Theory of Tikkun which Herr Doktor Scholem describes as &quot;the greatest victory which anthropomorphic thought has ever won in the history of Jewish mysticism&quot;. The doctrine of Tsimtsum provided me with a clear alternative to pantheism for the first time. This doctrine separated theism from pantheism because it provides an answer for the existence of something other than GOD. Isaac Luria must have been an astounding individual. Thomas Aquinas briefly defines mysticism as &quot;cognitio dei experimentalis&quot;, as the knowledge of GOD through experience. Which brings me to the most important idea I learned from this text, namely, that there is a place for the irrational in the worship of the LORD, my GOD, in whose presence I am. If you are interested in Mysticism of any type, creed or practice, this text is indispensible for you."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"What I love best about Scholem is that he wrote eloquently about spiritual enlightenment without presenting himself as being a mystical master or guru. He will guide you through the history of Jewish esoteric thought, after which you can sample some source texts (many of which now are available in English translation). No preaching here - just good scholarly thought and clear, eloquent writing. It's also amazing how a 60-year old volume remains the standard introduction while still being regarded as controversial in fundamentalist quarters. An awesome achievement!"},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"Kabbalah is one of those things that everyone seems to want to be part of, and something that enjoys a high level of fashionability at the moment. While this is great, it also means that there is a lot of rubbish out there with \\"Kabbalah\\" printed on it. For the beginner or the curious, this can make getting at the real thing a bit daunting and difficult.Scholem's book \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\" is rightly considered a classic in the field of Kabbalah and the study thereof. While somewhat aged, the book still retains its status as among the most respected of works.Scholem covers the major phases of Kabbalah, and includes sections on each one. He delves into the details, teachings, personalities and the impact of each phase, and brings the reader an erudite introduction to them. He includes early Jewish Merkabah mysticism, Lurianic Kabbalah, Abulafia, the Zohar, (a big section on this!) and even the very interesting Sabbatianism.I found some points of terminology a little objectionable in connection with Gnosticism, but this would not be an issue for the general, non-Gnostic reader. As such, it should not discourage you from reading it.As a starting point, Scholem's \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\" is unbeatable for both its scholarly approach and also for Scholem's ability to make it all understandable and absorbable. This is a fantastic book and one worth getting. I could not praise this book enough.To be honest, if Gershom Scholem wrote it, you can't go far wrong with it."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"This is the best guide to understanding Jewish mysticism that I know. Scholem was the great pioneer in the field. He opened up the mystical texts to serious scholarly investigation after they were ignored by more as it were ' rationalistic ' scholars. In doing so he connects us with a remarkable tradition and group of thinkers who contemplate the human divine relationship with utmost intensity and seriousness. One of the more interesting points for me was Scholem's distinction of Jewish Mysticism from other mainstream mysticisms, the central idea that for the Jewish Mysticism G-d can be approached , and must be approached as closely as possible but cannot be wholly unified with. i.e. that for the Jewish mystic some Transcendent dimension must always remain outside which the human can never come. I also greatly appreciated Scholem's meditations on the effect of Lurianic Kabbalah on Jewish history. And in this sense Scholem's own sense of the Jewish people's return to history as not involving an immediate and final demand for its end, but a place in its ongoing development. This brief review does not do justice to the richness of the concepts invoked and explained in the work, nor the scope of the thought. Rather it touches the points which most touched me.The joy of intellectual adventure at the highest levels awaits the reader of this work."},{"Title":"Major trends in Jewish mysticism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"Gershom Scholem was a pioneer in the academic study of Jewish mysticism. Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism is an excellent introduction to the kabbalah. The book covers the main historical movements and personalities. It explains the basic doctrines, rituals, and texts. The footnotes and referenced authors and texts become an excellent source of further study for both the academician and the spiritual seeker."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"I can't believe this book is out-of-print! I received it as a gift when I was about 10 years old and have read it over and over. Fortunately, I saved my old copy so I can still read it to my kids who are now about the right age. It's so sad that such a fine example of children's literature is no longer available."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite kids' books. Children love it because the heroine is cocky, resourceful, independent, and virtually an orphan.Set 100 or so years ago on the whaling island of Nantucket, its argot-speaking British heroine has to solve a mystery of international intrigue and help her friend learn self-reliance. The book contains a delightful and wildly improbable mix of characters - a nest of dangerous Hanoverians, pious Quakers, a naieve scientist of unspecified Germanic origin, and two clever little girls who have to navigate this bizarre and somewhat menacing world. The characters are almost Dickensian, the setting is engaging, and the heroine's inventive London street speech is classic. Top marks and a whole-hearted recommendation to any adolescent who wants something more than the formulaic drivel of the insipid Sweet Valley Twins."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"As a child I LOVED this book and read it several times"},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"Joan Aiken writes a brilliant story on two levels which continues the saga of Dido Twite, lost at sea in the preceding novel (Black Hearts in Battersea.) She is rescued by a whaling ship whose skipper, the lugubrious Quaker Captain Coffin, is obsessed by his hunt for the great PINK whale while having some difficulty relating to his timid daughter, who has locked herself in his cupboard for the duration of the voyage. Dido wins her trust and is 'rewarded' by her father who imposes on her to be a sort of au pair. The girls are dropped off in Nantucket where they are to be under the 'care' of Coffin's sister, auntie Tribulation. Tribulation does indeed appear as Nantucket turns out to harbour anti - British-monarchy terrorists and the wicked Miss Slighcarp, villainess of 'The Wolves of Willoughby Chase'. The fast-paced, intricately- plotted story comes to a very clever ending.As usual Joan Aiken is brilliantly spoofing 19th century literature. Adults will find the parody hilarious while children thrill to the melodrama."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"When we last saw Dido Twite at the end of \\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\" she was going down with the Dark Dew ship, swept away from her friends Simon and Justin in the middle of the ocean. Whilst the two boys were forced to go on without her (eventually preventing an assasination attempt on the Duke of Battersea), Dido's fate remained a mystery, that Joan Aiken now resolves for expectant readers in the third book in her \\"Wolves Saga\\".After a ten month long sleep, Dido awakes on board a whaler in the middle of the Artic sea, on a boat completely covered in icicles and frost. There she meets young Nate, a ship's hand, who informs her of her surroundings, of how far she is from home. Also on board is the fox-like and slimy Mr Slighcarp and the moony Captain Casket, who is determined to chase and catch the magnificent pink whale. He informs Dido that his young daughter Dutiful Penitence Casket is also on board, but who has locked herself away in a cupboard in mortal terror of the sea. He requests that Dido attempt to coax her out, and then accompany her to her Aunt Tribulation on the island of Nantucket before she tries to head back to England. Dido, taking it into her responsiblity to teach Penitence not to be so timid, agrees despite her homesickness.But there are other mysteries about, such as the fierce stowaway that Dido finds hiding in the hold, and the suspicious actions of Mr Slighcarp that aren't solved by the time Penitence and Dido reach the domineering and threatening Aunt Tribulation. The two girls eventually realise there's a Hanoverian plot in the making that involves a giant gun being fired from Nantucket to London, which will not only succeed in destroying the palace, but with blowing Nantucket backwards into New York harbour! With pink whales, German inventors, hidden woods and a familiar villainess from \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\", Joan Aiken once more dishes up excitement and intrigue set in her continually-growing parallel world, where history mingles with fiction, and characters engage in some rather incredible situations!To a point, \\"Nightbirds in Nantucket\\" was not quite up to the standards of \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" and \\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\", as the duo of the strong-willed Dido and the meek little Penitence reminded me a little too much of Bonnie and Sylvia of \\"Wolves\\", (especially in \\"Aunt Tribulation\\"'s treatment of them), and the Hanoverian plot of conquering King James III was basically the same threat that was faced in \\"Black Hearts\\". However, Joan Aiken's imagination is amazing, whether she be creating the icy whaling ship sailing through the Artic Sea, or the warm sunny moorlands of Nantucket with its white-washed cottages. Her melodramatic plot twists and devices are always humourous and adventuresome (despite their unlikeliness), and the story ends on a note of further adventure for the irrepressable Dido Twite."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"Yet another incredible book in this series by Joan Aiken! This one places the focus on Dido Twite, and one of the things that I thought was most enjoyable about this book was seeing Dido grow into the strong, tough-girl from the wretched \\"brat\\" in Black Hearts in Battersea. I also thought that there was a lot more humour in this book than the previous three. I guess this book is like the \\"growth\\" book. Dido grows into the confident person we see in the later books, and Dutiful Penitence, under Dido's care, also becomes much stronger during the course of this adventure. I guess what I'm saying is that this is the book that makes Dido the mainstay for the rest of the series by showing how she grew stronger and how she helped others grow stronger.I think it's a funny spoof of the whaling society of Nantucket in the 19th century, and of the Puritanical sort of Quaker types who brought up \\"Pen\\". This book introduces several sympathetic, believable, \\"bang-up\\" characters, such as Nate, Doc Mayhew, Cap'n Casket and Professor Breadno, and of course, Mr. Jenkins. The plot is wildly fantastical, (and physically impossible, in some parts) but the wonderful storytelling more than makes up for that, and rather sets the scene for the even more eerie and improbable sequels, The Stolen Lake and The Cuckoo Tree. Loads of fun, a must read for kids, and I personally think that adults should read it just to get in touch with the inner child within, etc. etc. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"This book (along with &quot;Wolves&quot; and &quot;Black Hearts&quot;) is one of the finest pieces of youth fiction ever put into print.

As Nightbirds on Nantucket opens, Dido has been picked up by a whaler out of Massachusetts, and has been in a coma for some ten months. When she finally wakes up, her main goal is to get back to London pronto, but life, and the ship's captain, have other plans for her.The series keeps improving book by book. It's a lot of fun, and if you missed it the first time around, you should definitely consider giving it a try now. ***"},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"There's a more fantastical than Dickensian feel to this third in the Wolves Chronicles. As the story opens, we find Dido Twite (thought drowned in the climactic storm in \\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\") aboard the Nantucket whaler that has picked her up, just waking from a \\"long winter's nap\\" indeed--ten full months. The ship's Captain, Jabez Casket, is, like Captain Ahab, in quest of a whale--but his is as pink as a strawberry ice. Since the ship is currently in Arctic waters, he can hardly return Dido to her beloved London, but he does have a task for her: lure his young daughter, Dutiful Penitence, out of the stores closet in which she has locked herself ever since her mother's tragic death at sea early in the voyage. This the resourceful little Cockney succeeds in doing, but as she explores the ship and gets to know the crew, she discovers that there are mysteries aboard. Who is the stowaway hidden in the hold? What was the paper Second Officer Slighcarp tore into bits and flung overboard soon after the \\"Sarah Casket\\" had bespoken another whaler?Returned to Nantucket with Pen (as Dido has christened her), our heroine finds that she will have to remain a while at Captain Casket's farm until arrangements can be made to return her home. Here it soon becomes apparent that Pen's \\"Aunt Tribulation\\" is in fact the mysterious stowaway. And lurking in the nearby woods are a band of Hanoverian plotters who have succeeded in fabricating an immense cannon with which they plan to lob a shot all the way across the Atlantic and murder good King Jim in his palace! Dido, Pen, and the \\"Sarah\\"'s ship's-boy Nate must find a way to expose the conspiracy and prevent the king's assassination. The pink whale, who proves not to be a figment of Captain Casket's imagination but a very real cetacean, plays a pivotal part in their counterplot.In this book Dido assumes a central role in the series, one she will hold for several volumes to come. She's definitely a heroine for our time--gutsy, clever, quick-thinking, quick with a comeback and afraid of nobody, loyal to her friends and tough as a leather thong. Apart from the incredible elements of the cannon and the whale, which most kid readers shouldn't have much problem accepting, the chief difficulty I have with Aiken's story is that Dido--whose entire family was shown in \\"Battersea\\" to be Hanoverians down to the very youngest cousin--here declares herself a Stuart loyalist and risks life and limb to save her king, something which would have been easier to swallow if Aiken had given some thought to setting it up in the previous book. It would also be nice to know how Miss Slighcarp, the sinister governess from \\"Wolves,\\" escaped getting her just due after her attempts to bring about the deaths of Sir Willoughby and his lady and take over their estate (no doubt with the view in mind of using it to finance James III's overthrow). But all in all this is another fast-paced and delightful alternate-Universe romp that maintains the author's previous reputation as a storyteller."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"My daughter and I read this book together. I had read other books in this series as a child and loved them. Nightbirds on Nantucket is very well written. Dido's is a very engaging heroine and we have read most of the books by Joan Aiken that involve Dido. I recommend all of them, but this is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"A writer I know first pointed me toward Joan Aiken, with high praise that I didn't find justified for *The Wolves of Willoughby Chase*, though I was more accustomed to Aiken's MO by the time I'd read *Black Hearts in Battersea*. This book continues the Aiken penchant for totally implausible major plot elements - as in this one, when Dido Twite is fished from the sea at the end of *Battersea*, put aboard a whaler and kept alive in a 6-month coma by being fed molasses and spermaceti oil. The concluding two major plot elements are equally incredible, and while I can't say I'm won over to this side of Aiken's work, I like her characters, including Dido, and she takes care over the verisimilitude of her settings, whatever loony events happen there. Nantucket and the whalers come to life very nicely, and the plot line ends with a spectacular if unlikely climax and an HEA for nearly everyone.This book hasn't developed the darker side apparent in the next work, *The Stolen Lake*, and more so in *The Cuckoo Tree* and the later books, which wd. make me classify Aiken less as somewhere around but not as satisfying as Diana Wynne Jones or Eva Ibbotson - who are less \\"fantastical\\" even when dealing in fantasy - than as a Clayton's version of Mervyn Peake. Particularly notable for this are the increasing number of caricatures, esp. the villains, and the nasty demise of assorted spear carriers - not just nasty deaths, but often unlamented ones.Wd. give this one 31/2 stars if such was available."},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"I love the Wolves chronicles - they were some of my childhood favorites, so of course I recommend this and all the books to this series!"},{"Title":"Nightbirds on Nantucket (Wolves Chronicles)","review":"I read this book after Dangrous Games (another book in this series).It was nice to read about Dido as she was a child.I have enjoyed this book.If not by the story than by the delightful castof characters,starring Dido,Pentinence,Nate,Captain Casket and Aunt Tribulation.I recommend this book to children of all ages."},{"Title":"Harlem Renaissance Re-examined: A Revised and Expanded Edition","review":"This carefully edited and informative work provides up-to-date scholarship and insights into this important era of American History.

Let me tell you, this book is neither impress nor is Gail Petersen a better author than Anne Rice. This book just oozes cheese.There is nothing worse than the cartoonish caricature of a vampire being a musician. Anne Rice made this ridiculous stereotype more interesting with her eloquent writing while Gail Petersen just made me wretch with this book. How many times must the public endure the same ol' crud like the character Kate stuck in limbo with her so-called &quot;suffering&quot;?

The beginning started out well and I really liked the interaction between Justin and Kate. I did find Kate's struggle with Vampirism interesting. But, when Kate decided to become a rock star the book took, IMO, a turn for the worse. It was too contrived. When I did get to the end of the book it started to pick up again, but with only a few chapters left. The book would have been much better without the rock star section which was a big chunk of the story and expanding on the evil doctor and Justin relationship. I think Gail decided to write about what she was most comfortable with (rock n roll bands) than what could have been a great story."},{"Title":"The Making of a Monster (Abyss)","review":"I got this book off a supermarket rack and bought it on a whim. It has a fairly plain cover, and a cheesy back cover description, but I thought it might be a fun read. What I got though, was a phenominal story that I ended up staying up all night to finish.The storyline keeps you guessing, the charecters are believeable (insomuch as is possible given preternatural circumstances), the narrator and main charecter Kate is so well developed... the reader finds themselves identifying with Kate right away, and then gets sucked down with her, into her gradual charecter shift from 'Suzie homemaker' to 'monster at heart'. And at each step the shift is so subtle, you never stop identifying with Kate as fate makes a monster out of her.11 years later, its still my favorite book.

A lot has been written about &quot;Bitten&quot; about a female werewolf being the latest thing but I think &quot;The Making of A Monster&quot; covered this territory back in 1993 and did it much better.

Considering that Gail, the author, is in a band, Kate's interaction with her band is very believable, more believable than that very famous vampire's rock band.

Gail Petersen's previous experience as a musician/songwriter in the alternative rock band, The Catholic Girls, comes into play a lot in this book (after all, this book was inspired by a vampire song she had written), as well as her strict Catholic upbringing. Both elements give Kate's own musical and religious struggle a bit more credibility. This book is certainly worth a try if you're a vampire lover.

With her usual ability to light up characters in a few vivid strokes, Van Wormer paints one as physically off-putting for &quot;the air of heavy handed money, the promise of, if all else fails, I'll pay you&quot;. Let's just say that nothing Sally learned at Castleford High prepared her for the viciousness of her welcome to the big leagues.But what I've long admired in this author reflects what she doesn't do. While delivering her patented wall-to wall suspenseful tour through the world of bicoastal superachievers, she resists the cheap shot and instead puts real flesh and blood on even the most driven and sometimes despicable.Van Wormer writes about the celebrity slice of society as a more forgiving Tom Wolfe, taking care to illuminate the motives of those who constantly measure the distance to perfection. That's why putting yourself in her capable hands never fails to satisfy.PS - if you have a chance to see Ms Van Wormer read/speak in person, as I have, drop other plans to do it.

In a return engagement (see EXPOSE), Sally remains a great protagonist seeking to find love even as her needs and desires confuse her. The support ensemble augment the tale with vigor and a two-coastal insight that shows Laura Van Wormer is a wonderful author who makes reading fun.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Last Lover","review":"the last we see of Sally Harrington.I really enjoy these books.Fast and furious dialog. Plenty of action.I LOVE the whole behind the scenes looks of television news and reporting. That is always a standout element of Van Wormer's.I found the characters in this and the other Sally Harrington novels to be well fleshed out. A plethora of wonderful characters with diverse backgrounds.This story takes us from Conneticut to NYC to LA and back again.The mystery works well, I think. You never know who the good guys and bad guys are. Not entirely, anyway, until the denouement.Throw in the mafia, actors, producers, the feds and primetime news. Stir in one explicit sex scene, which isn't gratuitous in the plotting of the story and you have an engaging read.Sally's love life is a plot in itself. Poor girl is painfully confused about the men in her life. I like how it is explored.Through it all you will root for Sally Harrington and her friends and colleagues to catch the bad guys and get the story on the air."},{"Title":"The Last Lover","review":"This was the first book I read by this author, and I thought this to be extremely boring until around page 200. The content of the book had almost nothing to do with the title. Not a very well written book, characters were very one dimensional with the exception of Lilliana Martin - the author may want to consider writing a book about her. While I am a Connecticut native and appreciated and could relate to town and state descriptions, most were too detailed and unnecessary to the plot. I've heard other books by this author were better."},{"Title":"The Last Lover","review":"The book was good, it held my attention to the end, but I want to know WHO in the world edited the book? I found more gramatical errors and &quot;runon&quot; words in this book than I did when my son was in fourth grade. I originally thought this was one of those &quot;writer&quot; things! Then I realized that could not be. The MOST blatant example is on page 290. If a book is good - it's good, but I'll tell you - I'd have been FIRED if I EVER produced a product with so many mistakes. Perhaps the author should think about another publishing house."},{"Title":"The true story of Frances, the falconer's daughter,: Wife of William Dungan, gentleman, of London, and of Jeremy Clarke, gentleman, of England & ...

The illustrations (photographs) are abundant and helpful. Although I have not had the chance yet to begin the practice, I look forward to learning much from this book. I WAS disappointed, however, that it did not address asanas for migraines, as the publisher's description promised.

I bought a LOT of books, DVDs and CDS. This is BY FAR the best for great instruction for whatever area you need, or for generally enhancing your strengthening yoga practice. I keep this book in my workout room for after my cardio and strength training. Because of my work with this book, I no longer experience lower back or hip pain. The book gives you some inner guidance to work with as well; I find that goes hand-in-hand with the physical, but as any yoga student will tell you, the asanas alone will heal you inside and out if you simply practice them."},{"Title":"Healing Yoga: A Guide to Integrating the Chakras With Your Yoga Practice","review":"I bought this so I would have something to refer to at home when I couldn't remember how to do an asana or wanted to try something new.As other reviewers said, this is an excellent introduction to yoga and includes a brief explanation of the philosophical underpinnings of it as well as clear, easy to follow photographs of how to do the asanas (poses). Many of the asanas are also appropriate for intermediate or advanced students. For me, attending a yoga class once a week and using this book as a supplement to home practice works well for me.Some people think of yoga as simply a physical discipline or another way to work out. Not so, because its emphasis is on not straining, not rushing and not competing. It is a system of helping the body become more flexible and promoting physical health, but it is also a way to know the self, transcend the ego and become enlightened, among other things.My primary focus right now is the physical training (hatha) aspect of it and gradual learning and practice of the spiritual aspects of it. That's just my preference and each person will approach it in their own way. I know I will refer to this book again and again."},{"Title":"A social history of the French Revolution","review":"I am currently trying to return this book for a refund.

The big problem is that when you upload a book to Amazon, you must download it, correct the HTML, and then reupload it. This was not done. The result is a book where the paragraphs are not indented.

Barton spends the first part of the book setting up the incident with details of the French and Indian War. Though some historians blame Washington for the defeat near Pittsburgh to show that he was a quite unsuccessful officer before becoming the commanding General of the Continetal Army, Barton documents how it was the fault of the British who ignored and disrespected the Indian Scouts, Washington hired. General Braddock(Washington's Commander) entered into battle and found himself ambushed by the French and Indians who had behind bushes and trees which Braddock refused to do, and indeed beat men who tried to hide behind trees to fight. Braddock was extremely partial to the European way of fighting. In the end, most of the British and Colonials forces were defeated in the battle. Amazing Washington survived, reporting finding bullet fragments in his hair, and bullet holes in his vest, and having horses shot out from under him. Yet he was not hurt. The story concludes with a visit from Indian Chief who gives more detail on the battle, and gives a prophecy to Washington that has come true. This book is a must-have for anyone's library."},{"Title":"The Bulletproof George Washington","review":"I'm not sure that I had ever heard of this incident before reading this book. I know it was never recorded in any of the text books that my Public School used for their curriculum. Yet 80 years ago, almost all school children were taught about this incident.And what's more important--It really happened, it's verifiable, and it was COMMON KNOWLEGE to Colonists during the Revolutionary War era. This is one of the reasons so many people had such trust in George Washington during the Revolutionary War and afterwards. They knew that he was protected by God.This booklet gives the account of the battle in which General George Braddock is ambushed during the French and Indian War. General Braddock is killed and all of the mounted officers are killed or wounded except ONE (George Washington). Washington escapes unhurt, without a scratch, though several horses are shot out from underneath him during the 3-hour (I think) battle, and his coat is riddled with bullet holes.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"The Bulletproof George Washington","review":"The historical evidence, much of which has been twisted or swept under the rug by revisionists, show that Washington was indeed a Christian. This excellent book chronicles what is possibly God's divine providence in his life. Here is the evidence that I speak of about Washington being a Christian; There have been numerous prayers written by Washington, verified in his handwriting, that mention Christ and his faith in Christ again and again. Many of these more poignant prayers reflect the way in which he felt guilty for his sins and he realized his need for the mercy of God....again, always making mention of Jesus in these prayers. After a request for a chaplain to accompany his army onto the frontier when Washington was a colonel was not fulfilled, Washington himself conducted Sunday worship services and preached to his troops for 2 full years. Washington forbade profanity by his troops explaining - and I'm paraphrasing - 'Our enemy is so great (at the time there were 500 British ships right offshore!) How can we expect the divine providence and assistance of Almighty God if we 'betray' him and do those things he despises with our speech.'When Washington's father died - George was 11 - His mother required him to conduct daily worship services in their home for the whole family.Upon reading his diary, you will see multiple references to his attendance of Church on Sunday ( Sunday - attended Church or Sunday - inclement weather - unable to attend Church )The revisionists of history and indeed most history books for students today, dampen or even worse, reverse Washington's greatness. As one prominent historian wrote of the historical revisionists: \\" These termites of the timber of our history - they seek to destroy his(Washington's ) greatness because, they are not great and cannot be. They seek to destroy his goodness because they are not good. To face the father of our country as he really is......they (the revisionists) could not face themselves and what they are\\" -This book is rooted in historical fact. Washington was a Christian if you look objectively at the historical evidence.I don't know if having four bullet holes in your coat and two horses shot out from under you in battle and surviving is divine providence or not, but, if you're a Christian, you certainly know that it could be."},{"Title":"The Bulletproof George Washington","review":"Congratulations to David Barton for bringing back and retelling a wonderful chapter in our Nations history and the story that once was the staple of our childrens educational diet. Unfortunately those who continually attempt to strip us of our heritage and our Founders of their honor, have by and large, been successful in just about eliminating this story from our curriculums now-a-days. In short with great malace, they rob our children of a healthy historical education. A very sad commentary on both our education system and our political representatives as we move into the 21st century. The reasons for this shameful conduct, ideology and oppression is rediculous and unamerican in nature no matter what mantel is placed upon it. And any court in the land that upholds such tyranny is quite frankly no more than traitors, to our country. The other day I watched a Fox News episode where a Militant spokesperson actually called George Washington and a few others &quot;Bad People.&quot; And indicated that their children should not be expected to attend any institution bearing their names. If this is what our youth, by our own hands are growing up to become and believe in, then America has truly lost it's soul. Can we get it back, sure, if we once again begin to read or let them read stories like this and honor such Ameircans as George Washington and bring back a patriotism that also honors our great emblems and symbols without being ashamed of them. This book should be required reading for all students and we should institute the beginning of a new train of thought for our children. An attitude in which we no longer accept the new age thought process of dishonoring our great leaders of the past, to the point of condemning our own heritage. But we should rather once again teach respect it and them once again and honor those who helped create this great nation. An enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"The Bulletproof George Washington","review":"This is a rather short book of 56 pages (8.5\\"x5.5\\" in size). However, it puts a good deal of infomation into those pages. The book starts with a short history of what leads to the French and Indian War, then gives information concerning George Washington's service under the British up to Braddock's march. In dealing with the begining of Braddock's Campaign, we are told of Benjamin Franklin's part in securing supplies for the march. There are illustrations and excerpts from first-hand accounts of those involved.The author gives a fairly good account of the battle (Braddock's Defeat) itself, but there are some mistakes. For example, the book claims the French set up an ambush for the English at Braddock's Defeat. This is simply not true. It is true that the French were trying to set up an ambush at the river crossing, but the English had already crossed the river before the French arrived there, and the English spotted the French and Indians before any \\"ambush\\" could take place. When the French first met the British, both sides were equally surprised. This mistaken belief that the French ambushed the British, however, has been repeated by many historians. And the \\"Indian\\" the book claimed was spotted by the English was really the French commander of the attackers. Also, the book leads one to believe the Indian and French \\"ambushers\\" immediately routed the English but this is not true either. The English formed up into ranks and had the French and Indians in a near retreat after the French Commander was shot down. The English only began to retreat when the French and Indians regrouped under another commander and threatened to surround the English. This is when things turned ugly for the English.There is really no excuse for these mistakes, but the story of George Washington's part in the Battle and his miraculous escape from injury is well told. Perhaps because of the rather short length of the book, the author simply skipped things which would be covered in a longer account.One incident related is the story of Mary Draper Ingles, George Washington, and the Indian called Red Hawk. The author tells of an incident when Ingles met Washington. The author uses as his source for this information the book \\"Follow The River.\\" Now, while I have read \\"Follow the River,\\" and it is a very good book, it is a novel, and should not be used as a source. In fact, the author of that novel writes in his \\"notes\\" at the end of the book that there is NO record stating Ingles and Washington ever met. In other words, it isn't really true; the novelist just used the incident for dramatic effect. Also, the author of \\"Follow the River\\" states he used the book \\"Trans-Allegany Pioneers\\" by Hale for much of his information. This book relates the incident of Red Hawk and Washington, but Ingles is not involved in any way. And \\"Trans-Allegany Pioneers\\" uses for its source of information, the book \\"History of the Valley of Virginia\\" by Kercheval. Again while the story of Red Hawk and Washington is most likely true, Ingles is not involved in any way. Barton should never have used a NOVEL as a source because the author of the novel changes things for the benefit of the story and as a way to introduce the information. In other words, the incident with Ingles really never happened, but the information concerning Red Hawk and Washington is based on fact. (By the way, however, \\"Follow the River\\" is a very good novel, based on the life of Mary Ingles, but it is a novel, not a source for reference.) The other account of Washington and Red Hawk and Dr. Craik has as its original source a book by Washington's stepson, \\"Recollections and Private Memoirs of George Washington\\" (by George Washington Parke Custic).So the story has some faulty history, but it does not distract from the main point of the story a great deal. Overall, the writing is well done and leads the reader on to the finish.This is a good book for someone who has little knowledge of the French and Indian War, but anyone who has read of this account before will most likely find nothing new. For what the book is--a 56 page story of George Washington's part in the French and Indian War--this is not a bad book. The excerpts of original writings from George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Indians involved in the fighting would probably be expecially interesting to those who haven't read a great deal about this time period. But in reality, there are better books (but also longer much longer, which may not be what the reader is interested in). That said, I would give this book to any child, and it is written in a manner that will most likely hold their interest more than any book about history they are given to read in school. In fact, if there were more books like this, children would probably have a greater interest in history, as this is the type of book that makes history \\"come alive\\" with a story of people and events instead of stale dates and places. A good read for adults too for those who have little knowledge of this event.By the way, the book is somewhat religiously oriented in that it claims God personally protected George Washington during Braddock's Defeat (an idea that is repeated several times throughout the narrative). Whether that is true or not, or whether one even believes in God or not, does not really detract from the book. However, because of the faulty history, I downgraded my rating to 2 stars. Still a good book to give to your kids though."},{"Title":"The Bulletproof George Washington","review":"Whether God spared Washington's life in this account of battle, I know not. The author certainly seems to think so. And other accounts of Washington's career seem to indicate something of the Divine was involved in directing the steps of his life. Scripture teaches us that God directs the affairs of men, since there is no authority except from God. (Rom13:1-2) Therefore in the strictest since, the birth of America was ordained of God and Washington played an important role in the forming. But service to the Lord is quite another story. To imply that because the hand of God was obvious in the life of George Washington, that he was therefore a \`genuine' Christian is stretching the truth. True conversion to Christ is manifested in humbleness of character, purity of heart, meekness and love. Something very rare in our modern churches. Although Washington lived in a time where sound preached was the rule and not the exception (as it is in our day) he did not manifest the fruits of the Spirit in his life to prove that he had anything better than the \`faith of devils' (much like most professing Christians today)He was indeed a highly principled man and probably moral in most of his conduct. But such were many of our founders. They excelled in the principles of sound leadership and upheld personal liberty. (unlike the reprobates in office currently) But MOST of them were not disciples of our Lord. We can remember Washington for his courage and determination in founding our Republic and pray to God that more like him would rise up to spare us the impending tyranny that is fast approaching."},{"Title":"The Bulletproof George Washington","review":"I read the book and enjoyed it. However It's historical accuracy concerning Washington's journey to ascertain the purpose of the French in western Pennsylvania is questionable. On page 10, the author refers to Tanachrison as a &quot;Southern Huron.&quot; Every reference to this period of history that I have read, to include &quot;Indians in Pennsylvania&quot; by Paul A. W. Wallace, have indicated that Chief Tanichrison was a Seneca. Given the relationship between the Iroquois and the Hurons during this period, I don't believe Tanachrison would have appreciated being referred to as a &quot;Southern Huron.&quot; On page 13, he states that the rest of Washington's party left to hunt and trap, that Washington returned home alone in the dead of winter. According to &quot;Washington's Journal,&quot; Washington left with Christopher Gist because he was anxious to get back to Williamsburg, VA and give his report to Governor Dinwiddie. Their horses had become feeble and the roads became deep with snow which slowed the party down."},{"Title":"Drawn to Trouble: Confessions of a Master Forger- A Memoir","review":"This memoir probably infuriates many in the art world. I'm sure Hebborn would have infuriated me, in person. But the guy could write! I come across hardly any art books, especially by artists, that are written in an engaging everyday style. Hebborn could have been a journalist, but he just happened to be poor-born, misfitted, delinquent, driven, selfish, witty, and a bloody genius with pencil and paintbrush. I think I have read it cover to cover five times, always with pleasure. I find myself agreeing 95% with Hebborn's pronouncements; the missing 5% concerns what seem to be excuses and evasions. It is also a terrific guide through art history, and through art education. You don't have to be schooled in art to enjoy and learn from this book. Hebborn had an adventurous, hilarious, hedonistic life, which ended violently and not, in his prescient comments, unexpectedly early.Read it."},{"Title":"Drawn to Trouble: Confessions of a Master Forger- A Memoir","review":"This is a great book for the art lover, art student, or anyone who is looking for a great read.

The tone is witty and cynical. The characters are straight out of Dickens. The technical details, at least for me, were interesting, not mind-numbing.I don't have to buy into the author's rationalization of his forgeries (he calls them \\"new Old Masters\\")in order to realize that his criticism of art dealers and other players in the market contains more than a grain of truth. The book reminds me of Wilie Sutton's autobiography. One doesn't have to approve of bank robbery to enjoy a good story.)(I haven't read Hebborn's other book, which is quite expensive (suggesting some unemployed artists may be considering a career change. So I have no idea about the extent of overlap between the two books.)"},{"Title":"Drawn to Trouble: Confessions of a Master Forger- A Memoir","review":"Like a lot of con-men, Eric Hebborn had talent as well as a complete unconcern about scruples, and in this case his talent was artistic. I find it hard to take his statements at face value that he was simply playing a game with experts and the art trade, since he discovered pretty early on that he could fool everyone in sight. Yet he continued to pass drawing after drawing off as having been made in a different time, and in some instances by specific artists, and there is no doubt in my mind that his drawings were intended to deceive. Obviously, his motive was ultimately financial, and it is interesting that he tries to justify his misdeeds by pointing to those of others -- in this case, art dealers.As for the book, I found the first half pretty boring, but the second half very interesting once he got serious about producing more and more fakes at higher and higher levels of competence. He has very interesting insights into how to create fakes, having to do with human psychology in some instances, and whether or not fakes inevitably will be discovered. In the meantime, he definitely muddied the waters of art historical scholarship -- not the first time it has happened, but something that the field didn't need."},{"Title":"Drawn to Trouble: Confessions of a Master Forger- A Memoir","review":"quite entertaining, sometimes the art-y descriptions drone on a little, but a fascinating tale of a slightly rogue-ish, and immensely talented fellow.

Just as there are lies by omission, surely there are thefts by the same tactic."},{"Title":"Active Server Pages 3.0 by Example","review":"Although HTML is the language of the world wide web, the real action is carried out by code that resides on the server. The life and death operations of a business to business (B2B) or business to consumer (B2C) e-business are the web pages created on the server by programs that accept data from the client and interact with server-side databases. One of the most widely used technologies is the Active Server Pages (ASP) technology created by Microsoft. Naturally, given its paternal origins, the scripting language used throughout is VBScript, the pared down version of Visual Basic.This is one of those books where the promises made by the title are kept. The topics are all presented by examples of working code, which in most cases is understandable and effectively carries out the operations to be demonstrated. The initial two chapters are introductions to the ASP model and the VBScript programming language. By necessity brief and somewhat incomplete, the treatment of the ASP model is adequate although the reader with no experience in VBScript will probably have to consult other resources.The middle chapters are used to present the basics of how ASP files run on the server and how communication with the client pages is accomplished. This is as good an introduction of this critical matter as I have seen. Topics covered include the global.asa file, the ActiveX Data Object (ADO), cookies, SQL connection and recordset objects; ad rotators and counters; and how to use installable components.The later chapters are devoted to the creation of a more elaborate site designed to implement an online educational institution. This involves the creation and updating of address books, a login page with security that prevents unauthorized access and sending e-mail messages among other things. Interacting with databases using SQL commands forms an integral part of the site. While not a complete model for all things one could or would do on an e-commerce site, it is complete enough so that you can learn what is necessary to understand the structure of such sites.ASP is not the only technology used to dynamically create web pages, the effectiveness of which makes or breaks any e-business site. However, it is currently the most popular and should be learned by anyone with a serious interest in commerce on the web. This book is a valuable and effective tool in learning those critical lessons."},{"Title":"Active Server Pages 3.0 by Example","review":"Being a beginner with ASP I bought this book as a tutorial to learn ASP.

He walks you through those 'gotchas' that you will encounter.No surprise that the book has no javascript examples to speak of, focusing on vbscript. That's good at the intro level -- you've got enough to learn about without having javascript syntax problems all the time. I agree that it's a good reference, but because the examples are concrete (one is called 'using ASP to add a record to an ODBC datasource'). If you use this stuff much, you'll want to use functions a lot -- hopefully you might be able to reuse some code -- so I wouldn't put too much credence in the low review).In terms of prerequisites, I would think it useful to have some general SQL knowledge (&quot;sql for dummies&quot; is a great add-on -- you'll be using SQL for all data access, so getting it down is key), and some basic HTML as well.

It is a real gem! As the publisher points out, the backbone of her philosophy is The Power of Right Thought, an ageless topic.The concepts in her book are incredibly simple. But therein lies their complexity. In her first \\"thought\\" she writes: the young men of France are studying alchemy, hoping to learn the secret of the transmutation of gold. But if you will study your own spirit and its limitless powers, you will gain a greater secret than any alchemist ever held; a secret which shall give you whatever you desire.Now that is some promise! And with serious, repetitive \\"thought work,\\" it is possible. Ms. Wilcox explains why we need to control our thoughts and how we can achieve this. She describes various facets of the mind and how it is used to heal or to maim. But do not be tricked by the refreshing simplicity of her writings, nor put off by her sometimes stern manner.

Its words can be read over and over and each time yet another facet (of yourself) revealed.Ms. Wilcox jars our thinking, and challenges us to become who we really are. At the same time she makes us laugh at ourselves and our gullibility. Forget about complaining, there are no obstacles, why worry...Remember, Man is what he thinks. And she repetively reminds us of this as well as of our own Divinity. Powerful stuff indeed!Ernest Holmes drew on her teachings in his creation of the Science of Mind Philosophy.

Fortunately, he is pretty much back to form in A Mist of Prophecies.The plot here is a bit more straightforward than usual: a \\"seer\\" in the forum, the woman called Cassandra, has been murdered. For reasons that become clearer as the novel progresses, Gordianus is compelled to find out who has killed her. The suspects are seven of the most powerful women in Rome whom Gordianus visits in turn. All this is taking place during a time of upheaval in Rome, when most of the young men are off with either Caesar or Pompey, fighting in the civil war. Needless to say, Gordianus eventually ferrets out the truth, which is not what he nor the reader expects at first pass.Though Saylor takes Gordianus through his typical paces here, the mystery is much more interesting than it has been in recent novels. The payoff is better. Still, there are some things missing. This novel doesn't have the deep historical flavor of some of his better outings. Also, Saylor allows a fairly happy ending here whereas I've always enjoyed Saylor's willingness to do real harm to his main characters. He seems to be losing this as the novels go on.Still, there's a lot to like in this novel. Gordianus is a great character as are most of the characters Saylor has built into his family. As long as he has a decent mystery, like he does here, it's hard to go too wrong."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"I've read all of the series in order. I think this is about the ninth book and the third from the last. I think Saylor's phoning it in. I really liked the early books and loved the combination of mystery and historical novel. The last three or four I read just weren't up to par. This book is alright in the context of the series, but it is disappointing and lacked creativity. Nevertheless I'll finish the series - in time"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"I've read the whole Ancient Rome series by Steven Saylor and this one was a bit off track. Steven went off on an affair and deep feelings in this one, which over shadowed the history of the book. Thankfully the rest of the series was wonderful!"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"I am savoring this whole series, and yes, A Mist of Prophesies is a little out of the mold. But it grew on me - Gordianus is more vulnerable, more human. The Roman women characters are so well drawn. I agree this book has a few rough edges, maybe needed another round of editing. But if you are working through the whole series, it is a delicious nugget. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"This novel is another in Steven Saylor's \\"Roma Sub Rosa\\" \\"Secret History of Rome\\" series. In this one, the protagonist, Gordianus the Finder, falls in love with a beautiful woman who is apparently a seeress. When she is murdered, he seeks to find the culprit. All of this takes place against the backdrop of Julius Caesar's struggle with Pompey Magnus (\\"the Great One\\") as Rome is riven with civil strife and intrigue.While this is not my favorite novel in the series, it is excellent historical fiction and an enjoyable read. The author departs from his usual linear storyline and instead presents the story as flashbacks. The technique is effective, if a bit jarring to Steven Saylor regulars such as myself. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"I'm a big fan of Saylor's Gordianus series and gladly give four or five stars to the other \\"Roma sub rosa\\" books. But this one volume in the series is a disappointment on several counts. First, Gordianus starts an affair that's totally out of character for him, as a person who's normally all about truth and integrity. Second, the book is written in alternating chapters that jump between two timelines in a very jarring way; it's a dumb literary device that detracts from Saylor's skill as a writer. Third, the plot isn't much fun, it's just Gordianus visiting a series of potential suspects until things fall into place.Last but not least, the Kindle edition of this book is overflowing with appalling (and sometimes hilarious) typos due to poor text recognition software. Clearly no attempt was made to clean it up with even the most basic spelling checks. I know that's not Saylor's fault, but there's no good place to point it out except in a review. The fact is that Amazon's Kindle versions of books often do a disservice to their authors and readers, and Amazon should be ashamed to be charging normal paperback prices for digital books of such poor quality.I wish I could just say, \\"skip this book,\\" but aspects of it carry over to the next one, The Judgment of Caesar -- and that volume is excellent, so it would be a shame to miss the background you need to fully enjoy it."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor has a true gift for his genre. He is stand alone. If you have read the preceeding books in the series, this one will not dissappoint. If not, start with the first."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"I am a Steven Saylor fan and anything about Gordianus the Finder is something I would read. A Mist of Prophecies was a very readable historical novel. Quite a bit of true history but written in a way that keeps the reader going trying to figure out \\"who did it\\". I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in Roman history."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mist of Prophecies is a tale of trouble. In this story Gordianus encounters many problems. Caesar and Pompey are fighting a war for control of the republic. Rome is in desperate economic times as inflation rages. Most people have difficulties paying rent and buying food. Merchants seldom stock their shelves. Gordianus, himself, borrows money to pay expenses and falls deeply in debt to a selfish banker named Volumnius. Bethesdia, his wife, suffers from a strange ailment which saps her energy and affects her mood. Diana, his daughter, pushes him to get work and suggests that she and her husband Davus take over the family business. Gordianus begins to feel old and useless.Then, in addition to his wife and daughter, eight more women challenge Gordianus' sanity: Cassandra, a seeress with a reputation of being mad; Culpernia, Caesars wife; Clodia, a manipulative temptress he has encountered before; Faustia, daughter of former dictator Sulla and wife of the banished politician Milo; Fulvia, Clodius' widow who married Caesar's lieutenant Curio; Terentia, the pious and proper wife of Cicero; Antonia, Mark Antony's wife and cousin; Cytheris, an actress and former slave who is Mark Antony's lover. Gordianus is convinced that one of the women is responsible for the death of Cassandra.Action begins after Cassandra's death. Gordianus, who had some secret relationship with Cassandra, arranges for and finances her funeral. The story unfolds through flashbacks and encounters and interviews with the ten women. Gordianus decides that Cassandra was poisoned. At first Gordianus avoids inquiring into the situation. After being nagged by Diana, he begins his investigation, wanting only peace of mind.Mist of Prophecies presents fascinating characters through Gordianus' interviews. The characters are encountered in their own element and most reveal themselves through their words and behavior. Gordianus, being a man, doesn't always completely understand what he sees.This is a fun book written by an excellent historian. I may read it again."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor's Roma sub-Rosa series is excellent, and this book does not disappoint. I am not sure why I'm the first to review this book. These books should be flying off the shelves of the bookstores. They are truly excellent. Saylor's writing is quite wonderful, and his attention to detail and his historical allusions are all right on. This book is extremely interesting as it profiles seven of the most powerful women in Rome during the time that Caesar was fighting against Pompey for supremacy in Rome. We get to meet Caesar's intelligent wife Calpurnia,as well as a reintroduction to some women we have meet in previous volumes, such as Sulla's daughter Fausta and the infamous Clodia who Gordianus has always admired. We also get to see Gordianus fall in love, and it's believably handled by Saylor. We feel his pain when the woman he loves is poisoned. Gordianus sets out to find who the killer was and uncovers a hornet's nest of intrigue and betrayal. All of these books are excellent, but I really did enjoy this one. I heartily recommend this series."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"What I want to give this novel is 3.5 stars. Not four, and not three. I found it disquieting because the author has Gordianus act in a way that seems totally out of character for him, namely his affair with Cassandra. I would expect, based on the previous books, that we would hear Gordianus's thoughts on this, but we don't. Add to that the fact that the main activity of the book is Gordianus questioning different people, back and forth, back and forth, without much happening, and you have a slow-paced novel. This book feels as if it's a bridge between Last Seen in Massilia, which was excellent, and The Judgement of Caesar -- a bridge that isn't of the best possible construction."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor has definately become a master of his art. Each of the characters are so vivid, it is obvious that Saylor treats each with respect and critical thought has been put into view point analysis. The images Saylor uses to bring Rome alive are personal and palpable. Its as if Saylor travelled in time and really hung out with these people.The story line really didnt draw me in to the novel that much. But if anyone can make a story about a bunch of bickering old ladies facsinating, you better believe that it is Saylor who will do it.Although the story line didnt excite me, the realness of the characters that did. I mean, I almost feel like I was down their by the river with Gordianus and Clodia."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Well, Gordianus continues to be entirely implausible as far as actual Late Republican Rome was concerned. But then this novel manages to obtain an eerie athmosphere, as Gordianus enters old age in earnest in a setting of civil war, chaos and impending doom, the telling of the story revolves around a savvy counterpoint structure, and the mystery is actually satisfactory and not a pretext for displaying historical erudition. I look foward to reading the next novel - something \\"Last seem in Massilia\\" didn't quite manage to do."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"The \\"Roma Sub Rosa\\" series, of which this book is the latest addition, just goes from strength to strength. As far as I am concerned, this is the best of the entire bunch, and I read it avidly, finishing it in record time! Gordianus may be getting older, but his wits are still sharp, and his nose for murder is as strong as ever. In this book we see our hero prone to a very human weakness, but it makes him all the more interesting for his failing. As usual, the Roman background is impeccably drawn, and the characters are excellent! We are in the midst of the war between Caesar and Pompey, and all Rome trembles with the fight. Once the mystery is solved, we see Gordianus packing for a trip to Egypt, and we just know that he's going to run into Cleopatra in the next installment. I can hardly wait!!"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"With Caesar and Pompey facing one another in Greece, Rome itself is left to be governed by Caesar's lieutenants. Poverty, debt, decades of civil war, and decades of swiftly changing alliances have unsettled Rome, but also made it seem to be a perfect target for men unscrupulous enough to seize a time when the armies are largely away from Italy, and when the mob can become king. Gordianus, the Finder, has fallen on hard times. Like many others, he has had to borrow and now finds himself deep in debt. Yet, his new friendship and passion with the strange seeress, Cassandra, sustains him while the rest of his life, and his city, fail around him. When Cassandra is poisoned and dies in his arms, Gordianus sets out to find the killer even though he knows that the murderer is likely to be one of the seven powerful women who attend Cassandra's funeral--women far beyond his power to damage.Gordianus's investigation, interspersed with flashbacks of his growing relationship with Cassandra, takes him into the heart of conspiracy and the soul of the ancient Roman Republic which was then failing around him. His trips to the forum to meet with the 'chin-waggers,' the sight of lictors, axes bared in the City itself, and into the slave-ridden households of ambitious women, scheming while their husbands and lovers battle for control ring true.Author Steven Saylor powerfully conveys both the strange days of the Roman Republic's death, and the more humble striving of one man to seek the truth about the brutal murder of a woman who acted as a beggar, but perhaps was also a blackmailer, a spy, or a madwoman. In Saylor's work, and in the small doings of a common citizen, Rome becomes far more real than in many of the histories of battles and great men.A MIST OF PROPHECIES continues Saylor's excellent ROMA SUB ROSA series and left me looking forward to the next novel--of Cleopatra and Egypt in the last days of the Ptolemies."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mr. Saylor's series on the life of Gordianus in late Republican Rome is wonderfully well written and for the most part highly accurate in its depiction of the actual lives of everyday Romans. This latest book depicts the despair and chaos of the Roman Republic as it collapses into horrifying Civil War. The chaos is replicated in the home life of Gordianus. The lives of various Roman women are vey interesting as they are illuminated in the search for the truth of Cassandra's death.I have not rated this EXCELLENT for several reasons. One, there are some odd inconsistencies which have been noted already by another reviewer. The absence of Davus and Diana's child, the difference in relationship between Bethesda and Eco's wife,bothered me in particular, as I am fascinated by Roman daily life.. These discrepencies are frustrating to us who like to read the series as a whole. Far more troubling to me, though, is Gordianus' treatment of his ailing wife, who is suffering, in addition to a physical illness, the emotional loss of her adopted son Meto. She had raised him all these years, and now he is lost to her due to Gordianus' decision.Roman society is famous for its debaucheries, but what is less known is that there were many loving marriages, particularly between plebeians and freedwomen, as evidenced from many tombstone inscriptions around Rome. I would have liked to see this aspect of Roman life given greater emphasis.In many ways, the figure of Cassandra seemed like a primal male fantasy- young, beautiful,and sexual while making no demands at all on her partner. I had already guessed what the solution was going to be to Gordianus' money problems, and felt this added to the male fantasy aspect.In spite of these reservations, this book, as all of Mr. Saylor's books are, is well written and well worth reading. The history woven into the story is superb."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"If you haven't read any Roman historical fiction from Steven Saylor then I suggest you look immediately at the amazon.com reviews for 'Roman Blood', the first book in the series. 'A Mist of Prophecies' is best enjoyed only after reading Saylor's preceding novels. For those who have had the pleasure of doing so please read on.'A Mist of Prophecies' is a somewhat contrivedstory of an enigmatic soothsayer, aptly name Cassandra. She enters the life of our Roman sleuth Gordianus (..actually, she and Gordy develop a \\"special\\" relationship). In the start of the book we understand Cassandra gets poisoned. During the rest of the book Saylor makes clever use of flashbacks to understand what actually happened. Saylor deliciously re-introduces all the evil ladies of Rome we got to know from previous books. These ladies obviously took a shine to the fortune telling Cassandra. Did one of them kill her too? Read the book to find out.Bottom line: slightly fluffy but extremely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"In 48 BC Rome is engaged in a great civil war with both sides led by a powerful warrior. Though the battles take place in the outer province of Thessaly, Rome is being drained by the war as inflation is running rampant and people are going into debt with barely enough money to eat.Gordianus the Finder finds himself besieged at every turn. He is worried about the debt to his banker, deeply concerned with his wife's mysterious and lingering illness, and frets over the end of his relationship with his adopted son Meto. When Cassandra, a mysterious woman who appear in Rome one day sprouting prophecy, dies in the Finder's arms saying she was poisoned, he takes it upon himself to bury her and find her killer. His quest takes him into some of the richest and most influential homes in Rome.A MIST OF PROPHECIES takes us into the heart of Rome during a civil war that makes the inhabitants of the city wary, fearful, and uncertain of the future for themselves and for their glorious Empire. Stephen Saylor descriptions of the times are so detailed that the audience can picture the city in the mind's eye. Experience grants the hero the wisdom to search out the killer using his brains while not relying on brawn as he did in his youth. This is a fascinating work, as much a historical novel as it is a mystery.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"How does he do it? He just keeps writing the best books ever. He has no equal in my book. Hr has the ability to hold your attention and more than that makes the experience most enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"great book and great service I always enjoy Steven Saylor books. I love kindle books and Amazon. will buy many more books in the future"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mist continues to illustrate Saylor's sure touch as a novelist and firm command of the historical sources and details that he weaves into his plots and settings. The earliest novel, Roman Blood, centered on Cicero and his defense of Roscius under the dictator Sulla. This latest takes place in 48 BC and culminates, historically at least, in Caesar's defeat of Pompey at Pharsalus.Saylor speaks in his author's note about the fact that the words of many of the men from this period have survived, but that none of the words of the women survive directly. So, part of his purpose, and certainly a large part of his technique, in Mist is to present a series of important women.The central woman of the story, already dead by page 1, is Cassandra, a beautiful young, mad (?) prophetess who, in the flashback of chapter 2, falls dead in Gordianus' arms, in the forum, gasping out \\"Poison. She's poisoned me.\\" We don't know the exact relationship of Cassandra to Gordianus from what we discover in chapter 1, but we know it was sufficient for him, even though in serious debt himself, to pay for her funeral and celebrate it, virtually alone, right up to the funeral pyre. However, at that point some others appear to watch the burning, and these are among the most powerful and remarkable women in Rome.The two questions that arise for Gordianus are: who killed Cassandra and why did these women come to see her burn. This presents a challenge to Gordianus, a tease to the reader, and a structure for Saylor. In fact, the first 16 chapters alternate between present action, including interviews with each of these women and flashbacks to Gordianus' meetings with Cassandra, so that the even numbered chapters, 2 through 16, all start with a variation on \\"The first time I saw Cassandra...\\" and most of these flashbacks are dated in Gordianus' mind by something Marcus Caelius was doing that day. Thus Saylor weaves the private story of Gordianus and Cassandra (if it is a private story) with the public story of the (off-stage) conflict of Pompey and Caesar and the in-Rome machinations of Caelius, who is setting himself up as a demagogic opponent of both the major men, relying on raising the hopes and expectations of the poor and debt-ridden in Rome. On the fringes of the story (for most of the novel) are the comparable machinations of T. Annius Milo, who is trying to raise the country-side after escaping from his exile in Massilia (where he was last seen in the previous novel).Each of the women who attended the funeral pyre gets a chapter worth's of investigation (the even-numbered chapters), and each emerges as distinctly different in personality. Saylor is very good here at making them all fascinating characters, each in different ways.Terentia tells about her marital troubles; Fulvia tells how Cassandra's prophecy of Curio's death was detailed and correct, 2 days before it was reported at Rome; Antonia, who got a very negative prophecy from Cassandra, asserts she was a fraud and in league with Antony's mistress, Cytheris; Cytheris admits she put Cassandra up to the prophecy about her rival Antonia, but says she doesn't know whether, otherwise, Cassandra was truly possessed or acting, which she was trained to do; Fausta says what Cassandra prophesied for her didn't make sense to her, because she needed much plainer speech, and no, she wouldn't divorce Milo, because Rome would look negatively on the daughter of Sulla if she divorced twice, and Gordianus notices that Fausta looks a bit beaten up and her doorkeeper, an ex-gladiator, seems to dominate her; Clodia is still the Clodia of old, with a lustful eye for Gordianus' handsome son-in-law, Davus, and harsh words for her old lover, Caelius, but nothing to say about Cassandra, other than that she can tell from Gordianus' demeanor that he and the seeress were lovers; Calpurnia, the only one to summon Gordianus, knows much about Cassandra, since Calpurnia runs Caesar's spy network in Rome, and surprises Gordianus with her revelations.One of Calpurnia's other revelations involves a relationship between two other major characters that neither Gordianus nor we had guessed, and that points Gordianus to his prime suspect. We are sure now who the killer was and why, but the why changes as Gordianus interrogates his suspect, and then she explains her relationship differently than Gordianus had surmised and Gordianus sees the murderer cannot be her. A bit of reflection shows Gordianus who the killer must be and why.Saylor, as always, writes and plots well. His historical detail is full and accurate and his accounts of historical events correct. Of course, he inserts Gordianus into all of these and also attributes motives to characters that are not historically attested, but they are not dissonant with what we know or would guess. One slight literary cavil would be that Gordianus explains a lot of the detail to us, the reader , (e.g., about lictors), but it is not clear who his audience that he is narrating to is and why, if they are Romans, they would need to be told details that any of his contemporaries would already know. It might have been better if the character Gordianus had been explaining some of this to another character who was a foreigner or otherwise had some reason not to know.I recommend Mist of prophecies to any reader who likes a good novel or an interesting interpretation of events in late Republican Rome. I'm eager to see the sequel, to find out whether Bethesda recovers, whether Gordianus and Meto are reconciled, and who the murdered person will be. One of the royal family of the Ptolemies or their retainers, such as Pothinus? One of Caesar's staff?"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"I've really enjoyed Saylor's roman novels, but this latest continues the decline noticeable in the previous couple. The plot involves Gordianus' personal life in a fairly implausible way and the historical setting of this particular year in Roman history (i.e. the history of the city itself, not the republic/empire) just isn't as vivid as in previous installments. I'll probably get the next one, but more out of duty and a diminishing hope that Saylor will do something new - but plausible - next time."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"For those long-time fans of Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa mysteries, \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" is a deeply satisfying return after several years' gap between it and Saylor's \\"Last Seen in Massilia.\\"The shocking conclusion of Massilia is referenced, but Gordianus' problems with his own family take backstage to the chaos of Rome during Civil War. Both Pompey and Caesar have moved east to the ultimate battle between them for control of the Roman world. Left behind, the capitol seethes in financial collapse, rumor, and fear. Into this, a beautiful, half-mad seeress, Cassandra, explodes into Gordianus' life. Dying in his arms in the Forum, we then backtrack through Gordianus' meetings with her and her involvement in the intrigues taking place in the paranoid world in which Caesar and Pompey, far away, are determining Rome's future. In discovering why she died, we meet some of Rome's most famous women, each of whom may be a suspect and each of whom is deeply involved with the desperate civil struggle playing out all around them.The women are sketched with particular vividness. We have met Fulvia and Clodia before in earlier novels. I particularly enjoyed Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, whose small but highly memorable part in the mystery makes her far more interesting than the little that is known from history. Old friends Milo and Caelius also help turn the plot.Saylor easily balances the personal woes of Gordianus with the the larger canvas of war and intrigue. I found it consistently satisfying and, in its surprise ending, I suspect we may look forward to the next in the series as a completely different change of pace.Although I missed actually seeing Caesar and Cicero in the novel (both are in the East), this is a fun, refreshing, and energetic read and - as always with Saylor - you will learn something about Rome. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Steven Saylor's \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" gives us a glimspe into the political and social power of Roman women as the Republic was dying. Gordianus' prefered methods of discovering the truth, conversation and observation, are tested as he talks to seven very important women who showed up at the funeral of a young woman who seems to have been gifted with prophecies. While Saylor does a good job with the conversations and giving us a view of Roman life there are multiple threads here that aren't as well interwoven as I would have liked. For example, I have nothing against jumping around in time but since there was a consistant pattern of when this was going to happen, I got a bit lost every now and then. Also there are many things going on in Gordianus' house that we see briefly or which are mentioned briefly but that do not really seem to make the Finder as concerned or as thoughtful as a father or husband as we might expect given his character in earlier books. Are we to assume that this is a comment on all men, that even the best and most observant will stray?"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"This novel continues the marvelous and vivid life of Gordianus and his family.

Like \\"Rubicon\\" and \\"Last Seen in Massilia\\", this book focuses on the Gordianus family, putting politics and intrigue on a back burner.

Grow up."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"As a PhD candidate at Harvard specializing in Roman-Greco Studies, I can say with all certainty that what Steven Saylor knows about Roman history is something akin to what Richard Nixon knew about money laundering and cover-ups: next to nothing! This is the most contrived, ridulous kind of pulp fiction which, frankly, is tainting the Mystery genre by sheer virtue of its contrived settings and implausible, bombastic twists. Saylor -- a \\"hack\\" writer whose only credential is a humble BA from some southern school -- attempts to veneer a Mystery story over the only thing he knows anything about, namely history. And his knowledge of the latter is shaky at that! Saylor is a long way from finding his writer's \\"voice\\" and it doesn't seem that he ever will. Why any subsidy publisher would bet good money on such a weak effort is more of a mystery than even Saylor's books. Saylor's peculiar genre is a hybrid ad absurdum that may better qualify for the tag of \\"mutated\\" rather than a genuine cross-genre effort. By all means, save your money on this nonsense and donate it instead to your local Italian Cultural Center -- it will be money better spent!"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Steven Saylor's &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; stories, the adventures of Gordianus the Finder, continues to be one of the very best historical mystery series ever written. Not only is the history accurate (the First Century BCE as the Roman Republic shatters), the characters are three-dimensional and convincing, and the reader cares what happens to them. Often a mystery series will grow tired after several books, the plots becoming predictable and the relationships among the characters increasingly trivial. Not so with the &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; tales. We continue to care about Gordianus the Finder and his family, even as new tensions tear them apart.&quot;A Mist of Prophecies&quot; takes place against a backdrop of the war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. Although these two rivals are off stage in this novel, their agents are active in Rome, creating a dangerous urban jungle. And perhaps even more perilous for Gordianus the Finder, the chaos unleashed by the war has prompted others to also grab for power, whatever Caesar and Pompey might do. Into this turmoil steps the beautiful, mad seer Cassandra who proves irresistable to Gordianus, beset by financial ruin, family discord, and the mysterious illness of his wife.As much as I like this novel, I must discourage readers unfamiliar with Saylor's books from beginning with &quot;A Mist of Prophecies.&quot; This is a series where the characters grow and their relationships evolve. So, start with &quot;Roman Blood&quot; and go through the rest in chronological order. And when you finish &quot;A Mist of Prophecies,&quot; then you can wait with me for the next!"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor's latest offering is remarkably different to the rest of the Sub Rosa series. The format, the prose-style, the characterisation and the historical basis move well away from the preceding set.Indeed this is the first of the novels that doesn't directly use a 'mystery' set in actual fact. At the time of the novel Caesar was about to meet Pompey at Pharsalus in 48 and Saylor only uses the references to the relatively unstable calm to place a date for this mystery. There is some dragging of historical 'fact' of the praetor Caelius in this year before Caesar's dictatorship and in some respects the tired old man ambience that permeates the entire book could be seen as echoing the sudden death of the Republic.The book takes the form of alternating chapters set in the present, as Gordianus investigates the poisoning of the ex-troupe artist/seer 'Cassandra' and the past with a series of snapshots of Gordianus' interactions with her. The denouement is reversed, actually taking place at the beginning of the novel with the mundus (Saylor actually gives some subtle direction as to where the guilty party lies) and then moves on to explain what happened.As in most of Saylor's novels it is the motive that is of utmost importance, that and Gordianus' relationship to both deceased and affiliators. We see a man struggling to accept his age and he changing times he lives in. His relationships and his reality are laid open bare to see.I suspect that Meto will make a 'return' to good graces in the future, Davus is broadly hinted at as possessing acute mental faculties and the continuance of Hieronymous is excellent. Bethseda's illness neatly places a sense of pathos into the proceedings.So, the novel: very different, as excellent as ever. However, you can't help wondering what is going to happen to the Sub Rosa series as time continues to pass for Gordianus."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"While Caesar and Pompey are in Greece preparing for the ultimate showdown of their civil war, Rome is in dire straits under its Caesar-appointed custodians. Food is in short supply and the economy has all but collapsed with soaring inflation and a population deeply in debt (including Gordianus). Utter chaos could ensue at any moment as several opportunists exploit Rome's weakness to gain power for themselves. As if things weren't bad enough, Gordianus' wife Bethesda has fallen under a mysterious ailment that threatens to be fatal. Gordianus and his family are in the Forum seeking food (and hopefully a cure for Bethesda) when the beautiful but obviously deranged woman called \\"Cassandra\\" (for her alleged gift of prophecy), runs to Gordianus and collapses in his arms telling him before she dies that she has been poisoned by another woman. It turns out that Cassandra and Gordianus were not strangers. They were, in fact, secret lovers. (Yes, at his age!) Since Cassandra was a beggar with no relatives, Gordianus gives her a funeral. To his surprise, seven of the richest, most powerful women in Rome (including the wives and mistresses of Caesar, Cicero and Mark Antony) come to watch her body burn. Gordianus is sure that one of them is the murderer. Keeping his grief secret, Gordianus tries to identify the killer, as he is drawn deeper and deeper into Cassandra's complex world. Who exactly WAS Cassandra? Where did she come from? Why was she there? Was she a genuine seeress? A clever actress? A spy? Or all of the above? If she was a spy, who was she working for and why?A MIST OF PROPHECIES is a more conventionally \\"Agatha Christie\\" structured mystery than the previous volumes: a murder is committed, the suspects identified and then interviewed to discover the killer's identity. I was sure I had correctly guessed the murderess and her motivation at the end of Chapter 13, but I was wrong! Once again, what really makes the novel worthwhile are the colorful details of daily life in the Roman Empire. This book doesn't have the depth that some of the previous volumes have (e.g., THE VENUS THROW), but it's one of the faster-paced entries in this series and a lot of fun. At this point, there is only one more volume in this series after this book. I really don't want it to end! But A MIST OF PROPHECIES hints at the intriguing prospect of Gordianus' daughter Diana and her husband Davus entering the family business as a team. So maybe it won't be over!"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"In the hotbed of intrigue that is Rome in 48 BC, Caesar is away chasing Pompey in their struggle for Empire, the populous is divided in their allegiances and life goes on. The wives, daughters, lovers and family members of the power brokers of Rome are all caught up in this most recent tale of Gordianus the Finder. It is a departure from the last two books in the Roma Sub Rosa series that concentrated on political maneuverings and military operations, now returning to a more \\"human\\" centered tale involving the women of Rome; giving a face to historical figures that went without more than casual mention in the histories written by men, for men, about men.This is probably Steven Saylor's most non-linear novel to date. It weaves back and forth through the events surrounding the murder of his latest case, who also happens to be his mistress. The story telling has been taken to a new level in this novel, and Steven Saylor deserves the highest accolades for his work here. Am I being too enthusiastic? I think not. A truly wonderful tale that is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"\\"Mist of Prophecies\\" is the latest installment of Steven Saylor's Sub-Rosa series. Immediately it is one of his best and most enjoyable works to date. The book is good enough to be read on it's own but is best enjoyed by checking out the previoius 2 novels, \\"Rubicon\\" and \\"Last Seen In Massalia\\", (Checkout the great review by the reviewer Booksforabuck.) Changed by the vicissitudes of time, we see our protagonist, Gordianus the Finder older and more worldly and confronted with the tragic death of his intriguiging lover Cassandra. A seeress of unknown origin who dies in his arms and who's prophecies were urgently sought after by some of Rome's leading matrons. At the funeral, no one attends except the very same group of women observing the funeral rite from a discrete distance. Here is an excellent view at the behind-the-scenes look at the feminine Roman mindset. There are numerous flashbacks that reveals the plot and Gordianus' state of mind in an interesting way that is at once personal and prosaic. Notice, as we age it is natural to reminisce and Gordianus does that in a such a way to make his dilemma of loss and pain all the more real and convincing. Looking back at the past plots from the earlier books (makes you want to re-read, the Venus Throw and Murder On The Appian Way), brings Mist of Prophecies in sharp focus to the state of affairs in Rome, (the fall of the Republic) and the rise of Ceasar.The similarities between ancient Rome and our world and are so close that there is much to consider; economic upheavals with a poplulation deep in debt, war, rogue politicians causing trouble and plenty of grandstanding and intrigue to keep you awake at night. A must read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mr. Saylor once again creates a masterpiece that allows that individual not familiar with the history of Roman Empire to slip through time and experience a fascinating culture. Mr. Saylor's offering to his readers is not only on par with the excellent standards he established for himself in previous works in this genre but exceeds the expectations of his readers. One experiences the sights, the smells, the thrill of political intrigue, the desperation of a man advancing into years and trying to convince himself that he is, if not the man he once was, not the elderly individual he believes others see him. If I taught a course in this time period, I would want to use one of Saylor's novels for supplemental material. He is concise and historically accurate and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"The reader should be aware that this novel is a change of pace from Rubicon and Last Seen in Massilia: there's far less action. Gordianus investigates a young woman's murder by questioning the handful of people who attended her funeral; there is danger, but most of it is associated with rioting crowds in the Forum.The structure of the novel is inspired. Chapters recounting the investigation alternate with chapters in which Gordianus recalls successive encounters he had with the young woman--all memorable because newsworthy events were taking place at the same time. Bit by bit, we see a political crisis play out, even as we learn more about the enigmatic victim...and our old friend Gordianus. It's all tied together in a highly satisfying conclusion, with a surprise development that left this reader panting for the next book.I do have some quibbles with Saylor's portrayal of Gordianus's family. He describes their home life in some detail, yet never mentions daughter Diana's little son. Two novels ago, son-in-law Davus couldn't swim; in the last novel he had to and did--which might have been believable. But now he's an apparently strong swimmer, taking a dip in the Tiber for pleasure. Gordianus muses about his son Eco, and Eco's wife Menenia, having said things that seem out of character. That might be explainable. But he also reflects that Menenia and his own wife Bethesda have never gotten along; that's totally inconsistent with what we've read before."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"Gordianus the Finder is accosted in the marketplace by a beautiful young woman. She staggers towards him and dies in his arms. The woman is known as Cassandra by many, but this is not her real name, but a name given by the people who believed she had the true gift of prophecy. lots of people would pay handsomely for this gift, others would do anything in their power to supress it. Cassandra has had the ear of some of the most influential people in Rome, people who would stop at nothing . . .Obsessed with Cassandra's death Gordianus sets out to investigate. What he uncovers has serious implications concerning some of the most important women in Rome and puts Gordianus in serious danger of losing his own life.Saylor brings the sights, sounds and smells of Ancient Rome to life yet again, surely this is how it must have been."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"&quot;A Mist of Prophecies&quot; was a disappointment. Granted, it was an above average novel, but it had the potential to be much more.The novel opens in Rome in 48 BC when the city is in tumult and the city government is hard pressed to maintain basic law and order. There is an alleged prophetess who goes under the name of Cassandra and who like her Trojan namesake is widely believed to be able to forsee the future. However, she is poisoned and detective Gordianus the Finder decides to try to figure out who's responsible for the dirty deed.So far, so good. However, the plot unravels from there. Gordianus decides that the killer must have been one of the seven prominent women who went to Cassandra's funeral although it is not clear on what basis he makes that determination.One problem with mystery novels set in past historical times is that the detectives are invariably private citizens who do not have any legal power to compel folks to talk to them. Nor do they have any sort of investigator's license to give them legitimacy. So, the authors of these novels generally have the suspects answer just about every question put to them by the hero except the one that would establish who done it. When a suspect refuses to answer a particular question, you know right then and there that this person is either guilty or a red herring.In the case of &quot;A Mist Of Prophecies,&quot; the reader can figure out who the villainess is early on in the book since the author, Steven Saylor, failed to establish a plausible red herring. The guilty party in this novel just about did everything possible to make it easy for Gordianus to determine her guilt so much so that she might as well as gone around in public with a target painted on her back.While the mystery part is weak, the historical part is the novel's strength. The reader learns a lot about Roman history during this important time period in a way that holds the reader's interest. Additionally, the novel is well written and has richly drawn characters.Overall, I give it 3 out of 5 stars, but it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Mist of Prophecies","review":"This latest Gordianus the Finder murder mystery novel is far more somber in tone, slighty slower in pace, and is a little convoluted in the telling than previous ones. So if you're looking for a Gordianus installment that is in keeping with \\"Roman Blood\\" and \\"Murder on the Appian Way,\\" you might be in for a disappointment. I'm a staunch fan and am a real addict for the series, so that my lauding of this latest Gordianus novel can be seen as a personal bias. I liked this book quite a bit. The mood and the tone reflects Gordianus's state of mind completely -- his fears for what the current political upheaval could mean for Rome and her people; his anxiousness over his wife's ill health and their financial woes, and his apprehension over his estrangement with his son, Meto. Tying all these emotions together is his fascination for the mysterious young seeress, Cassandra, and his guilt over his feelings for her. The backdrop to all this emotional angst is the power struggle that is going on between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and the anxiety that everyone feel as they anxiously await the results of this conflict.\\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" opens with the funeral of the mysterious, Cassandra, a young woman who had the uncanny ability to foresee the future. But who exactly Cassandra is and where she hails from is a mystery, for Cassandra seems to have suffered from a form of amnesia. And one day, while Gordianus is shopping at the market with Bathsheba (his wife) and Diana (his daughter), Cassandra bursts upon them much agitated. She collapses in Gordianus's arms and dies after claiming that she has been poisoned by a woman. Because Cassandra has no family (and because, it is hinted here, of his relationship with her) Gordianus decides to foot the bill for her funeral. He also privately resolves to investigate her death. And at her funeral, Gordianus gets his first intimation of just how high Cassandra flew, for seven of Rome's most prominent women from rather important and powerful families attend her funeral. And they include Terentia (Cicero's wife) and her sister, Fabia (a Vestal Virgin); Antonia (Mark Anthony's wife); Fausta (the tyrant Sulla's daughter, who is also the wife of Milo, leader of the rabble); Calpurnia (Caesar's wife); and Clodia (the disgraced sister of Publius Clodius). Perhaps the mysterious 'she' that Cassandra referred to is one of these seven women? Grappling with his grief and anxiety, Gordianus begins his determined search for Cassandra's murderess, an investigation that is steeped in a danger all of its own as Gordianus begins poking and prying into the affairs of these rich and powerful women...As I noted this mystery unfolds at a more sedate pace than previous Gordianus mysteries and in a more circular manner as well, as chapters dealing with the investigation are juxtaposed with Gordianus's memories of when he first saw Cassandra and how they met. I suppose that one could describe this novel as a tender elegiac to Cassandra -- an old man's tender memories of the young woman he cared for. I liked the book for it's poignancy and it's tenderness. I also liked this novel because I thought that it belonged to the female characters of this mystery -- to Cassandra and Diana (who seems to understand what it is her father is going through even if she does not approve), and to the seven patrician women who may hold the key to the mystery of who murdered Cassandra and why. Of course we're only really treated to a thumbnail sketch of these women, but it did make for fascinating reading to read of the wives and daughters of the men who made Rome tremble and shake. I loved \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" and fairly devoured it in one go. Steven Saylor did a fantastic job of getting the feel and mood of Rome (at that particualr time) right, as well as informing and relating to us the political realities of the period. \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" is a wonderful read, and one that (in my opinion) should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Oxford nursery rhyme book","review":"This book has the most wonderful traditional verses and the traditional woodcuts are fascinating.

P.I. Katie Hassworth's job is to use that long list to find the killer. The reader goes along with Katie when she meets each one of the suspects, and we hear their alibis. I felt very much like a P.I. myself, as I tried to figure out \\"who did it\\" from the information given. Katie was a novice at solving murders, but she didn't back away when things get rough. I especially enjoyed the local color of Key West and the descriptions of the surrounding attractions, restaurants, wild-life, and plant-life. The writing itself was very smooth and tight. The author did not digress into other areas as many authors often do.

Her confidence is limited so she is hesitant to take on a murder investigation especially with her mentor out of town even though her landlady and friend Diane Dade asks her to look into the death of her mother Alexa Chitting. Reluctantly Katie agrees to investigate the homicide ruled a robbery gone bad by the Key West police and concurred with by Mac.Katie begins her inquiries at the scene of the crime, Alexa's office, where the culprit killed the victim using a conch shell that ironically symbolizes birth. Katie finds an obscure bullet that the cops overlooked and believes more than just a robbery occurred as Alexa was changing her will. However, she wonders who were the losers if Alexa had signed her revised will and would one of them kill to keep his or her inheritance? Katie learns the answer as she becomes a target when she gets too close.This engaging private investigative tale hooks readers because the heroine lacks confidence yet courageously seeks to solve the homicide against staggering professional odds. The story line reads more like an amateur sleuth cozy as the violence is left off the pages and Katie is learning on the job. Katie is a delightful individual and the support cast enables the audience to understand her, especially her fears, much better even when they fail to cooperate.

Well, if \\"depth of character\\" means a continuing debate with herself as to whether she can do the job of solving the murder, then Katie has \\"depth of character\\". She also fights grief over a failed marriage, eating problems, and a fear of committed relationships. In other words, she's a basket case. But all's well that ends well: Katie has a flesh wound, finds two culprits (not one), and finds a man who will abandon his father's wishes and career path so that he can stay in idyllic Key West with our cozy heroine.

The plot was not believable. The dialog was not believable. The characters all had annoying little pet names for the main character - \\"Katie girl\\", \\"my dear child\\" or \\"Blondie\\" - that grated on the nerves. The baddies were one dimensional, and in some cases, laughably stereotypical (the hot-headed Cuban girlfriend of one of the suspects). Even the author herself acknowledges that she's repeating herself, at one point mentioning that \\"the much-touted cold front still held the island and its inhabitants in its grip\\".She awkwardly and jarringly throws \\"word of the day\\" vocabulary into dialog and descriptions, which would be fine, but they don't match the rest of the writing, and sometimes just feel wrong. \\"And no doubt the solving of this case will make your name an eponym in South Florida if not throughout the state,\\" says our heroine to a difficult local policeman. Really? Eponym? My elementary school classmate Georgie Papanicolaou's uncle was an eponym - he invented the Pap test. Someone who catches a local murderer? That's not going to make their name an eponym.(Spoiler Alert) But the point at which I should have closed the book was when one of the suspect's alibi was -- and I'm not kidding you -- that two neighbors watched her silhouette behind a pulled window shade all night. It wasn't moving; she was supposedly writing. So I challenge you - just from this alibi alone - who do you think did it?

He's got no social security number, no driver's license, and has never paid a cent to theIRS.

Upon his return, Paladin finds his client--a good friend--dead. What happens to this counterculture and innocent soul, and the envelope in his possession, is the stuff of the mystery.Paladin's voice--wry, intelligent and way-groovy--is right on.

Tres is a great guy and a great character. Even in the deepest mysteries or most desperate straits, he always strikes me as someone who's basically in control, and a fun guy to hang out with.The characters in &quot;Cold Springs&quot; aren't like that.If the Navarre stories are fast-paced and entertaining, &quot;Cold Springs&quot; is edgy and uncomfortable. All of the characters are tense and troubled. All their lives are dark and desperate. And with one or two exceptions, none of them were ultimately particularly easy to be around. Even Chadwick, our hero, is battling too many demons ever to feel comfortable with. In fact, I never felt comfortable in this story at all, never able to relax, and never certain about what might be around the next corner.I loved it.&quot;Cold Springs&quot; has all the intricate plotting we've come to expect from Rick Riordan. Suspicion points at one character, and then another. Nobody seems trustworthy, not even our hero. But when you finally reach the resolution, most everything falls into place. As you read this, keep in mind the subtitle on the front cover: &quot;A Novel of Secrets.&quot; Secrets are always being revealed -- right up to the very end.Riordan's plot is complex and winding, but his characterizations deserve praise too. As I read this, I was reminded of Tolstoy's famous opening line, &quot;All happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&quot; Here, every miserable, troubled person is miserable and troubled in his or her own way, and each of them, including the several teenagers, is true to life (or at least convincing to someone like me who has mercifully avoided that kind of misery in my own life). And unlike the Navarre books, this story is told in third-person, and from multiple viewpoints. Riordan thus not only had to create characters whose actions are believable, but whose thoughts and emotions are believable too. That's much harder to do, and my hat's off to him because I think he pulled it off.Rick Riordan has done a great job. He's one of the few authors, and certainly the only novelist, for whose next work I'm always impatient. Though &quot;Cold Springs&quot; paid off the wait, it also whet my appetite for whatever's coming next. But first, I need to sit back and let the tension ease out a little bit. This was a nerve-wracking ride, and I think I need a rest."},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"WOW!! Riordan has done it again.

The characters are believable and sympathetic; the story compelling. And best of all, it kept me guessing throughout with some questions answered all along the way. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"Fabulous book. Action packed enough to satisfy thriller-readers, with enough psychological studies to satisfy people who like character-based books, with twists and turns galore to satisfy people who are trying to figure it all out. I changed my mind every couple of pages on the &quot;who did it&quot; -- even though I got one part of the &quot;why done it&quot; right. Not a laid-back meandering book, even though some of the language is very descriptive and poetic. Something for everyone.Beth"},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"This is my first Rick Riordan book and suffice to say, it is a stunning combination of complex plotting and characterization. Full of secrets. Deception. Lies. Murder. Revenge. Grief. You name it..it's here. Interesting that Riordan chose not to give us our protagonist's first name. He is known only as Chadwick, and that may indicate the kind of personality Riordan wanted us to identify with. The cast is full of unique and uncompromisingly original people: the young Mallory, victim of a cruel childhood disaster, now drug-ridden and sent to a \\"reform\\" school in Texas; John and Ann Zedman, her divorced parents; Norma, Chadwick's ex-wife; counselor Olsen; escort Kindra; the Melrose family; David, a [***]-kisser; etc., etc. Riordan weaves his plot intricately and pulls a few surprises at the end.A very good book, one to be enjoyed by fans of the genre and others."},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"I thought I had figured it out at least 10 or 15 times and was still completely astounded by the ending of this book! What a ride! This was great fun!"},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"The typical death toll in a contemporary thriller would populate a small city. Today's crime-fiction writers gleefully dispatch more souls than Forest Lawn, and rarely is anyone haunted by the carnage or the shadows.The ghosts are thick in Rick Riordan's new thriller, \\"Cold Springs,\\" but not because a lot of people die in a first few blood-splashed pages. Quite the contrary. These ghosts -- like Riordan's cast of characters -- once had three-dimensional form and feelings, and they haunt the heart more than the noir-ish corners of rain-slicked clich&eacute;.\\"Cold Springs\\" is Riordan's first stand-alone thriller, a departure from his Edgar- and Shamus-winning series featuring wise-cracking San Antonio private-eye Tres Navarre. While the Texas middle-school teacher has now returned to the character who first put him on the radar, \\"Cold Springs\\" shows he has the chops for more stylish prose in the headlong rush of a multi-level, rapidly twisting plot.Riordan's voice is smooth, accented with a South Texas drawl and punctuated by evocative imagery -- hills that look like \\"scar tissue, swollen and raw and pink\\" or a voice that \\"stung like sleet.\\" Such metaphor from the mouth of the irreverent Tres Navarre would elicit a Chandler-esque groan -- and often does -- but transplanted to a deeper story with more complex relationships and landscapes, it's not out of place.It's a matter of degree. \\"Cold Springs\\" doesn't portend a new trend toward literary thrillers, but it flirts with slightly more \\"character arc\\" -- the way a protagonist changes over the course of a story -- than most of today's purely plot-driven stuff. It ain't even so high up the tree that it will put off page-turning mystery fans who measure good \\"literature\\" by high body counts and bizarre ways to die. For them, Riordan supplies a steady stream of corpses and unusual wounds.But Riordan is a rising star in crime fiction and, with luck, will help the genre usher back strong plots with complex characters."},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"Amid the mixed reviews for Cold Springs, this one-off thriller didn't disappoint. One reviewer's comments about discomfort is accurate... it was hard for me to identify with many of the characters, and, as with many works of fiction, I had to suspend my disbelief on many occasions. But Cold Springs was an entertaining read. Though I thoroughly enjoy the Navarre series, I hope to see more departures from Riordan, lest he, and we, get a bit tired of Tres."},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"Riordan makes his characters so real, reading this book might actually make you feel sick. I never knew who was the hero or who was the villian because all of the characters deserve empathy as well as disrespect. You will feel like you know these people and have been to their homes.I LOVED this book."},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"My awareness of the intricacy of Rick Riordan's plotting began when I realized the main character was known only by his last name. This interesting linguistic twist indicates a distancing from intimacy and immediate knowledge about Chadwick's personality and history. I should know. I semi-dated a man who constantly referred to himself by his last name. The story is riveting and often doubles back to re-involve the original characters and reveal previously unmentioned details. I pre-ordered this book and will always pre-order this writer's novels."},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"Chadwick intends to send his teenage daughter Katherine to Cold Spring, a boot camp style school in Texas because she's addicted to heroin and running with the wrong crowd. Before he can do that she overdoses while she is baby-sitting five-year-old Mallory Zedman. The incident traumatizes the little girl who saw her beloved baby-sitter die.Nine years later Mallory dates the boy whose brother supplied Katherine with heroin and is an addict too. Accompanied by Chadwick she is sent to Cold Springs, but once she arrives everything begins to fall apart. Mallory's mother has been accused of embezzling $27 million dollars. Mallory's father is tired of paying blackmail money and sends his bodyguard to kidnap his daughter so they can flee the country. Mallory becomes the target of a killer who has murdered anyone who has gotten in the way and the only person who can save her is Chadwick, who is a suspect in at least two homicide investigations.Rick Riordan has written a crime thriller that ranks with the works of Patricia Cornwell, Dennis Lehane and Thomas Harris. Chadwick feels guilty for not acting sooner in saving his daughter and in Mallory he sees the hope for his redemption, The protagonist soon learns, almost too late, that only Mallory can save herself from her own destructive impulses. Although much of this novel takes place on an isolated school in Texas, it has the feel of an urban noir thriller. This is a must read for anyone who wants to read an unforgettable thriller starring a villain that matches the bite of Hannibal Lechter.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"When an author steps outside the bounds of a &quot;franchise&quot; series, there are obviously risks and perils. Some are more successful than others, and an author's motivation is usually to expand (or escape) the boundaries created by their signature character(s).I, for one, felt extremely let-down by this novel. Riordan's previous efforts (with wise-cracking Tres Navarre)were well plotted, deftly written, and most importantly, vastly entertaining. Cold Springs, his first departure from the previous series, I'm afraid is none of the above. The &quot;troubled&quot; protagonist, Chadwick, just never quite rings true with his relationships with most of the other characters, who are too one dimensional to be of much interest. The one character who is more completely &quot;fleshed out&quot; is a teen-age girl who seems wise way beyond her years. Her transition from drug groupie to redeeming heroine lacks a believable fulcrum, and quite simply never engenders much emotion from the reader. This novel lacks polish throughout, and almost seems to have been written at an earlier stage of the author's literary evolution. (And as an &quot;aside&quot;, least I be accused of just missing Riordan's Tres Navarre too much, let me highly recommend Greg Rucka's latest --and first departure from HIS usual protagonist Atticus Kodiak-- &quot;A Fistful Of Rain&quot;...now THAT'S a smokin' departure)!"},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"I realize Cold Springs is a novel - and so not bound by truth. However, I find the positive depiction of teen help boot camps, and escort services, disturbing and worrisome. Any parent with a drug addled kid, who happen to get ahold of this book, would likely be sent looking for a boot camp and escorts. The abuse and gross neglect, so common to these programs was not represented in its true light.The girl the story revolves around was treated brutally; did resort to killing and eating an armadillo; did have to wear her menstrual flow stained clothes; but this was all to the good (rolling eyes) and she was saved from herself as a result. *Sigh*Also, the escort the story revolves around was a murderer - but only of bad guys.I would like to suggest to those buying this book, also buy a copy of :\\"Help at Any Cost\\", how the troubled teen industry cons parents and hurts kids; by Maia Szalavitz.Or, simply Google Aaron Bacon, the death of.

When 16 year old Katherine Chadwick overdoses on heroin, her parents' lives are turned upsidedown. Nine years later, the story threatens to repeat itself as 15 year old Mallory Zedman, the girl Katherine was babysitting the night she died, becomes involved with the younger brother of Katherine's dealer/boyfriend. For Katherine's father, now working for a bootcamp for troubled teens in Texas, saving Mallory offers up a chance to redeem the loss of his daughter.This is a story of three tragically interwoven families. The Chadwicks are an upwardly mobile family consisting of a teacher father and an accountant mother whose lives are torn apart by the death of their daughter. The Zedmans are a privileged family with an investor father, a headmistress mother and another troubled daughter. The Montroses are a family with a mother who is murdered early in the story, two drug dealing sons and a missing daughter. The connections between the familes are toxic. Chadwick the father was having an affair with Zedman the mother. Chadwick and Zedman's daughters were each dating different drug dealing members of the Montrose family. Chadwick the father is haunted by the death of his daughter and the romance with his high school friend Ann Zedman which died stillborn. Zedman the father is harried by a sinister blackmailer and angst over his troubled daughter. Finally, there are Mallory Zedman and Race Montrose, the Romeo and Juliet of the story, who must find a way to avoid destiny and live to adulthood.Rick Riordan has woven an intricately layered plot which juggles the stories of the three families and the locations in California and Texas. This is a great mystery story because it unfolds enough details to keep the reader guessing without telegraphing the final resolution."},{"Title":"Cold Springs","review":"After reading \\"The Devil Went Down to Austin\\" I was excited to discover Rick Riordan.

In their rough and, I guess, brash football world, they develop an infatuation as old as time. They attend football camp together and come to terms with their feelings for each other.The language is coarse and some of the descriptions are gross, but this is what my football and basketball playing brothers and their friends were like in high school. I think that S. Krol Joseph does an excellent job portraying these characters as real, tough football players. He also captures their sensitivities and their growing affection. I think the build of emotion is realistic and the self-doubt and denial is handled in a subtle and completely natural way. Also, the romantic suspense was beautiful. I could have hoped to hear more about Vinnie and Vuch after football camp, but I have to admit the ending was satisfying. I read the book in one sitting!

I disagree that the 11th edition is that much better than the 9th edition, which I also have. The paper cover of the 11th edition feels flimsier and weaker.The back of the 11th edition claims there are five (good) reasons exclusive to the 11th edition as to why you should buy it. The written explanation for the first reason could be both simpler and clearer: \\"A new introduction in Chapter 1 explains writing as a process in which you argue with--and ultimately explain something to--yourself.\\" Arguing with yourself does not sound either safe nor advisable, especially if you are having a bad day. Explaining things to yourself sounds like one needs help of the non-literary kind.Reason number two sounds good: \\"An updated chapter on print and electronic research [offering] advice...\\" This is nothing new, but why shouldn't the reader benefit from another's digital wisdom? The amount of digital information available on the Web grows exponentially faster than one can keep up with.Reason number three (sounds like door number three) is from the more is better paradigm: Twenty model student essays--including three new to this edition... This is a very good feature of this writing guide. I never counted how many there were in the 9th edition, but in this case, more is better. Generally, I have found the example essays, analysis and explications to be of great help, except for the section on meter, which I found just as difficult as the 9th edition's explanation.Reason number four: \\"Updated bilographical references...\\" More of the more is better paradigm. Can't complain with that.Reason number five (the last one): \\"New and expanded 'Rules for Writing...'\\" Almost every How to Write book or textbook I have looked at contains a section like this, so, I have to say this is nice but nothing really new.I gave this new edition four stars out of five. The first reason didn't make sense and, I thought, needed re-writing to be clearer thus more helpful and/or convincing. The real reason for why you, or anyone else should buy this book, is that it is very good at taking a subject, which can be made as complex or as simple as you desire, and breaking it down into smaller, more productive and clearer steps, which should help you write better. I recently bought two copies of the 11th edition, one of which I gave to a student, and the other, I have to admit--I kept for myself. And that is my second reason for why you should buy this book. It is good enough, even though the 9th edition was not broken and needed repair, that I bit the bullet and kept a copy for myself.

Then news comes that Boo has become a Christian and will no longer write horror. What will happen to the town? Is this just another media ploy? The townspeople all try to figure out the real story behind the news, getting everyone into a bunch of adventures that make for a good fun comic read.I read that this book was described as \\"The Mitford Series on steroids.\\" I totally have to agree with that description! The characters in this book are really eccentric and quirky. The small town seems to be isolated in their own little world. It's a place where everyone seems to know everyone and their business. I really liked Wolfe's character. He struck me as being the only normal person in the entire town. I really liked how persistent he was in discovering more about what it meant to become a Christian even though everyone around him was discouraging him. The story really struck me how Christians can be very snobby about their faith. Like Ainsley, they claim that want others to believe in Jesus but when someone actually does, they won't believe them. I've seen many people like Ainsley who doubt people's faith. Even worse, were the characters that tried to make Wolfe STOP being a Christian just for their own profit. I will not lie. Some of the characters in the story drove me absolutely crazy and I wanted to scream at them! And especially after what they did to Wolfe near the end of the story. Tsk.

I am shocked that I am a dissenter on this one!It is a \\"cute\\" story. However, the plot is very simple and very predictable. Perhaps I had my hopes too high after reading the reviews here that had prompted me to read the book. While I read, I kept waiting for the story to really grab me. Unfortunatley, it did not. The further I got in the book the more I realized that the \\"hook\\" I was waiting for was not to be found.It is not a bad book, but not great either. Very ho-hum in my opinion. It is reflective of what I always thought Christian fiction would be - references to the faith, but slow and...well... a bit boring. This is only the second piece of Christian fiction I have read - the first being \\"Bad Ground\\" by W. Dale Cramer - a fantastic book! After reading \\"Bad Ground\\" I was shocked that Christian fiction could be so great! I had to get on to another one right away and \\"Boo\\" was next in line. Unfortunatly, it fell short of the mark. A more interesting plot, better character development, and/or better prose in general, might have saved the day. For me, a day with this read, does not go down in history as anything more than drab with a pinch of cute thrown in.My recommentdation (although not that of the majority) is, don't purchase. Borrow from a friend or a library and save your money."},{"Title":"Boo (The Boo Series #1)","review":"The premise for this story is perfect; Horror fiction writer becomes a Christian, and the town loses its tourist industry. The book was a fun read and very lighthearted. There were a few lessons thrown in there, in particular, finding out who had witnessed to Boo. A great read for anyone looking for something fun, light and with some romance thrown in. The story did lack some depth and some of the characters were a little stereotypical. But you could tell the author had fun writing this one and I think it may actually make a good movie."},{"Title":"Boo (The Boo Series #1)","review":"Boo by Rene Gutteridge is lots of fun to read. Gutteridge has lots of fun making plays on the characters' names and speculating about what life would be like in a horror author's hometown. Wolfe Boone's horror stories have built the town of Skary, Indiana. All of the local businesses make money from tourism based on his books. So what happens when Wolfe (known as Boo to the local townsfolk) has a spritiual conversion? Everyone's secrets will come out! Miss Peeples is a hoot! The Christianity seems more like a plot device than actual faith until the end of the book when Wolfe finally reveals who showed him the gospel. Ainsley obsession with Martha Stewart is fun, but sometimes seems to overwhelm her character. I look forward to reading the rest of the series and seeing how characters grow in faith and humor."},{"Title":"Boo (The Boo Series #1)","review":"Here it is, that time of year for ghosts and goblins, on All Howlers Eve, so let's visit Skary, Indiana, the once-struggling tourist-trap for the dark side, to the Haunted Mansion cafe with its 'bloody fingers' (french fries covered with ketchup) to Spooky's Bookstore where the employees dress in Halloween costumes on a regular basis, and to other scary and dangerous places.Boo is short for Boone, the horror novelist in residence. We begin, \\"A dark shadow of evil...the evil can only been seen when there is light. In the dark it is hidden, inching forward over the landscape like a thick, black ink, fearing exposure by the rotation of the earth, waiting for the light to reach it again. It is invisible without its shadow. It lies on the edge of a small town, ready to drown it.\\" This is a town filled with one yellow cat and a multitude of black cats, don't you know!Boo becomes a born-again Christian and decides to abandon his scary image; then, things start to happen in this small town with its busybodies and hypocrites. Rene Gutteridge portrays the small town charm with a gentle message of \\"enduring faith, as the community is changed forever by God.\\"She has followed up with BOO HISS, BOO WHO and STORM GATHERING. This is a delightful treat for Halloween, so read it and laugh as the shenanigans take place. It's not really scary, just Skary, Indiana-style.

I'd put my daughter to bed for the evening, and I'm glad she was sleeping, because within a few pages, I was rolling with laughter! There were places in this book where I'd be on lunch in the break room at work, I'd start literally howling, and people wondered what was up. So, expect people to wonder where your medication is when you read this, and tell them, \\"THIS is IT!\\"I remembered when I first heard the main man's name was Wolfe, the same name as myself. Now, I was named after author Thomas Wolfe, but I never figured I'd run into a book that would catch my attention with the main character named Wolfe. But, he becomes a Christian in this town called Skary. What makes things really weird is the fact that he's a well known horror writer, and this town is all about Wolfe Boone, better known as Boo. So, leave it to Miss Missy Peeple, the town gossip, to try and get things back to the way they were. And Ainsley Parker, daughter of the Sheriff is the main attraction of Mr. Wolfe Boone. Ainsley Parker, works at The Haunted Mansion, which happens to be a restaurant that has delightful choices. How about some queasy quesadillas, with some bloody fingers. Maybe have the special of the day, Mad Cow meat loaf with a screamy potato?But Wolfe is what I'd call a very likable person. People want to know who witnessed to him in the first place. I mean, his editor, Alfred Tennison even wants to know when his next work is due out, and man, are citizens of Skary sure getting nervous! And while Wolfe is someone you like instantly, you really learn to dislike Missy Peeple. Believe you, me, you'll be able to picture people just like her while enjoying this work. I actually took a personal liking to Thief.Yet, even among all the hilarity of this, there is a somber message within the pages of this crazy, sometimes out of control work by Rene Gutteridge.

Enjoyed it so much I purchased one for my mom and sister in law"},{"Title":"Boo (The Boo Series #1)","review":"Boo is the first novel in a series of 3 (soon to be four I believe) set in Scary, Indiana. Wolfe Boone, \\"Boo\\", is a horror novelist that moved to Scary where he has spent his time churning out best selling books and becoming reclusive. The town has transformed itself into a tourist attraction, promoting all things horror and celebrating Boone's success. Also, no one in the town knows anything about Boone. Ainsley Parker works as a waitress at the Haunted Mansion. She is an honest, loving woman and a devoted Christian. She knows one thing in life is certain: She hates Wolfe Boone. She hates him because she blames him for what the town has turned into.The novel opens with Boone's conversion to Christianity. Missy Peeple, the old, cranky, scheming snoop hears about it and soon the entire town knows. Missy is scared that because Boone is now a Christian, he'll quit writing horror novels, thus depriving Skary of its tourist business. In an effort to save the town, Missy talks several townfolk into helping her convince Boone to continue to write horror novels. The basis for the plot seems weak and farfetched, but in a comedy like this, it works perfect. The novel is full of unique characters: Garth, the vet that secretly loves Ainsley, Sheriff Parker, the overprotective father of Ainsley, Melb, the devoted fan of Boone, Reverend Peck, and of course, the conniving Missy Peeple.With Boo, Gutteridge has the perfect pitch of comedy and light-hearted suspense. She has a great eye for quirky character traits that can at times be found in all of us. In this book, Gutteridge has found her voice as a comedy writer. Now for a little comment about the audio version of this book. I tried it, and made it halfway through and had to replace it with the written version. I'm usually a fan of audio books, but I don't think it works in this case, and don't know how it ever could with a book in this genre. First, the book sounds like it is being read by Rev. Lovejoy from the Simpsons (not a negative, just a comment). Second, the narrator reads very slow, so the audio version is over ten hours. Finally, as is common in all audio books, the narrator gives each character a unique voice, and this is where I find the problems. Gutteridge has worked hard to paint Wolfe Boone as a handsome, mysterious, reclusive writer, but the voice the narrator gives him makes him sound like a bumbling bufoon. The simple problem is the narrator tries to give each character a funny accent and it comes off as trying to be funny, but I also believe it is not the intent of the author for us to laugh at how the characters sound. So, while I could have enjoyed the audio version of the book, I recommend you buy the written version.I'm new to this genre and can't really compare it to others to know how it rates. But I know I enjoyed it. It reads like a romantic comedy. So in spite of, or maybe because of, the one dimensional characters, I recommend this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Boo (The Boo Series #1)","review":"What is it about Ainsley that's supposed to make her so likeable? I thought she was a big priss right from the very start. She wasn't at peace inside herself because she didn't like her job and she didn't like the town and she didn't like having to take care of her father instead of making her own life. She was a real jerk to Boo and whatsizname, the vet.And all that uber-Martha stuff just wore me out. The old-maid fussiness over cooking and decorating and the reference to the sheets in the linen closet being tied with ribbons just made me want to go lie down.So I just didn't get it about Ainsley, right from the very beginning. And then, with all her animosity toward Boo, to make such a rapid about-face really tested my credulity.I suppose what I'm saying is that Ainsley's character was not very well developed. I didn't like her. I didn't see any reason to like her. And I felt the same about Wolfe/Boo. He was a stock character -- the misunderstood recluse...the Beast from the fairy tale. That's an old, old characterization and nothing was done to put the slightest twist on it. We weren't able to see him wrestling with his inner longing for God and the conflicting forces that came up against his career as a horror writer - we only heard about them later. He'd gone through the struggle before the book even BEGAN, which was too bad. Because not being able to empathize with a character makes that character seem very one dimensional.And I never quite understood how he managed to be such a recluse in a small town like Skary. His house was in plain view, after all. No gate. No fence. We were able to read that he took his dogs to a vet in another town, but where did he go to the grocery, for heaven's sake? Did he never need to mail a parcel? Go to the library? The bank? It was like he had no clue that there was this entire tourist industry built from the fact that he lived right there in the town, IN PLAIN VIEW, but still managed to be a recluse, except for occasional forays to Ainsley's section of the restaurant to eat meatloaf. Very weird.The thing with the pastor was just kind of...dropped. He shut the doors of the church and left the note on the door, telling them to go and do what Jesus would want them to do. The congregation milled around and had their \\"meeting.\\" Ainsley took Wolfe to do some godly visiting, bringing Christ to the shut-ins, but it seemed like there was this undercurrent of worry that the pastor had been kidnapped or something. Next thing we know, he's at Thanksgiving dinner and no word was ever spoken about the success of his \\"experiment\\" until Wolfe got lost in the snow. Then the church was full and he was happy, although I didn't really understand why. Did that ONE incident of prayer mean that the pews were going to be full every Sunday thereafter?The pastor seemed like a puppet character, who abruptly popped into the story line to advance the plot a few more pages and then was just as quickly snatched back out, to be forgotten until the next time he was needed.The worst character by far was Missy. What was she? A meddling old gossip? A secret member of a crime family? Actual evil within all the fake \\"evil\\" of Skary? I'm assuming that will be addressed in the other two books. But the business of being in the bushes and trying to make it seem that the vet had assaulted her, and then the \\"dehydration\\" thing...I didn't get those at all.And the Thanksgiving scene was just weird. Nice way to treat a stranger in your midst, Christians of Skary, especially the sheriff.Ainsley's dad, Mr. Sheriff, needs some Xanax or something. He is a very strange man, much stranger than Missy. First of all, he wants Ainsely to marry the vet and is stubbornly locked onto that thought and will not budge, which is kind of obsessive. Then there's the deal with Theif and all the cat doors -- again, obsessive. And he seems to want Ainsley to stay there in Skary, in his house, even if she doesn't want to leave, which has shades of a horror novel, specifically Stephen King's \\"Misery.\\" Yikes. Then there's his weirdness with with Wolfe and the way he seemed to automatically leap to the conclusion that Wolfe had assaulted Missy and killed Thief. Whaa-?This man has some Issues and shouldn't be running around loose with a gun.I was vetting this book for my mother, who wanted to know if it would be a good story for her church's library. There's nothing objectionable in it from the Christian point of view, but as far as writing goes, the characterization was shallow and stereotyped and the plot was contrived and sluggish. A real disappointment."},{"Title":"Boo (The Boo Series #1)","review":"This is a pleasant enough book. Clearly, the characters are intended to be caracatures, and the plot is telegraphed from the beginning. But no one is reading this book intending to find Ulysses. It's pleasant escapism.Two bits hurt the novel for me, though. First, we are told at some point in the book that Boo drives a Jeep. Yet, when he is leaving the Thanksgiving dinner, he thinks he cannot drive through the snow, while everyone else piles into a far less likely car to go find him. A minor point, but jarring.Far more important was the discussion of why Boo had been converted. Or, more particularly, who had \\"witnessed\\" to him. It would be a spoiler to state who did, but the manner in which he claimed he had been witnessed to bothered me, as a non-Christian, because essentially what he was seeing was righteousness and charity by someone and that led him to convert to Christianity. With all due respect, Christians have no patent on either righteousness or charity, and it would appear from what Boo says that if he saw the same from a Zoroastrian, he would have become a Zoroastrian. So I don't get it."},{"Title":"Boo (The Boo Series #1)","review":"Saintly Social Butterfly Waitress Chick is wooed by supposedly-recently-converted Reclusive Horror Novelist Dude as whole town gasps in horror & plots to kill both their romance & his supposed faith.Beyond the highly-contrived plot, characters & setting & beyond the rather frightening uses of \\"poetic license\\" (more on this later), is a highly-romantic story held together by quaint instances of folk wisdom (out of the mouths of characters):\\"Well,\\" Gert [the aunt] said, \\"you'll find the one [the love of your life].

And then, without warning, he realized with excitement there was a test. He sat up straight and lifted his eyes toward the ceiling. Yes, a test! Something he could do to see if his little flock had indeed been listening all these years. He stood and laughed out loud. Yes! With one simple test he would know. Surely they would pass. It wasn't hard, after all. But he know one thing for sure: The test would tell him if his church had put his words in their hearts .... \\" (p. 164)And, although I LOVED the scenes that resulted from the pastor's decision, I did have to pause right here & wonder why the author had the pastor (of all people) say that he wanted to see if HIS church had put HIS words in their hearts, rather than acknowledge that the church belongs to Jesus & that the words that the pastor (hopefully) planted in people's hearts were Jesus' words ... ?!Which leads to a couple more glaring examples of poetic-license-gone-wrong (with #2 also being a major plot point):1) The author doesn't seem to know (or care) that t-shirts do not now, nor have they ever, had side seams ...2) The author doesn't seem to know (nor did she care to check the facts) that neutered cats can (& do!) attempt to woo female cats in heat -- which is, admittedly, something the average Joe might not know (or care to understand), but SURELY the town vet (who is one of the novel's main characters) WOULD know such an important little detail?Nits aside, this is a nice, fun, light read & would probably make a much better movie than a novel?

The characters and their relationships are complex and interesting, and as mentioned in the other reviews the book might remind you of Stand By Me or Richard Laymon's Travelling Vampire Show. While there are hints of what's to come, the first half of the book is the characters being fleshed out as they spend a summer on the coast of Maine. The Ketchum depravity that follows is up to par. This book also reminded me of Laymon's Night in Lonesome October.A night of fun trespassing in a haunted house--What could possibly go wrong?"},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"Ketchum did it again, created a story so real that it draws you in and leaves you wondering. The \\"horror\\" of Ketchum is that he bases his stories on reality. No supernatural happenings here, just a little pushing of the reality envelope.Dan is a young kid just floating through life in a sleepy little town, working at a lumber mill, and putting off attending college. Life for Dan is calm and easy until three rich kids from Boston arrive in Dead River. (What a name for a town where horrors live.)Casey, (who becomes Dan's lover) Steve, and Kim take Dan into their fold and Dan's life becomes less than calm. The three college kids show Dan how to live life with a sense of entitlement by stealing caviar and cheese for picnics on the beach, creating their own nude beach, and shirking the responsibility of a job.Dan's relationship with Casey is complicated by her hedonism and risk taking. During the course of the summer Dan comes to understand the tragedy in Casey's life that has formed her personality. He doesn't like what it has done to her, but out of his love/infatuation with her Dan goes along with Casey's crazy antics. One being the game of hide and seek in an old abandoned house at midnight. The house just happens to have a dark history, which Dan shared with Casey, Kim and Steve. And it is because of the houses history, which involves the eviction and disappearace of reculsive Ben and Mary Crouch, the removal of tens of abandonded dogs from the house, and the inability of anyone to live in the old Crouch home afterward, that prompts Casey's game. It turns into a very dangerous game for everyone, especially Casey.Hide and Seek reminded me of The Girl Next Door and Red, other great books of Ketchum's books that have their terror based in reality.

Why his talent has not been brought to the attention of more horror and mainstream fiction fans is a mystery to me. Hide and Seek, his second published novel, varies significantly from his incredible debut novel Off Season, but it packs just as much of a punch as its predecessor. Where Off Season was horrible and disturbing, Hide and Seek is downright spooky. I have read enough horror to become immune to the scare tactics most authors rely on, but Ketchum managed to really give me the creeps in the later chapters of this incredible tale. The book does start a little slowly, with character development taking up the first half of it, but midway through Ketchum cranks up the tension and advances the plot at an increasingly intensive, addicting pace. About thirty pages from the end, I found myself covering up the right hand page with my hand because it was all I could do to stop myself from jumping ahead and seeing how things played out. I must say that I found myself more than satisfied with the ending. Many authors put their characters through the ringer only to wrap things up with a fairy tale ending. Ketchum is far too honest to back down at the last minute and give his readers what they might want at the end. This honesty and loyalty to both his characters and his readers is what distinguishes Ketchum in my mind as one of horror's most praiseworthy writers.The story itself seems rather simple and conventional: two young men and two young women go to an abandoned house out in the woods of Maine in order to play a game of adult hide and seek--the house has long been the subject of gossip and rumors but it cannot really be characterized as haunted. The idea for this seemingly foolish pursuit comes from Casey, a complicated, fascinating female character. Her constant shows of bravado and risk-taking bother our protagonist yet he never refuses her requests. The first half of the novel establishes Casey's character and background pretty well, so the context of the game makes sense to the reader. When the gang arrive at midnight and commence their game, this novel quickly shifts into overdrive. Having to follow our protagonist around this creepy house in the dark, searching for the hiding places of his friends, got this reader's blood pumping a little harder, but the increasingly scary nature of the game is actually no more than a prelude of the horror to come.The only flaw I can identify in my own mind is Ketchum's level of characterization. He spends a lot of time introducing us to the four players of the hide and seek game, but I never fully came to know them. The complex Casey remains somewhat of an enigma to me despite the revelations we receive about her life and history. A few events seem very important when they happen but are never fully dealt with later on. Of course, Ketchum is mainly trying to scare readers, and to some extent it matters little whether or not we completely understand and care deeply about the players in his fictional universe. The fears Ketchum manipulates here are some of man's most primal, instinctive ones, which makes it almost impossible for the reader not to get sucked into the story and taken along for a wild ride. If you have begun to think that all horror novels are basically alike, Ketchum will surprise and delight you with his refreshing originality, realism, and honesty."},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"This is the fourth Ketchum novel I have read. It ranks second behind his masterpiece of the disturbing: &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; (&quot;Joy Ride and &quot;The Lost&quot; are tied at a solid third). I only wish I didnt know anything about the plot before I read this novel. I would have loved to have been completely in the dark;like the characters, until the the bone chilling climax. Oh well, this book was still creepy fun. P.S.: Never mind reviews that suggest this novel starts out slow. These are readers who obviously dont understand concepts like plot and character development (and do not have any patience: its not that long of a novel!). This is a perfectly paced gem."},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"Dead River, another small town up north.

The first 3/4 of this book was just mildly interesting interaction between teenagers, nothing to write home about. It FINALLY got going toward the end, but that just didn't quite make up for the earlier boredom, in my humble opinion. Very good plot concept, although similar to Off Season. Another JK trend - and I don't know if anybody else notices this, but it's pretty obvious - is that he can't write women well AT ALL, and he loves to put them in love/sex scenarios that just aren't realistic in real life. In &quot;Cover&quot; it was a married couple with the husband having a younger, beautiful mistress on the side, yet the mistress and the wife were best friends and they all hung out together. In this book, the two teenage girls and two teenage boys just love to run around naked all the time, checking out each others' bodies without any jealousy. A) most teenage women are NOT like that, and B) most teenage men are not like that either. Jack Ketchum does something strange along these lines in all of his books, which, sadly, makes his characters unbelievable because we can't identify ourselves with them. I think Jack just believes that if he keeps the sex level high, more people will want to read his books. My last complaint is that Jack's books aren't readily available because he chooses to publish them only in signed, limited form and charge big bucks for them. So he's only going to be able to keep the small fan club that already exists - smooth move, Jack."},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"This is only the second Ketchum novel I've had the pleasure to read. The first was \\"Ladies Night,\\" an o.k. book that lacked a lot of the things we readers take for granted (a plot, character development, etc.). I shall read more of his stuff in the future, but not as many as I would like due to the high prices publishers and sellers charge for some of his novels. Until there are mass-market reprints of books like \\"The Girl Next Door,\\" I won't be reading his entire literary catalogue any time soon. That's a darn shame, too, as \\"Hide and Seek\\" is an excellent, and surprisingly scary, read.\\"Hide and Seek,\\" Ketchum's second novel released in the early 1980's, is set in a small, dirt-poor town in Maine. The main character of the story is Dan Thomas. Dan is small town all the way; he works at a local lumber mill, and whiles away his days drinking with his buddy Rafferty. Dan ought to go to college, but he's young and drifting a bit in life. That is until he meets up with three rich college kids doing the summer thing in town. Dan really goes for Casey, a hot little number with an annoyingly dangerous habit of doing crazy things. Casey, along with her two buddies, Steve and Kim, think nothing of stealing cars for joyrides, shoplifting caviar for lunch on the beach, and taking their clothes off at weird times. Dan is accepted by the group, and quickly becomes wrapped up in their misadventures. Unfortunately for Dan, he makes the mistake of mentioning the Crouch incident to his newfound friends. The Crouch house, considered haunted by the local kids, stands as a tempting target for Casey's nihilistic approach to life. Casey insists on playing a game of hide and seek in the house as a new means for thrills. The tragedy that ensues changes everyone's life forever.I really liked this book. Ketchum's use of foreshadowing is excellent and the characters are SO well drawn. Even secondary characters, mainly Kim and Steve, are written with some depth. We not only come to understand Dan, we also realize why Casey likes to live on the wild side. I think any guy can understand why Dan is attracted to Casey and why he is unable to break away from her dangerous spell. If you can't understand why, Ketchum explains it in effective ways.I am also surprised that the book actually scared me. Very few authors can bring out that emotion in me. I think it has something to do with the Crouch family. They aren't supernatural beings like vampires; they are mere humans. For some reason, that little distinction makes the novel scarier. When Dan and his friends are wandering through that abandoned house, and the other part of the house they find later, it is genuinely freaky. Maybe it's because we've all been in that situation (either alone in our own houses or exploring an old house in the woods as kids) that makes it so real and frightening. Whatever it is, I found myself looking over my shoulder a few times after reading the book.This is one of Ketchum's good ones. I can't wait to read \\"The Lost\\" and some of his other novels. I also hope that reprints of his earlier works begin to appear with frequent regularity. Put down your Stephen King novels and visit the world of Jack Ketchum, and do it soon."},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"The follies of youth - sometimes they lead people to do the strangest things. Sometimes that means impressing people by shouldering less-than-bright ideas that we come up with, and sometimes that means trying to put on lifestyles that we know nothing about. Enter our lead in this story, sitting in his tourist town and noticing how much life is passing him by, and enter our distraction and the friends she courts. Also enter a tale of a house that has a haunting history when we are told about it, and enter Hide and Seek.As far as Jack Ketchum is concerned, I have to credit him with being one of the most stable character developers I have ever read. When his ideas hit the proverbial blackboard of thought, I can see the people and the little things they bring to the table. Whether they have a nervous tick or some sort of unmentioned OCD that causes them to do some of the oddest things, they have a clarity about them. I also have to credit him with being one of the best set-up men in the business. Many people can place a thing before you and the linearity of it makes you say that it was alright, but Ketchum's paths are anything if straight and the development a reader follows is a beauty to behold. I personally find the way he builds his worlds inciting.In Hide and Seek, the dance of the characters is nice to watch and the thing they are building up to is something you see coming out of the corner of your eye, and that is good. I personally thought the time spent developing the characters were a beautiful thing, and the temperament of the people involved --- it was honest in its own way. I also liked the own and the way it was defined; a thing rotting from the inside and supported only by tourists, giving it a feeling that does not scrub off easily. The run-down homes and the position of nature - sometimes it feels as if there is a statement involved in that and not just a set-up for things to come. The downside of the whole thing is the \\"what\\" that happens, or perhaps the briefness of the \\"what\\" that happens. You have an event that transpires, people trying to be better than the best they know how to be, and then, ummm, conclusion (?) I personally did not like that, thinking the ending was a bit rushed for my tastes. Still, I did like the book and thought it was a god read/If you are a fan of Ketchum, these are the days to pick up books that you would otherwise never see. When Hide and Seek used to look at me it looked from a place I could not reach, and that dollar monument was a scary place. Now it, as well as many of his and Edward Lee's works, are being released once more and it is fabulous. Were it not for this, I would not even be allowed an opinion on the book. If you do not know Ketchum, try out books like \\"The Lost,\\" \\"Off-Season,\\" and anything else that catches your fancy. I personally recommend Peaceable Kingdom as a starting point for the short story reader, citing \\"The Box\\" and the Stoker Award it won.So, this is reluctantly recommended, getting gold stars for some of its play and silver stars for others. Regardless, it is a good tale and nice to see back in-print."},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"Jack Ketchum, Hide and Seek (Ballantine, 1984)Eighties horror novels have a special place in my heart. They're like seventies horror films-- there was a glut of them, and most of them were awful, but awful in such a way that one can have a nostalgia for them. But, once in a while, one appeared that was far better than the general run of dreck. Hide and Seek certainly qualifies.Jack Ketchum, who'd burst onto the scene a few years earlier with the fantastic Off Season, returns to Dead River, Maine with Hide and Seek. While what you get here isn't much different than what you got in Off Season, Hide and Seek is an obvious link between Off Season and Ketchum's magnum opus, The Girl Next Door; the writing in Hide and Seek is orders of magnitude improved from that of his first novel. Ketchum went a long way towards the mastery of understated description and air of detachment that made The Girl Next Door such a terrifying experience:\\"Nothing you've told me can explain this thing to me. No rape, no seduction, no death, no guilt. You must have known. Suspected at least. Why fling your life around like a pocketful of change? It makes no sense. It never has. It must run very deep, as deep as blood and bone, much deeper than you ever knew.\\" (p. 159)Get to know Jack Ketchum; you won't regret it. While Hide and Seek doesn't have the sheer power of The Girl Next Door, it's certainly a good'un. ****"},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"In his introduction to Peaceable Kingdom, Jack Ketchum describes his writing as \\"all over the place.\\" I must confess that I agree with him. His second novel (after Off Season) goes into a different direction than his first. While Off Season is much more horrifying, gruesome, and extended terror, Hide and Seek goes into a more subtle approach than the gruesome novel (which was made into a gruesome film).As one reviewer stated, this is a novella in two acts. The first act is one of cautionary passion and love(?) between Dan, a local inhabitant of Dead River, Maine, and Casey, a wild girl who grew up in a tragic, yet well to do family. Dan is obviously bored and tired of his life in Dead River, but does not leave because he is \\"lazy\\". Casey, and her friends Steven and Kim, befriend Dan and whirl him into a frenzy of sex, shoplifting, and ditching work. Dan is more than happy to be a part of their antics, but when it comes to breaking and entering a house that is shunned by the locals, The Crouch House, he is more than a little hesitant.The Crouch House has a horrible history and this is all the more enticing for Casey, who is adventurous to the point of being reckless (due in no small part by her tragic relationship with her family). She coaxes her friends to join her in the house for a game of \\"Hide and Seak\\" (which Dan sees as \\"Breaking and Entering\\"). Dan, who has had a run in with the law and is very afraid of going to jail, reluctantly agrees.This brings us to the second, bloodier act. While it isn't as blood soaked as Off Season or Off Spring, Hide and Seek is disquieting eerie. Ketchum shows the reader that he has a talent for pacing (it took me a day to read through it and that was only because I had a lot to do that day), and creating authentic characters. However, being a huge fan of Ketchum's I always have the same complaint. His text is rife with grammatical errors and typos. Now, I'm in no way a picky person, but I think my pretention is exaggerated by being an English instructor. Nonetheless, I will say that even though the book has minor flaws, I will always pick up a Ketchum book. He has a way of cutting you, but in a good way!"},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"This is the third Ketchum book I read and I am quickly becoming a fan of his work. Hide and Seek is a story about a young, working class guy living in a small town. He becomes entangled with three rich summer kids, especially Casey a sexy temptress. The three rich kids are so bored in their lives that they take to doing stuff for thrills, stealing cars and shoplifting mostly. Eventually Casey sets her eyes on the town's local \\"haunted house\\" for the four of them to break into and play hide and seek. She gets her way and of course all hell breaks loose. This for me was Ketchum's least gory books that I read of his and a much less complex book. Although I did enjoy it I would have to say I liked Off Season (a particularily bloody book and a cult favorite) and The Girl Next Door (which is nothing less that a genius book about child abuse and absolute evil) better. But then anything you can get your hands on that is written by Ketchum is worth the time."},{"Title":"HIDE AND SEEK - SIGNED LETTERED EDITION","review":"Vintage Ketchum. Starts out innocently enough, then WHAM! This one took a little bit longer to get going than some of his other works, but just as is with everything else that he's written, once you reach &quot;that point&quot; there's no turning back! A little bit like &quot;Ketchum Light&quot;. Not as intense as &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; or as disturbing as &quot;Stranglehold&quot; or as overtly violent and disgusting as &quot;Offspring&quot;, this is still an excellent addition to your Ketchum library, and is well worth searching out and reading (it's now OP). Great early stuff from a writer who just gets better with each book!"},{"Title":"Creating the Work You Love: Courage, Commitment, and Career","review":"Far too many career planners start from the premises that &quot;your life's work&quot; equates to &quot;job,&quot; and that your &quot;strengths&quot; -- your talents, your skills, your personality traits -- are an infallible guide to which job you should choose. Jarow is one of the rare advisors (Barbara Sher is another) who takes a different approach: your &quot;life's work&quot; may not slot neatly into a job or a predefined career path; furthermore, your own intuition and self-knowledge are a more reliable guide to what you &quot;should&quot; be doing in life than conventional aptitude tests. His approach to discovering one's life path may smack of New Age eclecticism (the chakras, the Medicine Wheel). But I think he's picking up on something that other authors (e.g., Caroline Myss) have discovered: the cross-cultural similiarities between these modes of self-analysis. This implies that there's another way of knowing that our Western, linear, &quot;rational&quot; approach doesn't address, but that in matters of the heart might be a better guide to what &quot;really matters&quot; and what's &quot;right&quot; for us. If you take the time to complete his exercises thoughtfully, giving them the care and attention they deserve, you'll learn a great deal about what's truly important to you and where your life path should go. (I was talking yesterday with a middle-aged woman who recently made some major life changes. She remarked, &quot;In my career, I zigged when I should have zagged, and I've been miserable for the last 8 years!&quot;) This book will help keep you from zigging in the wrong direction -- or, if you're in the same boat as my friend, it will help you zag back to the right path."},{"Title":"Creating the Work You Love: Courage, Commitment, and Career","review":"I bought this book with scepticism. I thought it would be really tacky. I mean, career books are not exactly high literature, and one which incorporates the chakras sounded even worse than usual.So I was amazed, as I read it, to find that this book is exceedingly well written. Although Jarow is a new-ager, he has discriminating taste, considerable insight, and he's just a great writer. Just about every paragraph in the book is enjoyable to read, and presents useful information, if not a rare challenge. A previous reviewer said that this book is not that substantial. He or she certainly has a point--the book largely presents challenges and guidance for inner work. It doesn't make decisions for you, recommend practical plans of action, or tell you how to find a job. But it's written for people who relate to spiritual, immaterial, idealistic things, and it provides a demanding series of suggestions, questions, and meditations to galvanize such people into joining their inner and outer worlds. If you already relate to the world primarily in practical ways, this book would probably be worthless to you. The author does suggest, however, reading &quot;What Color Is Your Parachute&quot; (rather than plagurizing from it) and it might be a great idea to use them together.Personally, I was thrilled to find that the author seems to be talking about me nearly all the time. This paragraph phrased the dilemma well: &quot;People would tell me about their remarkable past lives as pharaohs and queens, but these same people were still working behind the counter at Macy's. What was wrong? Why was it that spiritual people seemed to be chronically nonfunctional? Why was it that not long after having some ecstatic vision or transcendant experience, I would find the same person bogged down in the same morass that they had been in before their revelation? Clearly, there was a problem&quot; (p 3). He also puts his work in a political context reministcent of the Situationists and others: &quot;From Karl Marx to Hazel Henderson, persuasive voices argue that the transformation of the workplace is a necssary prerequisite for human freedom&quot; (p 5). I would particularly recommend this book to people who would like to return to their lives as pharaohs and queens, but also to those who struggle with apathy, confusion, or disatisfaction, and can handle some new-ageisms."},{"Title":"Creating the Work You Love: Courage, Commitment, and Career","review":"Rick Jarow's book is not in any way a standard career guide. His work has some similarity to Carolyn Myss's, but it is really in a class by itself. Mr. Jarow's breadth of knowledge alone makes the book worth the read. Not only does he pepper his work with references to Weber, Nietzche and Alice Miller, but he teaches us a great deal about world religions as well. Teaching us how to learn from their wisdom and apply it to our lives is at the heart of his program. And, the book works! if you are ready to unplug from your assumptions about the direction you think your life should be taking, and start listening to your inner wisdom, you will be amazed at the results. this is not a book about career alone; it is about making sure you are on your life-path. Rick, if you are reading this: thanks!"},{"Title":"Creating the Work You Love: Courage, Commitment, and Career","review":"This book deserves far more publicity and attention. While many authors toss off New Age mumbo-jumbo, Rick has actually studied Eastern religion and has made his own pilgrimage to the East. He writes from life, experience and heart. Rick is the Real Deal.Although the book is organized around the chakras, Rick introduces many creative and insightful ideas.

This book was a fantastic guideline on reinventing your life and see it as more like a work of art. He uses the term finding an &quot;anti-career&quot; which I think is wonderful. This is not about ways in which you can make more money or other conventional career guidance. It's more about how, when you see your life as a work of art and pursue that truth within yourself then whatever career path lies ahead of you, you will be supported by whatever it is you need. And to finish, here's a quote from Rick on what exactly is an &quot;anti-career&quot; &quot;is for those who believe that it is still possible to live and act from the most authentic part of ourselves, and to express our strongest values, energies, and talents through our work in the world.&quot;I have used an anti-career counselor in Seattle and it too helped change my life.

Mixing the need to find one's work as part of life, with philosophy in general, and Chakras (energy centers within the human body) in particular is the mark of true abundance (read on).As every one is part of the same inifinite Self, one must have some strengths hidden. This strength or abundance, as Rick puts it, makes one feel most secure and at peace. One's work should be a result of this abundance. Creating a career based on one's wants and needs comes out of scarcity and hence is fundamentally a insecure and ever-debilitating reason. Due to one's such abundance, one's energy naturally aligns with such a cause and leads to most satisfaction.Each of the seven main chakras in a human body is a seat for some pyschological aspect. The author explains how to tap into these centers to identify one's purpose, and hence one's work in life. Many excercise, including meditation techniques provide such an opportunity. The idea that one's work is (also) an extension of one's lineage i.e., arising out of what his/her ancestors were doing provides a deep reason to reflect on. Writing about a parent's work/life is one such excercise that provides insights as to one's cause.Reading such a book in one-go is not an option at all. Rick himself suggests some of the excercise are open-ended as far as time is concerned. But, am I glad to have found such a book! This book drove unto me the concept of work as a life and not as a career much better than any other so far. It is a must read for anyone wanting to decide what his/her career should be."},{"Title":"Creating the Work You Love: Courage, Commitment, and Career","review":"I am very skepticle about \\"Self Help Books\\".

Rick is truly insightful and has a way of helping you to realize that life is short and that you have one chance at it, so find what makes you happy.

We use exercises and meditations in the book, but the core content unfolds as a result of the experiences of the 5 to 7 people who choose to meet.

Jarow is the perfect antidote. He's not unrealistic (at one point, he asks, \\"...but what if the money does not follow in pace with your real needs?\\") but he also doesn't advocate taking those endless personality tests that attempt to fit you into someone else's niche.He uses the chakras as a model for talking about the subject, so you do have to be open to some basic new-agey stuff, but he's talking about very solid inner work on deeper issues, such as your past, your family issues, and your basic trust in life.A great book to engage with, particularly if your calling is a little unusual or difficult."},{"Title":"Creating the Work You Love: Courage, Commitment, and Career","review":"I met Rick Jarow at a workshop he was conducting - same basic premise - creating the work you love.

Aleksey Makimovich Peshkov was born on 16th March 1868 in Russia at a place called Novgorod Nizhny. This place was latest renamed in his honor to Gorky.His father worked as a shipping agent at Astrakhan, but died when Gorky was just five years old. After that Gorky lived with his grandparents (maternal) who were very poor and used to be offensive with the little child. When Gorky was eight, his grandpa dropped him from school and put him to work. He was so inclined towards studies that he started learning from a fellow cook at work. Next few years were quite stressful for him and therefore at the age of 12, he ran away from his grandparent's house.He worked at various places doing different jobs. During this period he chose a new name for himself as Maxim Gorky which means \\"The Bitter One\\" in Russian. At 21, he attempted an unsuccessful suicide which ultimately developed tuberculosis and damaged his lungs badly. Next few years he moved frequently from place to place and during this course of journey he go familiar with the lowest class of society comprising of prostitutes, thieves and similar characters. At 24 he got associated with several revolutionaries and emerged as an outspoken personality thereby getting popular in public very fast. He went to jail several times during this period and got few of his stories published in local newspapers mainly based on his experiences gained over these struggling years.Later he joined with Marxists to fight against Tsars of Russia. His major earnings became a source of funds for Marxists. He spent his last phase of life from 1922 to 1930 in Italy. In 1930 he returned to Russia and was greeted overwhelmingly. He died on 14th June 1936 at the age of 68. There is some controversy regarding his death, some say he died of illness while others say that he was ordered to death by Stalin My views about the Book titled - THE LOWER DEPTHS This was Gorky's second play which he wrote in 1902 after the first one which was titled as \\"The Smug Citizen\\" which became very controversial at that period because of its content and outspoken nature of Gorky.The 'Lower Depths' was very successful and was produced at Moscow Art Theatre in the same year. The play is about some powerful characters based on his encounters over the years with various types of people he had known. It was a protest against the inhumanity in particular.This is a play in four acts having no solid plot but a series of sequences framed together. More emphasis is on characters, their thoughts and motives and how they act under certain circumstances. He made certain things in the play happen suddenly or shockingly. In first act the characters themselves narrate their past. Kostoloff is one of the characters who get murdered later. Pepel, Satine and Luka are other characters of the play. Ultimately the theme of the play is - All men live for \\"better\\" man everywhere in life and keep on working till they themselves become better men.This is a continuous cycle and at any time Men will be working for Better Man. Many of them die during the course of serving before reaching at the stage of becoming better man. Luka is one of the brightest character of the play different from all other characters. Endlessly optimistic he is and very much eager to talk always to everyone. He keep on questioning everyone and himself about the purpose of life, meaning of life.This too much probing nature of his causes his failures in life. Saaransh In real life if we see, everything is true what this play tries to tell. We all keep on working for \\"better man\\" and one day when we become \\"better man\\", all men start working under usThe language and characters? The language is pretty cool. All non-English writers' style is different than the English writers. You read any book of Gorky and you will find the language very simple, full of continuity and descriptive sort. You can compare the writing style of Gorky with MKGandhi. Regarding characters, well, I think, I have written enough there in my review already. When I kept the book aside, what were the questions or thoughts that occupied my mind? After I read the book, and kept it aside, it stayed shuffling inside me for 3 days.It kept me striking the questions like \\"meaning and purpose of life\\", \\"if there is God, where and what form? And what does he expects from us?\\" etc. etc. And one more thing that strikes is the style of Gorky as usual, he writes so simple and perfect that each character and each incidence get absorbed so well inside you and not momentarily but forever. But all his books (or for sake any books) should be read in silence so that you listen to them well. And most importantly, what should you (even if oblivious to this writer and his works) expect from this book? You are unaware of this writer or his books, no worry. If you expect sincere writing, truth, an encounter with real life, real sort of characters, real incidences, simple English and above all if you seek certain answers to Life's happenings, do read his all books.[...]"},{"Title":"Breads of the World (Illustrated Encyclopedia)","review":"I am NOT much of a cook, but I try sometimes to cook for me or a girl I'm dating at the time...

He kind of just needs to move things along and make his point, then he could be free to speak as much as he would like on all the other stuff. Even Friere himself admitted much later on, that some of his stuff was inaccessible. it must be hard to love all the great philosophers and not aspire to write the same kind of neurotic diatribe.

It relies heavily on the inability of the men in the novel to communicate. If the heroine's husband had simply told her he was trying to straighten out his crazy sister's accounting she wouldn't assume he is having an affair.*Spoiler Alert---don't read further if you don't want specifics.*I also find it odd that when Olivia's husband realizes someone is trying to kill her, he immediately goes out of town, leaving her alone. He doesn't even acknowledge that he believes Olivia, making her assume she is on her own. This book takes the \\"romance\\" out of \\"Victorian romance\\".When Olivia's husband practically kidnaps her, the reader assumes he has a nefarious purpose. The reader later finds that he is simply removing her from danger, but since he shows her no affection whatsoever it's hard to swallow. They allegedly live happily ever after, but I find it unrealistic that a marriage could survive such a lack of communication or affection."},{"Title":"Legacy of the wolf","review":"Enjoyable romance told in a first-person mode, reminded me of a Lady Chatterly type voice.Cover blurb: \\"A SUDDEN AND MOST DANGEROUS LOVE.

The bottom line is that people use the \\"polite\\" guilt some of us feel or were raised with when we don't tell them yes to get their way. The book explains that guilt away. I personally practice the three methods every time I can, and I have been slowly getting better. I can say no easily, but the tricky part is to do it in a way that isn't rude or dismissive. One time a guy who sits next to me in class was talking across me to another the guy on the other side of me. I was slowly getting mad and I wanted to say something. I let it happen and I missed what the teacher was saying. So, when the guy complained about not knowing what was going on, I very bitchily told him that maybe if he wasn't talking he would know. But, I didn't apologize to him. The guy was a good sport and we're friends now, but that was me trying to use what the book taught me about being assertive. There have been several other times, too. I think each time I get smoother and smoother. I got a salesclerk to give my friend a substitute free gift after he told her they didn't have the one she was supposed to get. She thanked me. When I went in to pay for a parking ticket and the cashier told me, \\"We aren't making people pay for the tickets for parking the wrong direction on the road, and since this is your first time I will take care of this for you,\\" I didn't give him my old \\"I'm sooooo grateful\\" face and thank him a million times. I unemotionally thanked him for his help and walked away. I didn't apologize to him. He was just doing his job.

I am 30 and i wish i read this in high school."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"WHEN I SAY NO, I FEEL GUILTY by Dr. Manuel J. Smith (subtitled HOW TO COPE- USING THE SKILLS OF SYSTEMATIC ASSERTIVE THERAPY, 1975, 322 pages, Bantam books, 1st ed.) is an awesome human communications bible. That's right, I said \\"bible\\", and a beautifully laid out, though slightly wordy, bible at that. It's also a bit dated but then I do have an original 1975 copy.This book I believe is the 1985 edition.In 1969, Dr. Smith was a field assessment officer with the Peace Corps. His job was to train the volunteers to go amongst the natives, wherever, and communicate well with them. When they all did a simple exercise together, Dr. Smith realized to his horror that the volunteers couldn't begin to cope. Not one of them could even begin communicating normally, and not one of the big-wig experts knew how to deal with it. The trainees could not communicate on a personal, one-to-one level when they were questioned or challenged, which the trainers knew would happen to them as soon as they made contact with natives wherever they went.This was a terrible conflict avoidance that seemed out of hand. Smith next observed the exact same behavior in a mental patient he was treating. Suddenly he hit upon the answer: Smith needed to find a therapy that trained unassertive people to be calmly, positively assertive, to be confident and non-defensive. So he invented the SYSTEMATIC ASSERTIVE THERAPY, which this book is. Sometimes I laughingly ask myself if Cesar Millan, the \\"Dog Whisperer\\", has studied this book!Smith explains expertly how we have become the rotten-communicating species we are today, then smoothly moves into an explanation of the problem and THE solution. What is THE solution? It is called \\"Broken Record\\". Smith outlines the start-off exercise he uses once he has shown his pupils how to be calmly assertive. He reminds us that we do not have to answer to anyone or let anyone dictate how we will behave.He then does the broken record exercise, in which the speaker deflects the interlocutor by literally repeating what he wants and only what he wants. No matter what is asked, said or demanded, the learner simply acts like a broken record player and repeats, repeats, repeats. It is amazing how people fail at this the first time. Well, Smith says, we were trained that we MUST answer someone after all! Well, Smith says, we don't have to answer to anyone.This is not the bully response as you might think. Get this book and study it. If you ever had trouble communicating with anyone, parents, kids, anyone, this book will help you. Smith outlines our \\"assertive rights\\" - such as the right to be in charge of what we say and do - he explains how people manipulate us, how to cope with criticism, and even ends by challenging his own therapy system. While dated and a bit funny, the book is bloody brilliant.I love the two true stories he tells of people he has trained. One is about an elderly lady who is afraid to face her nasty doctor and demand a new method of treatment. The other story I just love is about a young man who must charge back into a grocery store after they forgot to include his substantial meat order with the rest of his purchases. In his case, it is quite hilarious the way the clerk and floor manager try to con him, belittle him, push him out the way - and never once does he stop repeating, \\"I want my meat.\\"It is inspiring, and could change the world. Learning that we are not and cannot be perfect, therefore accepting positive criticism, shoving aside manipulation attempts, repeating what we want, admitting we do not know or do not understand certain things, most of all learning compromise - that is what Smith is all about and I love it. Even if you are shy and have trouble talking to anyone at all, this is the book for you.If only I could study and practice what this book teaches as much as I'd like. I can tell you this: it has helped me to change some parts of my life that I couldn't stand. It helped me manage what I used to believe was uncontrollable. It even taught me to talk better with my parents, many many decades ago.It will change you too, if you allow it and learn it properly."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"We middle aged wives were taught to help others and not say no even if it is to our detriment. this book taught me how to say no when i did not want to do something in a gracious way rather than saying o.k. and resenting it"},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"The methods described in this book are organized to help the learner progress from the simple to complex.

One reason I only gave it three stars is while the author says the techniques in this book won't always get you your way, he never gives any examples with the dialogues where the person being assertive does not get their way. This kind of makes the dialogues a little unrealistic.Another reason I gave the book three stars is there were a ton of grammatical errors in the book (like missed periods and misspelled words). I don't know if it is the editing or an error in the kindle book (which is the version I have) but this makes the book hard to read in some parts. One example is in chapter 9 the author writes \\"After she extinguished my critical enthusiasm, she asked the audience with a devilish glint in her eye if they would like to take up where I had pooped out She got no takers.\\" Again I don't know if this is in the print book or if its just an error with the kindle version (which I hope it is).Still, I would recommend this book because it gives great information on being more assertive."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"I have been struggling with this for years, and though this is a very common-sense idea, this book states how to deal with the guilt and find inner peace in a manner that can help anyone accepts and take the next steps to acting."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago and its message is still relevant today....maybe more so than ever.

Unfortunatley though, the book condemns more conventional psychotherapy which I believe unfairly biases novice psychology readers against a potentially helpful tool."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"This is THE book on how to get along with other people in individualistic cultures.There are people who will tell you that assertiveness does not work. They are wrong. It works. When it doesn't work, you either arn't doing it the right way, are asserting rights that you don't have, or are being beaten down by raw power. If you want more on why this is so, READ THE BOOK.There are people who will tell you that assertiveness is wrong.To this it must be asked \\"Who decides what is evil and what is not?\\" In an individualist society - it is up to the individual to decide for himself what is right and wrong. One is free in this society to argue about moral issues. However, the only one able to AUTHORITATIVELY say what is right and what is wrong is the individual. His judgement applies to him and him alone. The author of this book calls that \\"being one's own judge.\\". If you want to hear more about this...READ THE BOOK.As a Christian, I would not say \\"Be your own judge\\" but rather \\"Choose your own God\\" - but it AMOUNTS TO THE SAME THING. Remember, Joshua - a leader of Israel at war, said \\"Choose to this day who you serve. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\\" He said this as Israel was going into battle. For the moment, Israel was united in its belief in the one true God. It was under a great deal of stress. Yet even in this circumstance he gave people a choice of who to accept as an ultimate judge over their life. Even the ONE TRUE GOD will not judge you directly unless you allow him to - at least, not until judgement day. Who are we, then, to judge others or let others judge us? Want to learn more about that... READ THE BIBLE.If you don't want to judge others...READ THIS BOOK. It will tell you what judging truly is and isn't.If you don't want others to judge you....READ THIS BOOK. People who habitually judge others are surprisingly weak. Thanks to this book - my main problem in dealing with them now is not winning but in winning without hurting them unnecessarily.

You'll find yourself comfortably using some techniques well before you even finish the book.This book impressed me when I first read it 25 years ago. And it has stood the test of time: I felt amazed at how much more useful the techniques seemed when I reread it recently.A couple of points deserve emphasis:1. In addition to teaching you how to say &quot;no&quot; without feeling guilty, the author masterfully teaches you simple, powerful techniques for keeping your cool while you're under attack.2. This book plays an important role in the set of cognitive, emotive, and behavioral skills taught by psychologists such as Albert Ellis and David Burns. While books such as &quot;A New Guide to Rational Living&quot; (Ellis) and &quot;The Feeling Good Handbook&quot; (Burns) contain tools that address a far wider range of problems, Smith's methods work far more rapidly, easily, and consistently for the challenges that this book addresses.I strongly recommend this book for anyone wanting to quickly and easily learn to (i) say &quot;no&quot; without feeling guilty and/or (ii) react coolly to attacks by others."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"I am a psychologist working in a college counseling center, and this is the number one book on assertiveness that I recommend to my clients. Dr. Smith begins by describing &quot;Your 10 Assertive Rights,&quot; a reminder that we all have a right do such human things as say &quot;I don't know&quot; and change our minds. He then introduces various assertiveness strategies one by one, starting with the very basic skill of persistence (AKA the &quot;broken record&quot; technique). For each strategy, Dr. Smith presents a short dialogue vignette to help you better understand how to apply that technique to real life. Once he has thoroughly taught all of the individual techniques, Dr. Smith puts them all together and addresses assertiveness in different types of situations--ie, with your family members versus with your boss.

This book taught me how to stand up for myself and stop trying to solve everyone else's problems (the store's agreement with a manufacturer or distributor)and focus on getting what I have paid for. I am smiling as I write this because I have just returned from a trip to a major toy retailer whose store manager refused to take back a defective stroller &quot;because you don't have the box.&quot; Needless to say, after using Dr. Smith's methods, the manager gave me full credit on my credit card within fifteen minutes.

There are a lot of books that are all hype and wind up not being as helpful as they seemed originally. This book is definitely an exception. It will effectively teach you how to cope with criticism, deal with manipulative people, and be more persistent in every day interactions so you can really get across what you want.You should keep in mind that the goal here is not getting your way. The goal is to effectively communicate your needs directly. Some of the techniques are a bit harsh, and while they may work well on salespeople and customer service, you should not directly apply those to your spouse. But the book does have a section on coping with manipulation from a close relative, and how you need to soften your technique a bit, because so many more feelings are involved. Not only does the book teach you assertiveness, but it gives you the skills needed to help others become more assertive so they don't manipulate you as easily and as often as they would normally. This is particularly helpful with close relationships (siblings, spouse, parents, etc.).If you feel you're being walked on or your needs aren't being met by the people around you, you need this book.

The title may or may not apply to you, but nevertheless, the insights contained within can be valuable and practical to just about anyone.This book explains assertiveness and manipulation in opposition of each other. It explains manipulation as the act of indirectly asking for what you want by making others feel guilty. And it explains assertiveness as the act of firmly asking for what you want without feeling guilty and without making others feel guilty.It gives examples of transcripts throughout the book.

When my spouse gets angry over something legitimate (i.e. not putting the kids to bed on time), instead of my reacting with defensiveness and the 2 of use shortly thereafter screaming at each other, now we are learning to respond calmly and work thru the issue. All because of what we learned in this book! Yes, it takes practice and yes, both partners really should read it. But it does work. Instead of yelling back \\"How dare you criticize my parenting!\\" we can listen to the other person and work thru the issue.This book is an awesome, overlooked gem. I highly recommend it for *anyone* who has never learned how to fight without yelling or shutting down!!!"},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"This book goes far beyond theoretical principles on how to be more assertive. It gives numerous sample dialogues which reflect everyday situations. One practical method is the use of fogging. You implicitly agree with the critic in order to simultaneously deflect the criticism without resorting to hostility. In this book, you learn how to be assertive in relatively impersonal situations (such as dealing with a persistent salesman) as well as closer ones (such as negotiating with an employer, or conversing with a dissatisfied spouse).

I wondered whether this book would one day come to my rescue, and it certainly did. Here's my story on the first time I put this book into practice. One day I started receiving telephone calls from someone (a female) who kept telling me that I was \\"too old for him\\" (?), that \\"my hair was too long for my age\\", and that \\"I should lose all hope\\". I thought the woman was either totally nuts or had called the wrong number. However, she kept calling my home every day and very late at night, sometimes even at 1 or 2AM, and that was much more than I could take. Who was she? Who was she talking about? Who was too young for me? Mistery. All I knew was the woman wanted to make me feel badly and that was enough for me, so I decided not to let her get away with it. Next time the woman called, I was determined to go with whatever she said. When she called again, she started using the same silly phrases. \\"He is too young for you\\". Though I had no clue who or what she was talking about, I simply answered her: \\"Oh, yes, but those are the ones that I like, usually twenty years younger or more\\". She obviously did not expect this type of response. She gulped, but insisted and went on: \\"And your hair is too long for your age\\", to which I answered: \\"My dear, the reason my hair is so long is we don't have a penny; I am starving, I can't afford to buy a pair of scissors, much less can I afford to go to the hair salon\\". The woman went silent. She stayed on the line but could say nothing. Not a word. I bet she must have tried to find something else to say, but simply could not. She never called again and I never had to wake up to answer the phone at 1 AM. Several months later, just by chance, I found out who she was. The misterious caller was a woman who had just broken up with her boyfriend, who was a very good tennis teacher with whom I had been taking tennis classes for over four years. Sometimes my teacher and I would have a cup of tea or a soda at the club after class, and this silly girl, who used to work at the club and grossly misinterpreted my friendly relationship with her ex boyfriend, had managed to get my name, address and phone number from the club records.Now, after so many years, I am buying the book again for my Kindle."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"This book has no fluff. It is packed with great information that will help you become more assertive. I highly recommend this book. It is worth every penny. As you can see, I am a verified buyer and not a friend of the author. If you look at my other reviews you will see I have no problem blasting authors that shouldn't be wasting our time with crap. Some of the situations in this book are dated but don't let that stop you. Get it."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"You dont have to turn into a B... with this book but if you are tired of being a dormat then you will find this helpful. The assertive rights section is very helpful, and the assertive skills are comprehensive, and the practice dialogues demontrate the techniques in a step-by-step way so that the learner can master them one at a time. The trick is remembering the guidelines and applying these skills in everyday life improves frank and direct communication, and may require others to adjust to your new-found emotional bliss. Let them. The methods described in this book are organized to help the learner progress from the simple to complex. You can pick and choose what best applies to you."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"I read this book many years ago when I was a young adult trying to cope with assertiveness issues. I was one of those people who didn't know how to say \\"no\\"; as a result, I wasn't in control of my life. I wanted to be in control; I just didn't know how to do it.Then I came across this wonderful book by Manuel J Smith, with its pragmatic advice; that we all have \\"assertive rights\\" to do what we want to do, with no apologies (excluding malicious or illegal behavior). How does it work?Example: \\"Do you want to go to Aunt Mildred's tea party?\\" - \\"No thanks!\\"Wasn't that easy? Buy this book; read it and heed it. You'll be in control of your life; doing what you want to do, guilt free."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"I have ADHD, and have a hard time reading an entire book, so I found the table of contents, with its clear description of each chapter's content extremely helpful in choosing what I needed to read first.I really liked that the book contained a \\"bill of assertive rights.\\" After I read them, I gradually began to believe that I deserved to be happy and deserved to take care of myself even when it inconveniences people I care about. Internalizing these rights helped me to say no, without guilt and without breaking into tears and caving in, for the very first time to the most recent of uncountably many of my parents' unreasonable requests.As a young adult entering graduate school, who is not married, who has only ever worked part-time in food service and retail to build savings and pay for minor expenses, and who has not yet dealt with many common adult issues concerning money, I didn't relate to many of the example dialogues, which cited assertive techniques explained in the longer chapters I couldn't bring myself to read. Still, I am going to keep the book and refer to it when I have more responsibility for my expenses and am actually required to deal with unreasonable expectations at work, annoying people I don't want to talk to (I feel responsible sometimes to listen to these people even in uncomfortable situations, which once led to the person stalking me) or, when I am a professor, manipulative students who make a habit of asking for extensions.So, if you need help in asserting yourself with a manipulative domestic partner, an employer, an employee, in important job interviews, or are unfulfilled in your sex life, the interviews in this book may be helpful to you.I, on the other hand, plan to try and find another book with information tailored to younger people."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"This book was a real eye opener. A better title might have been \\"how to get what you want\\", because it is less about saying 'no', and more about being able to take control of your life, and give you skills to stop others from being able to manipulate you.Instead of fight or flight coping, the author introduces a 3rd option, talking assertively. And then he gives great examples using dialogues that show the exact words for many situations. I found the dialogues helpful, and the only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is that it is a bit academic in places. By skipping the filler/theory, and jumping right to the dialogues, you would gain all the benefit and save a lot of time.This has helped me start to see many frustrations in my life were caused by not knowing how to assertively state what I wanted, so I would resort to fight (anger, frustration) or then flight if fight escalated too much. By being able to see examples of how to assertively state 'this is what I want', I feel this book has helped me discover a new way forward.I'm looking forward to reading the book a second time, because although there are only a few techniques to learn (BROKEN RECORD, NEGATIVE ASSERTION, NEGATIVE INQUIRY, etc), really seeing how to use them is more than I can fully absorb and put into practice in my life in a single pass."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"My favorite book on how to be assertive without being obnoxious.

I first read it in the 1970s when going through some relationship difficulties. It certainly assisted me during those most tough times. Since then, the things I have learned in that book have assisted me again and again through various life situations that have come and gone. I am homeschooling my eighth-grade son now, and have purchased the book again. The role-playing and basic advice that come with this book are superlative, and in class he and I find it a great vehicle for learning to adopt an assertive approach to general living as well as dealing with specific situations that crop up from time to time.

For details as to the content, you can search inside this book and look at the table of contents on Amazon's web site. This author's writing is clear, the chapters are well-organized, and the examples he gives are realistic. Best of all, he made me laugh frequently about a subject that usually causes anxiety for me. His style of humor reminds me of Dave Barry. It's not a book about controlling other people; it simply helps clarify how to avoid the numerous ways that people, even well-meaning people, talk us into doing what they want rather than what we want. Another very good book on this subject is \\"The Assertiveness Workbook\\" by Randy J. Paterson, Ph.D., and I would recommend purchasing both.

I checked it out on Amazon to see if it is still in print because I recently mentioned it to a friend. I'm glad to see it is still around. The great thing about this book is that it is behaviorally oriented. It doesn't simply explain why you should not feel guilty, but rather it teaches concrete techniques which if practiced will allow you to assert yourself effectively.

In fact I am not sure they had a solution. I started to read this book a few years ago and couldn't imagine that you do not have to give a reason or excuse for returning merchandise.

Since it was first published in 1975 I have given away several of these books and gotten as many \\"thank yous.\\" I still use the techniques and 35 years later they still work.The book was shipped quicker than promised, and was exactly as it was described.

I just bought it for a friend who hates saying yes when she means no. I read this book too long ago to admit, and it helped change me from a doormat to a more assertive person (without being uncivil). Some of the techniques require a lot of adaption in real life. The elaborate scripts are more for illustration than practicality, as whoever you are speaking too is not likely to follow along. Not to mention people who may want to deck you instead of talking. But the concepts are absolutely workable. I always tried to think of it as training a stubborn cat or spoiled child (either me or the other party, as appropriate).

It wasn't that I thought it wouldn't be useful, but rather that it would just repeat a lot of the mistakes of other types of advice books I've read on this topic in the past:1. being overly simplistic by either being really vague and New-Agey or just common sense.2. being overly complicated with psychoanalytic concepts and lots of jargon.I was surprised to see it had the best of both worlds. It was straightforward and accessible, but not simplistic. And it was very psychologically sound and obviously written by a qualified mental health professional, but without being jargon-filled or complicated.Best of all, it has a lot of practical techniques one can immediately put into practice.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"Take a trip back to the 1970s, when leisure suits, long sideburns and \\"assertiveness training\\" were all the rage.

Some of his advice still feels relevant, particularly when he urges you to beware of those who try to impose their standards of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" to manipulate you. Smith lists your 10 \\"assertive rights,\\" the most important being the right to be the ultimate judge of your own behavior. He details several verbal techniques you can use to block manipulation, and encourage productive communication and negotiation.

I have lost my orginal well worn copy and will be getting a new one. It has been passed around to friends who wanted to know what I did to make my life so much better."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"I haven't checked the date when this book first came out, but I know it was over 25 years ago. And yet, it is still up to date and just as helpful as when I read it the first time.Dr. Manuel Smith approaches assertiveness in a behavioral way, basing it on the Assertive Bill of Rights -- what each person can claim as his/her internal rights. He lists ten of these. Then he lists seven verbal techniques we can use to interact effectively with other people -- with special emphasis on dealing with people who try to get us to do things we don't want to do or to quit doing things we like to do.This is not a book about controlling other people -- it's about self control. If we read it carefully and thoroughly process what it says, we also find that it has nothing to do with agression. It also doesn't \\"guarantee\\" that we'll always get what we want, but it does emphasize that we can often better the odds of either getting what we want or working out a compromise. And Dr. Smith points out that using the assertive verbal techniques in a sarcastic way is counter productive.I was pleasantly surprised to find that it also helps deal with potential nasty social situations -- having your clothing, lifestyle or other personal matters insulted at parties (they're supposed to be FUN?)or other gatherings. As a somewhat sensitive person, I wish I could have read this book as a teenager.But, it's never too late!"},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"&quot;When I Say No, I Feel Guilty&quot;, by Manuel J. Smith, Ph.D.offers many practical hints in developing your assertive skillswith friends, family, and business associates. In the broadsense, this how-to will be particularly useful to those whofind it hard to stand up in the face of conflict; however,some of these techniques (&quot;fogging&quot; and &quot;broken record&quot;, forinstance) will not win you congeniality points. What they WILLprovide, though, are usable, self-affirming tactics withwhich you can effectively deflect covert manipulation by others andkeep your defensive emotional responses in check.Although reading this book will not give most readers the assertive confidenceand technique-rehearsal that attending Dr. Smith's Systematic Assertiveness workshops wouldprovide, it is still an excellent launch-pad for those of uswho are ready to take charge of our own lives."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"As the first book that I read pertaining to \\"assertive training\\", it will hold a special place in my heart.In the instance I give it an extra star. In reality it should really be a \\"two star book\\".Overview:This book is overly-agressive, and does not give the reader a sense of \\"fair play\\" for the other human being you are speaking to. I took this book with such a zealous lust that it ended causing me more anxiety as a result of some of the misguided information. The information is useful, however it only gives a small window of scenarios to use them. The first being asking another person to do something for you which in the book is commonly a \\"refund\\" which requires the books approach. And the second is saying no to a request that you don't want.In both these scenarios, there was no room for a compromise, as the author sets out to either \\"get that refund that you deserve\\" or \\"say no without giving any sort of excuse\\", which could be seen as manipulation. I see some serious flaws within these strategies.Firstly, they are too agressive.Secondly, they don;t allow for compromise for the final result.Thirdly, you are discouraged from giving any reasons for your decision.Fourthly, these techniques require massive amounts of balls.For the first situation, the techniques are too agressive in terms of the wording used. It would be helpful to also know what intonation, pacing and voice pitch should be used. Simply repeating the same message word for word very bluntly is too agressive, most normal humans don't react kindly to this treatment. Saying no can work in some situations, yes you can use it on the salesman on the sidewalk trying to sell you something. Or you can say nothing and keep walking. However, far more tact and diplomacy is required for any other situation where you are likely to see that same person again, and you want to build some form of relationship with that person.Also, in regard to the multiple refund situations, a person must be open to the possibility that another person simply won't give you what you want unless you are willing to go through so much effort, work and pain to get that, when you can look to settle for an honourable compromise. I have had plenty of situations where I followed the advice of the book and kept going for the outcome I wanted eg: \\"a refund\\", without the intention of settling for a compromise. Sometimes not being open for a compromise can be detrimental for negotiations. Just hammering away at your opponent with broken record will sometimes solidify their stance and make them more resistant to your bullying.Thirdly, giving either valid or invalid reasos for saying no to requests takes alot of the sting out the interaction for both parties involved. It is a common thing for humans to do, and at least for me, I dont find giving them, or recieving them. Its just what humans do. Yes, in some situations you may not want to blab heaps of explanations for why you were late, you may just say you were late and leave it at that. However, sometimes its nice to let someone know reasons, especially people you care for like girlfriends, family and friends.Fourthly, I found that some of the scenarios would require a high level of social freedom, courage and internal locus of control, things that alot of people on the non-assertive scale lack. This isn't that kind of book that I needed when I first became aware of assertive training.These are high level techniques for people that are already probably asserive anyway, and then giving them a framework for interaction, that is too one-dimensional, uncompromising and unrealistic.Some of these technques can be used, although the context needs to be looked at."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"I purchased this book in order to learn to quickly recognize criticism and manipulation. I was always getting very defensive or extremely angry at criticism. It was my hope to learn how to not allow the biting words of others affect me so greatly. I was always devastated when someone disapproved of me. It was always important to me that everyone's opinion of me had to agree with mine, or I had to convince them of my opinion.While reading this book, I discovered that I was not always the one being criticised and manipulated. MY EXTREME DESIRED TO BE APPROVED OF MADE ME A CRITICISER AND MANIPULATOR ALSO. This huge character flaw of mine could explain why I have not been able to have a successful love relationship.

I had a mixed response to it.Pros: I think the information is very helpful for people who find themselves unable to respond effectively to criticism, guilt trips imposed by others, and manipulation by others. Seeing the 10 Assertive Rights in print is liberating. I am frequently caught off guard by how to respond to others' attempted manipulation. Even though I intuitively know I don't have to provide an explanation as to why I can't do something or don't want to go somewhere, I used to always provide one, out of guilt or to make my \\"no\\" more acceptable. Now I just say, nicely, that I can't or don't want to, and leave it at that. There's much more of value in this book than that, but it's a good example.Cons: It is oddly out of date and uses stereotypes like a \\"Yiddishe mother,\\" several times. I didn't like or expect the number of sexual examples. I'm not a prude but I didn't expect a sample discussion of a couples' sexual problems in a book with this title. It just didn't fit, and seemed unnecessary to me. Surely there were better, more general examples that could have been used. I found the sexual references off putting because they were so unexpected and out of place.So there's definitely value here, but pick and choose what you want to take away.

Finally I cracked it open because I am suddenly bombarded with family related manipulation, that I now realise has been going on for a very long time. So, it has really calmed me down, as I was beginning to consider yet another argument of the countless that I have initiated over the years and they work marginally, but to a great cost...myself and my own energy. With the help of this book, I see now that it really is a matter of persistence with some of the most manipulative and controlling people in our lives, and have already begun using BROKEN RECORD repeatedly with success. I haven't lashed out yet, and got my message across...only time will tell if it sticks. I'm beginning to think that maybe some relationships are so damaged it's not worth trying to keep them...family relationships that is. If they refuse to get the message, there's nothing anyone can do and if they continue to overstep the mark, just forget about them all together. I wonder, how long one has to keep persisting before finally deciding to throw in the towel? I suspect though that with the help of this book, I'll finally be able to see the wood for the trees and, instead of the usual reactive actions, I'll keep my cool, feel stronger to move in that direction if that is what is required for myself.

Since we try to manipulate others also, the third step is knowing how to influence our world without manipulating others.Very enjoyable empowering my life through reading this book."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"Its was middle of the road book for me, if somebody had some real assertive issues then I fully recommended it - not that I didn't learn something - the section on persistence and the section reading between the lines or the dropping of information."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"My book arrived within the time period as stated and was exactly in the shape that I expected."},{"Title":"When I Say No I Feel Guilty","review":"The book was delivered in a timely manner.

I especially enjoy the text that goes with each sketch, bringing us closer to each character and painting. The artwork itself is very good. I enjoyed the rough sketches along with the finished artwork. I truly feel that this book is worth the money, not a page is wasted... excellent book!"},{"Title":"Subversive Beauty","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend, because he is a big fan of Royo. I knew the man made lovely art, but this book truly displayed how breathtaking and intricate his artwork was.The book is a nice hardback, with nice matte, sturdy pages full of voluptuous, ethereal women. The quality of the art prints are vibrant, focused and intricate, plus there is a little story of the character provided with most pieces on a parallel page. The book is well comprised and layout!It's all pretty big x by x wise, but not too thick. Nevertheless, it has a bit of substance, and worth more than what you pay. I was very satisfied and my boyfriend enjoys it.Beautiful."},{"Title":"Subversive Beauty","review":"Breathtaking. The single word that comes to mind when anyone thinks of Luis Royo and his works. I had this feeling full in heart when I finally and gleefully opened the cover to this, his newest collection, Subversive Beauty. But no amount of mental or emotional preperation could ready me for what lay in store as the first page followed. Like a fine wine, Luis Royo's style gets better with every passing moment. The art is higher than top-notch as he deftly transposes a dark, post-apocalyptic, tribal imagery over the grace and beauty of the female form. Tattooed but not gawdy, pierced but not subtracting from their inherent and skilfully detailed features, the softer gender is treated like royalty in this book by the otherworldly talents of this master artist. If you like fantasy artwork with a dark side BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"},{"Title":"Subversive Beauty","review":"Definitely one of Royo's best collections.

I'm a fan of tattoos, so this edition is my favourite amongst his other works. Gorgeous females with fabulous bodies are of course the norm. In my opinion, this ranks among his 3 best works (Secrets, Sub. Beauty, and Malefic)."},{"Title":"Subversive Beauty","review":"WOW! I purchased this volume with some minor level of trepidation, fearing I might have ended up wasting money on cheap illustrated pornography. The cover art was nice, certainly, but it is common to purchase an art book only to find that the cover art was the only really decent piece in the whole book. Mr. Royo's art was recommended to me by some people whose opinions I respect, however, so I took the dive.And am I ever glad I did.Royo is a master of portraying the female form, and he knows what aspects of his subjects to emphasize. While most of the women in this are pretty scantily-clad, there is very little outright nudity. And when it is present, our attention isn't drawn to it. The women, as whole creatures, are incredibly sexy. I press this because I hate it when an artist ruins good art with a dehumanizing emphasis on T&A.;His images are high-quality and truly a marvel to behold. The attention to detail is amazing. This isn't mere cheesecake. This is great art which can be enjoyed by anyone of either gender who looks for quality.The theme seems to be Dark Fantasy with just a dash of cyberpunk, and it really works well here. The variety of costumes and situations is impressive. There is very little variety in the backgrounds used, but this is forgivable, given both his choice of theme and his focus on his subjects.One thing I really like is how most of his pieces are accompanied on the opposite page by a short story putting the image into context. There is a lot of imagination here, and the text really adds an extra dimension to the art. Thankfully, as this is an art book, he is careful to never make the text too long or involved.I highly recommend this book, and will be checking out the rest of this author's work in the future."},{"Title":"Abortion's Second Victim.,","review":"Emotional healing for women torn apart by the aftermath of abortion. She may be a relative or a friend, a neighbor or a co-worker. She may be you. She's a woman who has made the choice to abort her unborn child. Since over one fourth of the women of child-bearing age in America have had one or more abortions, you probably know one of abortion's Second Victims. In this book you will travel the devastating road of abortion with someone who tells of the horror firsthand. Twenty years ago Pam Koerbel chose abortion, and the experience crippled her emotionally for years. After finally discovering freedom from the guilt, anger, and shame, Pam thoroughly researched the problem of the Second Victim. In her book she lets you see into the minds and hearts of other Second Victims and goes on to show how women can find freedom from the horrible aftermath of abortion and experience peace and forgiveness. Give it to someone you love and it may save a life. Perhaps your own!"},{"Title":"Abortion's Second Victim.,","review":"I have been suffering with post abortion grief. I read this book and it actually made me feel worse. Buyers beware that this book is totally religious based... and consists mostly of explaining WHY abortion is wrong. Uses Bible quote after Bible quote, but doesn't do much for helping someone who is already grieving over having gone through an abortion.. This books kicks you while you are already down. This book first and foremost condemns you for the decision, uses tactics that make you feel even worse about &quot;killing your baby&quot; (the sort of wording and theme used in the book), then implores you to repent and ask forgivenss from &quot;a loving God&quot; as the ONLY way to heal.It does no go any further to explore emotions, reasons for the decisions, and coming to terms within yourself, etc.Horrible. Would never reommend this book to anyone who is grieving post abortion, except perhaps a religious fanatic.The author takes the reader through her personal experience and preaches what she believes to be the ONLY way to heal.My conclusion after reading this book?? The author is nuts... dysfunctional. Only thing IS.. I can't tell if it's a result of her abortion experience, or if she was that way to begin with."},{"Title":"Poems of Childhood","review":"Some of these poems are for children. Some are merely about children. Some are for grown ups who love children. Some are for children who have no idea how dear they are to the grown ups in their lives.Despite having had my copy of &#65533;Poems of Childhood&#65533; for ten years, I know absolutely nothing about Eugene Field save what I can infer from the poems in this collection. From their recurring themes, and the order in which they appear, I can guess that Field lost a child who was very precious to him . . . was slowly healed of his grief by the love and presence of other children . . . and was given a second chance with the birth of a new baby.There are about 15 poems that hint of that lost child and a handful that juxtapose sleep and death, making me wonder if the baby died in its sleep. Other sad poems are merely wistful about beloved children who have grown up. Thankfully, there are just as many happy poems as sad ones: cheery verses about toys, imaginary creatures, and playground games. Field also wrote several &#65533;lullabies&#65533; that are perfect for rocking children to sleep, whether or not they are put to music.I don&#65533;t know any other poet who has brought such dignity to \\"babytalk.\\" Toddlers in his poems are called names like Pittypat, Tippytoe, Googly-Goo and Luddy-Dud. His imaginary fairies include Amberglee, Daisybright and Pilfercurds. Moreover, I&#65533;m sure that no other collection of children&#65533;s poems has this many terms for \\"dreamland\\"--Blinkiwink garden, Shut-Eye town, and Hushaby street, to name a few.Though Field could be accused of writing the same poems over and over again, most of his verses have such distinctive _personalities_ that this is not entirely true. What they _all_ have in common is his delicate touch--yes, even the ones in which his voice turns rustic and homey--that has endeared him to children and grown ups alike."},{"Title":"Poems of Childhood","review":"I received this book as a gift when I was about 8 or 10, and it was one of my favorite all time books. The poems are dear and the illustrations are simply magical. This volume had poems I had heard before, like &quot;Winken, Blinken, and Nod&quot;, and many that were new to me. Over the years, when I had to memorize a poem for school, it was always one of these I chose -- &quot;Jest 'Fore Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat&quot;, and &quot;the Dickey bird is singing in the Amphalula tree.&quot;"},{"Title":"Poems of Childhood","review":"One of my very favorite books of my childhood.

Even the picture of the book cover here features an image of a Maxfield Parrish painting. While I am happy to have my own copy of the poems finally, I am quite disappointed that it does not include the images that were implied to be included in the book.

My main desire to write this review is to encourage anyone thinking of buying it to buy it in the hardcover edition with the fabulous Maxfield Parrish full color pictures. There are 10 full page color pictures in all and I believe they are unique to this book, as I've only seen a couple of them in collections of Parrish's illustrations. The colors are true--Parrish's color palette was often very subtle. There are some sideways nudes, but these are not distasteful, being handled in a way that illustrates the freedom of youth (The children look nonsexual, as if the sexual parts of their bodies didn't exist).

This book touched my heart with its old-fashioned style and unique poems. I revived an old tradition from my childhood, bedtime stories. Spending a little precious time with each of my children is something we look forward to and this is a great way to calm down the kids and transition them to go to sleep. My oldest child enjoys reading the stories to me and sometimes she \\"tucks me in\\" and pretends she is the mom. I encourage parents to give this beautiful book a try. Another plus, it is illustrated by the famous Maxfield Parrish who I know from his art, but didn't know he was an illustrator. This is definately a treasure that I will put away when the kids get older and will then pass it down to my grandkids."},{"Title":"Original Tao","review":"The centre of this 200-pages book is the critical edition of the Chinese text and the scholar translation of the Nei Ye (55 pages). Before and after this part, an introduction and 4 other chapters trace the history of the text, its contents and structure, its position in the context of the early Taoist mysticism and its position in the context of the early Taoism in general.The Nei Ye is not a recent discovery; it was known since millennia but, buried in a supposed Confucian miscellany, its actual contents and significance have been since long overlooked. This book attempts, with success, to re-assess them, placing this work at the origins of Taoist mysticism, as the earliest extant text of the tradition which will later express more widely known works like Laozi and Zhuangzi.\\"Original Tao\\" is a scholar book, it is not an 'easy' reading and the reader without any familiarity with ancient China's history and philosophy will be easily overwhelmed by the amount of names, data, quotations and so on.On the other hand, its language is not too technical, and basic concepts are never taken for granted but appropriately introduced. And, above all, the new lights it casts on (and the grounds it provides for) the development of the early Taoist mysticism are for sure of great interest even to the layman who knows Taoism only through (more or less sound translations of) the Laozi and the Zhuangzi.While not really new (it has now about 10 years), this book is definitely to recommend to anybody with a non-casual interest on Taoism.The only (small) criticism I can make is the use of an old Chinese transliteration system instead of the now more widely used pinyin system."},{"Title":"Original Tao","review":"Original Tao is a wonderful translation of an often over-looked text. The verses contained within this short work rival and often surpass those found in the more well known Taoist classic, Lau-tzu.In addition to the translation, Professor Roth's commentary on Chinese mysticism is phenomenal and provides an interesting back-drop to the history of Taoist thought.I highly recommend this book to both newcomers and veterans of Taoism"},{"Title":"Original Tao","review":"I have been a student of Taoism for over 40 years and try to accumulate as much literature on the subject as I can. This particular book is a very good find. I have been (and still am) enjoying it immensely. And Amazon.com helped me in finding this book at a great value."},{"Title":"Original Tao","review":"Original Tao provides a new translation and commentary which revise Taoism's origins and reflect new historic discoveries, uncovering the original expressions of Taoist philosophy and using original texts as masterworks for revision. From an introduction of short poetic verses devoted to meditation to the author's contention that the seminal Taoist work Inward Training is the foundational text of early Taoism, this provides an intriguing new examination."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"Unless you MUST have a small, light edition of \\"The Story of Art,\\" you will fare much better with the regular 16th edition.Why?In this \\"Pocket Edition,\\" the text and illustrations have been separated. The text comes up front, and all the plates are at the back. In my opinion, a terrible idea, mostly because the author refers CONSTANTLY to the plates.The publishers apparently realized there was a problem with this misorganization, because they supplied two ribbon book-markers -- one to mark your place in the text, and the other to mark your place in the plates.The result is a study in frustration, trying to keep both markers in place while trying to follow the author's discussion. In my case, updating the markers actually caused me to lose the thread of the discussion.How much better it is, to have the illustrations printed right alongside the text, which is the way the book has always been printed.Get the 16th edition and save your money."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"Appreciate the \\"personal introduction\\" type of writing style.

Therefore, as an architecture student, I recommend you guys to read this book to gain the knowledge of how art and architecture evolve throughout history."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"This book is a great introductory tool. The overview is easy to read and gives you a good bird's eye view of the history of art from cave paintings down to the present. It also does a nice job of clear up much of the confusion about what is \\"Art\\" and tries to open up your senses to not being snobby about the subject. The strongest feature of the book is that half of it is actual plates that are referred to as the book goes on. An example might be how the author tries to show you the difference between Egyptian art during the Hyksos dynasty and its change during Akenaten. In the appendix, side by side, there will be reliefs or statuary of both that has been referenced in the text. It makes the work so much more interesting and meaningful to actually see examples of what the author is talking about. No more boring, dry art history. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"That may sound a bit strange, but this is a great book to take on the plane or train with you -- or even to the beach.It is a compact volume (though about 1 1/2 inches thick). Because of this compact format the text is in front (thin paper) with the plates in back. Phaidon provides two ribbon bookmarks. That also means that it is easiest to read using both hands.That said, Gombrich leads the reader along with a style somewhere between a conversation and a lecture -- more like what you might expect from a learned uncle or family friend. Pleasant delivery, but leaving you no doubts about the value of the information that is to be passed along.There may even be an advantage to having the plates in the back. I found myself dwelling on them perhaps a little longer than if they had been in with the text -- and the text calling for my attention.You can read this book in long sessions, or in little bits. It doesn't matter, because the information is always there, and in the case of this book, the journey itself is important.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"This is a classic art history book, written in very clear, no-nonsense language, it's a really good starter for someone who has been scared away from museums by some art critics' cryptic aproach to art appreciation.Nice pocket edition. The paper is rather thin and needs to be treated carefully. All the pictures are in the back of the book and it requires you to go back and for from the text calls to the picture pages."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"Perhaps there is a better one-volume overview of the history of art in the West, but I have not seen it yet.Professor Gombrich's work is already a classic, and it will forever remain one for a few simple reasons. It is written in a straight-forward and clear style, so it is accessible by young and old alike. His enthusiasm and utter command of his subject are infectious, and he gives the reader many insights into the different periods and movements of art.For example, he makes a compelling argument that Cezanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh were the fore-fathers of modern art as we know it.When he makes comparisons to art movements over the centuries, the book is simply astounding. The plates are carefully selected by the author and serve as very telling samples. My only minor complaint: the paperback edition is somewhat flimsy and can easily tear apart for reasons unknown to me. But get this book and read it---your only regret will be that you didn't devour it sooner."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"I've read a few \\"art 101\\" style histories, and this stands out as by far the best. The problem with most comprehensive histories is that each chapter is usually written by a different author. Consequently, they end up reading like encyclopedias rather than smooth narratives. Volumes like Gardner and Janson are big, impressive, authoritative, and richly illustrated, but reading them cover to cover tends to be a painful and boring labor. Not so with Gombrich, whose \\"Story of Art\\" truly reads like a story. Each chapter progresses nicely from the last, making reference to material already covered. The 400+ full page illustrations mean you know exactly what he's describing.It's worth noting that, with the exception of one chapter on Islamic and Chinese art, Gombrich covers western art almost exclusively. While this might be unsatisfying to some, I think sacrificing comprehensiveness is worth maintaining narrative flow.My only complaint is that all the illustrations are lumped together in the back of the pocket edition. This necessitates constant flipping back and forth while reading. I suppose the publisher had to do this to keep the price low and the size small, but it becomes tiresome pretty quickly."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"good value and great writer!!!

With clear simple prose the author delivers his story of art, and the pictures accompanying the text are sharply reproduced.

In strong contrast to most other art history texts, Gombrich's book has a thesis, and therefore an argument. In choosing among the various alternates (Janson, Gardner, Stokstad, etc.) it is important to bear this in mind. The size and compression of his book is not its salient feature from aphilosophic standpoint: it is the presence of an authorial voice, and a continuous narrative. Most other survey texts give up the ideal of coherent exposition in favor of a neutral descriptive voice and a fragmented &quot;story&quot; thatcontinuously interrupts itself in order not to lose any essential historical detail."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"Having already been exposed to art history and criticism, I felt at times that this book was overly simplistic. (It was originally written for \\"young people\\" after all...) What was harder for me to appreciate were the frequent passages in which Gombrich gives vent to his own personal opinions (gushing on about Rubens for instance.) He makes a token effort to be objective but his Eurocentric bias toward the superiority of Classically-inspired Renaissance art is clear.However, as an introduction to Art History and Art Appreciation, you could do a lot worse. Gombrich is easy to read, he states himself clearly, he presents the history of art (in Europe) as a steady evolution of ideas, rather than a compartmentalized series of Eras & Styles as so many academic textbooks do. He selected illustrations that most effectively elucidate his point. Useful as his book is, it would be a mistake to treat him as a final authority on the subject. _The Story of Art_ is merely an INTRODUCTION to art. Once Dr. Gombrich has opened the door for you, you should leave him behind and continue your explorations on your own, or at least with a different guide. Form your own opinions; that's part of the experience of art.About the Pocket Edition specifically: The text is in the front (printed on very thin \\"Bible\\" paper) and the illustrations are in the back. Phaidon has provided two built-in ribbon bookmarks so you can keep your place in both sections. It's an interesting solution for making the book smaller. I can vouch for the fact that it's easy to carry around, since I took it with me on two trips while reading it, but the arrangement does have its drawbacks. Having to flip back & forth to look at the pictures as they are referred to in the text, and having to hold two places simultaneously while reading means that you have to use both hands. I like to read while I eat (yeah, I'm one of THOSE people) but found it was impossible with this edition. If portability and price are your top concerns, then this is the edition to get. Otherwise, shell out the extra $$ for the full-sized version."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"Originally, Dr. Gombrich intended (in the 1940s) for this book to be read by high school students; or as he writes \\"young people.\\" Since then, The Story of Art became popular and his book mushroomed into several languages and editions.

From the Stone Age to Picasso, *The Story of Art* is a lively and accessible survey of the products of mankind's urge to create. E.H. Gombrich does a stellar job of selecting those art-works--paintings, sculptures, and architecture--that he feels best exemplify the major movements in art and therefore tell a \`story' that continues to unfold so long as artists make art.This book was supposedly written for young people, but don't let that fool you into thinking *The Story of Art* is not a sophisticated and informative text that practically anyone will find rewarding. Gombrich's insights are easy-to-grasp but surprisingly illuminating. He deftly mixes history, religion, and biographical detail into his discussions which serve to help provide readers with a better understanding of what questions the artists of any given period were trying to answer with their art. For as Gombrich points out, art is a kind of ongoing conversation ((or story)) between the artists of different generations and the problems one group of artists solves creates a whole new set of problems for those who come after. To really understand art beyond the point of simply knowing what paintings you like illustrating your wall calendar, it's important to have some idea where an artwork fits into the grand scheme of things. It is the thread of this story that Gombrich follows in *The Story of Art* and it's his genius to pick out the essential plot-line with such lucidity and relative brevity.Although he died in 2001, *The Story of Art* effectively ends sometime in the early 1960s. There is some passing discussion of Lucien Freud and Hockney, but no mention of such seminal figures as Warhol, Lichtenstein, Rothko, deKooning, Bacon, or anyone after them. It's a little surprising inasmuch as Gombrich certainly had to be familiar with these artists, and its clear that someone like Warhol, for instance, is not just a passing fad. Still, one can find other, more detailed, not to mention more up-to-date books, about contemporary artists and art movements. Perhaps the greatest value of a book like *The Story of Art* is that it brings to life precisely the parts of the \\"art story\\" that aren't as familiar, or as often told. Those long centuries of Church-commissioned art or those weird-looking portraits of kids with the heads of middle-aged adults...they're also important chapters in the story of art and to understand where we are today it's important to know what happened back then. Where does El Greco fit in? Van Gogh? Why is Raphael important? To really understand art, you need to have an idea of where each artist fits into history's big picture-book and Gombrich's *The Story of Art* does exactly that.I highly recommend this book to art lovers and artists alike. Witty, entertaining, always informative, its like having an urbane and kindly grandfather lead you through a museum of mankind's most important art...and opportunity, in other words, not to be missed."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"Five stars because Gombrich's text has all the virtues attributed to it by reviewers here and elsewhere, and because Phaidon has done a fine job of making the book it set out to make--a cheap, easily portable version. But in my opinion the reproductions are much too small; in many cases it is quite impossible (for these eyes, at least) to see in the pictures what Gombrich is talking about or to check with any confidence the plausibility of his statements. My advice would be to forget about portability and buy the full-size version."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"My comment regards the pocket edition. The value of the book in general is widely known. But I was amazed by the splendid pocket edition. It is very handy, has very thin pages for the text and the images are all in the last section of the book. The letters are not too smal. There are two bookmarks, one for the text and one for the images which is very useful and cuuute at the same time. A handy guide in a handy size."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"Gombrich's text is, of course, a classic. The size of the book and its price are huge benefits. The are, however, two catches that make it less than perfect. First, the text pages are amazingly thin. I'm worried that they might tear and it's possible to see the text on the other side, which is distracting. Second, the text all goes first and THEN all of the plates together at the end. I understand the necessity of this strategy but it does mean that one has to flip back and forth between the text and the plates. Otherwise, it's a wonderful book and an ideal introduction to art. Given the exceptional price, the drawbacks become trivial. As such, it's an ideal text."},{"Title":"The story of art","review":"This is a beautiful book with comprehensive text.

Gombrich has a unique gift as an art historian: a concise, pedagogical, unpretentious style that appeals to the amateur reader and the broad public. The text constantly refers to the illustrations, which makes the reading even easier and entertaining."},{"Title":"Lucky Every Day: 20 Unforgettable Lessons from a Coach Who Made a Difference","review":"This book reminds me of Tuesday With Mory.

Her accomplishments as a lacrosse coach, and as an individual dying of brain cancer were awe-inspiring. Because of that I bought her book &quot;Lucky Every Day&quot;; and, after reading it in one sitting I now understand why she was such a remarkable individual. Author Chip Silverman has put together an outstanding series of stories from her former players that are motivating and truly inspirational; and relate not just to sports, but to every facet of humanity. Interestingly, I found this book quite a departure from two other books that I have read by Silverman: Diner Guys which follows the lives of the guys immortalized in Barry Levinson's film \\"Diner\\"; and \\"Ten Bears\\" an account of the first and only black college lacrosse team and its exploits as told by Silverman, the white coach of the black team.

In fact, after the master died, Theophrastus remain in charge of the Academia, the school where the peripathetics taught, learned and researched. Unfortunately, very little of this man's work has reached us, and this set of short texts seems to have been some kind of divertimento for their long talks after meals. They are clearly ironic sketches of several vices of behavior, not intended as &quot;serious&quot; philosophy but as literary entertainments.Theophrastus depicts several reprobable behaviors and types of characters, such as avarice, imprudence, aggresiveness, and other types of annoying, obnoxious or simply wrong attitudes. The historical value of the book is that it gives us some information of what everyday life was at the time (4th century BC) in Greece. We know, for example, that for a gentleman it was unproper to go to the market and carry the things back himself, without the help of a servant or slave. We know also that the Greeks used to get together at certain places in the evenings, and that it was usual for groups of friends to cooperate with money in order to help a fellow in trouble.

I understand that the author had to write this book without much to go on, but then perhaps she should have not chosen to dive so deeply into what makes the characters tick and written a more surface adventure. Unfortunately the plot, such as it is, takes a back seat to endless scenes of Riker doubting his role, Picard doubting his role, Deanna doubting her role, etc etc ad infinitum. I was planning to read the TNG books from the start and go through each one, but have revised that decision and will pay closer attention to reviews before buying."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"I was very excited when I saw that the entire series of classic TNG novels were available on the kindle, and I immediatley purchased this one. I use to read these novels years ago when Star Trek TNG was at the height of its popularity. I had never read this one though, so I thought I would give it a go. I see that several other reviewers have pointed out the fact that this book in some ways is inconsistent with the portrayal of the characters from the tv show. This is somewhat correct, but they are clearly viewing this novel through eyes that have seen how the tv show eventually played out and what the characters on the show eventually became. This is unfair to the book and the author. Considering that this book was written and clearly takes place within the first season of the television show and that the characters were not fully fleshed out at that point, the novel itself should be judged on its own merits and on its accuracy to the show at that point in time. With that said, this is a pretty decent Star Trek novel. It's not one of the best, but it certainly is serviceable and is a really cool glimpse into what the characters and show were like in it's earliest incarnation. The story itself is your standard Star Trek fare...routine mission goes awry, ship in peril, crew must find a way out of peril while also pondering a deeper philosophic issue. In this case the deeper philosophic issue is euthanasia, and the author did a great job of exploring all aspects of that controversial subject via the crew of the Enterprise. In short, if you like Star Trek, you'll probably like this book, so give it a try!"},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"What makes this book difficult to read is the author's interpretation of the characters. Picard appears as a grumpy old man. Riker is insecure. Data is overly emotionally sensitive for an android who doesn't have feelings. The book also relies on Wesley, who is particularly more stupid and annoying than usual. The plot is ok, but the inaccuracies are too distracting to fully enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"I'm pretty new to the Star Trek fandom and therefore haven't been exposed to much of it. Whether or not this was a good place to start, Ghost Ship was my first Trek novel. The book certainly wasn't bad. The author seemed to know where she was going with the plot, but the characters seemed off (even from what little I've seen of them) and the feel of the novel just wasn't quite right.The book opens with an introduction to the Sergei G. Gorshkov's crew. This really captured my interest, as the characters presented in this chapter were very well fleshed out. After reading the few sixteen pages that comprised the first chapter, I felt as though I really knew the captain and first officer. My hat goes off to Carey for that characterization and the gripping introduction of the main conflict. Unfortunately, after this first chapter, we never again see the crew as individual characters, but instead as a large collective mass of \\"ghosts.\\" Without the continued characterization (or something to remind us that these ghosts were individuals), it became really hard to care about what happened to the ghosts, as they no longer seemed to be people and were instead mere props to help the story along.Several reviewers have said that this book was written when the Next Generation was fairly new and the characters were still being fleshed out. This really shows in the novel. Most of the characters seem one dimensional, more like caricatures than actual characters. In fact, most of the characters here can be summed up in a couple words: Riker is an arrogant buffoon; Data is very nave; LaForge is emotional; Wesley is smart but incompetent in terms of common sense; Picard snaps a lot. Riker was probably the most inaccurately portrayed character. He rotates between blowing up at Data, debating the purpose of his job, admiring Picard, angering LaForge, and having personal conversations with Deanna Troi (which are probably where he is most accurately portrayed). The only character I didn't really have an issue with was Deanna Troi (who didn't seem too off). A lot of focus is placed upon the friendship being forged between Data and LaForge and the relationship between Riker and Deanna Troi. Some of the character interactions themselves are actually pretty well done (if you can get past the number of times Riker degrades Data and wallows in self pity over his job).Ultimately, this is a book heavy on ethics. The characters spend a lot of time discussing how to best vanquish the enemy without hurting its feelings (in so many words) and what exactly makes something living. The latter becomes an especially important issue to Data to the point where he becomes obsessive about it. I personally enjoyed the whole criteria for living issue and Data trying to deal with it, because it seems like something he might struggle with from time to time (then again, my knowledge on his character is limited). Unfortunately, Data's battle with this issue is never really resolved to satisfaction. There's a lot of emphasis placed on the ever present question of \\"is this right?\\" In fact, it seems to dominate more of the book than the actual plot. Some emphasis on ethics is always welcome, as it is realistic for characters (of any novel) to struggle with them from time to time, but so much of it felt out of place for a Trek novel.The actual writing of the book was a bit awkward at times. Carey seems to like analogies and possibly extending her sentences a little too far. There were also several instances where the plot was suddenly interrupted to analyze one of the characters. For example, Wesley is performing some calculations on the bridge regarding the ships status at a crucial moment and Picard takes a moment to internally discuss why Wesley's there and how Picard doesn't see him as being competent enough to be on the bridge. I love a good character analysis at the right moment, but disrupting the flow of a scene to insert it just throws the reader off. I also remember this happening once with Tasha and a description of the planet she grew up on. In some places, the writing flowed well and presented the story clearly, but in others, it was hindered due to some awkward writing.On a side note, I rather enjoyed Data's attempts at being more \\"human.\\" While the whole slang thing became a bit overdone (as I feel might have been the point), I got a few good chuckles out of it.All in all, if this wasn't a Trek book, it might have been just a bit less frustrating at times. The plot and idea itself were actually pretty original and well planned. However, the inaccurate portrayal of well established characters, the overbearing and constant emphasis on ethics, and the occasional awkwardness in the writing itself make the novel quite frustrating at times. I'm assuming this probably isn't the best Trek book out there."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"Granted that this was writte in 1988, just at the start of TNG, and perhaps Dian Carey didn't know much about the show or there wasn't much to be had at the time. Still, some glaring errors in characterization-1) Data uses contractions. He simply can't, not until the far far future in TNG as mentiond in Peter David's Imzadi, and the TNG ep All Good Things2) Data feels or seemingly feels emotions and visibly shows this change via voice volume differences etc. Data was curious more than anything, and didn't revieve emotions until later in the series; there was no way he could act hurt other than a pause in speech, yed Carey gives him more intonation than Roddenberry had3) Wesley Crusher is 16. In TNG, he was closer to 13 in the first season when he wore sweaters. Perhaps I'm just judging it wrong because Will Wheaton is so... baby faced.I completely agree with the prvious poster who said that the book feels far too dramatic, even things like thoughts or feelings are on a soap opera-ish scale here.A pinch....more like a pound of salt is needed while reading this."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"This is an interesting book to read for the known series of Star Trek: The Next Generation, giving the reader another side of the story, in regards of depths, with individual thoughts of the characters involve, unlike watching it on tv.It started slow at first, with the akwardsness among the shipmates, due to being new to each others but work perfectly well together. This book mostly revolved around the relationships between Riker, Data and La Forge with each other and the rest of the main crew, like Picard, Troi, the Crushers, etc. Trying to understand each other,A flash back showed, in the year 1995 when a mysterious entity destroyed a Russian aircraft leaving no trace of it behind. The Enterprise deck's crew has their peeve about the other like Riker with Data, who just literally saw him only as a machine, not alive; and every childlike conversation Data came out with annoyed Riker. Riker and Troi had to face each other as if they have no romantical history between them.

I have read some of Diane Carey's other ST books, and while she's not my favourite Trek author, I do enjoy most of her books, especially 'Ship of the Line'.I think the book would be better if more time was spent on developing a more complicated storyline, and less time on the characters feelings on the 'Ghost Ship'. Maybe it's just me, but the plot seemed too basic, and centred completely on what to do about the life draining entity. As it was, the book was more a question of ethics than a Star Trek novel.A good, thought-provoking Star Trek novel, but not one of the best."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"To be fair to the author, it is hard to write a completely objective review of this book. The novel was written when the concept was new, the series just beginning and the characters not yet fully fleshed out. I read it, on the other hand, after the series had concluded and the transition to motion pictures successfully completed. Still, the weakness of the book lies not with the inconsistent interaction among the main characters but with the plot itself. We start by meeting the captain and crew of the Sergei G. Gorshkov. In fact, the entire first chapter is dedicated to this introduction. The author makes us curious about these characters, and then does nothing with them. They exist in spirit form throughout the rest of the novel, but do nothing and are never revisited as anything more than a collective group of beings that want to die. The officers of the Enterprise undergo a great amount of soul-searching as they try to decide whether to grant this request or not, but the crew of the Gorshkov are neglected by the alien that absorbed them and by the author as well throughout the bulk of the novel. Ultimately, the reader does not care what decision Captain Picard comes to, because the author never makes us care about the \\"ghosts\\" whose fates lie in the balance.While the plot is disappointing, the interaction among the main characters is worthwhile if for no other reason than to contrast the original concept with their eventual, more developed, incarnations. The highlights are the budding relationship between Giordi and Data and the contradictory early relationship between Deanna and Riker. But at the same time, Giordi is painted as an arrogant and insubordinant brat and Riker an incompetent buffoon when the two are on the bridge.Bottom line: This isn't a horrible novel, but there are many superior Star Trek books out there (some of them written by Diane Carey herself). If you are going to invest the time it takes to read a book, invest it in one you'll get more out of."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"This book started poorly, and had a number of problems, but overall was a good enough story to make it all the way up to &quot;fair&quot;.It was 15 pages into the book before we met any of the main characters, and there was some very odd writing as has been commented on by one of the other reviewers (&quot;Her faint Greek accent tapped the words out with the click of a sparrow's talons hopping across marble.&quot;) and, also as one of the other reviewers has pointed out, several of the characters do not seem to behave in ways that, to my admittedly limited understanding, are according to their established characterizations from the television show. Riker, particularly, seems completely out of character, very self-conscious and uncertain, very unhappy to be a first officer, thinking of Data (at least at the start of the book) as simply an ambulatory tool with no personhood, and being even more pacifistic and unwilling to cause harm to another entity, even in self-defense, than Picard.This book would probably rate four stars if it stood alone, as a science fiction story with characters that were entirely its own; but the poor handling of established characters brings it down to three."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"The Next Generation was such an excellent series that it's hard to believe that one book could focus almost entirely on the goofy parts of the series.The book turns all of the crew into naval gazers, but my \\"favorite\\" part was the fake prime directive debate that consumed an entire chapter. What if we hurt the enemy's feelings?I still can't believe I read the whole book. This book was like a movie that I wish I'd walked out of.Thankfully, the series quickly abandoned the \\"Romulan warbird de-cloaking off the port bow; shields down to 5% -- OK, everyone to the conference room to figure out what to do\\" problem.

Thankfully, there's never been a book this bad again!"},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"Although I understand that this book was written when TNG was first on TV, I still believe that the author should have either waited for characterizations to develop on the series or possibly done better research before publishing this book. Especially for someone of Carey's caliber, I am constantly annoyed by the characterizations in this story. It is almost as if someone got only the physical descriptions of the characters and maybe a few catch phrases and then decided to write something they deemed worthy of Star Trek canon. Instead of her deciding how the characters felt (and in such depth), maybe she could have treated them more superficially until official canon had developed them. Otherwise, the storyline itself is very interesting, and in fact, the only reason I am struggling to finish the story, even though it means skipping PAGES of characterizations with which I feel she should have never taken such license."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"Given that this was the very first of the original Star Trek The Next Generation novels and that the author didn't even have the benefit of a full season of the show to work with, she did a worthwhile job in her characterizations based on her limited knowledge of them. Despite the television episodes having later disproved her suppositions about the characters, except for the strong bond between Data and Geordi LaForge, the author came up with a fairly decent concept for the plot. Given the outstanding newer Star Trek stories she has published since this one, I'm certain had she had more time to watch the episodes and learn these outstanding characters, her plot and the characterizations within the pages of this story would've been much better.The premise:Conceptually, the premise for this story is a sound one, well based in science fiction as we're introduced to a Russian aircraft carrier in the year 1995. We soon learn that there is an entity that will destroy the crew of this ship. We're then brought to the twenty fourth century and the Captain and crew of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D must deal with this same threat or be left a \\"Ghost Ship\\" as well.Would I recommend this first STNG novel, yes! Why you say, from a fans and a collector's point of view, it was the first TNG novel that will lead the reader along the line of all of the STNG novels published to date and it is quite interesting to read through them, seeing how they've improved, along with the series. If you've never read a Star Trek novel written by this fine Star Trek author before, whatever you do, do not dismiss her as a bad Trek author, for this was but the first of her STNG efforts and she has so many others that are well worth the time to read them! {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"This is the first of the next generation books and also the worst.

I felt it was a waste of my time and i am surprised i actually finished this book. This book is a waste of time and the paper it was written on"},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"Ghost Ship suffers from a problem that too many of the Pocket Trek books share - too much effort devoted to character interaction and too little effort to plot. Authors of media tie-ins - like Star Trek and Buffy - run great risks when they focus too much on the characters. Because the readers are already intimately familiar with the \\"real\\" characters, the interactions may seem fake or untrue. Conflicts or backgrounds created by the writers may be superceded by later television or movie episodes. And, ultimately, all the effort spent by the writer to make us care about the characters is wasted. We *already* care about the characters, or else we wouldn't be reading the book!So very much of Ghost Ship is wasted space. Riker insults Data. Geordi throws a tantrum about it. Riker and Deanna wonder if they can maintain a friendship. Geordi whines about his VISOR. Riker wonders if Tasha likes to wear comfortable shoes (yes, that's right). None of it is particularly moving or interesting. True, Carey was tasked with writing a Next Generation novel very early on in the series - perhaps before she was able to see any of the episodes? But that should have been all the more reason to *avoid* character introspection, and focus instead on what could have been an interesting plotline. The occasionally grossly overdone prose (\\"[Deanna's] eyes, extra large with their touch of alienness, obisidan as eyes that looked out of a Greco-Roman fresco . . . .\\") further keeps Ghost Ship from reaching the three-star plateau that most Trek books earn."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"This book is maybe only good for a laugh i.e. &quot;Picard eyed him foxily&quot; Hmmmm? &quot;Worf puckered his lips in a Klingon kind of shrug&quot; What the heck is that supposed to mean! &quot;Her faint Greek accent tapped the words out with the clip of a sparrow's talons hopping across marble.&quot; Whatever happened to &quot;she said..&quot; Don't get me wrong I do enjoy reading Star Trek TNG but I could not even finish this joke of all books. Thank you for your time."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Star Trek the Next Generation, Book #1)","review":"I can't say that I'm the biggest Star Trek fan by any means. By that, I only really enjoyed \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\\" Maybe it's because I was born in the early 80's, but for some reason I really can't get into Classic Trek, and I had a hard time really getting into \\"Deep Space Nine.\\" Therefore, for me it's all about \\"The Next Generation.\\" Seriously, I have all the episodes on DVD, I own all the comic books and now I've delved into the novels! I guess I'm a pretty big \\"The Next Generation\\" fan at the very least. I'm also big on details, as anyone can tell who have read my reviews.As many other reviews have pointed out about \\"Ghost Ship\\" is that the story concept is pretty good, but the characters are all wrong. A few characters here and there seem to have been developed correctly, but it seems like that's all by chance. I did see someone mention somewhere that the author may not have even been able to see an episode of this new series before writing the book. I don't understand this, but when you analyze the release dates that kind of makes sense. The episode \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" which was the first episode for \\"The Next Generation\\" came out in September, 1987 and the last episode aired on May, 1988. \\"Ghost Ship\\" was promptly released in June, 1988. This is way too soon to have been written after the season had finished being aired and would explain why nobody really acts like anybody on the show.Here's my theory, you can take it or leave it. I think that Diane Carey only had character profiles available to her, pictures of the characters, a layout of the ship, and maybe the script for \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\". Either that or written into the character profiles were hints at what their future would be in terms of development. When she was commissioned to write the book she was given these things wrote the book and then the publishing house held it to be released promptly after the last episode aired. That's my theory; it's the only reason I can think why a writer could so drastically screw up the main characters of the show! In another review I saw that someone mentioned not to judge this author by this book, furthering my belief in my theory. Because this story is quite good and pretty original and if it wasn't a Star Trek book it wouldn't be so hard to read.That being said, I struggled through this book. The characters were so inaccurate. The book was slow to get into, recounting some prequel that happened to a Russian ship in 1995. This was about twenty pages long before we ever got to hear from the crew of the Enterprise. This wasn't the greatest idea for the first novel to kick off this series. Mainly because I was starting to wonder if I was reading something in the Star Trek universe at all. Anyway, I'll go over the general plot and then critique the character flaws. Basically this alien ship/entity attacked a Russian ship in 1995 and somehow kept the souls/essences of those on board. The starship Enterprise encounters the same entity years later and now they are in danger of suffering the same fate. The entity is much more powerful than the starship and it almost seems like the Enterprise is doomed to share the same fate. The essences of the Russian crew begin to appear on the Enterprise, which is why we get the title \\"Ghost Ship\\". The Russian crew can talk to Troi, sort of, and the greater entity that is flying around the universe seems to be able to communicate with Data to a degree. This leaves the Captain and his crew in a sort of a quandary as to whether or not they should try to destroy the entity with all the \\"souls\\" on board. It's kind of an interesting premise and I will say, it's the only reason I finished reading the book. In terms of a time frame when this book takes place, I've narrowed down based on some given information. Since Wesley is an acting ensign and Tasha is still alive, then that means it takes place between episodes \\"Where No One has Gone Before\\" and \\"Skin of Evil,\\" which is a good chunk of the season. Therefore we can all already figure out that the Enterprise survives in this book given that time constraint because this book was after the first season.Okay, now that everyone knows what the book is about, those who would like to know what's wrong in detail can read further. I'll start off with Commander Riker. His character is probably the most flawed of the whole bunch. As I mentioned above the book is taking place after Wesley had become an acting ensign so we're about four to five episodes into the show at this point. Anyone who has seen Season One knows that the characters had already been pretty well developed at this point. Riker in \\"Ghost Ship\\" is like a bumbling fool. He constantly questions if he's good enough and seems unsure of his decisions. He constantly juggles with the purpose of a first officer on the ship; this is clearly not the Riker we know. He's overly prejudiced against Data and at one point blows up and starts yelling at Data about how he's not human. This sends Data into all these questions about himself ever desiring to try and emulate humans (more on this thought later). It's as if Carey latched on to one conversation Riker had with Data on the holodeck about being nervous on Data being a machine in the pilot episode. She really grasped at a straw that went nowhere, because by the time we got to the episodes where Wesley was an acting ensign Data and Riker were fast friends. There's literally no malice between the two. Riker also spends a lot of his time in this book angering the rest of the crew and making Geordi feel sad (more on that later). The only time I felt like I was reading about the real Will Riker was when he had a personal conversation with Troi near the beginning of the book, when he tells a story about his first assignment as first officer. It was a funny story and told in the very same manner Riker would tell it.Picard was probably the second worst portrayed character in this book. Seriously if you get the first and second officers on the ship wrong, and they're pretty much the main characters then the book is already doomed. Here we see a Picard, like Riker, that really isn't sure of himself and questions his command decisions and questions his motives. This became painfully clear during Picard's introspective look at his decision to promote Wesley to an acting ensign. If Carey had known the circumstances of Wesley's promotion this question would have never come about! Picard goes on and on about how Wesley is inexperienced and the ability to do calculations aren't enough for such a fast promotion. When, if you had seen Wesley's self sacrifice and ability to make decisions, it would've been very obvious that Wesley's knowledge of the ship more than qualified him, which was the whole point! In another scene we see Riker pull Picard out of the way of harm and then Picard berates him for it. We see an overbearing captain pushing his crew around and a crew nervous to say anything to him with fear of disappointing their captain. This is not the Captain Picard we know! He's a great captain that cares deeply for his crew and he engenders such trust and confidence in his crew that they wouldn't hesitate to tell him anything! It was so frustrating watching the crew bumble around hesitating to tell Picard any of the information he needed for a command decision. To put the final icing on the cake at the end Picard makes the most hare-brained decision I could possibly think of. During the crisis he removes himself for fourteen hours to go into a sensory deprivation tank to help him make a better decision. Seriously, even if the end results were a more informed decision he would not remove himself from command of the enterprise when it was in danger. There's no way Captain Picard would cease commanding the ship for some sort of \\"experiment\\". He'd order someone else to do it and then listen to their report if it was really that necessary. I know the book was trying to set up a situation where it was only the captain's decision, but this was way too far reaching for me to get behind the logic.On the note of Wesley, I may as well discuss that now. Here we don't see the child genius we got to know in the show. We see the genius that doesn't actually know how to work the ship nearly as well as he proves he can in the actual show. He clearly displays knowledge on how to configure the warp engines in \\"Where No One has Gone Before\\" and even during his first experience touring the bridge he displayed knowledge of the command seat and its functions. Therefore, in this book when Wesley asks commander Riker what the difference between a passive and active scan are, I can't help but slap my forehead. We're talking about a boy who managed to turn the ships tractor beam into a repulsor beam. How can he not know the difference between something that seems so elementary? Later in the book he is found working on an experiment with the antimatter, and seriously he displays knowledge on par with Data. So why even have him ask stupid questions? Further on that experiment it's presented to the reader that Wesley's experiment could have killed the entire crew the way that he was doing it. Wesley doesn't break rules in this fashion, he's smarter than that and we all know it.Next I'll go over the other big blunder we'll call LaForge. He's incredibly over emotional and subject to frequent outbursts, especially when Riker is being prejudiced against Data. While LaForge probably shows the most emotion in most of the episodes, he doesn't have the same kind of outbursts. He is frequently out of order on the bridge and I can't conceive of a Captain Picard that would allow this kind of conduct, especially one that is portrayed apparently being harsher. Also, Geordi complains how people are abusing him constantly, like when Riker and Picard ask him to tell them what he sees in an instance. I found this incredibly out of sorts for Geordi's character since it never comes up in the show and he seems quite happy to help in such times. In the episode with the Edo \\"Justice\\" he is happy to look at the ship that is orbiting that planet and we never see him complain. I think Carey was latching onto a scene in sick bay where Geordi was talking to crusher about getting headaches, and his visor was the cause. For some reason Carey conceived that this would cause him great stress and malice towards his commanding officers, thinking they were taking advantage of him. This is just plain unrealistic for the LaForge we know. Furthermore in one particular case Geordi yells out \\"Christ!\\" in a situation of stress, but if I'm quoting my Star Trek correctly, not once is there any mention or suggestion that any members of the crew follow an Earth based religion. And later something is referenced as being Biblical. I know it sounds like a minute error; it really stood out to me because it's something so common in our language use today that it seems out of place to never hear it. The most we see of a religion on a regular basis is Worf observing specific Klingon rituals.Troi's character was actually decently presented. Though she seems her emotions were out of control, but the author goes at lengths to explain her stress at getting herself under control. This doesn't pan out in conjunction with how she appears on the show. Also, what felt like another oddity was that she kept referring to Commander Riker as \\"Bill\\" when everyone else called him \\"Will\\". Strangely this actually appeared to be accurate. I revisited the first season because I really wanted proof that she called him Bill and in episode \\"The Naked Now\\" she does actually call him \\"Bill\\". I think the show eventually gave up on this and it only shows up in the first season. Interestingly the book does explain the origin of this pet name, but the show never tells the answer. Also they discuss her clothing as being skirted and that was only in the very first episode. They changed that idea after the pilot episode, but in the book she still clearly wears that. This furthered my theory that the author didn't have much to go on.Let's not forget Tasha Yar. Her character was decently accurate in her personality, but her history was an absolute mess. When they were trying to figure out what the Russian ship was, Yar piped in that she was Lithuanian and recognized the names. This makes absolutely no sense because she grew up on some other planet and was abandoned by her parents. Her knowledge of those languages wouldn't have been known to her! I submit as further proof that in an episode, Data references the French language as being obscure. If French is obscure by this time frame then surely Lithuanian would've never made it in to common language on a remote and chaotic colony. Nor would Tasha know the relation of her language to Russian in that case! Curiously later in the novel Carey curiously references the fact that Yar grew up on that other planet, but makes no further mention of her national heritage. It's as if she was submitting the chapters as they were finished and couldn't go back and correct the mistakes reasonably.Data's comments and personality were pretty accurate at first. Unfortunately I was less and less convinced of Data actually being Data as the novel went on. As the novel went on Data was having stronger and stronger illogical/emotional reactions to things. After Riker yelled at him and told him he wasn't human, Data had, what seems to be, extreme depression where he doesn't see the point in his emulating humans anymore. They also use language that is far too human to describe Data. In one particular instance Riker is standing over Data and it says \\"the muscles on the back of his neck\\" referring to Data. This makes absolutely no sense. Data doesn't have muscles on the back of his neck. Furthermore there was a constant reference to Data's beating heart and his pulse, this happens at one instance in sick bay! You have got to be kidding me. This is just absurd. Another instance that was wrong to me is that they bring up the fact that Data had been deemed a living creature by Starfleet. This doesn't make sense to me because then an episode in Season 2 aired where Data's \\"life\\" was questioned and put on trial for a final decision on the matter. This wouldn't have been possible if Starfleet had already decided Data was alive. The absurdities careen off and culminate in the final move where Data tries to get the entities attention in the book by flying out there in a shuttle craft to shoot it. In this fiasco Data's hand start shaking when he tries to disobey orders because his programming won't let him. Data wasn't made by Starfleet, and in other episodes he disobeys orders with quite a bit of ease when he feels it is a logical conclusion. Also his \\"heart\\" starts racing when faced with these decisions that conflict with orders. We all know Data isn't really designed this way where he gets nervous about breaking rules. For the final impossibility the creature does take Data's life essence. This is seriously impossible; it left behind a functioning machine husk with no personality. I really just don't think this is even remotely possible, I know the message is to walk away thinking Data is alive, but it doesn't hold up.Dr. Crusher and Worf seemed to be the most accurate characters in here. Granted my feeling of this towards Worf's character is probably due to the fact that he doesn't have a major presence in this book. Crusher's character had the usual amount of emotional outbursts I typically expect from her in the show. Given how incredibly wrong she was in describing the other characters it feels more like these were slightly accurate by mere circumstance.As you can see the story wasn't bad, but it was the development of the main characters that was incredibly false. Thus the book was nearly impossible for me to get into. This will be the case for any Star Trek fan I believe. We simply can't get into a crew that is bumbling and stumbling over each other at every turn. The bridge crew was so out of sorts that I wouldn't have trusted them to be in Starfleet let alone command the Federations flagship. This may have been the first book that launched nearly a hundred others in this ongoing novel series, but this is seriously the one fans and readers should skip. It's sad to say this and I wish I didn't have to, but I seriously must. The book is far too inaccurate to get behind and endorse."},{"Title":"Tyranny of the Moment: Fast and Slow Time in the Information Age","review":"This book is spectacular. Written by Thomas Hylland Eriksen, Professor of Social Anthropology at the Centre for Technology, Innovation and Culture at the University of Oslo, and published in 2000, it becomes obvious that the book is not simply an observation of the way things are, but a personal longing to overcome the fragmentation, confusion, and rootlessness that has come to characterize life in the developed world. Eriksen points to information as the engine that has driven humankind to this point in history: the availability of information, the breadth of it, the speed at which it comes, the diversity of sources providing the information, and the overwhelming saturation in information that we experience. In the preface, Eriksen offers one of his many irresistibly quotable phrases as he assesses the situation: \\"there are strong indications that we are about to create a kind of society where it becomes nearly impossible to think a thought that is more than a couple of inches long.\\"Eriksen introduces the term \\"information lint,\\" which refers to the countless pieces of random information that fill all of the gaps in our lives - what some would call \\"down time.\\" This constant inundation of information produces a breathless society filled with anxiety. \\"Indeed,\\" Eriksen notes \\"even the \`here and now' is threatened since the next moment comes so quickly that it becomes difficult to live in the present.\\"Eriksen starts out with a brief overview of the Information Age, stating up front that he is not an anti-technology Luddite. His is not a rejection of technology or even speed for that matter, but a cry for balance in our lives and in the world. Interestingly, he points to the fall of the Soviet Union, which ended the cold war and ushered in an era of USA democratic values being unchallenged around the world, as the point at which the Information Age kicked into high gear. Individualism and freedom (including free markets) spread unabated throughout the world, aided in a kind of mutual admiration society by the technological reifications of those values. Eriksen states that \\"the bipolar world has been replaced with a unipolar world. That pole is called market liberalism and individualism, and it beats the drum with catchwords like flexibility, freedom and openness.\\"One helpful concept offered by Eriksen is that people need freedom from information. We obviously have more information than we know what to do with, yet it keeps coming at us from every direction. Eriksen asserts that \\"a crucial skill in information society consists in protecting oneself against the 99.99 per cent of the information offered that one does not want (and, naturally, exploiting the last 0.01 per cent in a merciless way).\\" He points out that where information was once empowering - and in one sense still is - now the key to achieving one's educational goals lies in the proper filtering of information. If filtering is a priority, then the logical question is how does one determine what to hang on to and what to filter out? Eriksen asks a poignant question: \\"How can I sleep at night knowing that I have filtered away 99.99 per cent of the information I have been offered; how can I be certain that the 0.01 per cent that I actually use is the most relevant bit for me, in so far as I haven't even sniffed at the rest?\\" More to the point, he states that \\"today, the jungle has become so dense that one needs to be both stubborn and single-minded in order to be well informed about anything at all.\\"Eriksen talks a lot about the compression of time. He uses lots of different words, referring to the density of time, stacking of time, the loss of time, even the end of time. The key component of compressed time is that all of the gaps are filled. The multitude of information sources vying to occupy whatever gaps might remain on our mental landscape recognize that the most in-demand commodity in this new economic climate is the attention of others, and they will go to almost any means to capture that attention.The author writes quite a bit about the unexpected side-effects of technological changes. Socrates famously stated that writing was going to produce forgetfulness in our souls, crippling our capacity for learning and wisdom. Of course, he was completely wrong and completely right, depending on your perspective. Eriksen points to a more modern, and therefore more appropriate, example of the impact of technological change. He informs us that some commentators believe Nietzsche adopted a more terse style of writing later in life when he began using a typewriter due of poor eyesight. This is debatable, but in fact Nietzsche himself stated in a letter in 1882 that \\"the writing implements affect our thoughts.\\" Eriksen considers the development of writing as a key component in cultural history. Writing is the externalization of thought and, as this externalization has become more complicated and sophisticated, so has life. As Eriksen says, \\"writing made it possible to develop knowledge in a cumulative way, in the sense that one had access to, and could draw directly on, what others had done.\\" The accumulation of knowledge that began with the advent of writing has reached a place that Socrates, Gutenberg, or even Neitzche could never have imagined. As the knowledge pool of any society is broadened and deepened (reflected by the development of a written history), they move from a concrete society to an abstract society. The wholesale movement from a concrete to an abstract framework in modern life paved the way for the Information Society. Here is a good summary from Eriksen of his thoughts on the movement from concrete to abstract:\\"The transitions from kinship to national identity, from custom to legislation, from \`cowrie money' or similar to general-purpose money, from internatised music to notation, from local religions to written religions of conversion, from person-dependent morality to universalistic morality, from memory to archives, from myths to history, and from event-driven time to clock time, all point in the same direction: from small-scale society based on concrete social relations and practical knowledge to a large-scale society based on an abstract legislative system and abstract knowledge founded in logic and science.\\"A big part of what Eriksen seems to be saying is that many technological advancements initially brought about wonderful accomplishments for mankind, but as these advancements have spiraled upward and outward - our lust for them never satisfied - the subsequent results are increasingly dubious. Though we might acknowledge, for instance, the importance of print capitalism in the development of nationalism and democracy, we cannot know for certain the end result of the domination of Internet and satellite television in our day. Over and over in history, positive advancements have led to unintended and undesirable consequences. We would be wise to keep this in mind.In the chapter on speed, Eriksen states that \\"our history is the history of acceleration.\\" He quotes Paul Virilio, who says that \\"we now live in an era with no delays.\\" He is speaking of communication delays, whether you are talking about cell-phone use, satellite television, or email. Virilio hearkens back to McLuhan's insights, but much more pessimistically speaks of a \\"global mega-city characterized by anonymity and disintegration, where everybody communicates with everybody else, and where nobody - for that reason - really speaks with anyone.\\" The key to the \\"virtual city\\" that Virillo bemoans is real-time communication, ie no delays. While acknowledging that all epochs can claim change that seemed earth-shattering and community-destroying, Eriksen maintains that our current era is unique. Though clearly the electronic revolution is simply the continuation of an endless pattern of technological advancements, the elimination of time as a factor in communications is unique in the history of mankind, with consequences we can only speculate about:\\"All of these contributed to liberating, as it were, communication from its immediate context; writing made knowledge timeless and cumulative, the clock made time mechanical and universal; money made values comparable. Whether one is in Canberra or in Kanpur, a dollar, an hour and a news headline mean pretty much the same. The circumstances continue to vary, but the common denominators link places together.\\"Eriksen continues throughout the remainder of the book to unpack the ramifications of the increasingly information-filled, placeless, breathless world in which we live. All of this may sound pretty dire, but the thing I most enjoyed about Eriksen's approach to the subject is his relentless optimism. In his final chapter entitled The Pleasures of Slow Time, he points to practical steps that he is taking; simple lifestyle choices such as only responding to emails once a week, weekly fishing outings, not turning on the radio or cell phone during his half hour commute to work, reserving 4:30 - 8:30 every day for family, and monthly trips to orchestral performances. These are just a few among numerous suggestions made in this hopeful and practical chapter on how to swim against the current. In the end, Eriksen says our lives \\"must consist in finding balance, that is creating a world which is spacious enough to give room for a wide, inclusive both-and (as opposed to that Protestant principle, either-or).\\"I highly recommend this book; it is filled with brilliant insight, reams of useful information, and a hopeful vision for a life well lived. And it is all shared by a man who sees the challenges ahead, but has managed to keep his sense of humor. Quite an achievement."},{"Title":"The Potiphar Papers.","review":"\\"The Potiphar Papers\\" is shown to contain illustrations by the author, George William Curtis, as well as another individual, A.Hoppin.

My students (Graduate level English majors) love this book, we all find it very helpful because of the way it specifically traces roots in each words breakdown allowing the reader to understand many more words that are related.

I picked up this book for the title and the publisher. They betrayed me. This work ,certaily, contains Latin and Greek origins and their derivatives, but doesn't mention any grammarical points without which we cannot grasp the morpholgy of Latin or Greek derived English words. Further, the vocabulary index at the end of it counts only 2,000 or so. I can list more than that without any preparation, ad-lib. You can find more authentic information even in [Wheelock's Latin]. I'd rather recommend [The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], which is the best for English etymology. So if you are a serious reader, forget this book.However, this work has easy-to-read format and some cartoon-like illustrations. I guess this is intended for the senior elementary school students.

And they're killers:- Each description is a paragraph, or two at most. You can't tell me very much about a dive site in so few words.- There are no maps / diagrams for specific dive sites (just area overview maps) - a dive guide fails totally without these.It's a pretty book, but to be any use you need to include maps and more detail per site (if this was done it could be forgiven for not being totally comprehensive).In short, it's nice, but it's no use as a tool for researching a dive holiday.What'S further is I now own two of these (Red Sea and Bahamas) - I certainly will not buy another."},{"Title":"The Bonemender","review":"This is a wonderful story combining humans, elves, healing, friendship, prejudice, war, and love.

Gabrielle is a bonemender - a healer with unusual abilities, not seen in most humans. While recovering, F&eacute;olan approaches Gabrielle's father, the King, with some distressing news - the people of a neighboring country are mounting forces for an attack. Not sure whether or not to trust the elves, scouts are sent to evaluate the situation - never to return. The country starts preparing for war, including the bonemenders, while Feolan and Danais continue on their journey. But Gabrielle and F&eacute;olan's hearts are torn now that they are no longer together. How will either of them survive the upcoming battles? I am not usually a fan of the war/battle stories but it isn't the focus of this story. I thought this a delightful young adult story written well. Next up is The Bonemender's Oath."},{"Title":"The Bonemender","review":"When I picked up this book I was unsure whether I would enjoy it. The plot line was generic, a younge woman who is extraordinary with no real reason for it, but I thought that would leave room for interesting twists curtesy of Mrs. Bennett. I was sorely, sorely disappointed.Let's start with the characters themselves; Gabrielle the protagonist is a boring character. She is a princess, an extraordinary bonemender, compassionate, unprejudiced, strong willed and strong minded, has a wonderful voice and is exremely beautiful. Therein lies the problem. Instead of giving us a multifaceted character that grows and learns to overcome their faults and problems Mrs. Bennette gives us a perfect character with a great lack of faults, or none at all to be honest. It is a lazy way to create a character as if to say \\"Here is the lead, have your pick of stuff to like about her.\\" I was not rooting for Gabrielle I could not relate to her at all. I relate to quirks and faults.Fealon and Danais are the elves. Feolan falls in love with Gabrielle and their romance is stilted and unbelievable. As is most of the book and their conversations.Danais is the reason they meet Gabrielle when he is gored by a boar, very early in the story. This, which should have been interesting as Danais struggles for his life read as; oops blood. Good luck! Found a girl with crazy healing skills. HE LIVES! (Unessesary healer babble) It obvious that he will live. Gabrielle can do anything!The most interesting character was Tristan, Gabrielle's younger brother. He was much more multifaceted and the only character I invested in.I did not care about the characters, I did not care what happened in the convinent and loose ending and if one is not invested enough in the book to care for the characters and their future than the book isn't much good.Over all: Generic, overdone plot, Flat characters, Slow climax, stilted speech. Boring story.

I personally love fantasy, and I hoped to read some fresh materials, but this book definitely did not bring anything new.Starting with Gabrielle's mysterious birth to the generic plot line, I felt like I was just reading a poorly-written (and sappy) romance novel. I honestly could not read more than 50 pages per day because of the sappiness in some parts.Overall, the story is extremely simple, very easy to follow (and foreshadow), and cliche, so I would only suggest elementary school kids or ESL students to read this book."},{"Title":"The Bonemender","review":"I enjoyed the story, even though I think it is written more for middle school than for high school readers.

She has sucked from day one. I don't know a Spenser reader (and I know many) who doesn't cringe at the mention of Susan.I wonder if it would be possible to surgically remove all the Susan portions of the books and have them still make sense? Probably an improvement.There is really only one thing any future Spenser book can do to atone for all the annoying intrusions of Susan: shoot her.Far from feeling grief or remorse, I predict Spenser will feel a jubilant sense of liberation.Certainly his readers will."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"What is the going rate to investigate a twenty-eight year old murder? If you're Spenser, and the request comes from surrogate son, Paul Giacomin, the price is a hefty six Krispy Kreme doughnuts, paid up front. Paul's friend, Daryl Gordon, is looking for answers. Back in 1974, her mother, Emily, was shot and killed during a bank robbery right here in Boston. A hippie revolutionary group, The Dread Scott Brigade, claimed responsibility, and then, along with the stolen money, disappeared. There seemed to be few clues and leads to this robbery/murder, and the unsolved case has been cold and pretty much forgotten, all these years, until Spenser decides to take a look and stir things up. Now as two unlikely partners, the mob and the FBI, threaten Spenser to lay off and let this old crime remain unsolved, it's just the push he needs to dig deeper and see the case to its bitter end..... After a couple of rather disappointing, lackluster Spenser novels, Robert Parker is back in rare form, and Spenser's thirtieth outing is as intriguing and entertaining as his first. Mr Parker's well-paced story line is tense and compelling, filled with non-stop action, vivid, riveting scenes and brilliant characterizations. But as always, it's his spare, crisp prose and droll, witty dialogue that is the strength of this novel, and no one does it better than the P.I. Grand Master of them all. For those new to Robert Parker and Spenser, start with some of his earlier mysteries to get a real feel for the series and its characters. For those who are already fans, kick back, visit with old friends, and enjoy. Back Story is a strong addition no mystery lover should miss."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This is the first Robert Parker that I've tried and I have to admit I am kicking myself for not trying the Spencer series sooner. I was avoiding this books for years (despite many recommendations) because of the old TV series which featured Robert Urich. I just couldn't picture that actor playing what I knew of Parker's alter ego Spencer. It just didn't mesh in my mind.The dialog is crisp and funny, the story moves and the book reads quickly. It took me a little over two hours to finish it (yes I read quickly) and was amused throughout.This is by no mean the best book of the century, it doesn't pretend to be. But for what it is, the descendent of pulp mysteries designed to entertain, it is wonderful.My one thought, and maybe by reading more of the series this will be less obvious, but every character seems to have the same speech pattern. (and no I don't mean a Boston accent) Everyone from Spencer to Susan to every cop or sherrif, all speak in the same clipped and sardonic fashion. Don't get me wrong, the sarcasm was witty, but everyone the same? It almost as if they are all shades of Spencer the central wiseass.Bottom line: I'm going to try more of this series and would recommend this one for others to try."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"The time setting is 2002. Spenser takes on a case to solve a murder that occurred 28 years earlier during a bank robbery.He finds that there are dangerous people who do not want the case reopened. The trail leads back through the hippie generation of 30 years ago. He uncovers information that the client did not want to bring to the surface, and discovers a complex Web involving the family of a mob boss.A few people get shot along the way, but the ending is a little disappointing. I would have hoped that he would take out some of the really bad guys, perhaps dropping some information about how one of them had been an informer. Instead he seems to maintain a live and let live attitude with the main criminals."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This is the 30th(?) Spenser novel, and I've probably read all of them. I've only been disappointed by one of them, and this one was a decent return to the form and content of the original dozen or so.The storyline goes like most of them - Spenser takes a hardluck case, finds very few clues but continues to poke around until someone reacts. He is a smart Private Investigator, but mostly he is very persistant and willing to stir up trouble. Lots of good one liners."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I think &quot;Back Story&quot; is a cut above its predecessor, and definitely worth reading if you are already a fan. If you are new to Parker, go find the older Spenser titles first, so you can grow along with the characters. This one is a quick read, of course, with the 95 percent dialogue style Parker is famous for.The twist here is that another of his series characters, police chief Jesse Stone, makes a cameo appearance. Now there are 30 books in the Spenser series, and I do expect an end soon, perhaps by retirement. Still, Hawk and Susan and the dogs and Vinnie are annual companions for me of long-standing and much affection, and I felt this entry was a worthy one."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This is going to be a quick short review.This is one of the best Spenser novels so don&#65533;t miss this one if you&#65533;re a Spenser fan.Paul Giacomin brings Spenser an unsolved murder case, 30 years ago.

People try to kill Spenser, but you know that&#65533;s not a good idea, especially with Hawk around. We even get a cameo appearance by Jesse Stone, a character in another Parker series.All in all a very satisfying addition to the series."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I have read three or four of Robert Parker's Spenser novels, mostly the audio book versions. There is something about the writing style that lends itself especially well to the audio format; I suppose it's the terse dialogue and fast pace. In any event, Back Story is the first Spenser novel I've read in print, and I must say I enjoyed it less than the others. If I counted right, Back Story is the thirtieth Spenser novel. With such a prolific series, a certain amount of repetition and predictability is inevitable, but this book seemed a little bit too by-the numbers, so much like previous entries with only the specifics updated for the new story. Still, Spenser is an entertaining character. He is able to make witty observations in even the most hazardous of circumstances. The usual supporting characters are in this novel as well -the sinister Hawk, Spenser's girlfriend Susan and expert marksman Vinnie. Back Story has all the elements readers have come to expect from a Parker novel, so maybe that should be enough. The basic mood is always light, no matter how much violence is going on. In this novel, Spenser is persuaded by his stepson Paul and Paul's friend Daryl to investigate the thirty year old murder of Daryl's mother. She was apparently killed by a revolutionary group calling itself the Dread Scott Brigade. Spenser soon finds that both local gangsters and law enforcement officials are trying to prevent him from looking into this killing. Some of Parker's cultural biases come out in this novel. He seems to categorize anyone affiliated with the 1960s counterculture as a violent revolutionary or a pot-smoking vegetable. The latter is a bit amusing when you consider that Spenser's diet seems to consist mainly of doughnuts, coffee and hard liquor. The bad guys of Back Story are of the basic suspense novel/B-movie variety -mafioso and their dumb but menacing bodyguards; wisecracking drug dealers and the mandatory psychopath whose mission is to kill Spenser. Robert Parker is a talented enough novelist that he can, at this point, get away with coasting on a winning formula and that is what he's done in Back Story. It's a fast-paced, often humorous, sometimes suspenseful but unmemorable entry in this time-honored series."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This was my first Spenser book. (And yes, it is nonetheless quite pleasant here on my planet ;-) Sure, I'd seen glimpses of the late Robert Urich TV show while surfing around the dial - but never really read one of these. (Quot libros, quam breve tempus: Too many books, too little time!) What caught my eye was a blurb about this one talking about similarities to the Symbionese Liberation Army and the Patty Hearst thing. I was intrigued.Prior reviews have lugubriously belabored Back Story's plot. Suffice it to say that Spenser, Hawk, their old and new friends, associates, and acquaintences are out to solve an old cold case of a 70's bank heist by the one-hit-wonder \\"Dread Scott Brigade.\\" The story moves swiftly back and forth chronologically and geographically (if one is going to investigate hippie sects, one must get out of Boston and go to San Francisco/Berkley) accompanied by snappy dialogue. My favorite: Hawk's translation of Kemo Sabe.All in all, a cool trip! Reviewed by TundraVision"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"BACK STORY puts us back in the familiar groove that I believe Parker slipped out of with the inferior WIDOW'S WALK and POTSHOT. The story is original, the wisecracks are genuinely funny and not tiresomely \\"cute,\\" the characters are true-to-form without being predictable. In short, I loved it!The characters have taken on lives of their own, and their interplay adds texture to the story. I loved Spenser's discomfort with Darryl's cautious reaction to Pearl. And I especially enjoyed Hawk's observation about Susan/Spenser conversation: he points out that first one of them says something cryptic, then the other one simply agrees. So true!Spenser gets very introspective about his chosen line of work. I wonder if that, combined with the introduction of Jesse Stone, means that Spenser might be preparing us for his retirement. And maybe it's time. While I admit I loved this book, I can't shake the knowledge that these characters are getting long in the tooth chronologically. Spenser served in Korea and quit smoking 40 years ago. That would put him in his 60s. Since he boxed professionally alongside Hawk, Hawk must be in that same range, yet women of all ages keep throwing themselves at him. And Susan, so beautiful and firm of flesh, can't be much behind them. Is the Charles River really the fountain of youth? Sorry, but credibility is strained. (A small criticism of an otherwise great read.)"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"One reads the Spenser series not for the convoluted plot but for the characters we've grown to love. The witty repartee that takes place among Spenser, Hawk, Susan, Quirk and Belson is worth the price of admission. I guess I don't care how old Spenser and Hawk are nor do I feel the need to be judgemental about their unique code of honor or set of rules that govern their behavior. I simply enjoy the Spenser series or what it has been and continues to be for me - a fun read!"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"When I picked up &quot;Back Story,&quot; the 2003 Spenser novel from Robert B. Parker of course the first thing that came to my mind was to wonder how Pearl was doing. By page 2 we know the answer to that lingering question at which point we are distracted by the story of Daryl Gordon, the young woman that Paul Giacomin has brought to see Spenser (she stars in his play). In 1974 a revolutionary group calling itself the Dread Scott Brigade staged a robbery at the Shawmut Bank in Boston's Audubon Circle. During that robbery a woman named Emily Gordon, there to cash a traveler's check, was shot and killed. Daryl is Emily's daughter and wants the person who killed her mother to be brought to justice. Since Paul brought a half-dozen Krispy Kremes along with Daryl, our hero is willing to see what he can find out even thought the murder happened, as we are repeatedly told, twenty-eight years ago. There are a lot of things that Spenser does not do, and round up numbers is one of them. Ironically, of course, this is the 30th Spenser novel.&quot;Back Story&quot; certainly represents all aspects of the Spenser formula. There is the tried and true practice of asking questions to see what shakes loose, death threats that require Susan to be protected and gunmen to avoid, and all those witty and philosophical discussions between Spenser and Hawk (as well as Vinnie, Quirk, Jesse Stone, and whoever else shows up along the way). However, Spenser really does not cook as much as he did in the early days. Spenser finds out more than Daryl ever wanted to know, which makes it doubtful that she will be joining the ranks of our hero's expanding \\"family,\\" and once again puts our hero in the position of being judge, jury, and lord high executioner as he tries to make the world right.The results are enjoyable as always and Parker's novels are perfect for people who like to get a quick chapter in here and there throughout the day, but there is a sense in which Spenser is just going through his standard bag of tricks. I swear, if somebody came in and threw down a copy of the Warren Commission Report our hero would ask a few questions and somebody who come out of the woodwork to tell him to leave that JFK thing along and he would end up solving that one too. However, the ending does find our hero taking a position that might be somewhat contrary to his nature and even if we have read literally hundreds of witty exchanges between Spenser and the people he encounters they are still appealing (especially the ones with his second bananas)."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Spenser, Susan, and Hawk continue to provide the reader with suspense, laughter, love, and loyalty; all this without an excessive amount of profanity......Spenser is still sleuthing with the assistance of his long time friend and assistant, Hawk.

A few years ago, I thought the series got stale and stopped reading them. This book was a pleasnat surprise because it was as sharp and fresh as the early Parker/Spenser mysteries. The characters have again begun to evolve and have some depth. Back Story has a better than usual plot which brings it to the four star level.Spenser is asked to solve a 28 year old murder and bank heist(for the fee of 6 Krispy Kreme donuts). Hawk is in on the action early and Susan is always there as well - as well as a new Pearl. Spenser has to go back to the hippy/radical world of the early seventies and the question and investigate the players who have now grown to middle age. The plot has some clever twists and interesting characters woven in to give it depth. The mobsters are in on action to add the requisite danger and intrigue.I recommend this to any Spenser fan as the best in the series in a while.

In the course of running down leads, Spenser encounters a situation where a group of men wants to kill him. Spenser tells Susan who in turn tells Hawk. Hawk says they have to go to the mattresses. It isn't clear where the threat is coming from. Hawk and Spenser wonder how the mob could possibly be connected. It is strange that anyone would need to cover-up a twenty-eight year old murder. The two men decide to leave Boston and go to San Diego. The investigation starts to veer into the daughter of a mobster who was a class mate of the murdered woman. Interestingly, and this is the the 1960's, the daughter of the mobster was into causes of every kind. Eventually the client does not want to know anything additional about the case after things have taken a rather sordid turn. Nevertheless, Spenser and Hawk do manage to sift down and shoot down the truth. The books is of interest mainly as a demonstration of how an investigation might proceed with so few leads.

It appeared to be a random shooting, as it occurred when a bank was robbed by a seventies revolutionary group called the Dread Scott Brigade. The victim, a woman named Emily Gordon, was a visitor from out of town who was in the bank cashing travelers checks. At first, it appears hopeless, but as the detective starts chasing down the particulars of the case, he suddenly finds that the FBI has stonewalled the investigation. Shortly after that revelation, he is the target of some mob soldiers bent on assassination.The story takes several different turns and involves many characters of dubious backgrounds and integrity. However, the main plot line is strong enough to overcome the tangents and we come to learn all of the facts in the case. I listened to the story in my car and there were some points that held my attention so well that I sat in my car and listened until a local cliffhanger was resolved.

If yo enjoy novels with decent plotting and amusing style, you will enjoy \\"Back Story\\"."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"There is one trait about mystery series, which might not hold water for all readers, that I find interesting. As a series moves over the years, the interest moves from the case work to the personality of the detectives. When I first read Spenser I read the books for the puzzles and the action sequences. Now, I read them because of the characters--who feel like old friends--and what is happening. Each book of the series, in brief, becomes like a letter from an old friend.\\"Back Story\\" is such a book. The actions of Spenser, Hawk, and Susan are so well known to followers of the series that we are not surprised by Spenser's price for solving the mystery, the bond between Hawk and Spenser which allows them to move from Standard English to a form of Black English and the reactions of Spenser to attempts at pulling him off the case. It is a salute to Parker's ability as a writer that he keeps these characters and their actions fresh.There is also a reality about the death of Pearl the Wonder Dog and the pain which comes from such a loss. Pearl was a highpoint of the series because a reader (at least this one!)could see himself watching his dog all the time, noting her reactions, and having the feel of a proud owner/friend.Pearl was always in the background and she would be missed and griefed over. We also lost a dog and the feelings are real. The buying of a new dog to take the mantle of the older dog was something I have done--a nice touch of realism."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"It is seldom that a story is written that starts at the birth of a character then proceeds linearly to that character's death. Instead the story starts at some point in the protagonist's life and inserts the necessary parts of his/her life as necessary; this is called the back story. Parker has done this to one of his characters in this Spenser novel and Spenser sets out to flesh out this back story. The woman's name is Daryl Gordon, she is introduced as Daryl Silver and the first step is to determine her name. Then she states her mother was killed 28 years earlier and she bribes Spenser to take the case by feeding him a half dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts and asks him to find out who killed her mother. Spenser continually says he is taking the case due to these doughnuts.The case is complicated by the changes Spenser finds as he begins his investigation.A tough mobster is involved who tells Spenser to stay out because the mobster's family is involved. This is a mistake, the warning is ignored and Spenser bores on in. Mothers and fathers are switched, race is involved, murders occur and Spenser keeps bulling along. Not only is Spenser involved, so are the city police, the state cops, and even the FBI.Parker stirs the pot, people fade in and out, hippies intrude, and Spenser finds out the true mother and father, straightening out the back story. The whole book is about this back story, no principals are killed and Spenser lets the mobster go despite the killings he has done to protect his family. It is not Spenser's fault, it is Parker's doings and I think it ruins the whole book. It is not the first time Spenser lets murderers off."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"If you're from the Boston area, and you haven't read at least a couple of Spencer novels, you're missing a cultural icon. Boston and environs are as much a star as the erudite ex-boxer turned detective, Spencer.This is the 30th book of the Spencer series, and it's tired and formulaic. There's no real tension, the ending isn't particularly surprising (or interesting). It's not clear to me if the characterizations would hold at all if you hadn't read some of the other Spencer books.Maybe it's time for Spencer to retire."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"You know a series is in a rut when the author can't even introduce a new dog into the mix! The trio of Spenser, Hawk and Susan is so overly familar at this point that a different kind of mutt would have been most welcome. And sad to say, Parker can't be bothered to pause in his encomiums to Susan's perfection and Lucky Magazine-like riffs on Hawk's natty duds to make any attempt to develop the characters in this outing. Credulity is a bit strained as well--five bloody shooting deaths in a week and no heat on Spenser? Come on.Dialogue is still crisp and settings are vivid, however, so even second-rate Parker is a cut above most of the stuff out there."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"At this point it's kind of academic, telling people that Spenser novels are fun to read. They're so easy to follow, quick to digest, and fun to enjoy, that it's almost a shame when the book proves to only be 280 pages or so long. The dialog's snappy, the characters interesting, and of course the plot winds up being almost irrelevant, just a vehicle for Spenser, Hawk, Vinnie, Capt. Quirk, and the gang to sit and talk for a while, and then shoot some bad guys.This time around, Paul Giacomin (Spenser's adoptive son, first seen in one of the best Spenser novels, Early Autumn) brings Spenser a client, a young actress he knows whose mother was murdered in a bank robbery almost thirty years ago. She wants Spenser to find who shot her mother, and, Spenser being Spenser, when it turns out that she brought half a dozen Krispy Kreme donuts for him, he impulsively takes the case. I guess Spenser hasn't been caught up in the low-carb diet craze.Instead, he soon finds himself mired in a decades-old murder case where all of the principles seem to have been Simbionese-Liberation-Army-type lunatics who waved guns around and shot people randomly, and just caught this young woman in the crossfire. Things are not what they seem, however, and everyone from the FBI to the CIA to the local mafia gets involved, trying to tell Spenser to leave the case alone and find something else to do. This, of course, only provokes Spenser, and makes him more curious about what's happening.I enjoy Parker's writing immensely, and as I said, the plot's secondary to the characters, the dialog, and the writing. Parker by now has become the closest we're going to have (I think) to Raymond Chandler, and he's a great deal more prolific, thankfully. This was a reasonable addition to what's just about the longest-running series in American detective fiction, and what's certainly the most popular."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Robert Parker has yet another great Spenser novel to add to his success list. In Back Story, Spenser agrees to investigate a 28 year old unsolved murder. As he begins to investigate the murder, many unexpected facets appear. The FBI, an aging but very dangerous mobster, a hitman, college radicals and several ex-cons appear and disappear, putting Spenser and the love of his life in extreme danger. Hawk, his friend and most reliable co-conspirator, steps in to act as a bodyguard and to help him unravel the threads of this case. The characters are all there from previous books, even one from another series by Parker and as always they all mesh perfectly to create a novel that is both intriguing and funny. The lines of dialogue are great, the reactions so honest and dealing with unexpected answers only heightens the tension of this novel. Robert Parker is a reliable author, but he is never predictable!"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Let me say first, I am honored to own all 30 Spenser novels. I consider myself a collector to be sure but a consumer first and foremost. For those new to Robert B. Parker (RBP) and Spenser, Spenser is \\"Shakespeare meets Mike Hammer (and then some).\\" What's not to like? Well, with the last few offerings, RBP has, in my opinion, slipped a bit. In his last Spenser offering, WIDOW'S WALK, I was thoroughly disappointed in the uncharacteristically slow pace and lack of Spenserisms; not to mention the total lack of identification of the killer. In BACK STORY, RBP makes a partial comeback to the wit all Spenser fans have come to love, but it is still substandard. And, call me sadistic, but where the heck is Hawk? Yes, he's still in the storyline but his role is somewhat geriatric. I enjoyed the brash, somewhat dark side of Hawk. A bit more mystery and a lot less familiarity.To the story...Spenser's \\"surrogate\\" son, Paul Giacomin, turns up in Boston with a bag of Krispy Kremes and introduces Spenser to a young woman friend, Daryl Silver (nee' Gordon). Daryl asks Spenser to solve a 28-year-old murder (remember, 28, not 30-year old!!). The victim was Daryl's mother, shot to death in a Boston bank when a radical group calling itself the Dread Scott Brigade staged an armed robbery in 1974. The crime was never solved, and now Daryl has come to Spenser for closure, though his fee will have to be the price of a bag of donuts. With true Spenser brio, he readily accepts.Spenser immediately begins to see the facts of the old case don't add up. For one thing, the Dread Scott Brigade allegedly took responsibility for the robbery, and there are photos of the perps. However, strangely enough, no one was ever caught. As Spenser dives deeper into the case files of the authorities, he discovers the FBI knows things it won't share, and Daryl's perpetually-stoned father has sources of income Spenser can't explain. Not only was the case seemingly dropped before it got started, it has been covered up. A key FBI intelligence report is missing from both the Boston Homicide and FBI files. And, in a contrasting twist, Spenser discovers the mob wants the case closed as well.After an author successfully writes 30 novels with the same main character, achievement isn't at issue. And this story is worth the read if for no other reason than the author is RBP and the main character is Spenser. The combination is difficult to resist and I'll continue to read all of RBP's Spenser iterations. However, and this will be unpopular, RBP is not focusing on Spenser and Hawk in the fashion he used to. Pinpointing my issue, Spenser's wit is present but laconic relative to past offerings. Hawk is present but impotent relative to past offerings. The ending, well, let's just say it passed with a wimper. Not the usual RBP blast.All-in-all, BACK STORY is worth the read if one is a Spenser fan. However, in this reviewer's opinion, this book just barely reaches the 4-star level. I'm hoping for more wit and action in the next offering."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I've read most of the Spenser novels, and I thought BACK STORY was a relatively weak entry in the series.The plot of BACK STORY involves Spenser investigating a murder committed during a 30-year old bank robbery. Parker has constructed an intricate plot here, but I felt the storyline was a bit too convoluted, with Spenser rushing from place to place to place (San Diego, LA, Maine, etc.) almost non-stop. Most of the scenes are too short and not well developed enough. Most of the supporting characters are also quite thin. As a result, I didn't find this book particularly suspenseful or engaging in the end.Still, BACK STORY is mildly enjoyable because Parker's writing style is enjoyable. The dialogue is sharp and funny, and the plot interested me enough to complete the book. Parker doesn't write a great book every time, but his novels are almost always entertaining.So BACK STORY isn't bad, but don't make it your first Spenser novel. My advice is to start with the earlier ones first, starting with the GODWULF MANUSCRIPT and GOD SAVE THE CHILD."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Paul Giacomin brings one of his friends to Spenser, a young woman named Daryl. Her mother was killed in a bank robbery 28 years ago - blame was accepted by a revolutionary group calling themselves the Dread Scott Brigade, although no one ever discovered who it was that pulled the trigger and killed Emily Gordan. When Spenser begins to dig, he finds some puzzling inconsistencies in the police file - and almost immediately receives a threat from two dark-suited men claiming to be from the government, acting in the interests of national security. The deeper Spenser digs, the weirder things become.I enjoyed this book a great deal. Jesse Stone makes a brief appearance. Vinnie, Ty-Bop and even Junior show up to help with guard duties, which I found immensely amusing. I'm not certain how surprising other people will find the twists in the book - I never saw them coming, but I can be kind of stupid about things like that. Willful suspension of belief and all that, I suppose. Not to be missed by the Spenser fan!"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Half way through, I was ready to cream this 30th Spenser offering, but by the time I finished (i.e., about an hour later), I softened. It's definitely a step above the recent written-by-rote stuff Parker's been dishing out. He didn't dig in much deeper, but it's a shade better. On the other hand, I found the dialogue between Spenser and Hawk and Susan so repetitive and, well, barfy, that it almost ruined it for me. I'll keep buying and reading the Spenser books and Parker will keep writing them and making money hand over fist (so who's the fool here?), but I wish he'd do something original, for a change - kill someone off, maybe. But I'm not holding my breath - like a previous reviewer said - he couldn't even kill off the dog without resurrecting him."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"For those of you who are already fans of Parker's witty, aging detective, Spenser, this is another classic tale. Spenser's assignment, the murder of a woman twenty-eight years ago, lacks freshness. But, the chance to meet up again with some of the classic characters - Spenser, Susan, Hawk, Quirk, Vinnie - is well worth the read. They are as charming and multi-faceted as ever. Their faults are human and their loyalties unshakeable.For those who are new to the Spenser series, this novel may appear lacking. It requires at least some familiarity with the characters to really understand what's going on. Otherwise, things like Spenser's agreeing to take on a dangerous case and risk his own life for six Krispy Kreme donuts may seem implausible. However, Spenser and his contacts are worth getting to know. I would recommend to anyone new to the series go back and read some of the old Spenser novels. They are still fun reads today - fast paced, introspective, witty and delightful."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This is an excellent novel. Plot was very suspenseful. Also the ending only is worth waiting for. I'm a Spenser fan for life."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Solid entry in the long-running series delivers a pretty good mystery story, a few tense moments of danger, and some really funny banter between Spenser and Hawk. Readers also get to see Parker's other hero, police chief Jesse Stone, entertainingly interact with Spenser and Hawk for about twenty pages. As an added bonus, the novel is refreshingly free of Mr. Parker's usual endorsements for psychiatrists, therapists, etc., the bane of many of his thrillers. I'm glad he's been lightening up on that stuff lately, as it was getting a bit tiresome. Not EVERYONE needs to rush out to a psychiatrist to solve their problems, after all. Finally, also interesting is that &quot;Back Story&quot; delivers quite an indictment on many aspects of the hippie generation (see the quote at the top of this review), an indictment that comes off as credible even if you admire a lot of what that generation was trying to do. All in all, an entertaining and thoughtful read."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Boston private investigator Spenser isn't an easy touch, but Paul Giacomin is like a son to him so he is willing to go the extra mile to do the man a favor. Paul, a playwright, wants Spenser to help his friend actress Daryl Silver who is starring in his play, to find out who killed her mother Emily in a Boston bank robbery in 1974. Daryl wants closure and Paul pays Spenser's fee, a box of Krispy Cr&egrave;me donuts.The Dread Scott Brigade took credit for the killing and the robbery but nobody was ever caught even thought the bank cameras caught their picture. Spenser gets the police file from the Boston Police Department and notices right away that the FBI intelligence report is missing. A little deeper into the investigation Spenser is warned of the case by government agents and is on the hit list of a crime kingpin. Even though it has become very dangerous, Spenser is determined to find out who killed Daryl's mother, if only to satisfy his curiosity.It has been thirty years since the first Spenser book THE GODWULF MANUSCRIPT was published and the series is still fresh, innovative and very entertaining. The hero might be a little older but he still has the same quirky sense of humor and the ability not to flinch when bullets are coming in his direction. BACK STORY is a fascinating who-done-it that is both believable and somewhat nostalgic. Robert B. Parker shows why his hero has become an American icon.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Parker came upon a unique and clever idea when he befan writing the Spenser series. The characters were of interest and the plots well tailored. Although this series would never be confused with great, or even good literature, it was always good for a fast and harmless read. It seems as if the writer is going to the well far too often. The story is more miss than mysyery and the story becomes tedious at times. The story is rather predictable and this entry lacks the snappy writing style that was so evident in the earlier books of this series. The characters are like oft-used stereotypes andthere is little development of them. It was a good run yet appears to be time to give this character a rest."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"When a friend of his foster son Paul offers him half a dozen donuts to find out who killed her mother 28 years previously, Private Detective Spenser takes the job. It's just the kind of funky job that interests him. But when the police report turns up missing the critical FBI report, Senser suspects that there is more to the case than a simple bank robbery. When both mob and FBI enforcers warn him to back off the job, he knows that something is rotten, but he still can't get to the bottom of the case. Along with muscle from side-kick Hawk and wise philosophical advice and frequent sex from main-squeeze Susan Silverman, Spenser sets off on a case that won't bring in any money, can't result in a happy ending for anyone, and just might end up getting him, or Susan, killed.Author Robert B. Parker uses witty dialogue, occasional literary illusion, and male-bonding between Spenser and Hawk to propell the story forward. Fortunately for the reader, Susan is allowed to play a minor (if annoying) role in this story providing emotional support to Spenser and validating the killing that this job requires him to make. After two decades of Spenser stories, Spenser seems little older and is still a tough guy that remembers and uses his boxing skills.Parker's characterization, dialogue, and story-telling are all firing in BACK STORY. Although I found the end to be a bit anticlimactic, BACK STORY is one of the better recent Spenser novels."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"When an author has been writing a series through 29 volumes, there is always the possibility of the stories taking on a 'cookie cutter' similarity. To some degree, this is unavoidable, since a series requires a certain predictability in its characters and type of plot. Robert Parker's Spenser novels are no exception to this rule, but Parker is one of those writers who can usually find a new twist, even in an old pattern. 'Back Story' is a grand example of Parker's story telling skills, still fresh after all these years.A friend of Spenser's 'nearly' adopted son, Paul Giacomin, Daryl Gordon, draws Spencer into the thirty-year-old murder of her mother . The killing occurred in the middle of a bank robbery, committed by the Dread Scott Brigade, a 70's revolutionary group. There were no witnesses, and no one was ever caught. For Paul's sake, Spenser reopens the case and discovers a web of subterfuge surrounding the investigation. FBI reports have been squelched, all the characters seem to have unexpected links to each other, and finally, Spenser's own life is threatened.Into this chaos steps Hawk, Spencer's long time friend and co-perpetrator. These two are one of mystery's original black/white partnerships, and one of the hallmarks of Parker's style is the politically incorrect, whiplash banter that takes place between the two. They make fun of their own stereotypes (and ours) while scaring their suspects witless.Spencer's other partner is his very significant other, Susan, who does not participate in the investigations but is often all that keeps Spenser on this side of sanity. She adds wit, insight and an unselfconscious sexuality to what otherwise might be a grim story of tawdry revenge.The story, while not particularly complex, takes some surprising twists. There is a high violence content, not unusual for Spencer and Hawk, but Parker always manages to use violence without making it into an end in itself. What is unusual this time is Spencer's own introspection at the brutal aspect of his nature. Feeling his own maturity, he begins to wonder what he is really looking for. Susan, the psychologist, has answers, and the pair seem to grow before the reader's eyes.Thoroughly modern, 'Back Story' reads like vintage Parker - a swiftly moving plot, snappy dialogue, and respectable characters. Even if you have skipped the last few, I think you will find this one worth reading. Newcomers need have no fear. The relationship between the characters becomes clear quickly, and the story does not depend on any of the 29 previous novels."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Parker is a much better writer than this book reveals. It is a poor value for the price. I read it in an evening. Big type, lots of white space. Not much plot or character development.All the usual buttons are pushed in all the usual ways. No real surprises. Even the new dog is bored.I think Parker is getting weary of this series. It reads as if he produced this one in his sleep after much nagging from his editor or agent for just one more Spencer.If you must read it, get it at the library before spending your money. It is certainly better than much in this genre."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I was a big fan of this series for a long time but I find it to be a little stale. It's not that back story is bad, it's just not anything new. If you've read one Spenser isthe last ten years you have read them all. It's the same cast of characters, Hawk, Susan and Vinny and Quirk. Same storyline. Spenser takes a job for no money, angers people, someone tries to kill him and he calls in backup. Parker needs to take a break and come up with something new for this series."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Too many of my favorite authors are jeopardizing their work by dragging in material that they seem to think is of social importance or is &quot;true to life.&quot; I buy mysteries and thrillers to be entertained, and to revisit characters I've grown to like. Robert Parker is one of the few whose books I still buy in hardbound, as soon as they're out, because he consistently tells a good story. &quot;Back Story&quot; was Parker (and Spenser and Hawk) at their reliable best. I've written eleven academic books, but I'd swap them to have done just one novel that engaged its readers as Parker's novels have engaged me."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"It was fun to visit with all the old characters, and the Spenser/Susan/Hawk interplay is very enjoyable, but there's a big plot mistake.On pp. 180-181, Spenser, looking at Anne Fahey's college yearbook, is struck by the resemblance between Emily and Daryl. Emily's photo &quot;could have been Daryl with a protest sign.&quot;&quot;Her daughter looks just like her,&quot; he says.Later in the story, Daryl turns out to be the child of Bunny/Bonnie, the gangster Karnofsky's daughter. Emily had unofficially adopted Daryl.So how could Daryl resemble Emily?"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"First off, you don't want this to be your first Spenser book. If you don't know the character, go back to the first book, THE GODWULF MANUSCRIPT, and follow the series from there.Some readers figure Spenser to be around 70 &amp; think he should retire, but when he just gets paid in doughnuts like with this case, how can he afford to retire?OK, we do envision Spenser as being in his 40's, but even if he's older, he voices his opinion of retiring in this book and you can tell he wouldn't know what to do with himself.The story here is good, dealing with a few left over hippies. A lady friend of Paul's wants to know who killed her mother back in the 60's, and so Spenser collecting his fee consisting of six Krispy Kreme doughnuts digs into the past and comes up with more than his client wants to know. In the meantime, he manages to disturb one of the ganglords who just happens to live in Paradise, and so he meets the police chief, Jesse Stone. The two Parker characters working together, even briefly, envigorate the story.Recent Spenser books have been a bit disappointing, but this one is back on track."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I award 5 stars measuring this book against others of the genre, not as Great Literature.I regret that Parker is gone, now, for I always enjoy his books; a friend calls them &#34;eye candy,&#34; and so they are. The plots are interesting and his half-dozen main, ongoing characters, while not wholly credible, are a hoot. Back Story is just one more fun book."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Not one of my favorite Spencer series novels but I loved the mixing of Spenser and Jesse Stone in this book."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I love the Spencer series and all of Robert Parker's books.

We get Hawk active in this one, of course, Quirk and a good guy FBI Epstein, Vince, and other none enforcers and repeat characters like Samuelson from LA.

I enjoyed reading about the grown up Paul, whom Spenser 'rescued' as a young teen. Good story!!! I bought it so I can reread it now and then."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This was the first Parker book I ever read. I picked it up in an airport out of desperation when I had nothing left to read.While I liked it enough to read it through, and the story moved along, I found myself increasingly annoyed by the dialog. Every other line of banter spoken by the characters is a clever little quip. It's like they're all trying to be funny--all the time. It gets old quickly and has the effect of making each character sound exactly the same. They're all witty and full of one-liners."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"If I could have given this story zero stars I would have. The story wasn't interesting and the characters were flat. Hell after thirty books you would think that they would get better. The average chapter length is only two and a half pages, making it difficult to really get into the story. I have read reviews from past novels that said that Parker is the heir to that icon of the hard-boiled dectective story, Raymond Chandler, but even Chandler had more than two pages per chapter. Marlowe and the supporting cast in all of Chandler's books are more interesting than any in this book. For some reason I felt compelled to finish the book but it was a struggle. I just couldn't get into the story. I will have to try some of Parker's other, non Spenser stories. Hopefully they will redeem him in my mind. Don't bother purchasing this book it isn't worth the money, or the time really."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Sometimes it's lucky to be a &quot;Johnny-Come-Lately.&quot; My reason for saying this is that I am not encumbered by the history of something like 30 previous Spenser novels. I have read 3 of them, just enough to become familiar with Spenser, Hawk, and Susan, but not so many that they have become stale characters, or that Parker's plots have become repetitive.Any number of previous reviews have discussed the plot in great detail. In order not to be repetitious, my review will just discuss the plot in barest outline form and then will talk about the main protagonists, their interactions and characteristics.The plot: Spenser takes on a case for a young actress who wants to find out who killed her mother in a bank hold-up some 28 years earlier. In spite of a cold trail, missing documents,and threats on his life, Spenser, with the physical support of his friend, Hawk, and the emotional and analytical support of his lover, Susan, soon finds out enough to make his investigation dangerous to both the FBI, and the most powerful mob figure in Boston, thus making it dangerous to Spenser. It also turns out that what he is uncovering is NOT what his client wants to hear. For the final outcome of this case, I guess that you'll just have to read the book.Now for the promised character studies: Spenser and his ally, Hawk, form quite a duo. They are both in superb physical condition and can handle anyone who tries to intimidate them. Spenser, alone can handle (read manhandle) at least two or three assailants by himself. So, for that matter, can Hawk.Together they can out think, out strategize, and out shoot just about anyone. In at least one case, where Spenser is caught off guard, he also proves that he can outrun just about anyone before turning the tables on them.Hawk and Spenser are not just dumb mugs, between them they can quote from Shakespeare, are students of ancient and modern history, and have a philosophical bent.Susan provides a softer side, but only when softness is appropriate. She is supportive even when Spenser and Hawk need to kill, as long as the killing is necessary to save their own lives.To give Spenser and Hawk credit, they'd rather work out an amicable settlement than to resort to violence, if, of course, their adversaries are amenable to a peaceful settlement.If you like your Private Investigators to be men of terse dialog (a la Hemingway), with a touch of introspection thrown in, I think that you'll really enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I was about a third of the way through BACK STORY, the new Spenser novel by Robert B. Parker, when I happened to get a call from an older friend who had coincidentally first thrust a Spenser novel, PROMISED LAND, into my hands many years ago. I told my friend that I was reading the new Spenser novel and he mentioned that his grandson, who is now in college, had just started reading them. The reason that this is worth relating is that Parker is now writing for three generations of Spenser fans, with no sign of slowing down and, if BACK STORY is any indication, no sign of rust.BACK STORY marks the return of Paul Giacomin, Spenser's almost-son; though he has little involvement in the story, he is its indirect catalyst. For he brings with him Daryl Gordon --- part friend, part acquaintance, part associate and all troubled. Gordon, who is in her thirties, has decided that she needs to put the death of her mother, Emily Gordon, to rest. Emily was murdered some thirty years ago when a leftist revolutionary group calling itself The Dread Scott Brigade robbed a bank in Boston. Emily, who was visiting the city at the time, was shot and killed in the bank while cashing traveler's checks. No one saw who shot her and security cameras were no help. And The Dread Scott Brigade simply...disappeared.Giacomin now brings Daryl to Spenser in order to help solve this coldest of cases, a 30 year-old murder with no clues. As Spenser begins to investigate, he is troubled by the lack of clues and an apparently missing FBI file. Hawk is there to help, as is the mysterious Ives who, in the short course of a page or three, almost steals the book away. As Spenser follows the trail of the missing FBI file and questions Emily's friends and family, he begins to receive warnings from several quarters to back away from the matter. This, of course, makes him all the more determined to discover the truth behind the woman's murder. As the trail leads from San Diego to Boston and back again, Spenser slowly but methodically uncovers a web of passion, deceit and betrayal that has lain fallow for decades. He is also confronted with a dilemma: the truth is something that Daryl may not be prepared to handle. Should he tell her, or should he let things stay as they are?Parker, with BACK STORY, remains as amazingly consistent --- or should that be consistently amazing? --- as ever. He also makes a brief, but poignant, change in a major character, one that was inevitable and not necessarily unexpected, but nonetheless surprising. As always, highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Spenser needs to retire. For those who haven't bothered to notice: it you would compare the physical descriptions of Spenser with the pictures of Parker on the back of the dust jacket you will get the distinct impression Parker is basing Spenser to a great degree on himself. Spenser, as he has said himself, was with MacArthur at Inchon. This makes him at least 70.This latest entry is a bit of a letdown. No mention is made of Spenser's cooking abilities. And absolutely nothing is said about the details of the deal Spenser made with the aging crime boss at the end of the novel.This novel is a pleasant, but like another reviewer has said already: if you really want to read it borrow it from the local library or get it in paperback when it comes out."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Robert B. Parker does what he always does, and what long time fans of his know he can do everytime one of his new releases hits the shelves, he delivers the goods.Backstory isn't the most fantastic of books from a standalone perspective, but from character development, sense of intimacy, and consistent delivery of the goods in the area of craftsmanship, it is a model to all aspiring writers that would one day like to have, and deserve, a loyal following."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Back Story is the 30th novel in the Spenser series. The popularity of this series is a testimony to Parker's ability to weave a compelling story, tell it in a clean and direct way, and sustain the same personalities for a generation.Spenser is still strong. Hawk, his sidekick, is still stronger. They both are fierce protectors of Susan, a lovely psychologist and Spenser's longtime love interest. All three characters are gradually aging but with a continuing commitment to a life worth living.Spenser, a Boston private eye, retains his gift for finding a case that brings him into a threatening relationship with a mobster, who is willing to use hired guns to kill him. When Spenser doesn't back down, Susan's life is threatened. Enter Hawk, whose loyalty to Spenser and Susan is matched only by his deadliness toward anyone who threatens them.If you already love Parker's works, you'll want to purchase Back Story automatically without reading any other reviews. If you have never sampled Parker before, this is an excellent place to begin."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"When a book makes me laugh loudly to the point that I can't control it...it is definitely worth a look! Parker gives his characters such snappy comebacks and hilarious lines that you end up racing for a pad and pen so you can remember to use them on pals at a later time! (shhhhhhhh!;) LOL)Parker has a wonderful sense of timing both in his comedy and his pacing of the story as it opens before the reader.

Daryl Gordon, a friend of Spenser's &quot;surrogate son&quot; Paul Giacomin, asks Spenser to investigate the murder of her mother Emily Gordon in 1974. A radical group calling itself the Dread Scott Brigade claimed responsibility but it seems that no one saw who shot her. As Spenser investigates it becomes apparent that some people will stop at nothing to keep him from uncovering the truth. Sonny Karnofsky, an aging crime boss, puts out a hit on Spenser. Susan and Hawk play important roles, and Susan and Spenser get a new pet. &quot;Back Story&quot; is an excellent addition to this long-running series and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"After a couple of downers, Parker's back - Spenser, Susan and Hawk are all there.

Some good dialogue, some drama, but the same old formula with Hawk as bodyguard, and others assigned to protect Susan while Spenser rubs some bad guys the wrong way. Yada yada yada."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Flipping through pages in BACK STORY feels more like dancing than reading, feels like traveling in foot-tapping-syncopation through smooth-jazz dialogue. Like, COOL, man!Through the first 100 pages, the detecting process flowed from one interview to the next, in each case going to the geography of the lead and doing the talking heads thing as only Parker can pull off with painless rivets attached. I liked the fact that the leads were given one-at-a-time, with the culmination of data applied to memory having been collected in a slow, natural rhythm:-- Get name and address of someone who might know something about the crime.-- Go there.-- Talk to this guy/gal with observation antennae up to the zenith.-- Follow the next lead, given by that person.-- Or, go home first, get a hit and a refueling re-hash visit w/Susan. (Spenser's reverence of her provides a welcome, vulnerable warmth, for my reading tastes.)-- Then go visit the next candidate for input.Somehow that process worked perfectly, gradually seating me into the story through the natural flow of Parker's dialogue and economy of description of settings of each lead-following interview.Not only that, this is how investigations are carried out. (Like, in real life?) So, the realism builds and the reader gets to saunter around in a legitimate detective's shoes, with the full ambiance of the gum. (Love the way Parker includes at least one scene of a detective folding a stick of gum onto his tongue.) In BACK STORY the guns come later, after the talking-heads detecting has set up the show.What CONFIDENCE, when an author does the cerebral deal for a full 100 pages before even CONSIDERING, let alone attempting, a ball seizing, action surge. Please don't get me wrong, though, I'm not meaning to bash action-packed thriller tomes. They have their place, and required taste-bud-uptake-inhibitors, for those for whom cerebral extensions alone, or starting up-front-scene-one (and continuing on through two, three, four, and five) just don't ring the visceral alarm clock. For action-addicts, the Yawn rules until someone literally kicks ass. I understand, even warm to, this personality type and I certainly don't criticize it. I just don't live there. What with my pillow-plush, cushy easy chair taking up such a large part of my life.Even the active danger and shoot-em-up scenes in BACK STORY are engagingly cerebral (in addition to being physically intense). What is strategy. Spenser.This is my second read in Parker's Spenser series, and I not only love his style, I'm truly surprised by it. My stereotype of the hard-guy P.I. is blown. Spenser doesn't get his nose broken every third page; doesn't get his guts sliced out and returned at the end of every chapter, doesn't get a finger pounded to a tenderized crush or hacked off. So, is that stereotype filled by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, or what?Maybe I've been too long recalling WALKING TALL, the movie which came out in the 70's. After about the first ten minutes of dry-swallowing and squirming, of head observing knees, then up one-eyed, then down re-checking knees, then more dry-swallowing and squirming; I walked out into the lobby of the cold, old, vintage theater in Northeast Portland, Oregon, and sat on a tautly-pillowed bench, leaning my upper back and head of long-brown-hair against a swirled concrete wall until the movie signed off and my husband the deputy sheriff and our friends walked out of the curved-cushy-chaired, dark arena facing the cinema screen, after the heavy-velvet curtain had descended on the torturous, blood-spewing, calculated violence. I wonder how drawn and white my face had appeared to the buttered-popcorn people behind the Coke & candy counter. I hadn't happily snapped coins onto the counter for a movie house treat, tiny-round-tokens which have now clipped in cash value to require a fat collection of paper money instead of a few coins with almost no precious metal left in them.WALKING TALL was a very well done, realistic movie which exposed certain types of police \\"procedure\\" which was, in some cases, carried out religiously in small Southern towns seething in swampland miasma. And, yes, the sub-culturally-sanctioned, bacterial-behavior vividly exposed in WALKING TALL has thrived in the most teeming urban sprawls as well as in small communities.No geographic X is immune to the essence of cruelty.I was glad to be married to one of the good guys, who had every right to be walking tall, and who willingly put himself through the torture of watching a movie like that, to make sure he wouldn't ever slip even a Quantum Particle into that type of behavior. He didn't. After working 15 years as a deputy, unformed, and undercover for the DEA for a few years, he retired from the police force and became a commodities broker (he had majored in economics in college). He's still a good guy. I can say that with respect. Even though we're divorced, we've remained friends.What a contrast to Spenser that WALKING TALL exposure of the dark side of police-force-mystique was.Sometimes I wonder how our varieties of lifestyles can exist within the forces-of-gravity of the same planet, though I don't wonder how most of these have been collected between the covers of books, within the celluloid of film (whose messages are now sold through the cell structures of a wide variety of alternate mediums).Thank you, Parker, for giving us 30 books of Spenser! I understand how your work has survived and thrived. Humanity has a good side and emotional health exists (having made its debut well before the birth of Prozac).How did the human race live before pills?I laughed out loud at least 5 times while reading BACK STORY, and was intrigued by Spenser's descriptive passages playing on contrasts between the 70's and now. The altered ambiance of the office space of various police agencies was crisply exposed by Parker's pen, having evolved in a circular path from the chaotic clang of gray metal edges buried in soft piles of mish-mashed paper ... to the pristine prime of Architectural Digest paradigms. The FBI structure and interior was particularly dramatic in decorative temperature changes.Then, of course, there were Parker's cultural commentaries (spoken in singes through Spenser's observations) of the limp-noodle-hand-shake contrast between reefer madness and military diligence, dramatized through the face-slack, lackluster auras of Daryl's half-assed-dad-and-gang; Vs the bet-your-life-on-it backup of Spencer's Hawk-and-criminal-element-cohorts.So, is Parker deifying or hero-ifying a white-collar, silk-T-shirt, orange-jumpsuit gang of Right Wing, literary red necks who spend their surveillance-time reading science tomes on evolution?Is this fascinating author making a point about our species not having evolved much (basing from the 70's) beyond the Chimpanzee/Ape stage? The chimps would be swinging off Liberal limb-edges; the apes would be thundering hairy feet through Conservative mud jungles.Yet, Spenser fits no stereotype. As soon as a slot slithers up to his ankles, he sidesteps the swamp without losing the shine on his shoe. He's a (somewhat) macho, ex-prize-fighter, renaissance man with platinum keys to literary echelon bidet abodes, who grows gourmet taste buds on his tongue and cooks for his psychiatrist significant other. And, he's funny to boot!Parker entered the \\"Cultural Conversation\\" well before the term had been coined.He did it with a sensual maverick slant which he has retained and continually refreshed with subtle, smooth syntax and an ambient attitude, through 3 decades.In BACK STORY Parker successfully weaves the 70's flower-power, sauna climate into the present cool presence of electronic clicks.Clicking off, looking forward to my next Parker detective drama, which in any Age is a steal on steel,Linda G. Shelnutt"},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Lots of white space around every page as usual. I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I hadn't done the math. Spenser and Hawk are over 60, probably pushing 70. Spenser fought in Korea in the 1950s and was at least in his mid-thirties in the first novel in 1974.Parker still writes fight scenes as if Spenser and Hawk are 40 and can stand up against younger, stronger, faster bad guys.I think Spenser has passed his \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" date.It's time for Spenser to retire."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Many of the reviews I've read about Robert B. Parker's latest Spenser novel, Back Story, suggest that it is unlikely to win any new Spenser fans. This may be true, but Parker's 30th Spenser offering seems to be designed not with new fans in mind, but for old Spenser junkies like myself who have grown older along with the gumshoe, Susan, Hawk, Lt. Quirk, and the rest of the series characters. After several novels, a series become less story-driven and more character-driven. Back Story is a classic example.Hired by surrogate son Paul Giacomin for a box of six Krispy Kreme donuts, Spenser sets out to solve the murder of a woman who died in a 1974 bank robbery. Following a trail that's nearly thirty years old, he soon discovers that several people don't want the murder solved -- and that some people are willing to kill to keep it under wraps.Character-wise, Parker pulls out all the stops. In addition to Hawk, Paul, Quirk and Belson, we are re-united with some of Parker's more colorful characters: former Joe Broz gunman Vinnie Morris; Junior and Ty-Bop, two enforcers for black crime kingpin Tony Marcus; and Ives, the mysterious Company man (too bad Parker didn't find a way to weave Rachel Wallace into the story). There is very little suspense in the book, but that's never been Parker's strong suit anyway. Action-wise, the series peaked with A Catskill Eagle, but there are just enough punches and bullets here to keep the story rolling, culminating with a shootout in Harvard Stadium. And of course, there's the fabulous verbal interplay between Spenser, Hawk, Susan, Quirk, Frank Belson, and just about everyone else. Susan, whom I've often found superfluous to the series, shows her value here, as she helps Spenser through a brief bout of self-doubt. Hawk is -- well, he's Hawk: unfailingly loyal to Spenser and Susan, deadly to just about anyone else. And Spenser never lets us down, working a dangerous case for no money, finding out things his client (a co-worker of Paul's) would rather not know, determined to see the case through to the end. Not many people can understand the complex moral code he lives by, but Susan does, Hawk does --and maybe that's enough.If you're a fan of detective fiction and you've never read a Spenser novel, I would recommend that you begin from the beginning and pick up The Godwulf Manuscript, the inaugural novel of the series (I would also wonder what planet you are from, but that's neither here nor there). The Spenser novels truly are one of the great treasures of contemporary American fiction. Back Story is a satisfying read, but it is nothing special -- unless you spend a little time with the characters first."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I don't know what compels me to keep reading Robert B. Parker's &quot;Spenser&quot; series. The plotting has become almost nonexistent, the dialog is recycled from book to book, the books are getting shorter and shorter and Parker mainly seems to amuse himself by seeing how many characters from previous books he can pack into the current one, so it obviously isn't for the fresh, original take on the private eye genre.But it's still fun, dammit. Somehow, Parker always manages to engage my attention. The interaction between Hawk and Spenser still amuses, Spenser's twisted honor code still thrills and Susan's soppy shrinkiness still annoys.In this outing, we are on the hunt for the perpetrator of a killing 30 years in the past. The actual plot is incidental, as Parker seems to be making things up as he goes. The characters are, as usualy, thinly written and heavily dependent on stereotypes. But Spenser gamely travels from Boston to New Hampshire to California and back, giving us all our two hour's worth of lively description and jaunty heroism.If you are already a fan of the series, you've already bought this one and don't need my review. But if you are not already a fan, don't start here. Go back to the fabulous days of Ceremony, A Catskill Eagle, The Judas Goat and you will become a fan, ready to read and grouse over each new entry in the Parker oeuvre."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"You can get Spenser, that's what. A lady wants Spenser to solve her mom's murder from 28 years ago, and once Spenser starts snooping, he discovers both the mob and the FBI wants him to stop. But why? He snoops around a bunch that reminded me of the Sybonese Liberation Army (remember Patty Hearst?), i.e., overgrown hippies who break laws in their quest for social justice.As usual, Robert B. Parker keeps his book moving quickly, with rapid fire action and snippy dialog between Spenser, Hawk and Susan. A classic Spenser novel."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Back Story involves Spenser almost casually in an abandoned trail to a 1974 killing of actress Daryl Silver's (nee Gordon) mother, Emily. When she was 6, Daryl's mother was killed while cashing some traveler's checks in the old Shawmut Bank branch in Audubon Circle. A revolutionary group, the Dread Scott Brigade, was responsible. For openers to the case, Spenser quickly is puzzled by a reference to an FBI intelligence report in the case file . . . a report that has gone missing. Soon, he has visitors who firmly ask him to &quot;desist&quot; from asking questions about Emily Gordon because &quot;it is in the best interest of the United States.&quot; Spenser learns that &quot;a tax audit is not impossible.&quot; Next, a less polite visitor arrives with a gun and shoots a hole in a lamp shade. &quot;Boss wanted you to see me shoot.&quot; As Spenser begins to sort out the crime, his &quot;client&quot; tells him she doesn't want to know any more. Spenser continues relentlessly, despite being &quot;paid&quot; only six Krispy Kreme doughnuts flown in thoughtfully from out of town by Paul Giacomin, Spenser's almost surrogate son. Spenser's sense of duty is even stronger than he thought. He's stirred up a hornet's nest and the hornets had better look out!One of the great appeals of this story is the extensive involvement of lots of Mr. Parker's best characters. That makes the story development a lot of fun. You'll find out about Paul's career as a theatrical director, spend lots of time with an armed and dangerous Hawk, Vinnie Morris is brought in for protection, Quirk is advising from the sidelines, and Susan is adjusting to a new &quot;Pearl&quot; whom Spenser brings back from Toronto. During the book's resolution, Spenser teams with Jesse Stone (of Death in Paradise, Trouble in Paradise and Night Passage) in a memorable collaboration of the two strong men.The context for the story was also very appealing to me from a nostalgia point of view. The bank robbery described mimics a similar crime in Boston which brought me back to my younger days. There are hippies from the free love times. Spenser finds himself in the middle of a gunfight at Harvard Stadium following a jog nearby in an earlier chapter. Government cover-ups were prevalent in 1974, so hearing about another one brings back those memories.The story's resolution also chimes in well with recent developments among the crime lords in Massachusetts, giving the book an up-to-date feel.As usual, the dialogue is crisp, witty and original. I don't remember better.Then why did I rate the book at four stars rather than five? Unfortunately, the mystery itself is something of a clunker . . . being way too obvious and coming into the open way too soon. If Mr. Parker had kept the mystery hidden better and longer, this would have been one of his very best books. As it is, the book is extremely interesting, entertaining and amusing. The development of Spenser's moral obligation to solve the case is very fine. All Spenser fans should immediately read Back Story!After you finish, think about what ethical challenges you would respond to . . . even after it became in your personal best interest to stop."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Spenser's back -- how many times have we heard that? This is the 30th time he's back, making him an institution several times over. The plot of this (su)spenser dredges up idiocies of the early '70s era that began the series, and that Parker never quite got out of his system. A Patty Heart-like political bank robbery went badly wrong 28 years ago (dating from May 2002), leaving a member of the gang dead at the scene and a coworker of Paul Giacomin's theatrical troupe still angry and upset over the unsolved loss of her mother. Working for six Krisky Kreme donuts as a fee, Spenser takes on one of the most dangerous cases he's faced -- it's also dangerous to his partner Susan, who's threatened by her association with him. Nothing he turns up -- and it's quite a bit -- appears to confirm the assumed facts of the case, and it becomes clear early on the FBI is covering up something it doesn't want known. As in the previous books, good food and lovemaking are close seconds to a solid investigation. We get Spenser's usual acerbic zingers here, and Hawk gets a number in as well, because he's treated as a betrayer to the black cause by radicals and ex-radicals supporting African-American liberation. My only complaint is that Parker lays descriptions of food on a bit heavy before the pace of the book picks up; after that, I was relieved Spenser had a chance to eat between trips to the west coast. As in \\"Stardust,\\" the woman needing his help is unwilling to help him, so he has to call in most of his favors to unearth the hastily buried family mess that festered over the years. References to \\"Hamlet\\" keep us alert to the problem of an unfairly killed parent -- or so it would seem till it's clear who killed who and why. As usual in the Spenser novels, the truth comes twisted enough to undercut our trust in its rectification. Finally, Susan is among the most attractive women ever depicted by an American writer: her strength of character and insight, her constancy and independence make it clear that she (not Spenser) is the real backbone of this series."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"As a reader who was introduced to Robert Parker and his Spenser detective novels by watching Robert Urich in the television series, I was saddened by Urich's death last year since in a way a part of the Spenser mystique for me had died with him. Thus, I was delighted that Spenser reappeared in BACK STORY, which as the thirtieth book in the series seems to have refined the characters to their essence. And we also have Jesse Stone, the chief of the Paradise police department and the main character of three Parker novels, become periperally in this Spenser case as Parker devotees probably guessed was inevitable. (Will Sunny Randall be next?)Paul Giacomin, a character in previous Spenser novels (and a surrogate son for Spenser) and now a successful playwright, visits Spenser with Daryl Silver, an actress and friend. While visiting Daryl's aunt in Boston twenty-eighty years ago (when Daryl was six years old), Daryl's mother Emily Gordon was murdered during a bank robbery by the Dread Scott brigade, an unknown revolutionary black power group reminiscent of the Black Panthers. The murder was never solved and the group members were never identified, and Daryl hopes Spenser will investigate the case so she can finally have closure. The police had hit a dead end, but of course Quirk still remembers it and would love to close an old case but isn't particularly hopeful regarding Spenser's chances of so doing. Things look even bleaker when it becomes apparent that all copies of the FBI file regarding the case have mysteriously disappeared.As Spenser follows up on old leads, he is soon threatened (first verbally and then shot at my a group of hit men). Of course, the danger that first he and then Susan Silverman face mean that Hawk is an almost continual presence in this story, much to the delight of all true Spenser fans. The story includes almost all the usual cast of characters that have made this series so successful (in addition to Quirk, Hawk, and Susan - Vinnie Morris, Tay Bop and Frank Belson all have bit parts). We are introduced to Nathan Epstein, who is delightful in his essential role as Spenser's FBI liasion. The bad guys include both the mob and other assorted characters from Daryl's childhood years. None of them are likely to appear in future stories, especially since more than the usual quota meet their demise at the hands of Spenser and Hawk.As Spenser gradually uncovers the truth and learns that it is not exactly as Daryl described, she becomes so emtionally distraught that she asks him to quit the case. However, since he had agreed to take the case as a favor to Paul and his only fee had been a box of Krispy Kreme donuts, he declines to end the investigation. Partially because he believes since he now has reopened the case that he and Susan will continue to be in danger unless it is solved, but also because as Susan observes using her fine psychoanalytical skills and thorough knowledge of Spenser's character (and reinforced by some wonderfully rich imagery from Hawk), he \\"can't quit early... [he] has to know how it will turn out\\".This book does not present an especially difficult mystery for the reader to solve, as several of the elements of the solution are in fact telegraphed relatively early in the story. However, there are enough details which involve the usual misdirection to keep the interest of the reader. And some of the characters, such as the aging hippie who is Daryl's father and the associated imagery are wonderful. It also has some of best dialog and psychological interplay between Spenser, Susan, and Hawk in any of the stories in the series. Over the years, their characters have grown comfortable with each other, in fact they have become among the most enjoyable characters in this genre. Both the male/female and black/white interplay is done in a meaningful and enjoyable manner. So, if you are a new Robert Parker reader, don't hesitate to start with this book although you will probably not enjoy it as much as those readers with an extensive background in the series. And if you are already a fan, this is another excellent addition to the series, despite the death of another old friend besides Robert Urich."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Back Story, the latest in Parker's Spenser series, is a retro turn reminiscent of a previous Spenser novel, Pastime. In Pastime Spenser's quasi son, Paul Giacomin, approached Spenser when he discovers that his (Paul's) mother has disappeared and asks Spenser to find her, bringing up all sorts of unwanted info in the investigations wake. (Read Parker's Early Autumn if you are interested in how Paul becomes Spenser's quasi son.)In back Story Paul approaches Spenser on behalf of a friend of his. Her mother was killed in a bank robbery in Boston nearly 30 years ago when she was just a child and she wants Spenser to determine what really happened and who did the deed. As is always the case, a lot of unwanted baggage is dredged up and Spenser has to persevere though the client gets cold feet and there are some very bad guys who are not pleased by the turn of events.The Spenser series has become a sort of hit or miss thing lately. The most recent book previous to this, Widow's Walk, was pretty lame. The edition before that, Pot Shot, very strong. I don't know if his other series are distracting Parker too much or what. One of the real pleasures of this series earlier years was the genuinely good story telling that marked each new entry.That's not the case anymore. However, Parker can still hit the occasional home run in this series and back Story is a home run. The story is marked by an intensity reminiscent of the early Spenser novels. The characters are vibrant. The violence convincing. This one is a winner.If only they could all be this good."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"It's always a pleasure to hear Joe Mantegna read what Robert B. Parker writes. His flat delivery of the \\"I said, he said\\" dialogue along with distinctive accents and inflections for Spenser's supporting cast produce an almost melodic presentation. Spenser and friends continue to age gracefully, projecting the wisdom and perspective of those not too far from cashing their first Social Security checks. True, their libidos are at least a decade younger than they are, and when it comes to dealing with the bad guys, of course Spenser and Hawk are still in their prime.There's no neo political correctness either. Ethnic stereotypes are fair game when describing any character, and Parker has a gift for crafting observations that are irreverent, but fair and in no way offensive. The story unfolds with great dialogue and pace as we become reacquainted with Martin Quirk and Vinnie Morris and meet Nathan Epstein, the savvy Special Agent in Charge of the Boston FBI office. Pearl the wonderdog who was showing sighns of age in \\"Widow's Walk\\" is gone. No rehash of how, just a side trip to Toronto to pick up the new Pearl.Hanging around with Parker's core characters is so much fun that it's actually disruptive when he sends Spenser off to solve a twenty eight-year-old murder. Daryl Silver the stunning actress friend of Paul Giacomin who starts Spenser on this quest is little more than a mannequin. I wish Parker would give his damsels in distress a little more substance a la Elmore Leonard. Mob boss Sonny Karnofsky is now pushing eighty. He has lived in the same North Shore mansion for more than forty years, so it's a bit of a stretch that nobody knows he has a daughter in her 50s who lives a couple of towns away, the wife of his ex-bodyguard Ziggy. But that plot line does create an opportunity for Spenser and Hawk to meet Jesse Stone. The two leading men from different Parker stories turn out to be surprisingly compatible.Don't even try to figure out why Parker chooses \\"Taft\\" University and Harvard Stadium for the book's two shootouts. As to how a bunch of pot smoking college drop outs from the sixties, a couple of ex-cons and the FBI all fit together in the cover up of and old murder - well let's just say the ending is the weakest part of the story. But I think you'll enjoy the pictures Parker paints of Spenser's Boston, dialogue that seldom contains a superfluous word and an old action hero who really is getting better with age."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This was farfetched but still an enjoyable read. Paul Giacomin is back, but just doesn't have enough role in the story for full enjoyment. It's also missing the delectable Hawk. And, thank goodness, Susan Silverman's role is small too. I would recommend this to the diehard Spenser fan."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Parker has really made an effort here, and it shows. Recent books were getting thinner and more off-hand, and the last in the Spenser series, &quot;Widow's Walk&quot; read like Parker wrote it while he was watching a ball game. But in &quot;Back Story,&quot; Parker has done it for us again. It's not the &quot;Godwulf Manuscript&quot; and it's certainly not &quot;Looking for Rachel Wallace,&quot; but it has depth and heft, and a fresh plot that involves us in some very satisfying intricacy as it works itself out. Spenser shows more of himself, and our understanding of him deepens. Here it isn't an appealing client needing real help that is the reason he keeps going; it is his own choice to finish what he started, even at considerable cost. He is &quot;peerless,&quot; as Susan Silverman says, a man of integrity, humanity and power, whose choices, like this one, come always from a place of honor. And he still is as funny as he always was, with the same discerning eye, seeing everyone, from aging hippies to aging mobsters, right through any pretension or fascade, seeing the good in the bad guys and the bad in the good guys, seeing things as they are.There are signs here that Parker is making some acknowledgement to the fact that if Spenser fought in Korea, he can't really be 42 years old anymore. Now he does weightlifting for repetition, rather than for weight, he does measured runs, with walk breaks, on Harvard's track, rather than pounding for miles along the Charles River. He decides to have one English muffin because the second one he wants isn't good for him. The women he says look pretty good are in their fifties, and both he and Hawk say sadly &quot;Too young&quot; when teenagers walk by in bikinis. But may I suggest here that a &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; is more than appropriate. We may all be aging, but Spenser doesn't really have to, unless we insist on it. Rex Stout's Archie Goodwin would have been in a wheelchair in real time during many of his most useful flirtations. Nero Wolfe himself would have been about 112 years old when he solved his last cases. Sherlock Holmes could not actually have dealt both with Victorian hounds and the Norden Bombsite in the same adult lifetime. I think that, along with Parker, we should make no more than a gentle reference to Spenser's age, and then leave it alone. If we lean on it too much, Spenser may retire, and I, for one, am not ready.In &quot;Back Story&quot; Parker brings down barriers between story lines, and even across series. It is very appealing to have two heavy-weight thugs who tried to kill Spenser in &quot;Pastime&quot; sitting on the steps of Susan's classy house to guard her. And Parker has Spenser work with Jesse Stone in this one, so we get to see Jesse through Spenser's eyes. I'd very much like to know how Spenser looks to Jesse. And, hey, Sunny works in Boston. There are all sorts of possibilities."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"this is a good parker Spence volume that you will enjoy reading.

Old characters from different Parker novels, old dialogue among the characters which can always be clever and humorous because the characters are likeable that way, (even if they have a dark past), and an old formula where Spenser basically plows along clueless, stirs up the water to get a reaction from surprising sources which indicates that something is important enough to keep on digging and annoying people until something is uncovered. For new readers, I would pick Parker's earlier novels because they were a breath of fresh air, and still are. For Parker fans...well I guess you will read this anyway. It's an ok Spenser novel."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I simply love the writing style of Robert Parker. His stories about Spenser just flow for me. It'seasy reading, well written with good vocabulary. I get a kick out of his paramour as that's what Ido for a living. It is accurate and researched. Congratulations to the mystery king- Mr. Parker."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"This story has some nice elements like a government cover-up and a radical sixties group. It also has a decent level of action for a spenser novel."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"One of the finest crafted novels in the Spenser series, Back Story, zings along at a fast-pace, relentless driving to the find the answers to the initial question--who killed Paul's friends mother 28 years earlier. Paul Giacomin, Spenser's surrogate son whom we have met in earlier stories, approaches him to help his friend. Accepting 6 donuts for payment, Spenser sets out to resolve the mystery of who killed the mother in a bank holdup. Discovering a strange, radical group of students who got hooked up with some ex-convicts, Spenser determines some government involvement is preventing the truth. As things heat up, he is attacked by some assassins trying to stop him from investigating. In the process he finds that in addition to the immoral actions of the radical group leading to killing of the girl's mother, there was a cover up by an FBI agent of the truth.The tight plot involves a couple of trips to California, several heart-pounding action scenes, and the expected psychological insights of partner Susan. We find the usual humorous banter between Spenser and Hawk and the occasional moralisms of Spenser's unusual world-view. For Parker fans, Back Story is yet another well-written story with plenty of action and intelligence to keep the pages turning. Yet in some ways, the story is better connected than many of his books. The events from the past determine the events of the future, reminding us that all stays connected. Behavioral actions from the \\"hippies\\" ultimately led to the pain and hurt of many people, lasting for 28 years.When Spenser does determine who killed the girl's mother, he also discovers blackmail, bribery, criminal activity, and denial. In some odd moments of self-reflection, Spenser himself, after killing several attackers, questions his own motives and purpose. On one level, the plot is exacting and a little geometrically contrived, but on another level we see a depth of human motivations and questions that serve a greater purpose. How do our actions today affect others? Is knowing the truth always beneficial? Can self-deception be healthy or painful?This is a well-crafted story containing psychological and emotional depth. Highly recommended to thriller readers, Parker fans, and anyone seeking for a fun, adventurous book with deeper meaning. Once again, I am reminded of how much we will miss Dr. Parker and his terse but meaningful style."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"Robert B. Parker created interesting, fully rounded characters, wrote marvelous often-funny dialogue, and established an atmosphere that felt exactly right. Unfortunately his plots often felt vague--as is the case in this umpteenth Spenser opus. I tried to keep it all straight, but I found myself lost and had to go back and re-read portions. It didn't help much.The plot seemed to be heading for some great denouement, but for me it fizzled. I won't give it away by going into the details. I thought it should have been more meaningful than it was.Still, Parker's Spense For Hire novels are interesting if only for the dialogue and the characters--including a dog."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"I am a hugh Spencer for Hire fan and because of that a fan of Robert B.

Somehow he comes offhere as a pig who is bigoted about hippiesmore than 20 years after the fact?The second half of the novel with the MOBinvolved just left me feeling empty.I didn't like the overall effect."},{"Title":"Back Story","review":"A classic Spenser novel, maybe a bit better than some of his other recent books. If you haven't read Robert Parker before, you'd probably want to start with some of his earlier Spenser novels. These can probably be described as classic PI noir novels, with unrealistic but entertaining plots and dialog. The characters are reasonably well developed over the course of several books, but the emphasis is on the action and the wry wit."},{"Title":"The Great Game of Business: Unlocking the Power and Profitability of Open-Book Management","review":"All games have rules. When the score is kept, there are winners and losers. Business is no different. The concept of open-book management has been around since some company owner in the distant past gathered employees and attempted to explain to them why it is so important to produce quality work, on time and without waste. No doubt at least one of those employees wondered \\"What's in it for me?\\" Good question.With contributions by Bo Burlingham, Stack wrote this book (first published in 1992) partly in response to that question. He introduces \\"The Higher Laws of Business\\":1. You get what you give.2. Its easy to stop one guy, but it's pretty hard to stop 100.3. What goes around comes around.4. You do what you gotta do.5. You gotta wanna.6. You can sometimes fool the fans, but you can never fool the players.7. When you raise the bottom, the top rises.8. When people set their own targets, they usually hit them.9. If nobody pays attention, people stop caring.10. As they say in Missouri: Shit rolls downhill. By which we mean change begins at the top.To these Stack adds \\"The Ultimate Higher Law\\": When you appeal to the highest level of thinking, you get the highest level of performance. These are the eleven laws on which Stack's system of open-book management is based. He explains each in thorough detail. Let's say that you agree that these laws make sense, that they are relevant to your own organization. Now what?Pretend that you have entered \\"Stack's Open-Book Management Store.\\" He greets you at the door. For the next several hours, he guides you through an abundance of strategies, tactics, measurement instruments, communication devices, policies, procedures, etc. He answers all of your questions. He offers a number of caveats. He shares his own successes and failures. He directs you to the latest \\"newer and better\\" but also to \\"what still works really well.\\" At the end of your visit, you are fully prepared to pick and choose from among all the options. Then he assists you with formulation of a plan to design and then implement your own open-book management program, one which is specifically appropriate to the needs of your own organization. In effect, this what happens as you read the book. I recommend it highly. Even if an open-book management program is not what your organization currently needs, the issues Stack addresses and the questions he raises are still worthy of your thoughtful consideration."},{"Title":"The Great Game of Business: Unlocking the Power and Profitability of Open-Book Management","review":"Employers are increasingly challenged to find ways to engage their people, to inspire and motivate them, and to encourage them to stay with the organization for an extended period of time. Employers who can be successful in attaining these lofty goals can dominate their markets, drive more money to the bottom line, and enjoy a stable, productive, and happy workforce.Jack Stack and his associates at Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation learned how to do this. It was a fascinating, educational, and sometimes painful journey, with benefits that exceeded the wildest dreams of those who put the plan together and made it work. The secret? Share numbers with your employees. All the numbers that have meaning-from profit and loss to balance sheet, from sales projections to costing standards. The concept is that the more employees know-and understand, the more they will partner and support the company's mission and goals (which they also help set).The most vital issue here, I think, is that every employee becomes more educated, more involved, more committed, and-end result-more loyal. They become a part of a team, rather than just workers. No longer is their relationship with the employer &quot;just a job.&quot; It's now considerably more, as they participate in the decisions that drive the company's success. When employees are motivated this way and have so much more control over vital aspects of their employment lives, they will stay longer with their employer. There are more reasons to stay than to leave. Result: a substantially more stable, dedicated, and effective workforce.The book begins with a &quot;Players Guide,&quot; a chapter-by-chapter outline of what will be covered. By itself, this guide is a valuable tool to stimulate thinking. The questions are thought-provoking, creating a hunger in the reader's mind for more information. The answers are presented in the chapters that follow.Stack makes it clear from the outset that he's writing for an audience of doubters and the curious and suspicious. The front matter includes a presentation entitled, &quot;Does it really work or is it a bunch of hype?&quot; Right to the point. The reader gets the sense, even before getting into the meat of the book, that this author will tell it like it is. And he does.The author's higher laws of business are presented to place things in perspective. Consider the premise that Stack's design is to get people involved, committed, and supportive, and these postulates make sense. 1. you get what you give 2. it's easy to stop one guy, but it's pretty hard to stop 100 3. what goes around comes around 4. you gotta do what you gotta do 5. you gotta wanna 6. you can sometimes fool the fans, but you can never fool the players. 7. when you raise the bottom, the top rises 8. when people set their own targets, they usually hit them 9. if nobody pays attention, people stop caring 10. change begins at the top.Is your mind asking for more details? What is this all about? Sure got my attention, then we dove into the real message, the powerful concept of open book management. A listing of the chapters of the book will demonstrate the level of content covered: Why We Teach People How to Make Money, Myths of Management, The Feeling of a Winner, The Big Picture, Open Book Management, Setting Standards, Skip the Praise-Give Us the Raise, Coming up with the Game Plan, The Great Huddle, A Company of Owners, The Highest Level of Thinking, The Ultimate Higher Law: A Message to Middle Managers.This is a powerful book that, if properly applied, can change the way a company does business. Substantially. Profitably. Permanently. Read it, then if you're inspired, follow the directions so well-presented by Jack Stack, a man who has &quot;been there, done that.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Game of Business: Unlocking the Power and Profitability of Open-Book Management","review":"This is a great book, particularly for business owners/leaders. Jack Stack shows how and why getting all employees to think and act like owners gives a company an incredible advantage against its competitors. And one can't argue with the author's success. I would also recommend John Case's &quot;Open-Book Management&quot; for a slightly more &quot;big-picture&quot; view of the same topic.

As he states: \\"What lies at the heart of the Game is a very simple proposition: The best, most efficient, most profitable way to operate a business is to give everybody in the company a voice in saying how the company is run and a stake in the financial outcome, good or bad.\\" The ensuing chapters discuss the various aspects of this framework, covering a breadth of topics such as vision, goals, compensation etc. Below is an outline of these topics:\\"1- Why teach people how to make money: On profit in general, On your company's profits, On making money and generating cash, On jobs and job security, On wealth and wealth creation.2- Myths of management: On the danger of telling the truth, On the danger of being a \\"nice guy\\", On the role of the manager, On motivation.3- The feeling of a winner: On the credibility of management, On the attitude of employees, On pride and ownership, On starting games, On celebrating wins.4- The big picture: On defining the big picture, On Sharing the big picture, On moving people around the company, On sending mixed messages, On Connecting with communities outside the company.5- Open-book management: On taking the emotions out of the business, On being the least-cost producer, On the fear of competitors, On the fear of employees, On sharing compensation figures.6- Setting Standards: On critical numbers, On the purpose of standard costs, On setting up a standard cost system, On absorbing overhead.7- Skip the praise - give us the raise: On designing the bonus program, On the effectiveness of the bonus program, On the size of the potential bonuses, On the issue of equal payouts, On educating with bonuses.8- Coming up with the game plan: On budgets and game plans, On the sales forecast, On getting people to buy in, On changing the plan as the year goes along.9- The great huddle: On staff meetings, On putting names on the numbers, On the timing of meetings, On the role of the Leader, On writing the numbers down.10- A company of owners: On equity in general, On long-term thinking, On playing the game in employee-owned companies, On playing the game without the equity tool, On participation versus democracy in business.11- The highest level of thinking: On the cost of health care and other benefits, On creating new opportunities for people, On cash-flow generators and overhead absorbers, On the hunger for ownership.12- The ultimate higher law: a message to middle managers: On getting your boss to play the game, On playing the game without the boss, On having fun.\\"A great educative book on management, that promotes openness, transparency and effectiveness!Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- \\"The only way to be secure is to make money and generate cash. Everything else is a means to that end. Those simple rules apply to every business. And yet, at most companies, people are never told that the survival of the company depends on doing those two things...most important, no one tells people how to make money and generate cash.2- \\"People only get beyond work when their motivation is coming from the inside...Management is all about instilling that desire to win. It's about instilling self-esteem and pride, that special glow you get when you know you're a winner. Nobody has to tell you. You just feel it. You know it.\\"3- \\"Along the way, we learned some lessons about the kind of games and goals that work best: 1) Business is a team sport - choose games that build a team. 2) Be positive, build confidence. 3) Celebrate every win. 4) It's got to be a game. 5) Give everyone the same set of goals. 6) Don't use goals to tell people everything you want them to do.\\"4- \\"I found out that people who had worked in two or more jobs had a whole different attitude about business. Cooperation was great. They were much better at seeing the other guy's perspective. They understood how different functions fit together, how the depended on each other.\\"5- \\"The best argument for open-book management is this: the more educated your work force is about the company, the more capable it is of doing the little things required to get better.\\"6- \\"When you use financial statements as management tools, you have to adapt to your purposes...How you do that depends entirely on your business, but here are some general rules to follow: 1) Start with the income statement. 2) Highlight the categories where you spend most money. 3) Break down categories into controllable elements. 4) Use the income statement to educate people about the balance sheet.\\"7- \\"The real power of the bonus program lies in its ability to educate people about business. Once they understand the math, they see how everything fits together, and how business can be a tool for getting them what they want. And it all does fit together. The system really works. You can't criticize it because it is simply a reflection of reality. You can criticize individuals. You can take people to task for the way they do business. You can go after the ones who are greedy, who only want to help themselves, who exploit other people for personal gain. But the fault lies in those individuals, not in the nature of capitalism.\\"8- \\"That's because a company of owners will outperform a company of employees any day of the week..When you think like an owner, you do all the little things necessary to win...But people will only thing like owners if they have a larger purpose, if they are not just working for a paycheck...People have to see the Big Picture. They have to know what they are doing, why it's important, where they are going, and how business is helping them get there. Only then will they have the desire to go out and use the tools you provide and play the Great Game of Business to win.\\"9- \\"...\\"Everyone who comes fishin' here gits the same number of bites. The only difference between thems that catch the fish and thems that don't is preparation and concentration. You gotta make sure your hook is sharp and your line don't have no nicks. Then you gotta watch that line. You pay attention to them little things, and you'll catch all the fish you kin handle.\\" I think of that story whenever I run into people who don't know what to do with their lives because there just aren't enough opportunities around. I also think of it when I hear about companies laying people off because their services aren't needed, because there isn't enough work for them, because the opportunities have all dried up. What a waste. There are opportunities everywhere - opportunities to grow, opportunities to start new businesses, opportunities to create jobs and absorb overhead.

Any business owner who wantS to turn on the dynamic energy of his/her workforce should surely consider the secrets Jack learned at SRC. This is a real American success story that transcends The normal bounds of business. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Great Game of Business: Unlocking the Power and Profitability of Open-Book Management","review":"Stack believed in telling the employees the truth and letting employees protect their jobs by increasing production. In the early stages of the company, Stack put up a sign that said, \\"Our Goal: 800 tractors\\" in one month and every thought he was crazy; they were shipping 5 to 6 tractors a day; at that rate they would 700 tractors short. As they looked closer at the problem, they began to find ways to improve production. They discovered some part were being delivered but not making it to assembly in time. They figured out that some tractors were missing only a few key parts. They took a large problem and broke it up into a series of smaller problems. Stack keep the big picture infront of the workers, supervisor, and managers eyes. Stack began the culture of working numbers, balance sheet numbers, income statement numbers, and cash flow. The group jumped to 55 tractors in one day. Scheduling improved, part arrival per tractor improved, and workers time was more efficiently managed. Once they hit 300 tractors the company noticed something important was happening and focus intensified. Five days before the deadline 662 tractors had been shipped, everybody was involved. On Halloween Oct 31, 808 tractors had been shipped, everyone celebrated, balloon went up around the sign and pizza was ordered; everyone had a party. \\"Everyone wanted to come to work everyday\\".The first step to success is to create small successes and build on them. Nothing drives a person to work harder than success. Fear is the antithesis of success. Success builds confidence. People don't want to be pressured or harassed. They want to be a part of something exciting. Managers needs to provide opportunity and build on the positive accomplishments.Sales is the most important part of a business. Without sales there would be no money to pay the bills.Teaching people how a company makes money and generates cash is essential to reducing waste and fraud. Accountability drives competition and improves quality and reduces waste. Employee are responsible to protect their jobs. The way to protect their job is reduce costs or increase production. An employee may go to his boss and suggest buying a robot that would speed up a bottle neck in the process or he may be able to demonstrate manual labor is more cost effective; either way, the employee is responsible to protect his jobYou can either \\"go where the action\\" is and see \\"what is causing the slow down\\" or \\"you can let workers tell you\\". Often time production delays are caused by assembly of delayed parts arrival or labor shortage due to excessive demand. Management needs to understand how goals are impacting workers and workers need to want to perform to save their job and capitalize on bonus incentives.What drivers are important to watch in a company?a. Sales projects are an early warning system. If sales projection suggest a decline in sale then money will be tight. If sales projection indicate a surge in order than production capacity may need to be expanded. Business is about the strategy of knowing how to balance owners equity against liabilities. Profits can be added to owner equity for future growth of the company or it can be used to reduce liabilities and improve the financial health of a company. Assets should be twice the amount of liabilities.b. Sales should deduct order that have come back. An accurate sales amount subtracts behind schedule ordersc. Standard Cost-Of-Goods-Sold is used to determine \\"How much it costs to produce the goods\\".d. Gross Standard Income equals Net Sales Shipped less Standard Cost of Goods Sold. The Gross Income should be high enough to cover all \\"non production expenses\\"e. Inventory Receipts are used in the cash-flow statement. A receipt is a ticket tracking an inventory item. When receiving gets a part, a receipt is generated and associated with the part.f. Manufacturing variance is the difference between the actual cost and the standard cost of the product. The author does not use average cost. Most companies use average cost because it is easier to determine a product expenditure.g. Contribution margin is the actual gross profit made on the product by deducting the \\"total manufacturing variances\\" from the Gross standard income.h. Expenses are the operating expensesi. Operation income equals Contribution margin less expensesj. Most of these financials can be assembled rather quickly using a query tool like \\"Insight Software\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Game of Business: Unlocking the Power and Profitability of Open-Book Management","review":"Must read for all business owners or those who aspiring to be. We have been a open book company since 2000 but did not know how to leverage on that. This book provide a lot of answers.

The basis of the book is Open-Book Management or sharing the critical numbers and the financials with your employees. I know the United States was in a recession when this book was written so I took seriously his explanations about not laying off people to be \\"lean and mean\\", but helping to create new opportunities and jobs.Not every chapter is great, some were dry and too much like a self-help book, but enough good chapters to make this book successful. The chapter on setting standards had good information about thinking how to control your costs and generate cash. I liked the advice of \\"Don't accept any number at face value\\". Meaning explore your metrics and make sure the right areas are being measured, numbers are not sacred.The other chapter I liked was Skip the Praise-Give us the Raise. This wasn't so much about giving a bonus, but thinking about how to give a bonus and understanding what needs to be accomplished to earn a bonus. I liked the advice of setting a goal based on the balance sheet and protecting your equity. Nice explanation in the book on how to do this.The book is fantastic for entrepreneurs or for owners of small companies that are growing or need to diversify.

Now, as the founder of an investment company faced with resolving complex cash issues at our client companies, it is equally relevant. If you have a business of greater than 10 employees and over $1 MM in revenue, you will find the approaches inside extremely helpful in achieving your financial goals for the business.Jack Stack takes a practical, implementable approach to Open Book Management. In a nutshell, the theory is that if employees understand the numeric goals of a business, and how their own measurables contribute to those goals in a fun, competitive environment -- they will find new, creative ways to assist management in cranking out profit, additional sales revenue, and free cash flow. Having personalized this approach and implemented it myself in a number of organizations, I can vouch that this is absolutely the best way to improve the numbers that are so critical to your business success.

Charlie and four other bratty children, and their imperfect guardians, get tours of the great, mysterious Willy Wonka Chololate Factory, and Charlie is the luckiest child of all. The writing is extremely imaginative and &quot;child-like&quot; dreamy. There are a few unstated lessons about unfortunate, undesirable things that come to children who are too demanding, greedy, or apathetic, versus the good that comes to well behaved, mannerly children. The horrifying outcomes are so far from anything real though, that they are most enjoyable as humor. Mostly, it is just a funny, fictitious story of make believe and great chocolate adventure. The flowing text expresses on its own, the dreamy story, but black and white line drawings, on every couple of pages, help to illustrate the unbelievable events that unravel. It is very fast moving, lots of fun, and will keep you avidly reading and quite possibly reaching for the candy dish."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie finds a golden ticket,in a chocolate bar.This could be thebiggest adventure he ever had!!He gets a trip inside,Mr.Willy Wonka's chococate factory.Along with Augustus Gloop,a greedy little boy,Veruca Salt,who is spoiled by her parents,Violet Beauregarde,a girl who chews gum all day,and,Mike Teavee,A boy who watches television all day long.Until all the children go home,Charlies on a wonderful adventurefull of !!!CHOCOLATE!!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"My kids are 5 and 7 and both of them loved every second of this story. They were thoroughly engaged from page one and couldn't wait to get back to it every night. The combination of bratty little villain kids in such a magnificent world as Willy Wonka's factory, along with the funny little Oompa Loompas and imaginative scenes made this a perfect kids' read. They couldn't wait to find out how the next bad kid was going to get what was coming to him (or her)... and they were equally excited to see how things were going to turn out for little Charlie Bucket in the end. Each crazy invention in Wonka's factory seemed to spark their imagination more than the one before. In other words... this story is pure magic for children. The thing that I appreciated was that the book was littered with funny quotes and moments that kept me, as an adult reader, as thoroughly entertained as the kids were. The Oompa Loompa songs in particular were a highlight for me. As anxious as my kids were to find out what was going to happen to the next kid, I was more anxious to see how the Oompa Loompas were going to immortalize the moment in song.As an aside... When we had finished reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we had a movie night at our house and watched \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" (the Gene Wilder movie). Afterward, I heard my kids having a surprisingly thoughtful discussion about how the movie differed from the book. Talk about music to a book-loving mother's ears! I am so happy that our summer reading started with this book. It couldn't have been a better choice.The Bottom Line: Best. Children's Book. Ever. If you haven't read it already, get busy.

If you find a ticket you win a tour of the giant Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. While you are on the tour things happen to the children like getting sucked up a tube of chocolate, chewing a piece of special gum that turns you into a big giant blueberry, getting attacked by squirrels throwing nuts at you, and being sucked into a television that's chocolate and getting turned into a midget. And the whole time you must not touch or eat anything that is not tested and be fully aware of everything.For Charlie Bucket this was an extraordinary visit to the biggest chocolate factory in the world, in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, By Roald Dahl.In this book Charlie Bucket and his family including his mom and dad and his 4 grandparents, are starving, poor, and live in a very small house with only a kitchen and one bedroom, which everyone shared. As Charlie is walking home from school one day in the cold winter he found a dollar bill on the sidewalk. He decides to go to a candy store to by a chocolate bar and run home to give the rest of the money to his mom and dad to by food. Instead the chocolate bar he had was so good he had to have another. As soon as he opened the second chocolate bar he saw a flash of gold and he stood there amazed he had found the last golden ticket!In Charlie and The Chocolate Factory weird things pop-up all the time. One incident was this: Charlie was the last person to stay for the tour, and Willy Wonka had a glass elevator that could go every where from up, to down, to sideways, even diagionally. Charlie didn't know it but Willy Wonka had a special trip for him. They walked into the elevator terribly frightened. Willy Wonka pressed a button that said, \\"UP AND OUT.\\" And suddenly the elevator speed upwards-no twistings or turnings and kept going faster and faster. Suddenly they heard a lout crash and saw wood flying all over. And soon enough they saw the whole town under their feet. (Remember it was a glass elevator). It felt to them like they weren't standing on anything. Since it was going so fast Grandpa Joe asked how fast it was going, and Willy Wonka repeated, \\"Candy power! One million candy power!\\"If you enjoy fiction stories that are filled with comedy and imagination his book Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is for you."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"CHARLIE &amp; THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a GREAT story!

Because Wonka's having a contest. He's hiding five Golden Tickets in five Wonka Bars. And whoever finds them will take a tour through the entire Wonka Factory! And Charlie's one of the winners! But the other four winners aren't like Charlie at all. They're bratty! There's greedy Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, unkind Violet Beaureguarde, and selfish Mike Teavee. But don't worry.

Both children and adults will be amused by the appropriate symbolic way in which the wicked are punished and the good rewarded. An excellent &quot;read aloud&quot; book that older children--and grown-ups too--will enjoy reading on their own as well!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I liked the way the author, Roald Dahl, uses a lot of details & description in his writing. I was able to picture the scenes in my mind. For example, when Violet turned into a blueberry, I could \\"see\\" her turning blue & swelling up as if I was right there watching the situation evolve. Because of the way Roald Dahl describes the events, I could also \\"see\\" the events from every characters' point of view. I could take in the events from any of the people (or animals) in the room. One example of this is when Veruca goes to get \\"her\\" squirrel in the Nut Room. I could imagine what the squirrel felt like when Veruca reached out for him. Even when Augustus goes up the pipe, I could \\"see\\" from down below, or from inside the pipe. It all depends on how you look at the situation.I recommend this book to candy lovers all over the world. This book will be very interesting to readers who enjoy books with lots of details. It also has humor, suspense, and foreshadowing. The part I like most is how the main characters are different, but all have that little thing, curiosity, that brings them together. Lovers of Roald Dahl's work will also take pleasure in Willy Wonka and his crazy Chocolate Factory."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I purchased 6 of these Deluxe Edition books to give as rewards to students when reading during our school's Parents As Reading Partners (PARP) program. The kids love this book! The illustrations are wonderful and the size of the book is perfect for elementary students. It was a very popular reward!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory deserves its status as a classic. Of three classics I recently read to my 4-year-old, all of which he liked, he loved this one the best. (The others were Pippi Longstocking and Old Yeller.) I give the book five stars in honor of his opinion, but I would probably give it four stars myself.Wonka's chocolate factory, like many creatures of Dahl's imagination, is an impossible place, and it is probably only more intriguing and beloved by children for that reason. Wonka himself is zany and irrepressible, like many a kid who probably shouldn't be diagnosed ADD. Dahl's characters, with the sole exceptions of Charlie and his parents, are caricatures, something shown well by Quentin Blake's weird illustrations. (But frankly, I didn't care for the illustrations in this edition.)Dahl's style has a sort of wild, unruly exuberance, together with dollops of nonsense, that appeals to kids, especially little boys like mine. Maybe I'm too much of a grown-up now, but it doesn't especially appeal to me, but I very much appreciate how it taps into the spirit of childhood. Besides, it was pretty fun to read it to my little boy, who clearly was enjoying himself."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I loved this book and its sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, and have read them several times.

There are some interesting differences from the originalstory and the original movie..."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"In children's literature, the hero often faces extreme hardship. Most often, his or her parents are killed and the hero is left as an orphan, dealing with evil stepparents or the like. Charlie Bucket is spared that fate - both his parents are still living. In fact, Charlie is a member of a large, loving household. The Buckets problem is that they are poor - very, very, very poor. They are starving, in fact. Reading this book as an adult, it is striking to see just how extreme their suffering is. They all suffer from malnutrition; Charlie has to leave early for school because, if he runs, he will pass out from exhaustion.The cruelty of their starvation is exacerbated because they live right next to the most famous chocolate factory in the world. Charlie loves chocolate more than anything else, but can only afford one bar a year - on his birthday. When Willy Wonka announces that he has hidden five golden tickets to his factory in chocolate bars all over the world, chances look pretty slim that Charlie will find one. However, considering the name of the book is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you can guess how it turns out.The movie is such a classic that it is hard to come to this book without preconceptions. Now, with the new movie, there is a danger that the book may get lost in the shuffle. That is a shame. The book stands on its own and should be read first. For one thing, the book is less scary than the movie - the Oompa-Loompas are far less creepy. For another, Roald Dahl's style is fun enough to be interesting to adults as well as children. One danger though - reading this book makes you crave chocolate!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Sometimes I wonder what the ratio of children who read this book before seeing the movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" is to children who saw the movie before reading the book. In my own personal case, I first met with the works of Roald Dahl by watching the movie in my elementary school. The scene where Violet blows up like a blueberry haunts my nightmares to this day, I might add. It was only after I saw the film that I began to wonder about the book. Was it better? Worse? About the same? So I picked it up, read it through, and found it to be an entirely different beastie than the film altogether. I shouldn't have been surprised, I suppose, but I was. Though there's an underlying creepiness to both the film and the book, the book also has a wide-eyed innocence about it that is virtually impossible to capture on the silver screen. Reading the book yet again today I am amazed by the story's capacity to reach into the minds of children and display before their wondering eyes a tale that praises the one item all kids love and all adults once coveted: CANDY.Charlie Bucket lives with his mother, father, and four grandparents in a shoddy shack on the edge of town. The family is ridiculously poor and there is little money available for such treats as candy or chocolate. This is especially unfortunate for Charlie because he loves the stuff. Worse still (or better, depending on how you look at it), Charlie lives in the same town as the fabulous Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. One day, the owner of the factory, the mysterious Willy Wonka, offers a contest for the children of the world. He has hidden five golden tickets in some of his candy bars. Those lucky people who find the tickets will get a special tour of the chocolate factory (a place where no one's allowed in or out under normal circumstances) and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Four absolutely horrid children find the tickets first and then, by a stroke of providence, Charlie finds one himself. With his Grandpa Joe in tow the two join the other kids and parents as they take a wild ride within the marvelous chocolate factory itself.If nothing else, Dahl taps into the best possible candy ideas an author has ever concocted. Author J.K. Rowling has come up with some pretty cool candies, it's true. But for sheer breadth and imagination, Dahl cannot be beat. This book contains everything from hot ice creams for cold days to cavity-filling caramels (\\"no more dentists\\"). In his typically ridiculous fashion the villains of the piece are one and all horrid to the end. Of course, of the different sins each child exhibits, the sin of chewing gum is probably the oddest. I can only assume it was added to the crew because the plot takes place in a candy factory and it's a convenient flaw to exploit. Just the same, wouldn't picking your nose be worse? And lead to all sorts of amusing punishments?The cruelty of the book is there, true. But unlike the movie, the kids in this story definitely leave the plant alive and, if not well, at least wiser. Willy Wonka himself is endowed with a kind of delightful naivet&eacute;. He honestly tries to stop each child before he or she does something stupid and/or dangerous. Charlie himself is sort of an Oliver Twist type, complete with a saintly demeanor and countenance. All in all, I found the whole book to be great. I do wish I hadn't seen the movie first, but sometimes things like that are just unavoidable.Now, if you're going to read a version of this tale, I highly suggest that you do NOT get the original 1964 edition. This was the version I read recently and boy oh boy do those Oompa-Loompas catch you by surprise. In the original version they were black pigmies from the, \\"deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had ever been before\\". Even the illustrations (originally created by Joseph Schindelman) show a variety of happy laughing pigmies. Someone must have complained to Mr. Dahl though, because if you look at the 1973 reprint, all the Oompa-Loompas have been magically transformed from black pigmies to small white hippies. Entire sections of the book have been rewritten, including an entirely new section talking about \\"hornswogglers\\" and \\"snozzwangers\\" which never appeared in the original book. Now, of course, the illustrator of choice is the illustrious Quentin Blake. His pictures contain wholly different images of the Oompa-Loompas and the new text has been kept. Better yet, the newest edition of \\"Charlie\\" has an interview with Mr. Dahl at the back of the book. Be sure to read the part where he talks about how the 1930s were the \\"glorious and golden decade\\" of chocolate. I can't vouch that this section exists in the paperback edition, however. Only the hardcover version with the chocolate colored cover.In the end, what you get out of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" depends on what you put into it. If you go into this book expecting some sort of novelization of the film, you're going to end up sorely disappointed. If instead, however, you go in hoping for a book that effectively makes every reader's mouth water for Wonka's fabulous creamy candies and has a pretty good story to boot, go no further. It's a great story with a delightful dark side that kids will love and certain kids of adults will hate. A true children's classic."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"There's plenty that adults can learn from children's books. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is such a book. Not only is it a great read, it says something about greed, gluttony, and the dangers of the fantastic.The story is probably familiar to many (thanks to the 1971 film adaptation), but the basic plot is this: Willy Wonka, a reclusive, famous (almost Howard Huges-like) owner of the largest candy factory in the world wraps five golden tickets in candy bars and distributes them to the world. No one has been in or out of Wonka's factory in years, but these tickets allow the ticket finders access to it for one day, as well as a lifetime supply of world-famous Wonka candy. Four tickets are quickly found by families who have the money and the means to do so (one of the finder's father even stops production in his factory so that his voluminous workers can unwrap the thousands of candy bars he's purchased in hope of finding one of the tickets). This is discouraging to Charlie Bucket, who comes from a destitute family who eat mostly watery cabbage and boiled potatoes. Charlie only gets one chocolate bar a year for his birthday - his father's job screwing on the tops of toothpaste tubes doesn't bring much income. Charlie's luck changes when he finds a dollar bill in the snow (after his father loses his job in the toothpaste factory the family begins to starve, and Charlie conserves energy by walking slowly, which helps him find the dollar). Luck leads to luck, as Charlie buys two candy bars and the second one contains a golden ticket. Charlie's 95 year-old (wow!) grandfather agrees to accompany Charlie. So, Along with four other spoiled brats and their families, Charlie and Grandpa Joe tour the Wonka factory. Inside, the factory is filled with amazing things, and the spoiled brats show their worst side and also expose the dangerous side of the fantastic. A river of chocolate is great until you fall into it. Trained squirrels are great unless they mistake you for a bad nut and through you in the chute. Chewing gum that tastes and nourishes as though it were an entire three course meal is great as long as the forumla is right and doesn't turn you into a giant blueberry. Being allowed into the Wonka factory is an amazing experience unless you're a spoiled brat who needs to grab, chew, eat, or touch everything you see. In this case being a brat brings dire consequences. The reward for not being a brat is something unbelievable, but the \\"losers\\" still get a lifetime supply of candy and chocolate.Fans of the film (which is mistitled \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" because Charlie is really supposed to be the hero here) will notice some great differences in the story. The famous \\"Oompa Loompa\\" song is not in the book, but they do sing, but they sing longer and more detailed songs than in the movie. One of the songs goes on about the evils of television:The most important thing we've learnedSo far as children are concerned,Is never, never, NEVER letThem near your television set -Or better still, just don't installThe idiotic thing at all.They do not sing \\"Oompa Oompa Ommpity Doo, I've got another problem for you\\" such as in the movie. They also give credit where credit is due: the brattiness of the kids is also blamed on the parents. So in a way the story also becomes a lesson in parenting. The Oompa Loompas sing:For though she's spoiled, and dreadfully so,A girl can't spoil herself, you know.Alas! you needn't look so farTo find out who these sinners are.They are (and this is very sad)Her loving parents, MUM and DAD.In this way the Oompa Loompas almost serve the purpose of a Greek chorus. Whenever of the brats \\"gets it\\" they sing about the tragedy and probable causes of the event. This book is a very enjoyable read for any age. If you're an adult, don't deprive yourself of great children's books such as this one. If you're a kid, don't deprive your parents of your great books such as this one. Make them read it. Force them to read it. You know you want to."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I liked this book very much.

Dahls books, loved by some, hated by some, are truly amazing. You never know what will happend, though you can be truly safe, nothing too bad will happend to you as long as you behave.Chalie is a little boy living in deep poverty with his parents and his four grandparents. A tuff world for a little boy, and no romantification by Dahl, but still you almost want that you were little Chalie. His life, though filled with poverty and hunger is also filled with love. He is surrounded by love by the six grown ups in his life. When the chocolate king Willy Wonka is going to give away 5 golden tickets which will give you access to his adventurous factory, Charlie knows that there is no chance that he will win a ticket. Or may be there is a chance? Charlie's birthday is just around the corner, and every year Charlies parents and grandparents collect all their leftover money to buy little Charlie one tiny piece of chocolat. And of course, this plate, just as any other plate can be one of the five with golden a golden ticket.As the story goes on we meet the four first winners of the golden tickets, all children like little Charlie, but of course none of them anything like Charlie. Dahl let us meet four nasty children, though described with great humour.Of course Charlie gets a golden ticket in the end, if not, there would be no book about Charlie and the chocolate factory. And he and his \\"old as Methusa\\"-grandfather Joe are invited to the factory with the four other kids and their parents.Now we are taken into a world so filled with fantasy it is like a wonderful dream for every child.Roald Dahls writing is perfect for any child between 5 and 105. You are never too old to enjoy his books.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This is one of Roald Dahl's BEST. After ten years, Willy Wonka has opened the gates of his amazing chocolate factory to the public... only 5 members that is. Who will find the golden ticket wrapped in a Wonka chocolate? For Charlie Bucket it's a mere dream. Charlie is poor and only gets one chocolate bar a year. But one day, he finds a dollar bill in the snow and buys himself a chocolate bar... which just happens to contain the fifth golden ticket. You're swept in a marvelous journey in the chocolate factory with four brats... Mike Teavee who lives for tv...Veruca Salt a little brat with bratty parents...Violet Beauragarde a girl who love gum...and Augustus Gloop who'll eat ANYTHING. Don't worry they all get what they deserve. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"If you haven't read this book, where have you been??? The story is like the perfect childhood fantasy -- visiting a chocolate factory and seeing all the cool inventions!! Willy Wonka is a bizarre character who hides out in his factory, inventing candy with the help of Oompa Loompas (who only seem to show up when a naughty child is about to get into trouble!).It's a great book, and it teaches valuable lessons about greed. Charlie is a good kid who follows directions. The other children on the tour get themselves into trouble by not listening to Wonka's instructions. They're punished in strange and surreal ways, and we really don't know whether they live to tell the tale.That's why I'm giving this book 4 stars, not 5. I find it to be a little cruel, and I think Wonka is kind of sadistic toward children. For example, he shows everybody his brand new chewing gum invention that tastes like a 3-course dinner. Despite Wonka's warnings that it's not quite ready yet, a girl named Violet (who is famous for loving to chew gum!) grabs the gum and starts chewing it. When she tastes blueberry pie, her body turns blue. Before she knows what's happening to her and before she can spit it out, she starts blowing up and turning into a blueberry. While the poor girl is screaming helplessly, the Oompa Loompas surround her and start rolling her around the Inventing Room singing a song!!All of this struck me as a little mean. Wonka never tells Violet that she'll turn into a blueberry if she keeps chewing. All he says is it isn't ready yet. And the Loompas don't seem terribly worried about juicing her. They're joyfully rolling her around and singing about how naughty she is! Instead of learning any kind of lesson from Violet's \\"situation,\\" I just ended up feeling sorry for her."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Like other previous reviewers, I was nave about this film being based on a book. Having now read it, I have a much greater appreciation for the story itself. This could be said with regard to just about any book/film combination.The most significant difference (which I won't divulge too many of the details of in case of spoiling the ending for you) is the addition of an episode with the fizzy lifting drink in the film. Also, in the book, all children but Charlie have two parents with them instead of one.This is a charming book which I'd recommend to child and adult alike. It is very easy reading, which must be one of the reasons why Dahl is so popular. Easy reading doesn't always mean that everyone can polish a book off in an hour or so, like others often say they have done. So don't feel encouraged if you didn't read this as quickly as your friends. The main thing is to read and enjoy it - and keep reading!Not only is it a heart-warming story, but there are quite a number of indictments of our sinful nature. The main thrust of the story is that all the children (and adults) who go into the factory with Charlie are quite naughty. This is all with the exception of Charlie, who wins a special reward in the end. Charlie is good, doubtlessly because of his good upbringing and humble surroundings. We can all learn from such simple lessons. The one I personally need to listen to most of all is the warning not to watch too much television, brought to us courtesy of Mike Teavee.5 stars without hesitation."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Fact: Roald Dahl is an amazing author with tons of great books under his belt.With that said, if you're going to embark into the world of Dahl, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" has to be your first read. While I do think some of Dahl's other books such as \\"Matilda\\" or \\"The BFG\\" are better, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" shows the brilliance of Dahl.Most of us know the general story of this book. A young, poor boy who wins the oppertunity to tour the Wonka factory, discovering a magical world hidden within it's walls. You have to know a story is good when it inspires not only a movie, but a candy company.I love how this book paints each charecter and scene without overloading the reader with details. The reader feels like they are right beside Charlie, touring the factory with him.At the end the real reason to the tour is explained in a touching way that leaves the reader feeling that no matter what your background may be, anything is possible if you dream big enough. And if you ask me, this is a message every kid needs to hear these days."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"My very favorite Roald Dahl book. Wonderfully imaginative and fun to read. For kids and adults alike!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a lighthearted Cinderella fantasy about a sweet little poor boy who is one of five lucky children chosen to tour Mr. Wonka's mysterious chocolate factory. This factory is the topic of much speculation, since no humans are ever seen going in or out, but it remains the source of the most delectable confections known to man.The children and their parents discover that the factory is populated by funny dwarfs called Oompa-Loompas, and each room is filled with candy more delicious than the last. Throughout the tour, Charlie's good character (an effect of good upbringing by a loving family) strikes a contrast against the four spoiled, unpleasant children, who continually get themselves into hilarious trouble by misbehaving.The story is wonderfully well written, and although it is lighthearted in tone it is a true moral tale -- probably too moralistic for some readers. Charlie, like the traditional Cinderella, is almost too sweet, and the four bad children are ludicrously obnoxious. There are some intense moments: Charlie's family lives in danger of starvation, and in a few episodes the reader is left to wonder whether the bad children will come to real harm. Parents ought to use discernment when introducing the story to sensitive readers. And, of course, candy is a central motive, highlighted by Charlie's real hunger. Those who are sensitive to sugar or given to gluttony may want to avoid the story for this reason.Aside from these points, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a rollicking, lighthearted fantasy, full of humor and imagination, which is a delight to read aloud. If parents decide to let their children watch either of the movie version, I strongly recommend they read the book first, because the movie interpretations are quite different from the spirit of the original story."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"It's classic Roald Dahl for pity's sake. The extraordinary writer wove the brilliant and imaginative tale of a desperately poor child who finds a golden ticket and has the opportunity to step inside the most magical, mysterious candy factory in the world. If you are an adult and have only seen the movie(s) do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I love this book! I recommend it to all ages. It is about a boy name Charlie who is poor and hungry during winter. During winter an exciting news happens. Mr. Willy Wonka's Marvelous Chocolate Factory is putting five golden tickets in candy bars. See the five lucky kids that come to see the secrets of Mr. Willy Wonka's Factory. My favorite part is the factory."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I had never read this wonderful tale for myself until recently. My primary questions beginning the novel were, Will it be like Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp? What a surprise when it turned out to be neither. It was Roald Dahl. With respect to both of the fine aforementioned cinema performances, no film can properly reproduce the uncanny and extremely paradoxical character of Willy Wonka, as he intertwines the outlines of Roald Dahl's immortal classic.Another question I had was whether this book would leave me disappointed in its overall quality (like several others of his have done). Would it be grotesque? Would the absurdity overshadow the delight and even the plot?Alas, no.CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY possesses practically every motif - virtually every quality one could wish for in a classic children's novel. And not just for children. Just like Willy Wonka himself, just like the Chocolate Factory itself - there is almost a certain maturity wrapped up in all the whimsical mischief that abounds in the book. And sometimes you can't tell the kids from the grown-ups.But fun is the key ingredient here. And CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY will guarantee a mouthful of it with the turn of every page."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I hated the original Willy Wonka movie. Gene Wilder was too smarmy, Charlie too bland and the Oompa-Loompas way too creepy. Hence, I saw no reason to read the book that inspired my loathing. But when I learned that Roald Dahl, author of the book, had actually dissociated himself from the Wonka adaptation, I though that maybe, just maybe, I might like the book.And I loved it!!The book outdoes the movie in every way. Charlie and his extended family are dirt poor and hence always hungry. A yearly birthday candy bar is all they can afford. The other children, winners of Wonka's Golden Tickets, are hopelessly sniveling, selfish, spoiled and self-absorbed. When they visit Wonka's chocolate factory, they are dispatched by their own greed and lack of discipline. The scenes where Veruca Salt is disposed of by a gang of shell-shucking squirrels is perfect. Dahl's Wonka is hyperkinetic, elfin and passionate about candy. He seems not to know or care where the disappearing children have gone. The Oompa Loompas are not the lumpish candy-men of the movie but a race of tiny people transplanted willingly to the factory. The only slightly disturbing part of the book was the way the nasty kiddos were got rid of, since they could have been drowned, incinerated, or blown up like balloons. But even this discomfort is addressed by book's end.The best part of the book was Dahl's inventive cleverness about dream up new and wonderful candies. Edible pillows, cavity-filling caramels and sweets that let you spit in many colors were just a few of his delectable concoctions. As were the long songs sung by the Oompa Loompas to celebrate the removal of bad kids. Schindelman's illustrations gave just enough of a hint at the action without taking the reader's imagination entirely off the hook. Dahl's moral sense is an important subtext throughout the book. Greed and boorishness are punished; virtue, good manners and self-restraint are rewarded. Compare that with the ethical confusion of the Wilder film.Definitely one of my favorite books in search of an adaptation that is true to the Dahl's spirit, which rewards the habit of reading books and other good behavior, even among the needy."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is really funny and I have been laughing for a lot of days that I've read it. I've been laughing at the Oompa Loompas singing really funny songs - boy, was that funny. Remember when they sang \\"Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop\\". Yeah, that was funny.Jack, Aged 6.5"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I bought this book to read to my 6.5 year old son and he loved it. He would ask all the time for it to be read to him, which made me so happy. I really want to get him to love books as reading is such an important skill for school. I was a bit concerned that it may be too long of a book for him at his age, but he fared well and even read a paragraph or two each time we sat down to read it. Thank goodness there are some pictures peppered throughout the book to keep his interest sharp. Entertaining story with lessons to learn too - What more can you ask for in a children's book."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This is a great story. I love the snarkiness of Willy Wonka and the Oompa-Loompas."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The first time I read this book I did not read this book, it was read to me in class in third grade.Our teacher had broken down the chapters so that they would fit a certain time frame and then would stop making us want to hear more and allso encourage us to read.So the book unfolded to us with a series of what would be called cliff hangers along the way. What would happen and when. Though it is obvous now based on the title that Charlie would find the special candy bar, back then it was not.I picked up the book again recently and it is still just as charming and fun as I remember. A definate classic children's book, and for younger children probably less scary than either of the two movies.High recommended."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"If you haven't read this book yet...JUST READ IT!!! Roald Dahl's just brilliant! His got such a wild imagination! He makes up these crazy stories that just keeps you reading on and on and you just might wonder if all this had actually happened to him or how can he think of such amazing things! This is the first time I've ever read a book with a non-stop supply of short and unpredictable little storeis connected that keeps you curious and interested. In other books you know there's always a climax at some point, where there's the most exciting and &quot;twisty&quot; part of the whole book, but you'd probably can't find the climax in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It seems like the climax is throughout the whole book! Fine...I'm exagerating a little, but you'll pretty much agree with me after read it anyway. (Writing this review makes me want to put exclamation marks after every sentence :) hHEhe) Well anyway, let me tell you some of my favorite parts. The parts where no one else can think of other then Roald Dahl. I love the part with the thousands-and-thousands-of-botton-covered-glass-elevator-that-moves-in-all-directions. They're all labeled! Isn't that cute! You just press any one of them and it'll get you to that place in no time at all. I also liked reading about all the different types of candies that was made in in Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Believe it or not? Many of those candy's have actually come up in every kids' mind before, like forever-lasting-taste-chewing gums, candies that can take over breakfast, lunch and dinner, or even a castle that's made all out of chocolate! And there's MUCH MUCH MORE! Read some other reviews and you'll see that even though this book sounds quite childish but there are still readers and Roald Dalh lovers ranging from all ages. It's a relaxing boook. People should take a break sometimes from reading hard books. You can read this for a bed time story, filling your brain up with fantasies and after you fall asleep, you'll find yourself somewhere in a beautiful land in dream world...HhAHah...just adding some more to my review. Anyway, I won't waste anymore of your precious time. GO READ CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY RIGHT NOW!!!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book was a magnificant book! I highly suggest everyone reads it, of all ages. Through out the whole thing it was packed with action. It was not a complicated book to follow, it was very easy to follow.

They get in trouble, taste marvolous treats and see marvelous cites.I think everyone old and young should get a chance to read this book. It is absolutly spectacular. It relates to everyone some how. The lesson is &quot;Loyalty earns you trust!&quot; I say this because everybody no matter who you are has wanted something and tried to get it the wrong way. Then someone eventually says &quot;You should have just have been honest and asked for it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I have read this book and i liked it. It is very interesting and i have read it twice. It is a good book for imagining things and the author has wrote many other books but i think charlie and the chocolate factory is the best.There is a video of it i watched it twice i think the book was better than the video."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This Roald Dahl book is merely his second major published work for children. Despite this, he manages to show the world that he has the skills necessary for writing children's books after a successful stint as an adult writer. The book is a delight from first to last, and is a real page-turner with twists and turns on every page. In addition, the pace and excitement are well-maintained and a keen sense of cohesion deeply felt.The story begins quite slowly and normally in introducing our hero Charlie, but it picks up a little earn about Wonka's chocolate factory, and meet the interesting, winsome and informative Grandpa Joe. It is when the Golden Tickets are announced then we are in for a real surprise. We end up rooting for Charlie to find one, following him on his adventures, and letting the unexpected surprises in the factory enthrall us as much as Charlie did. At the same time, we end up laughing at the four naughty children who find the other Golden Tickets, yet learn the vices of good behaviour at the same time. The results are often hilariously funny, and their exploits act as a kind of cautionary tale that shows the children's love of sweet things at the same time as they possess their youthful heart.Overall, this is a wonderfully written book that serves as one of the best introductions to Dahl's children's writing. It is still an enjoyable read for me despite the fact that I am still a teenager, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is starting to read."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Five lucky children are about to be chosen to enter the very mysterious and magical candy factory owned by Mr. Willy Wonka.

Flying without much effort, stuffing as many sweets into my mouth as I want, throwing a spoiled-rotten brat into the garbage chute along with her &quot;loving&quot; parents --- such wild dreams were once mine at all. This book presented by Roald Dahl has reminded me of wonderful days of my childhood full of dreams those my favorite books realized in my mind. It was a wonderful experience to know I can still dream such wild dream!There are five children in this book. Augustus Gloop, an enormously fat boy whose hobby is eating; Veruca Salt, a spoiled rotten brat; Violet Beauregarde, a dim-witted gum-chewer; Mike Teavee, a crazy TV watcher; and Charlie Bucket, whose family have only less than what they need to live. Chalie is our hero and we will enjoy happy-ending with him and his family, of course. But why? Why is he chosen as a favoite child by Mr. Willy Wanka?I have only one answer, and I hope you will give me another one if you please. Anyway, mine is as follows; because he needs to dream a wild dream to live his daily lives full of wants. I know real children have a lot of wants to be fullfilled. They are greedy. Parents can't satisfy them. If they really want to do so, they spoil their loving children like Veruca's parents and will have to be kicked into the garbage chute full of fish bones, peels of potatoes, and so on. Charlie is the only child who knows his wants mustn't be totally fulfilled, so Mr. Willy Wanka chose him as a winner."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The gates of Wonka's factory are finally going to open into the public.

Inside a small cottage lives Charlie Bucket. His family is poor and Charlie only gets one chocolate bar a year. On his birthday when he got a chocolate bar, Charlie opened his bar and found nothing. All seemed hopeless when Charlie found a 1 dollar bill on the ground. Charlie bought two bars and in one of them was the golden ticket. Charlie was very happy because he dreamed of chocolate. He was the fifth finder. The other four finders in order were Augustus Gloop, Violet Beauregrade, Veruca Salt, and Mike Teavee...All in all, I thought the book was great.

I remember reading it as a child and still enjoy looking over my old copy. Dahl perfectly understands what children like to read about: wacky characters, nonsense, funny words, candy, and the good side winning out in the end. Though the classic fairy tales of the Grimm brothers, famous for their uncompromising endings, are also important children's stories, Dahl almost always, without shame, shoots and scores with a happy ending. The characters are all unforgettable, and the movie is likewise a &quot;scrumdiddlyumptious&quot; treat.

Nobody's fault but mine, but pay attention when you order to ensure this generic version is the one you actually want. (As for the story itself, well, it's Willy Wonka! One of the best ever.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were elements of the book in the musical that were not in the Burton film, and that I was also correct in my observation that the Tim Burton film stayed closer to the book.

I never read the book, but the movies do add things as movies will do and now I understand the differences arising between the two Chocolate Factory movies. The directors had to add some sort of conflict. Dahl's story is like this: Charlie is poor; Charlie gets golden ticket; Charlie is virtuous where the other children are bad; Charlie is awarded factory by Wonka.In this, the original story, everything plays out nicely and everything is too simple. Charlie is poor but his family is entirely good. All the others we see are horrible and one-dimensional and their defining traits become the mode for their downfall. But if you're poor you can be good just by keeping your head down and good things will happen to you. I was dismayed to learn that Charlie and his grandpa avoided the Fizzy Lifting Drink and avoided any complexity to their characters as is in the version I cherished.Wonka is an entirely wonderful and novel creation, and I understand why such talented actors wanted to fill his shoes. However, he is not a hero of the working class. Expelling all your workers as a way to avoid corporate espionage is bad enough, but enslaving a whole race of people as your personal worker-army is a little much. I would hope that the Salts or the Gloops or one of the other families enlighten the government as to the conditions at the factory. Also: Wonka has a beard.In the end, reading the book for beloved stories like this always create more perspective. Dahl is a talented writer but this creation is written for a different audience than me. In that respects, I feel it is an effective text. For me however, it works in concert with the creative efforts spawned by it to forge a synthetic idea of just Who Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket really are. I am glad I read it."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"When I was a kid and much taken by Gene Wilder, the Candy Man, as Willy Wonka, I considered buying the original Charlie book, as having a fuller exposition of the tale.Then comes 2005, with that horrid Johnny Depp portrayal, and I finally say, \\"enough!\\" and buy the Dahl book. Well, they're right; the Charlie movie is a more faithful recreation of this book, which isn't saying a lot. It's a little kids' book, and I suppose that was Dahl's intended audience, but I always thought there was more to those characters.Maybe it was just an illusion, and the work of David Wolper in 1971.

Charlie had a birthday coming up. For his birthday he always got ten cents , you maybe thinking that it's not that much but alot of stuff back then did not cost that much. Anyway, he got his dime and started out for school on his way to school he would pass a candy shop he usually just walked on but today he stopped.

So he was so mad that his dad threw away his candy that he ran away from home. So now he owns the biggest chocolate factory in the world.The theme of this book is a boy who always dreams about going to the chocolate factory. But he can't even afford a candy bar. The chocolate factory is owned to the greatest chocolate maker in the world. The one and only Willy Wonka.The main characters of this book is Charlie who is a very bright boy, Grandpa Joe is a well caring Grandpa and wishes they give Charlie more in life, and my favorite character in the whole book is Willy Wonka he is hilarious, creative, and I think he is also crazy.The setting with out the whole book is the chocolate factory. While it is running you can smell the chocolate being made. It is humongous you can easily get lost in it. Plus it is the only factory in the world that has a chocolate waterfall. But all of the other candy factories are always jealous and they always try to steal the formulas.The main reason I picked this book is it is hysterical, it is exciting, and while your reading it makes you want to eat a king size candy bar.

Roald Dahl is a superb author, brimming with imaginative tales that strike a passion for reading, in anyone who does read his stories.This tale, of a young, poor Charlie, chronicles his escapades in the Chocolate factory. It is a book filled with hope, sadness, happiness, and moral lessons. It does not sugar coat everything, though. It lets the young readers know that life is not always fair.

For me, this was one of the more enjoyable ones to read, and if you ask him what his favorite book is, this is always one of the first ones on his list."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, is a little funny, but not completely funny. Wonka invited the kids to his factory in a very interesting way. He sent out 5 golden tickets in 5 ordinary, plain old Wonka Candy bars. If you found a ticket you got to go to Wonka's factory, and afterwards get enough chocolate to last your whole life. One of the scary things is that all the kids except Charlie are not very nice kids. Each of the kids except for Charlie, ends up having something bad happen to them. Some of the funny things are the silly things that happen in Wonka's factory like the Oompa Loompa's songs. It was very neat that he had a chocolate river, a candy boat and candy grass and buttercups. I liked when Wonka talked about his everlasting gobstoppers, which never lose their flavor and never get smaller. And Wonka's chewing gum is very neat. The only problem with Wonka's chewing gum is that when Violet started to chew one, the bad thing that happened her just began. Another neat thing about Wonka's invention is he found a way to send chocolate by television. Another scary thing, is that Wonka crashes a glass elevator through the roof of Charlie's house."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"If the highest goal of any author is to create a picture in the mind of those who read his or her works, Roald Dahl can rest easy. I read this book when I was 10 or 11, and the vivid images that raced through my mind as I read were incredible. I feel sorry for anyone who can only see on the poverty of the Bucket family, the fate of the four less than saintly children, or the evasive turn of phrase used by Willy Wonka. This is a wonderful work of literature for those who see the good in Charlie Bucket and understand as he does that goodness is its own reward. The chocolate factory is just, if you will pardon the expression, double fudge icing on the heavenly devil's food cake. I hope my 10 year old niece has the same wonder-filled experience with her Christmas present this year."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I liked Charlie and the Chocolate factory because it's one of those books that has lots of adjectives and that has a great title too.

It's the God of all books."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I first read 'Charlie & The Chocolate Factory' many years ago; probably about grade three. I enjoyed it, but years later the only thing I remembered was the golden ticket,the kid who stuck her gum behind her ear and the glass elevator. I remember thinking as a kid, that a glass elevator that went every which way, would be soooo coooool.Having read it again 30 years later, I am not quite as impressed (well duh it's a kids book!). I found it a little on the cruel side and a little too moralizing, as Dahl takes literary vengeance on all the things that kids do that bug him, like watching t.v. or chewing gum. I guess I just found the moralizing a little too heavy handed. But your kid will probably love it and if it teaches him not to stick gum behind his ear, I guess that's good too."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This work was designed to instill proper moral behavor in children, something certainly needed in today's world. Dahl clearly drew on the classics to inspire and inform these works, relying upon their tried and true methods of wonder, curiosity, charisma, (and more than a little fear,) to elicit the proper resonse. He just changed things a little to make the tale relevant to children... I think that &quot;Charlie&quot;will be added to that list of nearly sacred tales, for the wonder of it's story, and the absolute mastery in it's telling, and finally, the simple message. BE GOOD.In &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&quot; The characters are random souls, thrust together and cast through a purgatory of sorts, where each child, (representing the deadly sins) is punished according to nature, estabishing and enforcing a strong moral code in the reader. They rise through the various stages devised by the master of the place, until they arrive at a state of final judgement, where the least and best of them, confesses his sins and his faults, and is found worthy and inherits the kingdom of heaven. (The chocolate factory, and all its wonders.) This is basic Dante, retold in the vein of Blake, with the social satire and subtle wit of Swift.The intent of the work is the same as the intent of its source material. A vanitas motif, explaining our impurities, our sins, finding each of us wanting, instructing us in the proper moral path by illustrating the folly of vice, and the imperfect nature of man. What better message to teach to a child? A wonderful work that I read often (at least once a year) and I never fail to find something incredible, something new."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book is a classic and I was thrilled to read it again this week. When I'm working on a middle grade project, I like to spice up my reading with both new books and books I loved from my childhood. Roald Dahl was/is my favorite author (him and Stephen King), and I figure when I'm seeking inspiration I could do a lot worse. For that reason, expect plenty more of Dahl's books to be my Book of the Week.I'm not going to bother with a summary of this book. If you're reading a blog about middle grade novels, I'll assume you're familiar with the basic story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That's one of the reasons I chose to reread the book now. Its story is so well known to me I can all but ignore it and focus my attention on Dahl's craftsmanship. I know that Charlie is a character we're hoping will find a golden ticket and get to tour the chocolate factory, but why do we hope this? How does Dahl convince us to care about Charlie and his lack of a chocolate factory tour?What I learned this time through is that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is actually a horror story for children. Seriously. How else is one to explain the chapter in which a little girl is attacked by an army of squirrels in what has to be one of the creepiest scenes in all of middle grade and adult fiction? And after all, Roald Dahl wrote a great deal of horror for adults (another reason I love him). When I read this book as a child, I hadn't spent any time watching, reading, or writing horror, so I never picked up on it before. Reading the book again as an adult, I have now written a fair amount of horror and I know it when I see it.Willy Wonka is a scary dude. So get this: he invites 5 children to tour his chocolate factory, then disposes of one child after another until he is left with one child (innocent and pure like the best teenage virgin horror heroines) who is rewarded with survival and a chocolate factory. Note to any screenwriters reading this blog: you could totally adapt this plot to a teen scream fest. Imagine five teenagers go someplace creepy, like say a factory, and a maniac kills the ones who have sex, who do drugs, who drink, who pollute the environment (it's your morality play, pick your vices), until there is only the one virgin left who defeats the maniac or reaches a compromise and gets to live happily ever after because he/she is a virgin.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the same story, only instead of doing drugs or having sex, the sinners in this tale watch too much television, chew too much gum, eat too much food, and are spoiled to the point of being a \\"bad nut.\\" If you don't believe me, reread the rhymes spoken by the oompa loompas who serve mainly as a Greek chorus, and are pleased when each sinner has been disposed of. Willy Wonka accidentally on purpose puts each of these terrible children in a situation where their own vice is turned against them, sort of like Kevin Spacey's character in Se7en, but for kids! If I were Charlie, by the end of that tour I would be screaming my head off in terror, worried about how Willy Wonka was going to blow me up into a blueberry, shrink me to the size of cockroach, let me get sucked into a pipe, or sick an army of squirrels on me (just thinking about it sends a shiver up my spine).Don't get me wrong. Knowing that Dahl wrote a horror story for children almost as scary as The Witches only makes me love him more. Part of the appeal of the horror story is that the reader is able to see characters get what they deserve. If a person is a jerk in a horror story, the reader can look forward to seeing that character get what's coming to him. Children have to deal with jerks just as surely as adults do. I think part of the reason I loved this story as a child is because it was fun to see the bad kids punished.The last observation I want to make is just how skilled Dahl is at moving a story. He conveys settings and actions through dialogue, thus saving space and increasing his pace. He jump cuts frequently and isn't afraid to have characters state their motivations so long as they do it in a funny or clever fashion. Roald Dahl moves his stories along so fast he could have written War and Peace in about 150 pages or so and you wouldn't notice anything missing from the original."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"OK, this reviewer had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - never saw the movie with Gene Wilder, and even though am a Johnny Depp fan, never saw the newest movie -I dropped my defenses and got this book, and was I surprised!

I don't know if \\"Charlie\\" or any of his other books have been translated, but I would imagine that it would be difficult to do so.To the reviewers who were horrified at the fates of the children--that is the point. They were horrid little brats who got their comeuppances. In every case they were warned NOT to do something and they did it--and look what happened to them. Mr. Wonka assures us that they come out OK, although not unchanged. (Violet will probably be blue to the end of her days, for example.) Yet, one is sure that they will have learned from the experience. Mike surely won't watch nearly so much television, and Veruca certainly won't be nearly so spoilt. Children aren't nearly as delicate as some parents think they are, and aren't (usually)traumatized by such stories, unless they are unusually sensitive; and in a world that contains things like Abu Ghraib, Kosovo, and the Sudan, the sooner they get toughened up a bit the better.To the reviewer who didn't like the fact that two of the brats were GIRLS and was afraid that the story would bruise her precious little one's delicate female self-esteem, I'd recommend MATILDA by the same author. (Actually, as a former schoolteacher, my experience with girls is that many of them have too MUCH self-esteem; so many adolescent and pre-adolescent girls seem to think that they rank at least as countesses, and expect to be treated as such.)"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Dahl's delightful story about the lucky children who found five Golden Tickets has captured the imagination of kids of all ages since 1964. Charlie Bucket is a thin only-child who lives in poverty with his adoring parents and 4 old grandparents. It's bad enough to be nearly starving all the time, but he has to pass by Willy Wonka's world-famous chocolate factory to and from school every day! Suddenly the nation is swept by Wonka- mania; a newspaper announcement creates a buying frenzy to find the five-only special invitations for a private tour inside the mysterious locked gates. The prize also includes a lifetime supply of candy! If anyone deserves to be included, it is surely our Charlie.Curious little Willy Wonka has many marvels to share and his own unique method of child therapy, which he subtly works on the four other (bratty) children who are also ticket holders. Join Charlie and his beloved Grandpa Joe as they stare in amazement at the hidden wonders inside Mr. Wonka's fabulous chocolate factory. Who are those tiny workers who produce the world's greatest candy? How does Willy Wonka try to reform the spoiled kids and what incredible surprise does he have in store for the one decent kid in the bunch? Although different from the movie version, this book is the original Golden Literary Ticket to an unlimited feast of rich imagination! Not to mention a cautionary tale to children who indulge in various excesses."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I actually picked this book up to read for myself, but after reading the first chapter I thought it might be something my two girls who are 5 and 7 might be interested in as well. \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" is one of the movies we own and love, and they were already familiar with all of the characters. We sat down on the couch late this past Saturday afternoon and I began to read it to them. After the first chapter I asked them if they wanted me to stop, and instead they begged for more. I read another, and another, and another, and finally after the eighth chapter in a row I told them I had stop since it was time for them to go to bed. They were very disappointed, and they made me promise I would read more of it for them the next day. Believing it was just a ploy so that they could stay up later I didn't take it very seriously, but sure enough right the next morning they were up and had me start reading it to them right away. They didn't even want to watch any early morning cartoons, or play on their Playstation II. Before you knew it we had gotten through the first hundred pages in no time at all. I've never seen them love a book so much. The illustrations by Quentin Blake throughout the book, and especially right at the beginning, were wonderful. They grabbed my kids imaginations and kept them long enough to get into the words. Then once the story line kicked in they were hooked.We loved all of the characters. There's the eccentric candy making genius Willy Wonka who has locked himself away in his chocolate factory so that the other candy makers can no longer steal his inventions. The gates are always locked, and nobody goes in and nobody comes out. Mr. Wonka holds a contest, which seems to just be a promotion to generate sales, but Mr. Wonka also has an ulterior motive in mind. Five golden ticket are hidden beneath the wrappers of different Wonka Candy bars, and the five lucky children that find these tickets will be given a life time supply of chocolate, as well as given a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory along with their parents. The five lucky children consist of the glutton Augustus Gloop, the little rich girl Veruca Salt who always gets what she wants since her parent's have spoiled her rotten, the gum chewing Violet Beaugarde, Mike Teavee who only wants to sit around all day watching television, and the last golden ticket of all is found by little Charlie Bucket. Charlie Bucket is a poor noble good natured child who lives with his two parents and four grandparents in a dilapidated shack. They all turn out to be dreamers who would rather spend their last dollar trying to win this contest even though they are starving, and should be spending their money more wisely on more nourishing food other than chocolate. But they all love Charlie very much. Grampa Joe is Charlie's favorite and he gets to go with Charlie to the factory. He is 96 years old, but always becomes very energetic when he's with Charlie.Nobody has ever seen Mr. Wonka's new employees who are called the Oompa-Loompas, so they are a big mystery. They are a tribe of little men no bigger than your knee who love to sing and dance, and live off of cocoa beans. After each bad child, and bad parent is removed, they like to sing a lovely moralistic little rhyme about what was wrong with the child and how it can still be corrected.This book was written in 1964, and I see that since then many other candy makers have continued to borrow Mr. Wonka's ideas about candies and promotions. The moralistic themes are also just as poignant now as they were then also. One moral that still held relevance was that kids should still be taught to read rather spending all of their time watching television. As you can see from above this can be made easier if there are other such lovely stories as this one to read to entertain them.

I recomend this book."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This was a good read, and definitely could be used as an educational learning tool, much like the movie. However, the lessons aren't as deeply outlined as they are in the book. In fact, the basic Oompa Loompa Song, is a more detailed song in the book, based on the situation of: gluttony (Augustus Gloop), greed/chewing gum all day (Violet Beauregard), Selfishness and Want for More-also greed (Veruca Salt), and last but not least, what watching tv all day does to you (Mike Teavee).The story line was pretty much the same, and I do Love the original movie more than the book (Gene Wilder Willy Wonka). However, I do believe that the book is something that the whole family could enjoy, and there were notable differences between movie and book: after Charlie won the Golden ticket, he didn't run into Slugworth, they didn't sign a contract prior to the tour in the Chocolate Factory, Veruca wasn't a \\"bad egg,\\" but she was a \\"bad nut\\" nut according to the squirrels (I also believe that she was a bad nut in the Johnny Depp version), Charlie didn't leave his gob stopper behind, yes they did take the elevator in the end, but Mr. Willy Wonka pressed the \\"button\\".To find out more about the magic elevator ride, read the book. Although there are things missing from the movie, it is a movie that I enjoy watching time and time again with the kids and husband. But I also like to read. Finally, as much as I like the movie more, I highly recommend this book to children from 1-150.

This is among his finest and has inspired two whimsical films, which I also recommend to you, and the plot is fascinating and magical. It is about a penniless boy named Charlie Bucket who wishes to find a Golden Ticket that will earn him passage to Willy Wonka's celebrated candy factory, and when he does discover one, he accompanies several undeserving, bratty children on a tour through the whimsical factory who wind up being disciplined for their misdeeds committed throughout the tour triggered by their curiosity or greed. I think that it is nearly impossible to see why anyone would not enjoy reading this book, because it is chockful of whimsy and enchantment that will very easily lure in readers. This would be perfect for any reluctant reader in your life, so you should purchase it right away if you know anybody like this or enjoy magical stories yourself.

On this birthday though something even more exciting has happened because Willy Wonka, owner of the most famous and secretive candy factory in the whole world is offering a prize, whoever finds 1 of 5 golden tickets hidden in their chocolate bars will get the chance to visit the factory which hasn't been open to the public in years.The world of the chocolate factory is quite astounding with little worker men known as Oompa Loompas that sing and dance, a giant chocolate waterfall (untouched by human hands), and tons of candy. Willy Wonka escorts Charlie and several ungrateful little brats around the factory and introduces them to all of his strange candy inventions with several mishaps along the way (that the Oompa Loompas sing about). Best of all, one lucky kid gets an extra special prize at the end.The descriptions of some of these candies was heartbreaking to me as a child because I had to come to terms with the fact that they didn't actually exist. Regardless, this is about as good as a children's book can possibly get and I can't imagine a single child not dreaming of visiting Willy Wonka's themselves someday!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Roald Dahl's entire published work should be required reading.

Factory'Watching the movie companion, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' at about the age of eight, I felt I just was given my cinematic experience equivalent to my generation's 'The Wizard of Oz'.Now past forty, I am still enchanted by the same movie, but it has taken me this long to take the above advice from the Oompah Loomphs given about Mike Teavee who held my closest vice.So enthralled was I to own and see this classic gem, that I had to take the joyride in reverse: And now, finally, I have actually read Dahl's children's novel and seen for myself what it is like to take my own advice to this generation so attached to gadgets: Reading does, indeed, exercise the mind's muscles, exerting the VCR of one's imagination.Yes, there are plenty of differences between the book and the movie, and while I'll never know what it would have been like to read the book before the movie as a kid, I at least have been able to save some literary enjoyment that can extend childhood into my middle years.Both the book and the movie are a juvenile extention of Dante, 'The Purgatorio'--that is, but without its grimness or some of the sterness of Hilaire Beloc, whose moral lessons in rhyme resemble only his in structure--rather than whimsey.Whatever stage of childhood you may be in, even if it is rediscovery, it is never too late to read 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' and for all it's mindport, now's as good a time as any."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The story of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is an amazing tale of a young and poor boy who lives in a small cottage at the end of town. One day, in his Father's newspaper, he reads that Mr. Willy Wonka, the owner of the world famous chocolate factory in his neighborhood, is placing 5 Golden Tickets in his famous Willy Wonka's Chocolate bars. Those who find them will be invited to Mr. Wonka's chocolate factory for a special tour.The children who find these golden tickets are (in order from first to last) Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beaugarde, Mike Teavee, And little Charlie Bucket.Once at the factory, they are eliminated one by one in order of ticket findings. After each one is eliminated, the Oompa Loompas sing a song about their fate: Augustus Gloop goes up a chocolate pipe, Veruca Salt gets pushed down the trash chute by a group of smartly trained squirrels, Violet Beaugarde chews a piece of gum and turns into a huge blueberry, and Mike Teavee shrinks when teleporting himself by television. Charlie survives every task and is rewarded with a life-time supply of chocolate and the privilege of living at the Chocolate Factory, as well as owning it once he is old enough.This story is fascinating.

It is so good I stayed up all night reading it and I would recommend it to grades3-5, here is my opinion on the book. I like this book because in the beginning Charlie bucket and his family struggles to get through life. Charlie sees a commercial that Mr.Wonka is selling Wonka Bars with one golden ticket in each of the five chocolate bars. After school Charlie finds money on the street and buy's two Wonka Bars. Charlie wins the ticket but what will happen?Charlie, Grandpa Jo, and Mr.Wonka are the main characters in the story. Charlie Bucket is a small boy who lives with his mom, dad, and his four grandparents. They are very poor and don't have it the best. Grandpa Jo is old and used to work for Mr.Wonka and his factory. Mr.Wonka owns the factory he is old but very creative.Though the charters are important, I need to tell you the setting. The setting is Mr. Wonka's factory. Since he could not eat chocolate when he was little he decided to make a chocolate factory. It has a tone of rooms including a chocolate water fall. The five lucky winners will get to explore the factory and 1 will win the prize.Now here is the theme, Charlie gets a golden ticket and meets Mr. Wonka but Charlie's goal is to get the prize at the end. Read the book and find out if Charlie wins or not.This was a fun book, and what made me want to keep reading it was to see if Charlie won the prize from Mr. Wonka.

One of the deepest joys of reading---relying on one's imagination to create the characters, their voices, the locales, etc.---is preempted and nullified by the choices made by directors, producers, casting agents, and set designers. Thankfully, the best books which have been adapted for the screen are complex and spacious enough that they allow some free play in spite of this imaginative preemption, and such is the case with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.The plot should be familiar to anyone who has seen either film version, but for those who are new to the tale, young protagonist Charlie Bucket is a seriously impoverished and malnourished child who lives on the edge of a town whose main focus is Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. This factory, in which no one (at least, no human being) has worked for the last decade, is the ultimate children's fantasy---part candy store, part amusement park, and part haunted house. As fate would have it, Mr. Wonka has decided re-open his factory, but only to five children and their guardians, by way of a lottery, in the form of five Golden Tickets hidden in the wrappers of his candy bars.Needless to say, Charlie finds a ticket and gets taken on the adventure of a lifetime, along with his Grandpa Joe (amazingly spry at 96!) and four other nasty, bratty children. What happens along the way will have the whole family cracking up, and hopefully, learning a bit about better behavior as well. Dahl's now-classic tale is a wonderfully silly morality play about how not to behave and about the consequences, good and bad, of our actions, and the format of the book, written as short illustrated chapters, makes it great for family reading aloud. In other words, this is a gem for kids and adults alike. (There are low-star reviews by those who are horrified by the \\"violence\\" in this story, which is frankly as silly as anything that happens in the book. All the kids make it out of the Factory in the end, with a lifetime's supply of candy no less, having learned lessons in appropriate behavior. 'Nuff said.)"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"In the book Charlie and the chocolate factory, by Roald Dahl, Charlie Bucket is a poor boy who wants to get a golden ticket so he can get into Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory and the golden ticket is hidden in 5 Willy Wonka chocolate bars. The problem is that Charlie only gets a chocolate bar once a year and that day is his birthday. So 4 of the tickets have been found by Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beaudergle, and Mike Teevee but, Charlie's Grandpa, Grandpa Joe, Believes that he can get the last golden ticket. So on his way home (from school) he sees a dollar on the ground so he goes to the candy shop to get a chocolate bar. So he gets a chocolate bar and there was no golden ticket and he ate the chocolate bar. So with the change that he has, he buys another chocolate bar and there was a golden ticket. Now to hear what happens in the factory, you'll have to read the book yourself.Charlie and the Chocolate factory is a great book. The book is good because it has creative writing and that the book is kind of funny. I think that this book has nothing bad about it. There was nothing I didn't like. I would recommended this book to anybody who wants to read a good book."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"With only five golden tickets hidden, will poor little Charley Bucket be lucky enough to get into the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory? Charley and he chocolate factory is a novel about a poor boy who finds a golden ticket, and gets to go inside the world famous Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. While Charley goes through the factory, the other children, slowly break the rules, and end up getting either sucked up a tube or down a pipe, and end up having to leave the factory. Charley and the Chocolate Factory is a thrilling fantasy that every child would enjoy.This book was very good in the since that it was very descriptive. The group of children and adults would enter a new room the book described every thing in the room. For example when the whole group enters the chocolate room and charley sees the waterfall, the book says \\"There was a tremendous waterfall halfway along the chocolate river- a steep cliff over which the water curled and rolled in a solid sheet, and then went crashing down into a boiling churning whirlpool of froth and spray\\". The book also describes the bubblegum machine as \\"a mountain of gleaming metal that towered high above the children and their parents. Out of the very top of it there sprouted hundreds and hundreds of thin glass tubes, and the glass tubes all curled downwards and came together in a bunch and hung suspended over an enormous round tub as big as a bath. The book was so descriptive, you could picture each scene as it was happening.Charley and the chocolate factory is good because the other four winners all had a trait of bad children. Augustus Gloop is a greedy boy, who found his ticket because he ate so much chocolate that it was practically imposable for him not to find one. Veruca Salt is a girl who is spoiled by her parents; she found her ticket because her father bought truck loads of chocolate bars, until he found a golden ticket for his daughter. Violet Beauregarde is a girl who chews gum all day; she found her ticket because when she heard about the tickets she switched from chewing gum all day to chewing chocolate all day. And Mike Teavee is a boy, who does nothing but watch television all day, who just gets lucky and finds a ticket.This book also teaches children to never give up on a dream. Charley normally only got one chocolate bar a year, and he got it on his birthday, when charley heard about the tickets, he was looking forward to his birthday like never before. He didn't get the ticket when he opens up his chocolate bar, but he didn't loose hope. Then his grandfather secretly gave him ten cents that he had been saving for charley to go by another chocolate bar. When charley opens it, yet again there was no golden ticket. Then on his way from school a few days later, charley found a whole dollar in the road. He thought he would buy one chocolate bar and give the change to his mother for food. So charley went to the nearest candy store and bought one chocolate bar, when he opened it there was no ticket. Then Charley thought the first bar tasted so good he bought one more. When charley ripped the wrapper, a golden ticket fell out and his whole life changed.Charley and the Chocolate Factory is an exciting fantasy. This book is a thrilling story that nobody would want to put down after reading. This book also teaches children to take full advantage of there dreams. Children of all ages will very much enjoy this book.N. Lenix"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book is about a boy named Charlie.

I recommend it to everyone, especially if you like to be transported to other realities than your own- and if you like chocolate."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie Bucket is one person that will stay on my mind for a long time. The way he is described makes me want to be just like him. From his not so greedy ways to how grateful he is for what little food his parents can give him. It makes me very happy how his luck changes when he is granted the most awesome prize of all time. Roald Dahl makes this a great story in so many ways. From what happens to the five children to how crazy Willy Wonka is. From the way the Chocolate Factory is managed by Ooompa-Loompas. To how Willy Wonka won the hearts of children all over the country, manipulating them to buy his chocolate for a oh so special golden ticket. I am not surprised that this book is talked about from generation to generation."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I remember reading this book as a child (before ever seeing the movie with Gene Wilder). It is an awesome book that now I get to share with my sons. A few years ago, I was teaching a 4th grade class and had the class read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. One mom thanked me because her son who hated to read, started to like reading because of this book."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"My 11 year old tutee loved this book. She found interest with each of the characters, found the descriptions captivating, and read it very quickly. We as adults have got to let kids read.

I recommend this book to everyone who wants to see the movies."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a funny, mouth watering story. Its about a boy named Charlie that has a very poor family and finds a golden ticket in one of Mr.Wonka's candy bars. Four other snobby kids get them too.So they go to the factory and have a wonderous and delicious adventure. I recommend this book for people that like to read about a fantasy story with tons of chocolate. I enjoyed this book because it had very descriptive details."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl is about Charlie, a generous boy whose family is very poor. Charlie hopes to win admission to Wonka's fabulous chocolate factory which is finally open for five people. I enjoy how Road Dahl describes imaginary characters and the interesting machines in the factory. At the factory, Charlie meets four other children who all have one thing in common: they all represent naughty children in one way or another. The other children can be described as sassy or obsessed or bulging or lazy. They are all extremely unhelpful, and they expect other people to do all the work for them. Charlie is different. He is helpful, and he works hard to make his family happy. I think that there should be scene that shows Charlie making a good choice in the factory instead of just standing there watching the other kids make bad choices. I think that the book is good for readers in second to seventh grades because it is a complicated story with exciting and unpredictable characters. I liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory so much that I chose to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This is my first Roald Dahl book and I must say I love it! Highly imaginative and full of lessons, this book is a gem. I like the little boy Charlie very much and like most children, he is full of curiosity. He is also obedient for he listens to his parents, Mr and Mrs Bucket, and his very old grandparents. His family is poor and the seven of them live in a tiny, worn-down house. It is heartbreaking reading his family situation.One day, Mr Willy Wonka, a well-known chocolate maker who was missing in action for a long, long time comes back into business. As we know, Mr Wonka makes all sorts of wonderful, out-of-this-world, magical sweets. His chocolate-making secrets, having been copied before by other manufacturers (that's the reason he closed down and went \`missing') he now protects them by hiring a mysterious workforce when he reopens. The workers are never seen to enter or exit from his factory--very strange. The action starts when Mr Wonka launches a competition with an irresistible prize: a visit IN the factory for five children! These children will be able to see how his secret chocolates are made and their adult guardians can come with them. To win, each of them must possess the golden ticket only found in Wonka chocolates! The world, of course, launches into a chocolate-buying frenzy. But Charlie, a chocolate lover, is so poor and could not even afford a decent meal, how could he afford to buy enough chocolates to get a chance to win one of the five golden tickets?The story gets even better when the five winners--all from different backgrounds and attitudes--get their tour in the factory. Four of them are spoilt brats in their unique ways, and the fifth one is Charlie (of course he got in)! What an experience each of these children and their parents (except Charlie for he brought his grandfather) go through! From the way Mr Wonka talks (as evident in the writing), he is an enthusiastic person. There are lots of exclamation marks punctuating his sentences and italics to emphasis his points. Besides all the intriguing stuff, the children also discover who the workers are. It is interesting to see how the children's mischief gets them into trouble in the factory.I love how Roald Dahl weaves the magical story so wonderfully and it was funny reading about the four obnoxious children. More interesting is how each \`weird' incidence that happens during the tour is in direct relation to their naughtiness. Watch out for the twist towards the ending, too, because there is more to things than just the factory tour. This is an amazing tale."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"it was my favorate book and i love it so much im reading the secquel i cant say much more because it was so good please read it. it will definitly satisfy your craving for chocolate."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Thats basically all I have to say, it's cuter then the movie.

If you have watched the movie and have not read the book, you have only experienced a sliver of Roald Dahl's imagination. The book is very much like both of the movies, but his descriptions and details in the book are magical. I would recommend this book to anyone, and it is, as it says in the title, one of my favorite books. If you like this book, I would recommend the sequel to this book, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, which is a worthy sequel to this classic."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I got this book from the library the year it was published. I was nine years old. I read it in one day and it was one of my favorite books. I didn't think either of the movies even came close to be as enthralling as this book.

All these news reporters come and interview Charlie at his home.

I think I have read it something like 30 times, and the story has capYou know the story -- about a poor kid in a poor family who has to eat cabbage soup every day, who loves chocolate but can not afford it. One day, however, the most magical thing ever happens to him -- he wins one of the five golden tickets to the nearby Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory.This is a wonderful book in so many ways, but especially in modern American suburbs where children often grow up spoiled with riches. This book shows them that, yes, some children grow up too poor for chocolate bars, and also shows them how loathesome spoiled children of various types are. There is the obnoxious bubble gum chewer, the TV-obsessed kid and the glutton.Willy Wonka teaches each of them -- and the reader -- a valuable lesson.On top of that, it is such a fun story -- with amazing candies that will delight children of all ages (including their parents).Every child should read this book, or have it read to them. It is absolutely the best children's book ever written. I can give it no higher recommendation."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was number one of all books I ever read. I don't read a whole lot but as a young student who puts everything we read in school aside, I couldn't put this book down. I would highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys laughter, sadness, and exciting endings. I didn't want the the book to end although I love the ending when one of the five kids was good and the other four kids were bad. I think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a very good book. I would recommend it to anybody who likes funny books. I really liked it. My favorite part is when they went into this place where everything you could eat and there was a chocolate river."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I have always loved this book. My parents used to read it to me, and as soon as I could, I read it to myself over and over. I'm a 19 year old college student now, and I still pick it up! One of the beauties of this book is how it applies to all ages. Children giggle as they understand the jokes withing the fantasy and the morals of the story. Adults laugh at the social commentary and the jokes that kids may not yet understand. Even after reading this book for so long, I can still read it and notice things I never picked up on before. (It took many years of reading before I picked up on the &quot;Has Beens&quot; comment.) :-) Kids, contrary to what adults may think, can understand many, if not most, of the lessons presented. In a fantasy setting, they see what can &quot;happen&quot; if one over-eats, is spoiled, chews too much gum, or watches too much T.V.--basically, if one is too indulgent. And they see that wealth does not necessarily buy happiness. Obviously, these characters will not be seen everyday in &quot;real life,&quot; but that's not the point. They represent different aspects of our society, and in no way does it suggest that all children are like this. It just gives humorous examples of what over-indulgence can do to a person. And if anyone is like me, they get a certain gratification in knowing that the rotten children in this book got what they deserved. ;-)"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I read the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. This book is awesome, imaginative, funny and once you start it you can not put it down. Even though it is fiction, it has a lot to do with real-life problems and how irresponsible and careless human beings can be. I would give this book a 5 star rating. This book is about a really poor boy coming from a poor family who does not have a lot of things or any toys to play with. The best birthday present he can get is just a chocolate bar from Willie Wonka's chocolate factory, which he loves. It may not sound like much of a birthday present to you, but from a really, really poor family with absolutely no money, it is a pretty big deal. Also Charlie is very grateful for all of his presents even if they are small. Charlie is a very kind and loving child, and he is not a bragger or a bully. Mr. Wonka, the chocolate factory owner, starts to put golden tickets into chocolate bars and if you find one of the 5 golden tickets in the world in your chocolate bar, you would be very lucky. The reason is because you would get a special tour of the Wonka factory. Then one day, to Charlie's surprise, he found money in the sewer to buy a chocolate bar and found a golden ticket in it! Charlie is very excited when he goes on the tour with his grandfather. That reminds me to tell you that Charlie's grandfather is another very important character. That is because the grandfather is very inspirational and keeps Charlie out of trouble in the factory. Cause Charlie's grandfather is also very kind and caring. But I am not going to give everything away. I will tell you that it is wonderful inside because everything in the factory is made of candy which makes your mouth water. I think it's the best book in the world because it is funny and imaginative. It is funny because some of the people on the tour are very spoiled and irresponsible so they get punished in funny ways, but I won't tell.

He found some money in the street and bought a candy bar! This book was good .If you want to know what happens to Charlie in the factory then read this book!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I read the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. This book is awesome, imaginative, funny and once you start it you can not put it down. Even though it is fiction, it has a lot to do with real-life problems and how irresponsible and careless human beings can be. I would give this book a 5 star rating. This book is about a really poor boy coming from a poor family who does not have a lot of things or any toys to play with. The best birthday present he can get is just a chocolate bar from Willie Wonka's chocolate factory, which he loves. It may not sound like much of a birthday present to you, but from a really, really poor family with absolutely no money, it is a pretty big deal. Also Charlie is very grateful for all of his presents even if they are small. Charlie is a very kind and loving child, and he is not a bragger or a bully. Mr. Wonka, the chocolate factory owner, starts to put golden tickets into chocolate bars and if you find one of the 5 golden tickets in the world in your chocolate bar, you would be very lucky. The reason is because you would get a special tour of the Wonka factory. Then one day, to Charlie's surprise, he found money in the sewer to buy a chocolate bar and found a golden ticket in it! Charlie is very excited when he goes on the tour with his grandfather. That reminds me to tell you that Charlie's grandfather is another very important character. That is because the grandfather is very inspirational and keeps Charlie out of trouble in the factory. Cause Charlie's grandfather is also very kind and caring. But I am not going to give everything away. I will tell you that it is wonderful inside because everything in the factory is made of candy which makes your mouth water. I think it's the best book in the world because it is funny and imaginative. It is funny because some of the people on the tour are very spoiled and irresponsible so they get punished in funny ways, but I won't tell. You will have to read the book."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I remember my 4th grade teacher reading this book to us. (Something that nobody does for you anymore when your'e 10). I loved just being able to relax and hear a good kids' fantasy! Recently I bought this book for my son. He loved the story (and the time we spent at bedtime). I then loaned &quot;Charlie&quot; to my stepson. He read it himself AND THEN read it to his younger sister. What great memories this book has created for so many in my family! A classic is a classic. And all we have to do is share it with a child to experience it again and again! Don't miss this chance! You never know, in another 30 years, your kids may not only remember this as one of the best times of their lives, but may read about &quot;charlie &amp; willie&quot; to your grandkids.

This is exciting because the factory has been closed to visitors, but you can see little figures in the windows and nobody comes in or out. Everyone all over the world tries to get Golden Tickets.

One day when 4 of the tickets were already found Charlie found a dollar in the sewer and he went to get a candy bar. When he got home he opened it, and in it was the last golden ticket to be found.

I think the place is important because of the winter season how Charlie was poor and could not afford a jacket like he could not afford a chocolate. How money was short. That his family only gets 1 serving a meal. The setting is also important because that is where Mr. Wonka's Chocolate Factory isThis book is mostly about a boy named Charlie and his poor family. Charlie who loves chocolate, gets chocolate once a year.When Mr. Wonka sends out 5 golden tickets to the whole world. Charlie trying to find one ticket.Has doubt that he will win.

Charlie Bucket is the only son of a very poor family. He lives in a very small cottage just outside of town, with his Mom and Dad, his two Grandmas and his two Grandpas.Charlie absolutely loves chocolate. Alas, his parents are so poor they can only afford to buy him a bar once a year, for his birthday, which is awaited eagerly. Needless to say that passing by Willy Wonka's enormous chocolate factory, the most famous in the world, on his way to school every day is close to torture for poor little Charlie.Until the day Charlie finds one in only five golden tickets in the whole world that entitles him to a visit of the reknown factory.I decided to read this book before Tim Burton's adaptation comes out. What a wonderful children story, full of adventures and twists and turns! The factory's a fantastic place, the characters are great, especially Grandpa Joe, and I'm looking forward to seeing the talented (among other qualities) Johnny Depp as Mr. Willy Wonka. And Quentin Blake's illustrations are excellent. Definitely something I'm going to read to my kids (when I have some).

He loves chocolates but can only afford one per year. One day, his grandpa, Grandpa Joe, tell him of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Willy Wonka made many inventions in that factory of his. But for years, the factory has never been activated. It was then when there was an announcement. There were five hidden gold tickets in five candy bars from all over the entire world. Charlie and his Grandpa buy one with their money but doesn't find it at all. A few days have gone by and time was running out. One day, Charlie was looking down at the snow and saw some paper. He picked it up and found out that it was one whole dollar! He went to a candy store and bought a candy bar. He bought one more and a gold light hit his face. Could it be? It Was! He found the fifth golden ticket! Then the next day, he went to the chocolate factory. He saw many magical stuff in this factory. Then, when he came home, he had a lifetime supply of chocolate bars.There was a few things that i enjoyed about this book. First of all, Charlie never got mad when he didn't get the golden ticket. He just laughed a good laugh about it. This was one of the good parts because it shows that the main character is kind hearted. Second of all, all the things that happened were very creative. Charlie finds a dollar miraculously and has permission to go into the chocolate factory.Many things happen to him in this factory and he finds many interesting of Willy Wonka.I also enjoyed this book because the main character was poor. If he was rich, there would really be no point because he can just buy chocolate bars with no problem at all. But when you're poor, it would take a miracle just to be able to buy 3. This is what made me interested. Also, it has many interesting inventions. For example, gum that never loses its flavor, ice cream that never melts, etc. This book is very interesting and once you read it, you'll wish there was a sequel to it."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"In the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, there is a little boy named Charlie Bucket.

He found the last Golden Ticket! He was so excited, that he invited his Grandpa to the factory. They had so much fun!

The other children on the tour all have distinct flawed personalities which are tested on the tour to disastrous results.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is much like the movies that have been produced which was my daughters only complaint. She wished that she'd read the book first. It took a couple chapters before she really got into it but because she's got an author crush on Dahl so she knew that it would get better and after the first couple chapters she was hooked. My daughter loved the book and looked forward to reading it every day even though it was a difficult read. The characters are what really makes the book the other kids are exaggerated examples of all the obnoxious kids that are in a childs life and they get what is coming to them when they refuse to behave during the tour.Appropriateness: Like most of Dahl's books this book is very twisted. Bad things happen to the kids on the tour in fantastical ways which might disturb kids that have a hard time distinguishing fiction from reality. My daughter however thought it was fantastic. The lexile is 810 and the grade level equivalent is 5.9 making it great for advanced readers. I'd recommend it for kids 9-14 who can handle the reading level."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Poor Charlie gets a break when he finds a golden coupon, making him one of five visitors to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Grandpa Joe takes Charlie on the big day and they are guided through the wonders of Wonka's factory. Throughout the factory tour, children lose their way and only one will win the ultimate prize.You have to love Charlie - a boy, who lives in crowded squalor and eats nothing but watery cabbage soup, yet turns down a life of chocolate if his family can't join him in the chocolate factory. I love the themes of family, honesty, integrity and parenting within this book. Even kids will recognize the nasty kids - the one that chews too much gum, the spoiled one, the one who watches too much TV, the gluttonous child. Parents and kids will cheer for Charlie throughout the story."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Like more than one reviewer of this book, I was in Third Grade when I read it, and it was the first book with over 100 pages that I recall completing on my own.I talked about it incessantly as I did so, and may have driven more than one acquaintance crazy with that.I was galavanized by having seen the movie on NBC some time earlier, in the days when such airings were more sporadic, and also by a rather cheap staged version by other school mates in which Veruca Salt whirled out of the classroom to a recording of \\"I Want It Now\\".The story of Charlie Bucket's virtue being rewarded is an archaic theme, presented to us by the late Roald Dahl whose style is emulated by J.K. Rowling in many ways.The young newspaper boy lives in a two-room shack by a prestigious and mysterious chocolate factory with his parents and four bed-ridden grandparents.His Grandpa Joe tells him the story of the candy factory's owner, Willie Wonka, whose factory was closed for many years due to spies trying to steal his candy-making secrets, until one day smoke mysteriously appears from the smoke stacks after years of inactivity. No one knows how the factory is run since no one is seen going in or out.One day, Mr. Wonka stages a contest in which he promises children who find special golden tickets beneath the wrapping of any of his candy bars a tour of his factory, whipping the whole world into a ticket-finding frenzy.The first to find one is Augustus Gloop, the personification of gluttony, whose parents overindulge his consumption of junk food.The next is the ultimate spoiled rich girl, Veruca Salt, whose father runs a nut factory, and who, to quiet his hollering daughter, makes his workers \\"shell\\" Wonka bars until one is located.The third is the curly haired gum-chewing champion, Violet Beauregarde, who switched from gum to candy bars in order to find a ticket.The fourth is Mike Teevee, who dressed as a cowboy, shoots his pistols before his television set all day long.No explanation of how he found a ticket is given.Amid the discovery that an early find was a fake, and the worsening situation for Charlie's family, Charlie finds a stray dollar in the street, buys a Wonka candy bar, and finds the last ticket. His family fortunes will change forever.Grandpa Joe, bedridden for over twenty years finally gets out of bed to accompany Charlie on the tour on that fine snowy day.Amid much fan fare, the ticket holders and at least one accompanying adult are greeted by the diminutive Mr. Wonka the very next day. They enter the factory, and begin a magical, mystical adventure, enjoying a few sweet treats along the way.But alas children will be defeated by their own personal vices, and the best one can hope for is that they will eventually be wiser for the ware.The Ooompa-Loompas, described in the book as little Cro-Magnon types with rosy skin, long-golden brown hair, bearded, mustachioed, and with beautiful sets of teeth, break into a little morality song every time a child is eliminated from the tour for bad behavior.Having seen both of the film versions, I have often wished that one could be done that's truer to Dahl's story, although both featured some elements of it.In the final analysis, this adventure is still a delightful one of which I have fond memories,and of which generations more will too."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"What an absolute joy this book is. If your only exposure to this is through the films, you really owe it to yourself to give this a read at some point. The story is pretty familiar to anyone at this point - the eccentric chocolate factory owner, the golden tickets, the four bratty children and the one impoverished good child, the gleefully bizarre fates and sights inside...is there anyone who isn't at least passingly familiar with the story? But the story itself is absolutely packed with treats, and first and foremost is Dahl's wonderful imagination that's on display on every single page. Charlie's a fable, no doubt; there's some heavy satire going on, and a lot of points about children and their parents as the real cause of many of their problems and issues. But reading it with my son was a nice way to remember just how wondrous and imaginative the entire work is, and watching his eyes widen and his jaws drop with some of the sights in the book was an absolute joy. And, as an adult, it's fun to see Dahl's sharp sense of humor shining through, most notably through the songs of the Oompa Loompas, which have a nasty, twisted wit to them. From the wonderful sketch drawings to the memorable characters, it's no wonder that Charlie is the classic that it is; what's nice is remembering just how much of that comes from the book rather than the movies."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the chocolate factoryCharlie Bucket is a poor boy that eats cabage soup all of the days.

I still like to pull it out from time to time and relive the magic of Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate creations, and the humor of the four nasty children who got what they deserved.Charlie is a poor child, and lives with his four grandparents and parents in a little ramshackle house. The family barely has enough money to buy food, and survive mostly on cabbage. Mr. Bucket, Charlie's father, works screwing toothpaste caps on full tubes. The only bright spot in their lives are Grandpa Joe's stories, particularly the ones about the mysterious Willy Wonka.Wonka's factory has been closed to the public for over a decade, but when he puts five Golden Tickets in candy bars, five lucky children have the chance to enter the factory, as well as win a lifetime supply of goodies. Charlie's desperate for a ticket, but his family can only afford one candy bar a year, and he isn't lucky. But as readers of Dahl's works know, good children get their due, and Charlie and Grandpa Joe find a Golden Ticket...What can I say about \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?\\" It's one of my favorite of the author's works, and I tend to reread it every few years.

This is an awesome tale that teaches children morals and values without beating them over the head. Reading the story as an adult I can not truly see the hardship that Charlie has to suffer prior to coming to the factory and this is in itself is the hallmark of inteligent social commentary.

I like the little fat guys, called oompa loompas who work for Willy Wonka. They are really funny and I enjoy reading the book and seeing the movie. The author of this book is a very talented man. Then my other favorite part of the book is also when the girl eats the gum and turns purple and fat and they had to roll her to the juice room to squeez her.

What would happen if you got the chance to meet the most famous candy-maker ever? Charlie Bucket knows because those things happened to him in Roald Dahl's classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Charlie is a kind and generous boy who lives in a small, junky two room wooden house, with his four grandparents, two parents, and one bed. They gave the bed to the grandparents, but they were so tired, they never got out of it. Charlie wanted lots of things, but he wanted one thing more than anything: chocolate. One day they found out that world-famous candy-maker, Willy Wonka, was randomly putting five golden tickets, which would let anybody who finds one by February 1st, inside Wonka's factory. The search was on! The first four children found the first four tickets, but on January 31st, Charlie found the fifth and final ticket!When you read the book (which you'll have to do yourself) you'll find out about \\"square candies that look round\\", Hair Toffee, and Everlasting Gobstoppers.

It is about a boy named Charlie Bucket who is kind, honest, and unselfish. He hears that Mr. Willy Wonka is having a contest. If you find a golden ticket in your candy bar, you win a tour of the chocolate factory and get to meet Mr. Wonka. Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee, and Charlie win the contest.During the tour Willy Wonka tests the children, but they don't know it. Each time Willy Wonka gives them a test something funny happens. Violet blows up like a blueberry when she chews the gum that she isn't supposed to eat. The Oompa Loompas, who are Mr. Wonka's helpers, have to roll Violet to the Juicing Room so they can squeeze the juice out of her. Augustus Gloop, whose hobby is eating, falls into the Chocolate River when he is trying to eat the chocolate. He gets sucked into a skinny pipe, and he gets stuck in the middle of it. All the pressure of the chocolate builds up and Augustus shoots out the top of the pipe.This book is funny and it has a lesson too. The lesson is not to be greedy. Each time one of the kids gets into trouble, it is because of being greedy. When Augustus falls into the Chocolate River he was trying to eat all the chocolate. That was greedy.Roald Dahl is one of my favorite authors. Each of his books that I have read has a good lesson and is very funny just like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Roald Dahl is very creative and writes books that are unique in every way. You should start reading Roald Dahl's books if you haven't already.

This is a pure classic of imagination, storytelling and magic. Far superior to the film (where Willy Wonka becomes the title character), the book tells the story from Charlie Bucket's point of view. Charlie, who lives with his four ancient grandparents and his mother in a one-room house, is the kind of child who can only dream about his future, since his family has barely enough money to survive. When the Wonka chocolatier announces that five golden tickets to visit the aged factory have been carefully tucked inside chocolate bars the world over, Charlie's dreams are suddenly wide open. He stumbles on some money in the street, purchases a chocolate bar and is thrust into the limelight beccoming one of the five lucky vistors. The rest of the tale is one of scrumptous folly and nerve-wracking sentiment, highlighted by magical workers (the one and only Oompa Loompas), the etheral Willy Wonka, a host of loony characters - both adults and kids - and a thrill ride in a factory where time stands still and also rocks forwards, backwards, sideways and then some! It's a classic tale of the triumph of good over evil, generosity over greed and family over fair-weathered friends. Sure to be enjoyed by children of all ages, adults included, this is the best children's book ever written - and deserves prominent place in every child's library."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The gates of Mr. Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory are opening at last- and only five children are allowed inside. The only way they are allowed in is if they have the golden wrapper from a Wonka chocolate bar.

Charlie is the main character, and comes from a poor family made up of his mom, and two sets of grandparents. When his birthday comes around, he just gets a homemade scarf and a candy bar. But candy seems to be the latest craze all over the world, because it seems that 5 golden wrappers were hidden with the candy bar. Whoever discovered the wrappers would win a lifetime of chocolate, after a visit to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Each day, a new winner was announced. Day one was Augustus Gloop. Day two was Veruca Salt. Day three, Violet Beaurgrade, and day four was Mike Teavee. There was one day left for Charlie to find the golden wrapper. And after a fortunate buy, Charlie discovered it. Able to bring only one person, he brought his grandfather, who was closest to him. And the two went hoping for the chance to become the most famous people in the world.

With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of her picks.Since many people have seen the movie and not read the book, let me briefly compare them. The book creates more of a contrast between want and plenty. Charlie Bucket and his family are literally starving to death in the book. The book is also more of a moral tale, along the lines of Dickens. Some of the satire is much more wickedly funny as well. For example, each time something happens to one of the other children in the Chocolate Factory, the Oompa-Loompas sing a very witty, satirical song to emphasize the lesson . . . not unlike a Greek chorus.If you don't know the story, Willie Wonka is a regular candy magician. He has made a chocolate ice cream that doesn't melt even when out in the sun all day. He can make a gumball that never melts in your mouth, so you never have to buy another. He has candy balloons that you can blow up, and then eat.But his competitors sent spies into his factory and stole his secrets. So he fired all of his employees and closed the factory. Then, one day it started up again behind a locked gate. But no one ever came in or went out. You could see small shapes behind some of the windows. The candy comes out each day from a hole in the wall all packed and addressed for the post office.Suddenly, Willie Wonka announces that the children who are the holders of five golden tickets (hidden in five of his candy bars) will be allowed a one day tour of the factory. Everyone wants one!Augustus Gloop lives on candy. His mother isn't surprised when he gets a ticket because he always eating candy.Miss Veruca Salt is spoiled and her parents are rich. Her father bought 100,000 candy bars and had the people in his factories open all the wrappers until they found one.Miss Violet Beauregard is a world champion gum chewer, and has been working on the same piece for 3 years now.Mike Teavee never leaves his television, and likes to shoot at the screen with his 8 toy pistols.Charlie Bucket is a poor boy who lives next to the factory. His father has just lost his job. He gets one candy bar a year for his birthday. Alas, the candy bar did not have a ticket in it. Feeling sorry for him, his grandfather gives Charlie his last 10 cents. That doesn't do it either. What now?Inside the Chocolate Factory is a world better than Oz. Every child will love to hear about its wonders. Every parent will feel terrific for reading about these amazing features and sharing them. If you are like me, you will especially like the INVENTING ROOM.After you finish enjoying this story with your child, I suggest that you talk about what you can do to help poor children. After all, Willie Wonka only helped one. There are lots more out there. I guess he wanted each of us to have our chance to help.The next time you are in the mood for a dessert, imagine that you can have one of Willie Wonka's amazing delights! It'll feed your imagination while keeping your waistline right where it is."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"What kid wouldn't love to tour a chocolate factory that no one had visited for several years?

I was first exposed to this story by my 3rd grade teacher, as a whole class read aloud. And from that day forward, I was a lover of the writings of Roald Dahl.I have since read this story every year of my teaching career to my own classes. And I can honestly say that I have not found a class yet that has not loved the story of Charlie's amazing adventure! This is one of the greatest books ever written for children... and I really mean that!Roald Dahl introduces us to the Bucket family, an unfortunate family who struggles to survive on the money Mr. Bucket makes as a toothpaste cap screwer.One day Mr. Bucket is laid off from his job and the family begins to starve. One member of the family, little Charlie, struggles to subsist on bread and cabbage soup. Poor Charlie finds himself starving to death, when one day he finds a dollar in the snow and his whole life changes. With this dollar Charlie buys a candy bar just to fill his stomach and gets so much more than he could ever imagine.Charlie becomes the 5th child to find a golden ticket and with it, has the marvelous opportunity to visit Mr. Wonka's chocolate factory.At the factory Charlie meets up with a most wild assortment of characters:* Augustus Gloop: A large boy who loves to eat more than anything in the world. His uncontrollable appetite leads him to a sticky end.* Veruca Salt: A spolied rotten young lady. Who is prone to terrible tantrums when she can't get what she wants. Her greed leads her to a messy exit.* Violet Beauregard: An incessant gum chewer who chomps and chomps her jaws day in and day out. Her insatiable desire for gum leads to her chewy end.* Mike Teevee: A crazy Television addict, whose love for TV sends him zipping through the stratosphere.* The Oompa Loompas: A group of melodic factory workers who work for Mr. Wonka, and act as a chorus in a greek tragedy. Their silly songs are one of the many highlights of this book.* Mr. Willy Wonka: The enegmatic ruler of a chocolate universe. He has more secrets and surprises than we could ever hope for.I highly reccommend this book for kids from 0 to 99!

Simply put, kids love it. (Adults love it, too.) The premise of a poor starving boy who lives near the most wonderful and secretive candy factory in the world is inspired. Dahl has a skillful knack for making you want to read the next chapter. Once you meet the interesting characters such as Charlie's Grandpa Joe, and hear about the mythical Mr. Wonka, you are hooked. The pace accelerates as the world learns that Mr. Wonka will allow five lucky children into his secretive factory, if they happen to buy a candy bar that has a golden ticket in it. The winners are mostly awful brats - each one is presented as an example of how NOT to behave. There's something Dickensian in Dahl's wild wit and unabashed morals. But what of Charlie, our hero? How can he find a ticket when he can't even afford a candy bar? I won't give the rest away (there's much more to this plot), but suffice it to say that there are moments of pure excitement and fun throughout this book that will be remembered for a lifetime. And as a children's librarian, I urge you: please have your kids read this book instead of just showing them the movie version. Let them imagine it for themselves first."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book is so delicious I just want to eat it! &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; might be in many people's eyes a story about morality but to me, it's a story about children and their love of all things sweet, sticky and delicious. Charlie Bucket is the delightful boy (who is so poor all he gets to eat is cabbage soup) who finds a golden ticket in a chocolate bar he buys with money he finds in the street. This ticket entitles him and a companion to enter the wonderful world of Mr. Willy Wonka, the most famous and mysterious chocolate maker that the universe has ever known. Other competition winners include such heinous but wonderfully over the top characters like Augustus Gloop, the greediest boy in the world, and Veruca Salt, a spoilt brat whose father buys 10,000 chocolate bars so she can win a golden ticket. These greedy children and their frightful companions get their come-uppance in various hilarious ways that will have you spluttering with laughter with every page that you turn. Dahl's most famous creation in this book though are the Oompa-Loompas, a race of small people that Mr. Wonka has saved from extinction in the days when he traveled the world. This is a glorious, glorious book, filled with amazing characters, incredible sweets such as the everlasting gobstopper for the child with limited pocket money, and the chewing gum that that is a whole three course meal in itself. Your mouth will be watering throughout the story, and the river of chocolate will make you drool a waterfall. A scrumptious book for everyone no matter what their age."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"My absolute favorite as a child and newly beloved by my kids. ONE CAUTION . . . the illustrations in the current version by Quentin Blake are highly inferior to the ones in the original printing by Schindelman. The originals convey Dahl's twisted, almost gothic vision much more richly. These illustrations (and I think some accompanying text) are distinctly non-PC vis. the Oompa-Loompas, but, especially if you are using this as a \\"read-to-me\\" book, this actually provides a teachable moment. Definitely get this book for your kids, but, for a more fulfilling experience, seek out a used version pre-1988 or so."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"*** A Purist's Review ***Joseph Schindelman's illustrations are to Roald Dahl's text like Peanut Butter is to Jelly.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of those exciting and unexpected reading experiences that makes an impression when you are young and then years later comes to mind when choosing books for your own children. It is an exploration into a whimsical universe but yet grounded in a real and recognizable Victorian place... Nice for those who have not yet acquired a taste for complicated science fiction and fantasy.My favorite part of the book was the characterizations of the children and their families and a critical part of my enjoyment was the hilarious and classical Joseph Schindelman illustrations. His pictures are truly inspired and cleverly silly... and appear to so accurately portray the essence of each character and scene... as though he knew exactly what Roald Dahl meant - even though this is a fantasy that could have many different visual interpretations. They captured my imagination and added immeasureably to the fun of the story. As a child I had absolutely no desire to see the Gene Wilder movie because the illustrations were so integral to the story in my mind. They remind me of the illustrations in the \\"Le Petit Nicholas\\" series (illustrated by Jean Jacque Sempe). . .which are so expressive and cute and elegantly done that they don't even need to be in color.The new edition illustrations are so disappointing in comparison. It's really too bad that the new generation of young readers will be eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with no peanut butter. I will instead look for a used copy of the older edition to give as a gift because introducing this wonderful book to a young child without those original illustrations would not be doing it justice."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I bought this book for my 8 year old daughter who had to have it for her 3rd grade reading/vocabulary assignment. The teacher wanted them to be able to highlight certain things in it so they had to have their own copy. My daughter liked the book and the school project."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Given the popularity of Roald Dahl's classic book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and of the 2005 Hollywood movie by the same name, few readers need a summary of the plotline and characters. However, less obvious are the valuable economics lessons interwoven throughout this beloved book. The reader meets Charlie Bucket and his parents and both sets of grandparents in the opening chapter, and quickly learns that this family lives in harsh conditions of poverty, with just one bed in a two-room wooden shack. Charlie's father supports this household with a low-pay position as an unskilled worker in a toothpaste factory, screwing caps onto toothpaste tubes all day. The family suffers malnutrition and near starvation, with a diet based mostly on bread, potatoes, and cabbage. Once a year on his birthday, Charlie is given a chocolate bar, which he savors, morsel by morsel, over the course of an entire month.In contrast, the other four children who win golden tickets to visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory do not know the meaning of scarcity as they come from families with varying degrees of wealth. Also in contrast to Charlie's wretched living conditions is the presence of Willy Wonka's enormous chocolate factory within sight of his own house. The reader learns more valuable economics lessons from the tale of why Mr. Wonka decided to close his factory to all workers and other people. Earlier, \\"spies\\" had leaked secrets of his special production processes to competitors who then proceeded to copy Mr. Wonka and produce the same kinds of delicious and whimsical sweets. The process of producing chocolate and candies in a factory, and the natural resources used to make the products, are economics lessons that appear throughout the book. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory also teaches about consumers and how they respond to incentives by buying more or less of a product; in this case, news of the five golden tickets causes a surge in consumers' demand for Wonka chocolate bars.Children may think they know the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but chances are they do not realize that they are getting a good dose of economics from start to finish. This book makes a nice addition to most collections, including those used to teach lessons about poverty, competition, consumers, and producers."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"\\"There were only two rooms in the place altogether and there was only one bed. The bed was given to the four old grandparents because they were so old and tired. They were so tired they never got out of it. This is the house of poor Charlie bucket.\\"Charlie bucket is the main character in the book of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Charlie bucket is a small child compared to his other friends. This is because Charlie's family is poor and they don't have enough money to buy plenty of food for the six of them. But then one day Charlie bucket finds some money on the floor and he goes to the nearest store and buys a Willy Wonka chocolate bar. When he buys the first chocolate bar he eats it all up then he decides to buy a second one and when he opens the chocolate bar from the back he finds Willy wonkas last golden ticket. After he finds it he runs home and tells his family and they get so excited. After this all the magic happens when Charlie bucket meets Mr. Wonka and the other lucky winners and the adventure begins.As I read this book I thought to myself, what if I was in Charlie's place? How I would feel if I lived his life? And then that one day I got to find the golden ticket. What I would do is run straight home and tell my family about what I have done, the next thing I would do would be to rub it in all of my friends faces because I would want o see the look on their faces. I think if this would have happened to me I would have been so happy because if I was in Charlie's place and really didn't get anything good in my life I would be the happiest person. One of my favorite parts of this book was when they were in the chocolate factory and they went into the biggest room which was where all the chocolate was made. I liked this part because I imagined a chocolate river and all sorts of kinds of chocolate while I was reading this book. I think the moral of the story is that even though someone is poor, if he or she is patient and friendly while others are not, good things can happen because that's how Charlie was and he happened to win something."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book was good.

I can picture the look on his face and I can imagine how exciting it would be. I love the descriptions of all the characters--especially Veruca Salt and Willy Wonka! I think every kid should read the book, even if you've seen both versions of the movie, because a lot more happens in the book. The drawings are great, everyone's all scrawny and skinny (except for Augustus Gloop of course)."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was very different from the Willy Wonka Movie.

And sometimes you can't have breakfast in the morning before you go to school. Would you like to live this life? But what if then you got the opportunity of a lifetime, and it changed your perception of your life forever. Well this is the situation for Charlie Bucket, the main character in Roald Dahl's fantasy book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Charlie is a normal boy living a minimal life, until a miracle happens.There are five children in this book: Augustus Gloop; a greedy and big boned boy, Veruca Salt; a girl who is spoiled by her parents, Violet Beauregarde; a girl who chews gum all day, Mike Teavee; a boy who does nothing but watch television all day. And then there's Charlie, a blonde haired boy with blue eyes who is very polite and calm. He lives in a small house with his mother, father, grandfather, and grandmother. Near his house is a humongous candy factory managed by Mr. Willy Wonka, which has been closed down to visitors for years. But now Charlie has found out that there is a worldwide competition to find five golden tickets that are special vouchers to get in the factory for a tour.After four tickets that have been found, and after several tries to find one Charlie almost gives up all hope. But then one day he finds a dollar on the street, and decides to buy one more candy bar and try again. When he opens it he sees a spec of gold, then rips it open to find he has found the last golden ticket. After an apprehensive wait, he finally gets to enter the factory. Over the next couple of hours they encounter strange rooms and situations in which one child is eliminated each time.I recommend this book to anyone who has a large imagination and to anyone who likes candy! Roald Dahl likes to right simple with bits and pieces of tough vocabulary and rhyming. I think this book is a good fantasy and imagination builder with lots of humor and some attitude.

But he's also the author of several marvelous books for kids, some good creepy short stories for adults and a couple really good memoirs. He is best known for his great children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory made iconic by the classic schlocky movie version, Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.This is another one of those classics that has become so familiar that it is perhaps easy to lose sight of its pretty stern moral tone. In addition to being generally obnoxious, all four of the other kids represent some bad habit of children:Augustus Gloomp: gluttony Verucka Salt: avarice and greed Violet Beauregarde: gum chewing Mike Teavee: excess television viewingThe obnoxious children come to various horrible ends, each in keeping with his or her particular vice.

He seems to be the superhumanly good type of kid some parents held up to their own children as an example; i. e., \\"Why in the world can't you be more like X?\\" and who is hated by every other kid in the neighborhood as a result.

Charlie really wanted to go on a tour of the Chocolate Factory. He bought many candy bars. Charlie won the last Golden Ticket. Charlie is bringing his Grandfather to the Chocolate Factory.

As I've grown older, I've read the book over and over again, and it still frightens me, as I now understand that there actually are lots of people who can't afford to live the kind of life they should be able to.All in all, this book contains lots of fun episodes, and kids will love Charlie's adventures in the Chocolate Factory, but it will also give your children, as well as yourself, something to think about.

Charlie is a very poor boy that lives with his four grandparents and his mother and father. Mr. Willy Wonka owns a big chocolate factory and he makes the best chocolate in the world.

When Charlie is walking home from school he finds a dollar on the sidewalk. With the dollar he buys two candy bars. In one of the candy bars he finds a golden ticket, with the ticket he's allowed to go into the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. Only five people are allowed in. When Charlie goes im the chocolate fatory he sees the most wonderful things in the world.The ending of the story was great. Im glad it ended that way. What I would change about the story is when Charlie was poor, he should have had a little more to eat and a bed to sleep on. I would recommend this book to my friends and I hope they read it. I think everybody should read this book. It was such a good book.I hope you really do read this book. If you do read this book I hope your heart will go out to Charlie and his family and at the end I hope your glad it ended that way.

Knowing about the poor Charlie Bucket and his family. About Charlie who has to wait for a year to eat his most favorite food in the world, CHOCOLATE. The description about Chocolate in this book is so wonderful, making my feet walk to nearest store to buy five bars of chocolate as if I am a chocolate manic or something. The chocolate becomes more delicious, really. Then, I get know with this Mr. Wonka. The most unique imagination, crazy and hyperactive creature that I ever know, he's the maker of the Chocolate anyway. Reading the next chapters of this book is really making me out of mind, don't know why, maybe because I am just an adult who's too boring to understand the fantasy of this book. Especially during the trip along Mr. Wonka's factory, meeting the Oompa-Loompas, Augustus Gloop, the boy who only knows eating, who trapped in pipe of chocolate river. I just mention one incredible accident, for the rest you must read by your self. Still, I was forced to give five stars for this story, as a story that I'll never forget in my whole life and eager to tell it to my son and daughter, even maybe my grandson and my granddaughter, and see the expressions on their face. And maybe I have to buy them bars of chocolate after that.

No one has been allowed in the great factory for years, and everyone knows that Wonka is a magician with magic. The story will make anyone hungry for a good candy bar and is easily amusing.

This book captures imagination like no other, and the brilliant idea and the brilliant writing makes for an amazing book. This is one of my alltime favorite books, and authors. Roald Dahl also inspired the movie Matilda, and he also made other great books such as: James and the Giant Peach, and The Twits.Charlie and the Chocolate factory is about a boy who is living in a very small ' house ' with his Mom, Dad, 2 Grandpas, and 2 Grandmas. His dad has a very low paying job at a toothpaste factory which is very low pay. Soon, Willy Wonka puts 5 golden tickets in 5 chocolate bars.

My sister was required to read it for school and since she had a learning disability with her reading, I ended up reading it to her and enjoyed the friendship we shared then. It is something we both remember vividly. I recently bought a new copy to read to my own five children and they are enjoying it just as much as I did. They love it.The reason I put only 4 stars though is that I loved the original illustrations better than the ones Quentin Blake has drawn. I miss the picture of Prince Pondicherry in his melted chocolate house. He also left out an important picture. In the beginning, he has the pictures for each of the people in Charlie's house. Unfortunately, he left out the picture of all four grandparents in the bed together where Roald Dahl writes, \\"Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephina on this side. Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina on this side.\\" Mr. Dahl wrote it along with the original illustrator so that those sentences would be put underneath the correct sides of the bed. It confused my kids when I read that since there was no right or left indicated in the book and no picture to go with the words. They asked, \\"Which side?\\" and I had to go back and let them look at the other pictures of the grandparents and point out the sides for them.All together though, this is a great book for kids who have wonderful imaginations.

In the end, Charlie recieves the chocolate factory for his extraordinary display of honesty."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a book about a boy named Charlie who lives in a small shack outside of town with several relatives. The house is very crowded. Everyday on his paper route Charlie passes the Wonka Chocolate Factory and lifts his nose to smell the scent of melted chocolate in the air. Charlie wishes he could just have a chance to go into the factory. Then one day Charlie walks by the factory and notices it is in operation again after ten years. It was inoperative because Mr. Willy Wonka couldn't trust his workers. They were all spies. So he found and rescued the Oompa Loompas so they could work for him. Later, Mr. Wonka had an idea for a contest. There would be 5 golden tickets wrapped in 5 Wonka Bars in the world. The lucky finders would be able to enter the factory and bring two guests...I suggest you read this book because it is a funny, well written, easy to understand book for a 10-12 year old."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This is one of the most boring books i have ever read, and that is saying something since i have read the Voyage of the Dawntreader.

The fantastic descriptions really appeal to the imagination: you can almost guess what a Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight tasts like. It is a very funny story because of the wonderful writing and characters, for example: the Oompa-Loompas who have te deal with dangerous animals such as hornswogglers, snozzwangers and whandoodles. On the other hand, the story has a bit of an evil side as well. Really nasty things happen to the other four children and Mr Willie Wonka has a bit of a cruel streak as well. After all, he finds the nasty things that happen to the four unlucky children quite amusing.

He finds a golden ticket in the rapper of a chocolate bar. So he and his grandpa along with all the other kids that found tickets get to go to take a tour of the factory. Why they are in there some pretty interesting things happen to all the kids. Each kid finds a way to get in trouble in there own way.My favorite part of this book is when Charlie and his grandma get in trouble. They drink so soda that makes them float and have to find a way down. Then they think no one saw them but they get caught in the end.I believe that the theme of this book is that \\"good things happen to good people. I think this cause Charlie is a nice boy and very good things happen to him. He is quickly rewarded for performing good deeds.Overall this was a pretty good book.

It is about a boy named Charlie who wants to find one the five golden tickets in a Wonka Bar. Charlie walks past Willy Wanka's Chocolate Factory every day he walks to school.

So he picks it up and goes to the nearest candy shop and buys a Wonka bar. He eats it all in one bite. Then he buys another bar and eats in one bite again. Then he looks closer what was it. It was the golden ticket! So the store clerk yells and says this kid found the last golden ticket! When Charlie gets home he tells his family he found the last Golden Ticket.

There are four other children there waiting to go in. Mr. Wanka comes out and gets the children. Then they start the tour.

A very fun adventure story told beautifully. A must read for anyone with an imagination. A classic!!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I loved the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. It is so good I stayed up all night reading it and I would recommend it to grades3-5, here is my opinion on the book. I like this book because in the beginning Charlie bucket and his family struggles to get through life. Charlie sees a commercial that Mr.Wonka is selling Wonka Bars with one golden ticket in each of the five chocolate bars. After school Charlie finds money on the street and buy's two Wonka Bars. Charlie wins the ticket but what will happen?Charlie, Grandpa Jo, and Mr.Wonka are the main characters in the story. Charlie Bucket is a small boy who lives with his mom, dad, and his four grandparents. They are very poor and don't have it the best. Grandpa Jo is old and used to work for Mr.Wonka and his factory. Mr.Wonka owns the factory he is old but very creative.Though the charters are important, I need to tell you the setting. The setting is Mr. Wonka's factory. Since he could not eat chocolate when he was little he decided to make a chocolate factory. It has a tone of rooms including a chocolate water fall. The five lucky winners will get to explore the factory and 1 will win the prize.Now here is the theme, Charlie gets a golden ticket and meets Mr. Wonka but Charlie's goal is to get the prize at the end. Read the book and find out if Charlie wins or not.This was a fun book, and what made me want to keep reading it was to see if Charlie won the prize from Mr. Wonka. That is why I recommend it to grades3-5 for easy reading."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Ha, this book is great, and I am 28 years old. am fairly The high of this book is a sugar rush...lots of fun~ and I am not going to say, \\"I am reading it to my kids\\", as I don't have any!

It was one of the moments were you thought there was no real evil in the world.With the new movie I decided to read the original to see if there are any claims of the movie character taking a little from Michael Jackson. Kind of sad to say there might be some truth to this as I found Wonka to be kind of a Phileas Fogg type of character.The original move stayed the course of the book but there was some artistic license.The book tells the story from Charlies viewpoint. Charlie is poor. He lives with his family. Both grandparents included in a tiny shack of a house. With all the poverty Charlie retains the pure innocence of a child. He wishes for more but is is about improving his family rather then simply himself.His opportunity arrives with the announcement of the golden tickets. As to the movie, he finds money on the street, buts a candy bar and gets the ticket!One thing that is different is the option for both parents can go versus just one like in the move. Charlie of course picks grandpa joe rather then mom and dad. Dad was left out of the movie.Enter Willy Wonka. I thought Gene Wilder was more to the character then Depp. He was a gentlemen with a peter pan view of the world. He didn't like \\"improper\\" children.The umpalumpas are different then the movie and their songs are rather funny.One thing I was surprise was the fact the glass elevator was a different book.

Each winner is more obnoxious and spoiled then the one before. Is there any hope that Charlie will get to go? And if he does, what wonders await him inside?Ok, so the title gives away any suspense the first part might have over whether he will get a ticket or not. But the book is wonderful fun. I read it a couple times as a kid and after watching the recent movie was inspired to pick it up again. I had forgotten how many puns there are and laughed at many of them. The story is rather straight forward but it is told with such creative rooms you can't help but read on to see where everyone goes next and what happens to them when they get there.

Well, Charlie Bucket did in the book and so did four other greedy, plump and gum-chewing children. They all get to roam the rooms in Mr. Willy Wonka's factory. But Charlie has to control himself so not to mess around or go against instructions like the other children do.Charlie was a poor child who lived in a shack and had barely enough to eat until he won a contest that Willy Wonka had secretly held. So now, Charlie is the owner of Willy Wonka's factory and has enough candy to last him a life time.This is a funny, and humorous book teaches people that magic or luck can come true. One of the funniest events that happens is when Veruca (the greedy one) and her parents fall down the garbage chute because their heads are hollow, meaning their mean and nasty people. The conflict in the story is Charlie vs. Veruca, Violet, Mike and Augustus.

Every book he ever wrote was filled to the brim with magical (if not slightly gruesome -- but no book's perfect) tales of funny candy-makers and monkeys who stick furniture to the ceiling with super glue to confuse their owners. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has been one of my favorite books for a long time now, and when I heard that there was a movie when I was about 5 or 6, I jumped up and ran to get it! I'm so happy that they are doing a remake of it. I can't wait!!!!!Charlie is simply a poor boy who wishes for happiness (and chocolate!) and goodness for his family. He receives one piece of chocolate every year, on his birthday. Soon, though, he finds out about Mr. Willy Wonka giving out five golden tickets to five lucky children who will get to tour his factory. One by one, they seem to disappear until Charlie is the only one left. Mr. Wonka takes him on his Great Glass Elevator and off they zoom, Up and Out, where Mr. Wonka tells Charlie about how he will soon be taking over the company when Mr. Wonka retires. Of course, this is a miracle to Charlie and his family, who desperately need the money -- and the happiness.A great book for ANY child!!!!!!!!Livi"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"As amazing as this book is, I don't think that it's the best work by Roald Dahl. But after the movie was released (and a movie remake will be released later this year), it is certainly his best-known book, and it deserves every bit of the attention its received.Charlie Bucket is the only child in a family that's so poor that they all look forward to Sunday, when he, his parents, and his four grandparents all get an extra serving of cabbage soup. Charlie's life takes a turn for the better when he, along with four other children from around the world, wins a ticket that allows him entrance into the magical and mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory. Wonka has been turning out delicious treats for decades from behind a complete veil of secrecy, and the guided tour is receiving international media coverage. Once inside, Charlie, the other four children (each of whom is nasty in their own particular way), and their parents find that the factory is filled with both wonders and dangers that must be navigated by one who is pure of heart.This is a grand unveiling of all of the elements which mark Dahl's work. The imaginative storyline, the dark humor, the wacky rhymes and the strong identification with a good-hearted child protagonist are all in evidence. Readers who have grown up seeing the movie first might be surprised at some of the differences between the two; no movie made in the seventies could have possibly depicted some of the wonders that Dahl has dreamed up.This wonderful book has become a staple of childhood, and no one should deprive their child of the fun that reading it will provide."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The book that I am reviewing is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl.

Willy Wonka took him around the factory and visited rooms filled with chocolate. At the end, all the wicked children learned a lesson and Charlie got Willy Wonka's factory!My favorite part was when Charlie got Willy Wonka's factory forever. I liked this part because it was a happy ending.The lessons I learned were you don't get whatever you want and be kind to other people.I suggest that you should read this book because there is lots of description and details. It's an excellent book."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie Bucket and his family live in a small house and are very poor. Charlie's dad Mr.Bucket works at a factory that screws toothpaste caps on. He doesn't get paid that much. They barely have enough money to put food on the broken down table. The thing Charlie loved the most was chocolate. One day Mr. Wonka of the chocolate factory sent out 5 golden tickets. Those 5 lucky winners got a tour of the factory by the one and only Mr. Wonka and got a lifetime supply of chocolate. Charlie wanted one of those tickets so badly but he only got a chocolate bar on his birthday. One day he was walking home from school and he found a dollar in the gutter and picked it up. As soon as he found it he rushed straight for the candy store. He bought 2 candy bars. He gobbled up the first one and then when he started opening the second one he saw a flash of gold, and instantly he knew he found a golden ticket. Then Charlie went on the tour of his life. If you want 2 find out the end read this book. My opinion on the book was I liked it. The author did a good job of giving all the characters good personalities. He gave good details on all the character's backgrounds like what they did as a hobby."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Yes, I have seen both versions of the movie, but after hearing that the most recent production was much like the book, I had to read and compare for myself. I bought Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a birthday gift for myself and I am so glad that I did. Once again I was whirled away to the wacky world of Willy Wonka with Charlie and Grandpa Joe, but this time I could create the illustrations in my head. And though I know the story well, there were a few surprises, such as the square caramels that look round, which made me smile. Overall, it's a very worth-while read, if only to taste the snozzberries one more time."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This is the very first book I had ever read. And then I read it again for a class book report. Not being a very good reader at all and, for the most part, faking it all through school - I loved everything about this story. I was disappointed with the Gene Wilder movie and much more disappointed that Tim Burton had made assumptions about Willie Wonka that I didn't believe were true in his movie. Older now, with children of my own, I've purchased this book and the Glass Elevator for my daughter who devours books unlike I ever had and, thankfully, more like her mother does. She's heard the story read to her in class, but she is enjoying it on her own now."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Have you ever been poor? Have you ever lived with two Grandma's two Grandpa's, and your parents in a very small house? Oh, and have you ever eaten a chocolate bar, that had a golden ticket in it, that gave you permission to go inside a Chocolate Factory you've been dying to go in? Well, a boy named Charlie Bucket has!This is the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It is an extraordinary story, about five children, getting to go inside the famous Chocolate Factory, run by Mr. Willy Wonka, that no one has ever been in!There was only five golden tickets in five candy bars anywhere in the world. Here are the five lucky winners:1. Charlie Bucket, who is very thin and doesn't have a lot of money.2. Mike Teavee, who likes to watch violence on TV, for hours and hours.3. Veruca Salt, who is a little \\"brat\\", who gets everything she wants, by yelling at her parents, screaming, \\"I want this, I want that!\\" O. M. G.4. Augustus Gloop, who's a fat kid, and who eats junk food all day.5. Violet Beauregarde, she chews gum nonstop, and if she's not chewing, she has her gum behind her ear. (gross)I think this book is hilarious, totally funny well written and exciting.I think that anyone can read this book, because the humor, and the way it's written is just so well put, okay, here's a joke from the book!\\"Squares Candies that look round!\\" They look like squares, but, they look round (around)!That's a good one!Anyway, I would be so excited, if I got to go into, the greatest Chocolate Factory in the world!It would be so cool to se Violet Beauregarde blow up into a big blueberry, watch Augustus Gloop fall into a chocolate river, and watch Veruca Salt get attacked by a squirrel, and more!That's what I think about this book now you read it and see what you think about this book!Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie Bucket was the luckiest person on earth. He was very close from not getting the golden ticket. In this story, there are 5 children: Augustus, Veruca, Violet, Mike, and Charlie. Best of all, I liked Augustus the best because he eats a lot of fatty stuff. Veruca was spoiled by her parents. Violet chews gum all day. Mike liked to watch TV so much. Finally, Charlie was the only one that was left because he is nice. The only thing that I didn't like was that it had less information than the movie."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is a classic children's book. First published in 1964, the book was re-issued in a special \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\" in 2004. This review refers to both the book in general and to the special edition.Charlie is a poor boy living in a small run-down house with his mother and father and his four grandparents. The four grandparents are so old and frail that they spend all their time lying in one large bed. The family is so poor that they don't have enough to eat, and then Charlie's father loses his job, and the family begins to starve.This is a story for children?Not far from the house in which Charlie lives is a huge chocolate factory owned by Mr. Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka is a master at inventing new kinds of candy and chewing gum and other sweets. His factory is manned not by human workers but by small Oompa-Loompas, miniature people who work hard and love to sing.Willy Wonka's amazing factory is closed to the public, but Charlie and four other children (and their parents) get to visit the factory one day. The other four children have various behavioral problems, and they all, one by one, get their comeuppance. Willy Wonka blithely comments that they just got what they deserved, and the Oompa-Loompas sing an amusing song for each of the four children to mark their departure from the tour of the factory!Do naughty children really deserve such serious consequences?Children seem to think so. They love the story and they love the quirky and strange Mr. Willy Wonka and his fantastic inventions and they delight in the songs of the Oompa-Loompas and the beguiling illustrations. So who am I, a mere adult, to argue?So five stars for the book, based on it being a children's book that children love.The book has been filmed twice, in 1971 with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, and in 2005 with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. I've never seen the 1971 movie. The 2005 movie is great, but it should be noted that Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka is a somewhat different and much more developed character than the simpler Willy Wonka of the book.And finally, a few comments about the \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\". As far as I can determine, all that is special about this special edition is that it is hardcover and that it has a very nice dust jacket with a bit of gold printing on it. Frankly, I'm disappointed that when they advertise a book as being a \\"Special 40th Anniversary Edition\\" that the contents have not been made special in some way.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"After seeing both film versions of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I felt it was time to read the book that started it all.Roald Dahls book is an imaginative romp through a make believe world of chocolate palaces, chocolate rivers, chocolate waterfalls and a myriad of other confectionary delights. It's also a cautionary and sometimes dark tale in which naughty children are served up their 'just desserts' in the most inventive ways! Quentin Blakes illustrations add a whimsical flavor to an already delicious book, one that my six year old son and I devoured in two sittings! It's a wicked, witty and yummy fantasy for chocolate lovers of any age!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"My son doesn't like to read, so after seeing the movie I bought this book for the 2 of us to read together and it is WONDERFUL!! My son is actually liking to read this book."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book was really funny and fun to read. I especially enjoyed the part where Mr. Wonka said he made \\"Square candies that look round\\" and everyone else said \\"They don't look round, they look square!\\" and then Mr. Wonka said \\"They DO look around!\\" because they had little faces on them that looked around. The Oompa Loompa poems were a lot funnier than in the original movie. I highly recommend this book.I am 7 years old and this is my first book review. I love reading now!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Dahl continues to amaze me as I revisit his classics in my adulthood. How is it that he writes so perfectly for his adolescent audience and still gains much praise from adults? I, like many others, read this in preparation for the theatrical release, and it was a fantastic book!During Wonka's hunt for the best heir to his factory, the audience comes to see four of the children as monstrous and responsible for their horrible words and actions. I like that Dahl kills the innocent childhood image (aside from his depiction of Charlie). And instead of merely inflicting punishments, he actually seems to \\"allow\\" the children to fall into their own unique demises. Charlie triumphs in the end because he isn't extraordinary--he's simple, content, and happy just to be there.Written with wit and on-point language, Dahl dazzles his audience with this quick read."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"When I was in 3rd grade I remember Mrs. Duckett, one of the volunteers, settling into a chair and reading this book to my class. The rest, as they say, is history. I was enthralled by the story, and I loved to listen to her read a couple of chapters a day. The whole class would drop down around this woman's feet and go dead silent.That was my first real experience with a book. It's led to a love that's with me today. Don't just read this book, BUY it. Share it with your children. And forget the movies they've made about it, because they just don't get it. Charlie's adventures are best lived in the hearts and minds of adults and children who believe in the magic of imagination and whimsy. It changed my life forever, and opened to a wonderful world where anything is possible."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This is the world that we dream of as children. The characters are wildly imaginative and keep you entertained from beginning to end. A definite on the must read list."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"As Roald Dahl's masterpiece \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" opens the first chapter is totally devoted to its protagonist Charlie and his poor family. \\"Here Comes Charlie\\", the first chapter, is supposed to be sad -- but it isn't. Actually it is quite funny, mostly due to Dahl's touch and enchanting Quentin Blake's illustrations.Charlie lives in a sad world where his four grandparents have to share the same bed, they can't afford good meals or a better home. Nevertheless the boy is happy. Blake's illustration of Charlie displays an enchantment of someone who is happy on his own way. At that's the message of the book: be grateful for what you have -- even if it is not at much as you want, your luck may change some day.For adults, specially those who don't like books with message (myself included), this can be a silly thing. However, for kids, this is a valuable lesson taught throughout almost 200 pages with lots of fun. Dahl's book works as a metaphor of the world --albeit a perfect one, and not the real one. Again, this is not much of a problem, this idealization for young kids.Blake illustrations are an art apart. They perfectly translate into images Dahl's words and world. Mr Wonka is as weird as he could be. Charlie is cute and the Oompaloopas are strangely cute, too. The other kids and their family are enchanting -- albeit they are so problematic.\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is a book that still enchants more than 40 years after its first publication. Both kids and adults may find reasons to love it. The young ones will find another dream -- to have a candy factory for them --, adults will find a nostalgia of a time when they could dream of having their own chocolate factory."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of the best book I ever read.

I really think you'll like this book just as much as I did. This book is for people of all ages to read! It is really funny!!by, Hollie"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I don't even know where to start with this book. It was just fantastic. It is clear that Dahl had such a great imagination, and it's a shame to the world of children's literature that he couldn't live forever. I loved every element of this book. I loved his made-up words like snozzwangers, snozzleberry, hornswogglers, and oompa-loompas. The remarkable descriptions in the book creates pictures in the readers' minds of the factory, the pink walls, the pipes, the rivers of chocolate, the winding corridors, the roller-coaster type elevator and makes the reader feel as if they could be there themselves. While I was reading this book, I felt like I personally watched Agustus Gloop get sucked into the clear pipe. I saw Mike Teavee be sent through television. I was on the elevator when Willy Wonka pushed the \\"Up and Out\\" button to head towards Charlie's house.Aside from the creativity and the descriptions depicted in this book, I loved how Dahl makes the reader hate all the kids but Charlie, \\"the hero\\". The \\"bad\\" little kids disappeared one by one, and I couldn't help but be happy to read how they slowly disappeared until only little Charlie was left. Charlie and his family were very poor. It was as if Willy Wonka knew that Charlie needed the factory. He wasn't spoiled like Veruca Salt; he would appreciate everything he saw that day in the factory and everything he was given. Charlie and his family were living off of cabbage soup until one day, something miraculous happens: Charlie finds a dollar on the side of the road. With the dollar he buys two candy bars--one which contains the very last Golden Ticket into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Charlie and his Grandpa Joe go on a magnificent adventure throughout the factory. In the end, Mr. Wonka gives Charlie the factory. Charlie and his family never again have to worry about money, food, housing, or anything else. Everything they need is in the factory and they have a happily ever after ending. Dahl did such a great job with this book, and it will probably be on my list of favorites for years. When I become a teacher, I hope to one day encourage my students to read a Roald Dahl book. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the only book I have read by Dahl, but I am certain it won't be that way for long."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I liked this book and it was goodto read. In the book they talkedabout chocolate and what happenedto Willy Wonka and no one has everbeen in his factory.

Willy Wonka hada surprise for them and who ever winsthe told them and charlie won andwilly wonka talked to him about givingthe factory to him because he wasgetting old and then he said his wholefamily could live at the factory withhim so they went and stayed there.What I did not like about the story wasthe the oompa-loompas because they kepton singing.But I would tell other people to readthis book beacuse it is really good andthey do lots of funny things."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"A confection as sweet as any of the candy Willy Wonka ever might have wanted to create, in this novel Dahl, who wrote many inventive and magical stories, created his masterpiece.A classic that every child should read."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie is in a family that is very poor. He lives in a small cottage with his grandparents and parets. He also lives by a great chocolate factory. Charlie is so poor that he only gets one Willy Wonka bar a year. No one has seen anbody or anthing go in or out of the chocolate factory.One day in the newspaper it said that the chocolate factory was opening up. There were five golden tickets on Willy Wonka bars to get into the factory in the whole world. The prize is you get to go into the factory and bring any person of their choice. You have to read the book to see if he gets a golden ticket.It was a good book to us because even if you saw the movie the book changed so you didn't know what was coming."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I owe it to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for introducing me to reading in general. An immersive and very well written story, and also appealing to our humorous and imaginative senses. This book is fun to read and most elementary students should be able to grasp it.

It surely deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate factory is a good book.It is funny and cool.It is my favorite book.

And there Cause there was a lot of candy. There was a chocolate river."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I loved this book, because it has inventions which I couldn't even imagine. Almost every chapter is filled with surprises and has many interesting characters.The story is about a little boy named Charlie Bucket. He lives with his parents and 4 old grandparents in a tiny hut. He longed for chocolate more than anything else. One day the owner of a chocolate factory that was 50 times as big as a usual factory announces \\" I have hidden 5 golden tickets around the world inside a chocolate bar \\"signed by Willy Wonka. Charlie gets a golden ticket by luck along with 4 other children. The 4 children are very different from Charlie and they are funny to read about. They are Augustus Gloop, who loves to eat, Verca Salt who is a rich spoiled girl, Mike Teavee who loves to watch TV and loves to play videogames, and Violet Beauragrade who loves to chew gum. All the children take a journey in Mr.Wonka's factory. They see many wonders like a chocolate waterfall, square candies that look round, and a chocolate television etc. This is my favorite part of the book. I also like the part where the kids give into their weaknesses and get into trouble. I won't give away the ending, but it is a happy ending.I would highly recommend this book to kids who love fantasy and adventures. I'm sure they'll enjoy this book, especially all the adventures in Wonka's factory."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book was fantastic!

You will like to read it because someone gets sucked up by a tube and someone else gets pushed down a garbage shoot! Somebody is even turned into a gigantic, talking blueberry! Someone is also sent by TV and turns out smaller. Last, the main character gets shot up into the air!This book is funny, so if you like funny books, you should read this book. You should not read this book if you want a book with pictures. You should read this book if you like books with a lot of action. You will like this book if you like descriptive books. You will not like to read this book because there are scary parts, but you will mostly love this book.I give this book 5 stars. It was an awesome book because someone gets turned into a blueberry. This book was always making me laugh, and I hope it will make you laugh too. There is even some cliffhangers like at the end when they are in the glass elevator soaring up into the sky. If you wonder what this book is like, you should read it!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The story grabs you at page one and never lets up, it's a mile-a-minute pacing that carries you along this children's classic at a clip that could put many adult action novels to shame.I am a 47 year-old man who is going back and rereading favorite children's books from my youth, to rediscover them and get back in touch with my roots in preparation to writing a children's book of my own. This book was a pure delight, its story sucks you right in and doesn't let you go for 142 pages of illustrated fun. Dahl's characters are a kick, his nasty children will irritate you with their foolish antics even as Charlie pleases with his good manners and deserving situation. Willy Wonka's chocolate factory delights with its endless wonders even as Willy himself capers and makes mysterious comments on the behavior of the nasty children and their parents. This book is fun whether or not you've seen the movies. Its themes of good vs. bad children's behavior and familial loyalty give it a strong moral center even as its entertaining story sweeps you along. This book will be a pleasure for children young and old, I'd think even very young children will delight in the storyline due to the simple, straightforward storytelling style and the child-centered focus of the book. Roald Dahl has conceived one of the great classics of children's literature here, a book that you can reread every decade of your life without wearing it out. May it reign for another century, at least!"},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"This book gives a more imagintive feel than the movies.

Young Charlie and his family aren't making a whole lot of money considering that only his mom and dad work. One day Mr. Willy Wonka presents to the public a contest that will allow 5 winners to go into his very own factory and at the end of the day they will go home with a lifetime supply of Wonka candy. Will our Charlie Find a golden ticket and win?I like how this book is very creative with all kinds of things. Like the snozzberries, the edible marshmallow pillows, and the all favored Ommpa-Loompas. I like how the book is very descriptive about what is happening with all of the little children. The climax isn't to suspenseful but the most suspense you get is when something happens to a child. I think Mr. Wonka is very energetic for his old age; but he brings the children to their type of dream worlds, filled with magic and candy.I personally recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and humor. The book isn't hard to read and it is fun for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great book by Roald Dahl. In this story Charlie Bucket is the main character. He is a poor boy that lives in a shabby house. Charlie and four other children (Mike, Veruca, Violet, and Augustus) all win a tour of Mr. Wonka's secret chocolate factory. Each of the children had found a golden ticket in a Wonka bar. Once they were inside the factory each kid, one by one, got into trouble, except Charlie. Some were so bad they were changed for life! But Charlie obeyed Mr. Wonka and got a big surprise.I like this book because it has lots of excitement, action, and humor on every page. My favorite part is the end when Charlie's grandparents, who have not been out of bed in years, are put into Mr. Wonka's great glass elevator screaming and howling. The funny thing about it was they did not know they were going to live with Mr. Wonka in his chocolate factory!People can learn to obey from this book. Four children disobeyed Mr. Wonka and got hurt, but Charlie obeyed and got a reward. I recommend this book for kids age six to eleven.

The picture on the front cover grabs your attention, and after you read the description on the back cover you can't wait to start reading!The main character is a small boy named Charlie, whose family is very poor. Charlie loves chocolate, and he becomes very excited when he finds out that Willy Wonka is opening the doors of his enormous chocolate factory to the lucky finders of five Golden tickets. Unfortunately, the tickets are hidden inside five Wonka chocolate bars, and Charlie's family can't afford to buy chocolate. Charlie is desolate until one day he finds a dollar bill in the street, uses it to buy two chocolate bars, and, lo and behold, the fifth Golden Ticket is in the second bar! Charlie and the other four greedy ticket holders, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee, Augustus Gloop, and Veruca Salt see strange and astonishing things in the factory, and some of them come out looking a bit worse for wear.I liked the author's ability to come up with wacky and unpredictable events at every turn; the surprise at the end was both unexpected and rewarding. I didn't really find any major problems with the book, although by my standards it was a bit short.

We were whisked along through the thrill of Charlie obtaining one of the prized Golden Tickets and his tour through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with his Grandpa. It's a bit of a moralistic romp; what sets this volume apart from other children's works?The dark, almost maleficent flippancy of Willy Wonka is brilliant--the person handing out the moralistic lessons is not some smarmy do-gooder. The manic playfulness of Willy Wonka combined with the general tall-tale quality of this book create a wonderful escape from the dreary world we and Charlie typically inhabit."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"The seller's response is quick, but the package was broken when it arrived.

You'll just have to read to find out!!The theme of this story is about the world of Willy Wanka one reason I believe that is because they talk about the factory a lot in this book. The thing is they get to go into the factory. Another theme is that Charlie needs more money to get a new house.The characters in this story are Mr. Willy Wanka, who owns the chocolate factory.

I don't think some parents would let their kids read it though because of some of the bad language used. I wish that they talked about chocolate more because I like it.

It is not a kid's book. It is a book by an adult ABOUT children, not FOR children.This book paints a very negative picture of children. With the exception of the main character, all of the children are bad and are punished in cruel ways for their faults. Are most children fundementally bad and deserving terrible punishment, at the moment they least expect it? This book suggests it (especially to a child who might be reading it and cannot understand what &quot;social commentary&quot; is yet). This book fits right in with the Omen and Rosemary's Baby. It is a child-exploitation story.I recommend this book to adults who do not like children."},{"Title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:A Play","review":"I hate this book SOOOO much. I was seven when I read it for the first time. It scarred me to irrevocable fear and forced its malicious, acrid depiction of the murder of four innocent children down my vulnerable throat. Many have argued with me and have said that the children didn't die. However, I argue intensely. First of all, Willy Wonka is a liar and anything that expels from his horrid monstrous mouth can be regarded only for the sake of malevolence and remain at that. Second of all, even if they didn't die, they most certainly lost their sanity - for who would not if one was nearly drowned and sucked up a pipe only to be despensed in a boiler, turned into a blueberry only to be mocked and rolled by evil little creatures, forced to fall down an opening into a garbage disposal to be burned in a nightmarish furnace, or shrunken beyond recognition by harmful rays of light? This book has caused horrible nightmares to haunt me and every movement I make for the past nine years. I have not even tasted a blueberry or anything blue colored since for fear I will suffer the same fate as the characters. I hate this book and movie with all the hatred I could possibly hate anything with.

But one thing: the Oompa Loompas were a bit scary and cruel at times. Like every time a child was harmed they danced and sang like they were glad that the child was gone.

From reading his Dahl's biography \\"boy\\" it's easy to see where he, and so many other British authors, get their twisted ideas from; the harsh and cruel British Gulags aka boarding schools.Roald Dahl loves to write stories about tormented, punished, starving, suffering children (and adults for that matter, too). I don't think British people like children, period. Just read David Copperfield or Oliver Twist by Dickens, any Harry Potter book, Alice in Wonderland among others. British children freeze and are chronically abused until they one day discover a \\"magical world\\" where it's warm, they get food and someone cares about them. Even many of Monty Python's movies hint at the same child-UNfriendly environment in the UK.

At this critical time in her development, when she's looking to women and girls (real and in literature) as role models, the only girls in sight are punished and humiliated for their aggressiveness.I don't begrudge Charlie and his spiritual journey with Grandpa Joe, or his final reward. But there's nothing in the book of redeeming value for girls to identify with, unless one counts long-winded railing against spoilt kids with very bad habits?The underlying message of this book is that girls have no part in larger adventures and rewards, that men and boys and male Oompa Loompas run the show.

Dublin Made Me, is at best a watery account of Sheridan's childhood which fails miserably to grip the reader and maintain interest. This account is more appropriate for bedtime anecdotes handed from father to child, than anything even remotely comparable to the writings of McCourt and other contemporaries. If the reader is anticipating the rawness and vigor associated with the accounts of others who have shown the best and the worst of Dublin life, then they will be disappointed. A very forgettable read."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"Everything the professional reviewers write is true; this is a marvelous story of how dysfunctional families actually function quite well, thank you very much.But I'm surprised that none of the reviews mention Mr. Sheridan's gift with words. Funny, yes. Poignant, yes. But stated with such a beautiful, lyrical simplicity (if that isn't an oxymoron) that one feels he could write a 500-word description of a garbage heap that could be set to music. And for a memoir of Ireland's premier theater director, it's a lovely trinute to a father who did his best as well as he knew how.Really the only thing I regret about reading this book is that he stopped at 1970 and didn't continue for another 20-odd years."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"If 44 has not yet been translated into Spanish, may I offer myself for this task.

At times, I found the choppiness of Sheridan's style a little jarring, and the final chapters seemed a little rushed, but on balance, I definitely enjoyed the book, and do not hesitate to recommend it."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"The story is about Peter growing up with his family in North Dublin and is set in the 1960's. The tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers, which his parents took in to supplement his father's income, forms the backdrop to his story at 44 Seville Place.The pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties. The short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up-beat throughout the whole of the book. For those who have experienced Dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time.The metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed. One example of this technique was when Peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother Frankie before Frankie goes into surgery. A joy to read.Da is the Sun and all the minor planets revolve around him. Peter takes to his role as Mercury the messenger with great relish. There is a strong bond between father and son.I feel this story should not be compared to Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. A one generation step into the future in Ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced.It was a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced.

Don't keep other Irish books such as Angela's Ashes in mind as they are each so brilliantley different. Experiance the writer's language of experiance and not your perception of an Irish childhood.

I agree with the previous review, that I was only sorry that it ended. I really wanted to know what transpired between 1970 and somewhere close to the present. Peter really remembers what it is like to be a child in an adult world, the confusion, the wisdom. Funny, poignant, beautifully written, beautifully human."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"Peter Sheridan's Irish family makes for a cherished read. The loved and classic Beatles' \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" album is brought to life once again. In descibing his fathers makeshift bathroom, Sheridan says that he used a local telephone directory for toilet paper: \\"He's down to the r's ... He's now wiping his arse with the Rileys\\" Pure dry Irish humor at it's best! The story depicts a lucid view of a loving Dublin family through good times and bad times in the 1960's. Very worthwhile!"},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"In the opening chapter of his memoirs, Peter Sheridan pedals off on his bike to run an errand for his father. Even at the age of 8, there's no way he could get lost in his own city. He &quot;loves the statues and monuments. If Dublin were a woman, he'd marry her.&quot;*** &quot;44 Dublin Made Me&quot; will invariably be compared to Frank McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; on the sole count of being Irish. The Irish, however, are a diverse people, and life in Dublin is very different from life in Limmerick. McCourt's family faced scraping poverty, whereas Sheridan's family (by no means millionaires) have a steady home environment, food on the table, and the constant presence of both parents raising a large brood.*** Peter Sheridan focuses on the decade of the 60s which begins with childhood innocence (getting a TV for the first time) and makes his way through adolescence and two defining events in the author's life -- a disturbing encounter on a train at age 13 and later the death of a family member.*** Sheridan has a wonderful voice for storytelling. He stays true to his kid spirit and endears without being precious. And in fine Irish tradition, every laugh has a tragic edge and every sadness is survived by some beauty."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"When you read a McCourt memoir you read of bleak reality, a reality rarely tempered with happiness much less joy. There is humor, however of the sort that more often increases your respect for those who are able to find humor where few could even imagine it. At times the light moments are not so light, just bright in comparison to what you have read. At the other end there is Brendan O'Carroll and his trilogy of, \\"The Mammy\\", \\"The Chisellers\\", and \\"The Granny\\". This is fiction and it is outrageously funny, so much so that when there is a tragic event the pain you feel from laughing often tempers the darker moments. And then there is Peter Sheridan's work, \\"44 Dublin Made Me\\". And this work lies somewhere between the two others I have mentioned.I enjoyed the book a great deal. At times it is almost a hybrid of the other three Authors I mention, for even though it is a memoir and does contain painful events, they are not as painfully presented as I think they need to be for readers. I am in no manner diminishing the pain of the Sheridan Family; I am expressing a writing issue, or perhaps a stylistic point.There seem to be more of these Irish Memoirs as of late, and as they have been widely read, they by definition either create or reinforce notions people may have already brought to the book. The issue that I struggled with was the manner in which some material was presented, some was absolutely funny, and other issues were anything but humorous. I don't believe they ever can be humorous. And this is the part of the book that failed for me. The writing was a bit too neat and slick for want of a better word. The experiences of a young child read as an accomplished Author had written them rather than a talented writer bringing the thoughts of a young man across as a child may view them, but as an adult would read them.The book is very good and it's one I would recommend. I felt it worth noting that the story of any country or the people that live there can become a commodity. I don't believe that to be the case with this book, but I feel the first steps on a slippery slope are waiting to be trod upon."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"As soon as I saw this book I knew I had to have it.

In a break from this natural order, Peter Sheridan's memoir, 44 Dublin Made Me turns to the bond of a boy with his father for its compelling tale.Sheridan writes about his childhood with grace and ease. Readers are catapulted into his large Irish family in 1959 from the first sentence onward.Peter Sheridan is a good Irish boy who enjoys school and loves the hectic life Dublin offers. His best friend, Andy, hates school but loves traipsing around the city in search of fortune.The two boys influence each other in both good and bad ways - Andy gets involved with the church after a stint in reform school, and Peter learns to stand up for himself. In the end though, Andy remains the rogue and Peter the goody-two-shoes.A steady presence throughout the book is Peter's Da. The man has his own outhouse in the garage, preaches to his family like they are his disciples and relies on his wins at the horse races as a major means of income.Peter is his Da's helper and is ordered to do just about every imaginable task - from climbing up an ariel on the roof to fix the TV's reception to digging holes in the garage to fix water pressure.When Peter's brother, Frankie, falls ill, their Da finds himself unable to cope. Peter tries to fill in for his father and be someone for his mother to rely on. After his father regains his strength, he and Peter find their friendship stronger.Peter also runs errands all over the city and helps out with the tenants his parents have taken in.One of these boarders, Mossie, plays a crucial role in Peter's life. Mossie robs Peter of his innocence, terrifies and scars him so deeply that Peter withdraws inwardly. Unable to find comfort, Peter then seeks solace at the hands of the church.Illness and deaths make Peter grow up quickly and 44 Dublin Made Me documents his maturation. Andy gets a girl &quot;in trouble&quot; and quickly marries to take responsibility for the situation. As his world changes, Peter adapts.Sheridan's strength is that he writes his story, which could be sad, as hopeful and happy. Rather than just have stories from his childhood strung together as some memoirs do, 44 Dublin Made Me creates a touching story."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"Simple, beautiful, and thoroughly engaging in the spirit of &quot;Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&quot; and &quot;The Commitments.&quot; Dublin Nort'soiders at their best, managing to find love and spirit of community no matter what happens."},{"Title":"44 Dublin Made Me","review":"Happiness is in the eye of the individual..to me this was a tragic family life...a mother overburdened with a houseful of children and a self centered husband.

It's just an adjective there to describe the kitten's personality. I enjoyed the book though I wish it was longer. If you've read &#34;Gretchen's world&#34; or have heard of that book, I think it should've been the length of that (about fourty pages). Overall, It is a really good book for ages three and up.

A shaggy puppy then offers to lead the kitten home but not before he busies himself yapping at a squirrel who drops a nut on his nose! Home at last, the kitten joins a barnyard picnic but a bee-stung frog causes a stir and everyone dives into the brook for safety! It isn't long though before merriment is restored.

The story itself is no great shakes: it's basically just a kitten walking around and meeting other animals, getting lost, and trying to find her way home. Nothing terribly interesting happens during her walk, and the book just kinda ends with nothing happening. It's like Seinfeld with kittens, and without the misanthropy. The real reason to get this book, and the reason to get any of the classic Golden Books, is because of Gustaf Tenggren's artwork. The art is gorgeous, and every page sparkles with life.

I ordered this book used. As others indicate above, if you like pretty pictures of exotic PCs, this book is for you. If you want specific pictures for how to build such a PC, avoid this book. There are no step by step photos that show how to assemble the Motherboard with components...where to put the chip (processor); how to hold the chip (and how not to hold the chip) as you place it on the Motherboard; how to apply thermal paste (Arctic); how to place a Zalman fan over the chip....Anyway, these are the important things one needs to know (+see) in order to assemble one of these high end computers.My advice: look elsewhere for a how to build book. However, if you want pretty pictures of what a fancy computer looks like, or flashy color photos of a nice motherboard, or a nice power supply...then this book is for the dreamer in you.

This is a GREAT book for those that want to travel River Road from Baton Rouge to New Orleans (or vice versa)to see the plantations and the ruins of some plantations. The way the book is written, with a map, is VERY helpful in finding all the old homes, some of which are now bed and breakfasts and others that are simply open to the public. Some, of course, are just private homes. I like the way that Mr. Kane writes such as, \\"...and 2 miles farther down the road on the right you will see...\\" as he gives distances between each plantation, etc. He also tells that when you see an avenue of old oak trees, they lead from the Mississippi River (or where it WAS at that time) to a plantation that may or may not be there now. It's fun to read the stories of each plantation before taking the trip so that you know the history of each and can be reminded of each history if you have your book with you, which is a must! You need to read the other review on this Amazon site for more information. It is a truly wonderful book that I'd love to be able to give as a gift to many people interested in the old way of life and the plantations. There have been several movies made in and around these plantations and at least one (maybe more, can't remember) is mentioned in the text. Our favorite of the mansions is Ashland/Belle Helene where Clark Gable, Sidney Poitier and Yvonne de Carlo made the movie, \\"Band of Angels\\". Another of many filmed in these plantations was \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" filmed at Houmas House, the site of many.

I'm rather fond of all of these books, mostly for the illustrations which I like very much, bold blocks of color outlined in heavy, black line.Planes isn't Elsie's (8 mo) current favorite book, it's somewhere after Dinosaur Dinosaur and My Car, and somewhere ahead of Barnyard Dance and Sheep in a Jeep, but it definitely makes the list!Like Barton's other books, Planes is a sturdy board book with lovely, bold, vivid, and simple illustrations accompanying very simple text. Elsie's favorite pictures are of the orange jetplane on the blue sky, and of the people getting on and off of the plane. Often she'll let me read it through the first time, then want it again, but turn through quickly herself until she gets to her favorite pages, which she either studies carefully or hits vigorously, depending on her mood. She is certainly interested.I like all of these books for reading to babies, and recommend the board books, even if they aren't lap-sized prints. They're the same size as my other board books, and that seems big enough for Elsie.Any word from other readers on whether or not any pages were omitted in the board book version of this book? I'm curious about it."},{"Title":"Planes","review":"We have the board book version and thank goodness! This book is read many times and is holding up well.

Text is very simple &quot;this is a jet plane with people inside&quot;. Very simple wording yet NOT annoying. Quick to read through and then my son asks for it over and over and honestly, I don't mind the repetition for this book (unlike some other books we own....) At 3 years old he now has it memorized and sits and &quot;reads&quot; it to himself over and over. My baby also likes this book and carries it all over the house and &quot;reads&quot; it to himself with babbling baby talk.I can't wait to buy more of this author's books and wish they were all available in board book format as this one gets a lot of use in our home.I have not seen other books about planes in board book format that are appropriate for baby through the preschool ages, making this is a unique book."},{"Title":"Planes","review":"When we took our 1-year-old across the country via air, we wanted to prepare him for the experience of riding in an airplane.

The bold, colorful yet simple graphics captivate my son's attention, and give us many things to talk about on each page. He started enjoying this book at 15 months, and by 18 months could pick out several things at the airport that he had seen in the book. We use the book to talk about what happens when daddy goes away on a plane. The diversity (gender, age and ethnicity) of travelers illustrated makes it easy for my son to pick out &quot;daddy&quot; in several of the pictures, thus making the process of daddy's disappearance on a business trip a little more understandable. The book fits easier into our carry-on bags for our plane trips. The pages are easier handled by an 18 month old, and hold up well under various spillages that inevitably happen with a favorite book. Based on my son's enthusiatic enjoyment of this title, I am ordering several other Byron Barton books."},{"Title":"Planes","review":"Planes is perfect for the toddler learning new words. Barton takes us on and off planes and illustrates different uses for airplanes, like crop dusting. There are even boats and trucks pictured in this story to add to the learning experience. This book is a simplified version of Barton's Airport book. It is small enough for little hands and great for traveling."},{"Title":"Planes","review":"This book is fantastic in its simplicity, but under the short phrases and light graphics, there is a lot of detail. Not only is there a wonderfully diverse cast of characters, but the book starts and ends with the plane in the air. Normally, books have the plane taking off at the beginning and landing at the end, but this thoughtful touch by Byron allows the reader to imagine the plane \\"living\\" in the air, as they seem to do, with only brief stops on the ground.When we first looked at this book in the store, it stuck in our minds after we went home and for several weeks afterward. We finally went back and bought it, and we think that we like it even more than our son does. We are not going to mind reading this one over and over."},{"Title":"Planes","review":"The Turkeybird Speaks (My son's opinion, age 3): \\"Now this is the part where I tell you to pull up a chair and your favorite snack so you can settle into a great book. Does it really get any better than trucks, planes, and trains? I would say not! They move, they have wheels, they go fast and they do all sorts of fun things. I especially liked reading my plane book when we traveled cross country to our new home. It was neat to look out the window and see the same sky that I was looking at in my book. These books are a must have for every home. Go get them!\\"Mom's Two Cents: \\"I have to agree with The Turkeybird and the publishers summary. We initially purchased the Trucks book when he was very little and it instantly became a favorite. Now that he is quite a bit older (at least two years have passed) he still picks them out of our full bookshelf. As he mentioned, we traveled by plane this last summer to move from the DC area to California and the Planes book was a huge hit! There are images of people getting on and off planes in the book and because of the small airport we initially left from, we were able to get aboard the plane just as they did in the book, which he loved! And though you would think these books wouldn't appeal to girls, even The Littlebug picked the Plane book out yesterday as her book of choice.\\"Now, onto the technical side of the book. What I, as a parent, really like about these books are the simple text and straight forward images. It's not going to be the most beautiful book on your shelf, nor will the words be drawn out and elaborate, but it still holds an entertainment and educational value I can't deny. Each page has between 3 to 5 words with a simple illustration demonstrating the text. For smaller kids it can often times be overwhelming to have a book filled with words and dramatic images, but these books though not elegant are still captivating. I highly recommend these books for beginning readers and even for older children who may need a respite between larger, more complicated books.\\""},{"Title":"Planes","review":"My son has had this book since he was two and it was his favorite until he discovered longer stories.

The other \\"Bible\\" is I'm OK -- You're OK by Thomas A. Harris, M.D.Before reading Games People Play, it is a good idea to read I'm OK - You're OK. There are two reasons why. First, I'm OK is a general introduction to Transactional Analysis whereas Games People Play deals with a narrow aspect of the subject. Second, I'm OK is written in an easier style than the present book. In fact, if I hadn't already studied I'M OK, I might not have understood Games People Play.The author of Games People Play was the founder of the TA school. The author of the other book was his follower. Transactional Analysis was popular during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, it has lost some of that popularity in America, although it still seems to be going strong in Australia. The society founded by Dr. Berne still exists in this country, today.Before investing in a copy of the book, you might want to check Wikipedia which has an excellent article about Tranactional Analysis. Games, the subject of this book, are special behaviors that people use to accomplish ulterior designs. For example, the game called \\"If it Weren't for You I'd....\\" helps people feel better about NOT doing things they are really afraid to do.I believe this book and the school of Transactional Analysis are worthwhile for everyone who wants to understand human nature."},{"Title":"Games People Play: the Psychology of Human Relationships","review":"Eric Berne, a psychiatrist from Sacramento, CA, wrote this at the height of the humanist movement in psychiatry.

The audio quality, reader, etc. is good. The audio chapters match the book's chapters so navigation within 10-15 minutes is difficult. The biggest problem is that the book depends on graphs and illustrations and often refers to them in the text.

It seems to have the target audience of psychologists, and maybe it does. But with such a playful title, I was hoping it would read more conversationally. I read in another review that if you skip right to the games (chapter 5), it's most interesting, then you can go back to the beginning to see how they work if you want. I hate skipping initial chapters--I'd feel like I'd miss something. But I believe he was right. I read through those chapters and they were a bit of a bore--like definitions and a glossary. Had I just skipped those chapters, I would have been able to judge from how it was labeling the sections of the games what the words were referring to. Some games are more interesting than others or make more sense. They all seem to be expressive of plots we see on tv and things we hear of people doing all the time, and this book gives explanations of why people do these things and what the proper response would be to get them to stop--plus the consequences. I do wish it was written less like a text book though. I'm an educated person--I have my master's degree, but didn't major in psychology. I don't mind big vocabulary, but I think the sentence structure and organization could have been much improved to better engage the readers.

But that's not to say it's a dense academic book, far from it; Berne hopes/expects that you have some understanding of sociology and psychology as he jumps in to fascinating discussions about certain human behaviors (particularly interpersonal relationship behavior) that is primarily utilized to construct walls and is rooted in the fear of being intimate (not necessarily sexually intimate, but genuinely honest about what you're thinking and feeling and expressing to & about your life and others that you interact with).The various \\"game\\" titles/descriptors that Berne uses are a little dated, but they still are very apropos and describe the essence of the so-called aberrant behavior in a wide variety of social settings - from the mundane (an acquaintance you know from the lobby at work) to the highly complex (the behavior of sexual partners who are past the early stages of the relationship).Reading the actual entries and their examples takes a bit of getting used to, as the jargon is very specific and precise to the established \\"rules of the game\\" that Berne presents in the revelatory introduction and opening chapters.After reading the first half dozen entries, I was quickly attuned to the behavior of lovers (current and past), friends, family and acquaintances currently and/or in the past that was confusing, frustrating or confounding; that was eye opening and gave me greater understanding to why certain relationship are the way they are.After continued reading (and it's helpful to read each chapter more than once to get the most benefit), it became an interesting exercise to pinpoint and categorize peoples behavior or combinations of behaviors, and think about the origins and/or continued causes of said behavior.Not that this are the end-all/be-all diagnosis of why people play certain games, but it does provide a groundwork for understanding, but, ultimately, this book is uniquely indispensable in providing an understanding human psychology, character (for writers & directors) and the behavior that stems from that."},{"Title":"Games People Play: the Psychology of Human Relationships","review":"Boy oh boy!

This book covers both the love games and the interpersonal games. Dr. Berne says \\"People tend to live their lives by consistently playing out certain \\"games\\" in their interpersonal relationships. They are desirable and necessary.\\"There is a 'historical' significance of games, also a 'cultural' ones. The intimate games include those women with large proportions (similar to Dolly Parton) who will sit with their hands behind their heads so as to thrust forward her best features, to draw attention by remarking on their size, like Dolly; and squirming around in front of males to show that they are available. Usually a lascivious mother uses provocativeness to get noticed. Note this, J. N., that is the provocative use I knew when you called me provocative, and I was scandalized, as I had never in my life been that way!\\"Schlemiel\\" is a game to be forgiven for non-existentent sins. Adults play this game in polite, grown-up social circles to obtain forgiveness, the chief goal of the game. \\"Anti-Schlemiel\\" shows the objective opposite by creating an enemy. Whatever, you say to this kind of close-minded person, the worse thing is \\"I'm sorry,\\" because he will not accept it and turn the tables on you by insults and worse. He is the type who never says \\"Im sorry.\\"In marriage, one of the 'bad' games is \\"If It Weren't For You\\" because you are blaming the other person (the one you agreed to love through thick and thin) of causing you to act as you did. No one can cause us to be uncivil; we can react to their bad behavior 'in kind' and that is not acceptable, either. If you ignore their slurs, then they accuse you of 'passive resistance.' Another 'bad' one is \\"Look How Hard I've Tried\\" usually by the male making the woman feel guilty for something she did not do. That, my friends, is called the game of love. It's not about sex; it's about power. Who is the most dominant partner? It used to be the man, but now the tables are turned and the young women rule the household and their husbands like no other time in existence. Why, I wasn't allowed to be that kind of wife! And it hurts to see my daughter-in-laws do it.\\"See What You've Done Now\\" and \\"See What You Made Me Do\\" are childish games but played on a continuous basis by ignorant adults, usually paranoids (he says). In the underground slang, \\"patsy{ meant all right or satisfactory; later, it was changed to \\"pigeon' like 'stool pigeon, not homing pigeon.'When you end up at the psychiatrist's office, you've played all the wrong games, those which led you into difficulties. We all sometimes work our way into a corner, but it is possible to jump out. Good games are those party games like 'Charades' in which you act out something in front of an audience and they guess the letter you are wanting until you decipher the word. I have played that game exactly one time, and pretty good at it, was the only one who knew the woman was acting out a book title, THE NAKED APE, and it embarrassed me. I just blurted it out without being socially polite.Dr. Berne has written WHO DO YOU DAY AFTER HELLO?

Sure, a starving humanity stratifies itself into \\"sheep\\" and \\"wolves.\\" Still, the falsity of that stratification and - in fact - all dualities is at the heart of the book and really what these two brilliant sci-fi authors are trying to tell us.The good news for sci-fi fans is we get a fascinating problem. A rogue planet pops into the solar system and steals Earth from orbit and there's nothing mankind can do. After all our weapons prove useless and no one returns from an invasion of the rogue planet, most of the human population dies out due to a dwindling food supply in the dwindling starlight as the solar system fades into the distance. And so we have a post-apocalyptic vision - shuffling drones and those few who rebel.However, AFTER that set-up is when things really get good. The authors set up this almost insurmountable problem and then solve it. However, there's a deeper point here. At first, there seems to be an inherent criticism of meditation, but then the table turns in a way that you can only get in Sci-fi. Kornbluth and Pohl seem to ask us what's the difference between a wolf in sheep's clothing or a sheep in wolf's clothing - especially if you can't tell the difference? Thought-provoking stuff from sci-fi masters."},{"Title":"Wolfbane (U.K.)","review":"Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth are probably best known for two of their collaborations, \\"The Space Merchants\\" and \\"Gladiator-at-Law,\\" two scathing satires of 1950s American capitalism which were not only funny send-ups of advertising (Merchants) and the legal profession (Gladiator) but also fast-paced adventures set in a future (but all-too-recognizable) America. \\"Wolfbane\\" is not nearly as well known, but is at least as good as those two classics, albeit very different in tone. The social satire is not nearly as pronounced in \\"Wolfbane,\\" a story of a future earth that has been literally stolen from its orbit by unseen aliens. The sociological element is still there-- the book begins by imagining the type of society that would grown up in a world full of privation, in which humans are helpless victims of aliens who are unseen and inscrutable-- but the caustic criticism of 1950s America is replaced by an almost elegiac tone. As the book goes on, the tone changes, as one man slowly learns that it is possible to rebel against the aliens. I hear echoes of this book in a lot of later science fiction (including the \\"Matrix\\" films), but the novel has dated much less than most SF of its era. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wolfbane (U.K.)","review":"On settling down with this novel (on recommendation, I think I recall, of Instapundit) I enjoyed the flash of recognition of the classic SF style. Written well, with interesting, unexplained phenomenology (mysterious pyramids, Earth moving from the Solar System), followed by a \\"rational\\" \\"scientific\\" explanation within a sharply constrained set of premises. Unfortunately, perhaps because the length of this novel is probably 1/3 of a contemporary SF novel, the character development is limited. Also, the ending is consistent with the narrative arc but without any unforseen twists and therefore markedly anticlimactic. All in all, the pleasure from the first four fifths of the novel outweighed the weaker ending."},{"Title":"Wolfbane (U.K.)","review":"I would never describe Wolfbane as great literature but it does have staying power. I read Wolfbane more than 35 years ago and still think of the novel's plot and ideas from time to time. It probably has the greatest appeal to young men who are feeling rebellious and nonconformist. But we all need help figuring out human nature and deciding what kind of human being we want to be. This is what makes Wolfbane a good read."},{"Title":"Wolfbane (U.K.)","review":"This is an interesting but somewhat dated attempt by two authors to depict a \\"far out\\" scenario in which automatons created by an ancient alien civilization capture our world and use it as a source of human \\"components\\" for an immensely complex planet-spanning system on their own world. It contains a multitude of thought-provoking ideas, but often feels dated and self-consciously erudite, as the authors drone on about subjects from meditation to cybernetics to large-scale engineering.The first half of the book describes two human societies on the dying Earth, while the remainder takes place on the aliens' world and contains lengthy descriptions of their huge planetary mechanical empire. As someone noted below, the two authors' writing styles differ markedly, and the \\"gear changes\\" between chapters are noticeable. One writer (Kornbluth) died while writing this novel, or immediately thereafter, and I suspect that Pohl picked up his uncompleted work and filled it out.

The author gives a little background on each person that touched Garcia's life and where they fit into the scheme of the whole story. It also tells the story behind each of the songs Garcia wrote or collaborated on and his relationships with the different instuments he mastered. It is easy to get lost in the book while reading it. The stories and history flow very well. I will admit that sometimes the author gets the reader lost in too much detail but it isn't distracting enough to ruin the reading experience. I highly reccommend it to Jerry fans and Deadheads. I will warn you that reading the book may make you wish there was a Dead tour to hop onto - if only there were."},{"Title":"Garcia","review":"A great book covering the history of the Grateful Dead and the many articles about Garcia and the Dead featured in Rolling Stone Magazine over the years. It includes many interviews and the best compilation of pictures of Jerry and the whole scene surrounding him and the band. A must have for every Deadhead"},{"Title":"Garcia","review":"Several of the reviewers apparently got this book mixed up with another one. There is no \\"author\\"--this book is a collection of articles and interviews, mostly from Rolling Stone, over three decades. The photos throughout the book are very nice, and the interviews are well done. I only give it four stars because Rolling Stone never really gave the Grateful Dead the credit and coverage they deserved while Garcia was alive, so I'm not going to give RS full credit for doing it now. (Rolling Stone was started in San Francisco, yet it wasn't until 1973 that they bothered to get around to an interview with Garcia!)"},{"Title":"Garcia","review":"We all died a little with the passing of Jerry, many brain cells were damaged during the summer of flowers, many more were enhanced and set free to colour our thinking and being for the rest of our natural. This book is best read and absorbed whilst listening to the Dead. It provided an insight into the man from the many perspectives of the people who knew him. And in so doing helped me gain an inside into his mind, his music and his life. Excellent rating 11 out of 10. Deadhead from Downunder."},{"Title":"Garcia","review":"Overall the book was good, but many key people and situations were never touched on. For example, there was no mention of Hank Harrison as one of the band's first managers. There was very little describing the negative aspects of Garcia - it was clearly written not to ( ) off anyone in the Dead family. Overall it was written very well and it gave a very good timeline of events (unfortunatley it missed some key events.)"},{"Title":"Garcia","review":"this book is an amazing way to get an in depth look of the life and times of rock's greatest guitarist, and most passionate performer of our time. it gives the reader a good look of the jerry garcia; and who he really was. a must read for every deadhead"},{"Title":"The Esoteric Scene, Cultic Milieu, & Occult Tarot (Cults and Nonconventional Religious Groups)","review":"This book is a fascinating, disciplined, and relatively sympathetic study of the esoteric subculture during the 1970s in the U.S., which includes an in-depth report on Tarot and Tarotists from a sociocultural viewpoint.Jorgensen observed and experienced the world of Tarot as an &quot;insider&quot; and describes it in terms used by Tarotists. His findings are based on field research which he conducted during the 1970s when he worked as a professional card reader in a community in southern California (which he calls &quot;the Valley&quot;).He views the world of Tarot as located in a &quot;social scene&quot; which he describes as an esoteric, occult, and cultic milieu, which &quot;consists of common themes (esoteric and occult knowledge) and means (social networks, study groups, cults, sects, movement organizations, confederations, published literature) whereby participants structure and organize their experiences and activities.&quot;The author views Tarot as an organized system of socially created knowledge which is subject to human interpretation and serves as the basis of such human practices as divination. On the other hand, he is unsure that the Tarot can predict specific events in a scientifically observable way or, more generally, that magic &quot;works&quot;.I recommend this book to readers who want to learn about the sociocultural aspects of the esoteric scene from the point of view of an &quot;insider&quot;. I also recommend it for those who want to understand better how sociocultural theories may help to explain the popularity and effectiveness of Tarot and how it is used by readers and querents to structure their worlds and give their lives meanings."},{"Title":"At Your Command","review":"Maggie Yates possess a Masters of Science degree and a graduate assistantship in psychology. Two days before her wedding to the professor she assists, Maggie leaves him a message on his answering machine saying she&#65533;d changed her mind and he should stay in L.A. In an equally impersonal response, Chet sends her a telegram saying he needs an assistant with whom he can work closely and he will find someone else.With no money, no job and no plans, Maggie&#65533;s at a loss. Four weeks later a package arrives from her great aunt. Within is a jinn. They are now unexplainably linked as surely as he has a silver collar around his neck. Until Maggie banishes him to the obis or she dies, he belongs to her. Maggie thinks she&#65533;s loosing her mind, although she can&#65533;t help but admire the rather hunky, naked man that has mysteriously appeared in her bedroom. Now she has three wishes before he disappears forever.But soon Tom, as the jinn calls himself, has his own wish. He wants to remain close to Maggie and keep her happy. From warming her toes to providing the most erotic nights of passion, he&#65533;s happy to please, unlike with his previous masters whom only doled out cruelty. Now Tom hopes to trick Maggie out of her third wish until she&#65533;s an old woman, so that he might enjoy living. He even finds himself wishing she might love him enough set him free.Christine Murphy creates an entrancing romance in AT YOUR COMMAND. Certainly any woman would delight in the physical pleasures and potential for wishes that this sexy jinn presents. Yet there&#65533;s a deeper motivation, as Maggie&#65533;s growth and maturity bring a sparkle to the tale, balanced by Tom&#65533;s sizzling journey to learning to love and trust humans. Sensual, evocative and amusing, AT YOUR COMMAND comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"At Your Command","review":"AT YOUR COMMAND isn't your normal jinni in a bottle story. Tom, our jinn, is doing his best to be released from his five thousand-year curse of servitude and torture. To do this he must trick his new master, Maggie, into setting him free. A couple of problems occur with his plan, one; she doesn't believe he's real and is being somewhat flighty with her three wishes and two; he is falling in love with her.This is a fairly short story, really a novella more so than a novel, a quick read and I found to be a rather fun one. It's a nice average story that will help you kill a little time that will give you a chuckle and a bit of a 'Ahh' at the end. I definitely RECOMMEND it, a great one for a day at the pool this summer."},{"Title":"At Your Command","review":"&quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot; may be the old adage, but heroine Maggie Yates wasnt exactly wishing for another man in her life --- especially a sexy jinn. She'd called off her wedding, spent weeks in bed, and wasnt expecting anything miraculous or wonderful to happen to her. Then, she opens the 50 yr.old package from her great aunt and gets the surprise of a naked man in her bed!Tom, a bound genie, has a hard time convincing her he's the real thing and that she has three wishes coming. He's hoping she'll either delay those wishes or he can trick her into thinking she's used them so that he can remain out of his obis prison until she dies and he's sent back to wait for another master.Christine Murphy has written a wonderfully whimsical book, full of moments of humor, moments of poignant emotions, and a very real heroine that reacts just the way you'd act if you were confronted with a jinn and three wishes.Its a great, entertaining read!"},{"Title":"At Your Command","review":"This is a fun book with a very lovable, magical, and beautiful jinn named Tom. Only two complaints - Maggie's character was not as developed as I would have liked, and the book was too short!

She was just a scrap of a girl clinging to a black cat with eerie yellow eyes. A lost child or an orphan, maybe. It was a miracle she had survived on Eden Mountain at all. Suddenly strange things began to happen in placid Ruger County, bizarre killings that the police couldn't solve. Horrifying accidents that the people couldn't comprehend. An insatiable beast was stalking their lovers' lanes, their swimming holes, and their children. No one noticed how quickly the little girl's pale cheeks turned pink with health. How her frail body filled out with sleek, lithe muscles and feline grace. And no one noticed that at night her innocent blue eyes turned an eerie, evil yellow ...\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This story would definetely make a B-horror flick, but I enjoy reading Johnstone's horror novels. Classic Good vs. Evil, God vs. Satan. In a rural county in Virginia, the devil's child and cat are awakened by an engineer in a mine. Bad mistake. Before this, Johnstone gives a background to how the girl came about and what has been happening over the course of about 2 centuries.Well, all Hades breaks loose. The girl and cat survive on human flesh. If you happen to survive their attack, you turn into a beast. Also, Satan calls upon the cats in the town and county to attack humans. This book is full of gore and is not for the weak stomach. It is actually one of Johnstone's goriest I've read, next to The Uninvited and Bats, also good horror novels.This story gets complicated as the sheriff and state troopers are trying to figure out what is going on, then the Feds get involved, headed by an insane person. The angle with the Feds, OSS, CIA, FBI and so on gets complicated at times. The main reason they're there, is to try and harness this evil and use as a weapon against the Russians. Yeah, right! Did not work as several are killed....To find out what happens, read the book.Only a couple of things about this novel that are negatives, lots of cursing and disregard for a few Christian denominations."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"When I was younger I read a book that I really enjoyed and spent years trying to remember what the title was.

Excellent gore novel. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The story is good, the characters were fine but sometimes I got kinda lost in the story.

Johnstone's Cat's cradle. The book's story is comprised of three different books. The story consists of blood- bath killing sprees. This is a fiction book that should be rated Pg-13. The book is about a 1/2 cat, 1/2 girl, which goes out and kills many people throughout Ruger County.

I'd found it among my brother's book collection when he moved off to college and relished the freshness of ... a book without the rosy-tinted happy-endings of our Accelerated Reader program at school.Now, about ten years later, I seem to remember the book traumatizing me a bit. I had nightmares quite a bit after finishing it. Nevertheless, it was a life-changing book for me (taking this statement with a grain of salt-- I was, after all, 12). The blood, gore, evil, and general terror of the novel made me appreciate the darker side of literature.Not for the faint of heart.And not for people who like cats. I do like cats, and I was terrified for weeks of my own."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I really wanted to read this book. I saw it while grocery shopping and was intrigued by the cover; I really love stories involving creepy kids and the cat looked cute in an evil way, of course. When I got home with my purchase, I started reading it and soon discovered I just couldn't continue. Why, you ask? Well, I'll tell you - Johnstone's writing style is atrocious and I just couldn't bring myself to feign interest in it. He writes in small, simple, annoyingly terse sentences, making it very hard for me to get involved in the story. I enjoy rich imagery and his style does absolutely nothing for me in this regard. I almost feel bad writing such a harsh review for a book I didn't fully read, and any other time I might *briefly* consider trying again if I didn't think it'd be too painful. Maybe I'll pass this book on to my little brother if he can even stand it. I'd advise anyone NOT to buy this book until you actually get a look at it because the style is that awful."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This novel is pure cheese. I picked it up at the library today because it looked like one of those quick, entertaining novels. Well, it is definitely entertaining. It's horribly written, of course, a ten-year-old could probably write better dialogue than this, but that's why I say it would make a good B movie. If you love cheesy horror films, then you could probably enjoy this book. But if you want a &quot;masterpiece,&quot; read Stephen King or Anne Rice or something, cause this definitely isn't one."},{"Title":"Wiley GAAP for Governments 2006: Interpretation and Application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for State and Local Governments (Wiley ... of GAAP for State & Local Governments)","review":"I received the book in time as promised, and it was in excellent condition.Great services!"},{"Title":"Alyssa Again (Harlequin Intrigue Series)","review":"ALYSSA AGAIN by Sylvie Kurtz is an unexpected gem. Seldom does genre romance mix so successfully with intrigue to weave a tale that will hold one's attention captivated by both romance and danger.At six, twins Brook and Alyssa were separated. Each went to live with a parent, believing the other parent and twin dead, until an unexpected illness brings about a death bed confession. Brook became determined to find her twin, and possibly fill that emptiness that has haunted her for years. She doesn't expect to find Brook in a coma, the victim of fowl play. Now Brook is determined to impersonate her twin and find the person who wants her dead. In addition to this dangerous task, Brook also finds her heart at risk. She's attracted to the one man she can't have.Jack Chessman doesn't want Brook to risk herself, but vows to keep her safe. He can't see how a kindergarten teacher can pull off such a deception without tremendous risk. Nevertheless, he helps to ship Brook off to her mother's care, and prepare Alyssa for her new role. Alyssa must learn to jiggle her foot when nervous, to slouch, to kayak, to court danger and to live on the edge. Not so easy for a kindergarten teacher who's afraid of the dark. As she steps into her twin's identity, she steps into extreme danger, and only Jack will have the skills to save her.ALYSSA AGAIN lends a new interpretation to amnesia, allowing one twin to assumes another life. While amnesia plots are terribly common these days, Sylvie Kurtz manages to put a unique spin on the plot, breathing in freshness and originality. Woven into the romance are also delightfully suspicious characters and a wonderful intensity. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alyssa Again (Harlequin Intrigue Series)","review":"An excellent read! Sylvie Kurz has an exceptional talent at weaving romance with edge of your seat suspense. Several scenes in Alyssa Again had me holding my breath--especially Brooke's kayak adventure. This is one of those books you want to read slow (but can't)because you don't want it to end. I was so drawn into Jack and Brooke's quest for justice as well as their intense feelings toward one another; you couldn't help but being pulled in. The characters are identifiable, likable, and above all--BELIEVABLE. This author truly knows her craft. She kept me guessing right to the end on whodunnit and will they &quot;live happily ever after.&quot; Sylvie Kurtz sprinkles in the red herrings just at the right moment. It is done so professionally, even the best of slueths will have a challenge solving the mystery. The author pulls the reader in and grabs hold of your attention right from the start to the very last word. The romance was tenderly written with feelings the reader cannot ignore. You can't help but laugh, cry, cheer, and feel your pulse rate increase. Being from South Florida, I enjoyed stepping into Brooke's shoes, into her new world, surroundings, and life at a small New Hampshire town. The scene in front of the crackling fireplace on a chilly summer evening with the man she desired sent goosebumps down my own spine. I kept saying to myself, &quot;C'mon, Jack! Stop being so professional, let your heart rule your head!&quot; Sylvie Kurtz gives the reader just enough backstory to make you want to care about these characters. It is woven into the exact scenes where a reader might ask &quot;I wonder what their lives were like growing up.&quot; I felt I was not only a part of Jack and Brooke's life, but every member of The Adventure Group. I look forward to reading more of Sylvie Kurtz's romantic suspense novels. One Texas Night, I thought, was great, but Alyssa Again wins hands down! When I read this book, filled with the author's exceptional talent of putting real feelings to paper, there wasn't an emotion in me which didn't come alive. Fear, sadness, grief, love--the story stirred me. If you like romance, if you like a GOOD mystery, if you have time to sit back and take a visually written adventure, then don't miss this one. I promise, you will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Alyssa Again (Harlequin Intrigue Series)","review":"She'd assumed her twin's identity, faked an engagement to a man she hardly knew.But only by becoming Alyssa could Brooke Snowden view life through her long-lost sister's eyes...to find the person who wanted Alyssa dead. The deception, she knew, was fraught with risk, but Brooke hadn't anticipated her dangerous attraction to the one man forbidden to her...It was Jack Chessman's duty as a cop to protect Brooke, and his debt of honor to her twin. But while his regard for Alyssa had never gone beyond brotherly affection, his feelings for pretend fianc&eacute;e Brooke were of the forever kind."},{"Title":"Least Of All Saints","review":"This engrossing novel deserves to be reissued in a new edition. The historical perspective it gives on the slow rot that attacked the Protestant churches in the early years of the Twentieth Century is presented from the point of view of a young atheist, Andrew Connington.Of English descent, this Canadian veteran of the First World War, wanders into a church one Sunday evening for want of something better to do, and is struck by how little the preacher or the congregation seem to respond to the powerful words of scripture to which he, Andrew, has never really paid attention before. As an orator, he feels he could do a much better job with such wonderful material. He is somewhat irked and disappointed to find that the churches, for which he, as an enlightened intellectual, has no personal use, seem to be failing to provide the spiritual nourishment and inspiration which he assumes others, in more need than he, are seeking. The upshot is that, having nothing else he really wants to do, Connington enters seminary, with the intention of preaching the word, as an unbeliever, more effectively than the believers do, not in mockery, but as a sort of social work project.Then the fun begins. In seminary, Andrew finds himself the champion of orthodoxy, defending the historical truth of the gospel to a faculty of divines who have wholeheartedly adopted all the scepticism of their age and are busily, if unintentionally, destroying the faith of their students. The more orthodox seminarians adopt Andrew as their champion, much to his surprise, because of his habit of rigorously investigating source documents and ruthlessly demolishing fuzzy thinking. None of this serves to make a Christian of him, however, and he graduates with honors, immediately seeking one of the plum parishes of Toronto as his theatre of operations.University intellectuals, congregational members, the lost, the faithful and the deluded, sex, alcohol, drugs, ecumenical movements, social activism and a very unusual love interest eventually turn Andrew's world upside down.At the same time entertaining, educational and challenging, Grace Irwin's story is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Least Of All Saints","review":"Truth can be communicated through various methods. Some people struggle with abstract theology, but would enjoy a novel which communicates the same concepts. Least of All Saints is such a novel. It opens with Andrew Connington's conversion under the ministry of John Wesley, then moves forward five generations to his namesake. Although young Andrew Connington has entered the ministry, he struggles with agnosticism. This account is reminiscent of the more famous George MacDonald novel, The Curate's Awakening, the story of Thomas Wingfold. But while MacDonald deals with the legalism of the Scotch Calvinism in his day, Irwin seeks to introduce a later liberal Methodism to its heritage.The author taught high school Latin, Greek, English and Ancient History as Head of the Classics at Humberside Collegiate Institute in Toronto until 1969. Some years after her retirement in 1969, she unexpectedly found herself co-pastor, then pastor, of her church in West Toronto, where she was ordained by the Christian Congregational Conference of Ontario in 1980. She continues to live in Toronto and celebrated her hundredth birthday in April of 2007.She has written eight novels, including Least of All Saints. The same theological emphasis continues in the two remaining volumes of the trilogy: Andrew Connington (1958) and Contend with Horses (1968). While Least of All Saints is not currently in print, it was last reprinted in 1976 and you can locate a used copy quite inexpensively."},{"Title":"Modern spearfishing: (incorporating Spearfishing, a handbook for beginners),","review":"The more things change, the more they stay the same. That sure goes for spearfishing and spearfishing books. Ivan was one of the early spearos and his advice to divers is still good today. He covers equipment and technique. Some of the equipment information is obviously out of date, and he does reflect the then current preference for pneumatic spearguns, but almost everything else in the book still has wide application today.The various techniques of underwater hunting are covered, and he gives a good review of ways to select dive sites based on the condition of the land leading into the water. Simple information, but gets right to the crux of the matter.It's a fun read, and interesting to see how things were done in &quot;the old days&quot; when you might use a kitchen knife in a leather sheath rather than a specially made dive knife or hearing about freedivers who didn't use fins or wore woolen underware for a wetsuit. Yow!Overall, a charming book. Maybe not the ONLY spearfishing book you should own, but a nice one to have on the shelf for those times where you want to let your mind drift back to yesteryear when all the fish were bigger and we all knew that man could fix anything he might happen to break along the way."},{"Title":"Dinosaurs: A Global View","review":"Dinosaurs: A Global View is engagingly written and packed with great dinosaur art. The book starts with a general history, and later chapters have brief discussions of various topics such as how stegosaurs' plates were arranged, how sauropods held their necks, etc. The writing is readable by a lay audience, although some paleontology-specific terms are thrown in without explanation. However, there is a glossary and a thorough index to make up for it.The best part about this book is the art. The paintings, overall, are excellent, and include 19 by Mark Hallet, 9 by John Sibbick, and 52 color and b/w by Douglas Henderson. Henderson's moody, atmospheric style is gorgeous to behold, at once both painterly and realistic. Also included are numerous skeletal diagrams and 8 photos of Stephen Czerkas' fantastic dinosaur sculptures.As a great picture book and for entertaining reading for the mid-level dinosaur fan, I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dinosaurs: A Global View","review":"When I first learned about this book, it was 20 years ago while I was working on JURASSIC PARK. Then, it was only available in the United Kingdom and cost me @ $65 to have it imported. Years passed and I got rid of my copy (I think I lent it to someone and never got it back), which is a shame because it is a nice book. You can imagine my surprise when I saw a used copy advertised on Amazon for $1.99. Yes, you read that right - that $65 book was now being offered for less than 2 bucks. Well, I had to have it. When it arrived, I was stoked. It is a hard cover, large-format book that is generously illustrated (mostly by artist John Sibbick). As i paged through it I got deja vu. Not because I remembered the book so well...no...because there were about 15 pages of the book that had been printed TWICE and bound in the book. Not only that, but those repeated pages were IN PLACE of the pages that SHOULD have been there!!! I could have been REALLY upset and made some stink about it, but....$1.99? That's almost the cost of a soft drink. I wrote it up to experience and now realize that if it seems too good to be true, it will lead to some level of disappointment."},{"Title":"Dinosaurs: A Global View","review":"This book offers a comprehensive description of the evolution of the dinosaurs. The well-written text makes it one of the better books on the subject - not too technical, but sophisticated enough for serious readers. The illustrations, black and white and color, are good, but consist exclusively of drawings."},{"Title":"Dinosaurs: A Global View","review":"I bought this book during the dino-craze of the early 1990s and I have to say, it is pretty captivating. The illustrations (color, black and white and photos of recreated scenes) are dazzling and the text is pretty understandable even for non-dino buffs.Before the BBC documentary \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\" came out, this was the only way in which we could imagine the dynamic life of the dinosaur. Just the cover alone, with a towering Brachiosaur stopping in its tracks with the arrival of an allosaur, is enough to make you imagine the Jurrasic sounds that may have accompanied such an encounter.The authors take the reader to the exciting world of the dinosaur, and the strange and exotic creatures that came before it (mammal-like reptiles, giant amphibians, etc.). Of course, these days you can see the Permian and early Triassic come to life in shows like \\"Walking with Monsters - Life Before the Dinosaurs\\"... but another way is through books like these that show how the pre-dinosaur fauna was also as exciting as what came afterwards."},{"Title":"The Islamic World, Russia and the Vikings, 750-900: The Numismatic Evidence (Variorum Collected Studies Series, 595)","review":"Thomas Noonan was a professor of History at the University of Minnesota and one of the world's leading and most prolific scholars of medieval Russia for nearly three decades. Particularly, Professor Noonan's research focused on analyzing the hundreds of Islamic silver coin hoards that were deposited in the soil of Scandinavia, the eastern Baltic, and European Russia during the late eighth through the late tenth centuries. Using the hoards, Noonan succeeded in establishing patterns of Viking activity in Eastern Europe which had remained elusive to historians due to the lack of literary evidence for the period. He shed further light on the numismatic evidence by surveying the Russian archaeological material and the literary evidence from Byzantium, Khazaria, Central Asia, and the Islamic Caliphate.This collection of essays addresses such questions as: Why did the Vikings first come to Russia? One of the primary reasons, according to Noonan, was the availability of silver flowing through Eastern Europe from the Islamic Caliphate. In another article, Noonan discusses why the flow of silver began in the mid- to late-eighth century, focusing particularly on the problems within the Caliphate, which led to its concluding peace and opening of trade relations with the Khazars. In another article, Noonan examines the distribution of silver throughout Russia in the ninth century, which suggests patterns of Viking activity in the East which are not discernible in the written sources. Noonan's reconstruction of this portion of Viking history using often intractable evidence is a brilliant contribution to Viking and Russian history.Readers should be aware, however, that this is a collection of essays and not a monograph. The reader should not expect an immediately accessible narrative of Viking raids and adventures. Noonan's writing style is, however, refreshingly lucid and engaging for high scholarship. The cost of the collection is also beyond the practical means of most readers. In order to avoid the cost, one may find all of the articles in journals and anthologies available in most research libraries.Warnings of accessibility and cost aside, Noonan's work is fundamental to anyone seriously interested in the eastern Viking world. Viking studies has long suffered from its wetern European emphasis. General works on the Vikings may include a short section on the Vikings in Russia, but these sections are too often brief and simplistic due to the understandable problems in assimilating Russian-language material. Professor Noonan tried to redress the balance, but his work was often ignored because he did not produce a monograph before his death in 2001. It is hoped that the articles in this volume, along with his more than 100 studies, will receive more attention in the future."},{"Title":"The complete prophecies of Nostradamus,","review":"Reading this book leaves you wondering with your own illustrations and possibilities without the opinion or influence of what others think which in turn could be a positive or a negative thing.

It is a good book to buy on Nostradamus for anyone who is interested in understanding his work and life."},{"Title":"The complete prophecies of Nostradamus,","review":"Where the heck is Century 2 - Quatrain 51 ?!

As for this book, it is an ok read, but a little hard to follow.I do wonder if Nostradamus predicted we would be reading his work on a kindle 2..."},{"Title":"The complete prophecies of Nostradamus,","review":"This book is good to have for a reference. The problem is it is written in two launages - I believe Latin and then in English - It is difficult to understand. It dosent seem to say exactly what Nostradamus predicited. I guess I'm looking for something more easier. Such as - NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTED THIS.....THIS DID HAPPEN ON.....SO NOSTRADAMUS WAS ONLY 2 YEARS OFF or whatever! That would be nice. Also, the book sends you to different &quot;quatrains&quot;. That is hard to do with a book thats hard to understand. I recommend Nostradamus 2003-2025: A History of the Future by Peter Lorie over this book. Except it tells from 2003-2025, not 1600-2025."},{"Title":"The complete prophecies of Nostradamus,","review":"Nostradamus and His Prophecies ( Edgar Leoni )ANY offering of Nostradamus' prophecies, that doesn't include the original middle-French, is bogus:you CANNOT know how accurate the translation is, then!The version I had had a slightly different cover, and had both languages,and from my minimal knowing of French ( & ability to do research ),I could see clearly that there were some incredibly \\"optimistic\\" or phony translations...That is the problem with having a \\"believer\\" do translation:instead of translation, it becomes propaganda!Get the Leoni book, instead, and enjoy the tedium of a skeptic giving you nearly everything,bad & good, contradictory or not, & then you can get some correct knowing!( no I don't consider skepticism to be something valid when it turns into a religion,and yes Leoni to some extent embodies that,but relying on \\"believers\\" to tell one what is what is far worse! )Cheers!"},{"Title":"The complete prophecies of Nostradamus,","review":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!

His connection to the area and to music in general is apparent throughout. While this closeness to the subject might be cause for academic concern in some writers, this is not the case here. The author's methodology is thoroughly transparent and ample evidence is provided for all his claims. But this book is not only for the musicologist. Kreitner's style is that of the local historian who finally finds someone interested in what he has discovered about the town. He speaks to the reader in first and second person frequently and often provides his opinion when historical data are not sufficient. In other words, he tells a fascinating story about small-town Pennsylvania, the people, the industry, and the culture. He then discusses the place of the bands and some of their more colorful individuals in this context. This book is not only a valuable addition to the meager scholarship on the subject, but a thoroughly enjoyable read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"History and Stories of Springville, Pictou County, Nova Scotia","review":"If you have roots from this area of Nova Scotia, this book is a great resource.
