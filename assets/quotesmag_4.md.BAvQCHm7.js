I listened to the 4 CD version of this book and after CD #1 and #2, I had to look at the author to make sure it was Stephen King. The last section was great but hardly worth wading through the first 3/4th's of it."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Once again, Stephen King has made his point about how an author can make you SEE. While not as long as some of his works, ALL the King focus is present. Together, the author and reader of this story made me weep for this little girl and want to fly to her rescue while at the same time standing in awe of her courage and determination. You know what it was like? It was as if he captured in words the spirit of that woman marathon runner who got within yards of the finish line and just fell, only to get up and stagger across the line an inch at a time as the World watched. Some may bitch about the length of some of his stories and some may bitch about the horror in his stories. Guess what? Life IS horrible a disturbing amount of time. King writes about how the human spirit can stand in the face of such horror. The world is better for his writing."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"One of Stephen King's best. Could not stop turning the pages. It's like your there, taking every step thru the woods."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Although not one of my favorite I enjoyed the book from start to finish.....King is the best in his genre and has with great sucess broken into others... I cannot wait tho for the Dark Tower series to be completed until and well after i will continue to be a loyal fan......."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Well, the last few King works have been less than appealing. This one in particular takes a new low...boring. It was an easy read, but what horror is it to us (presumeably adults) that a little girl is lost in the woods. I would have liked to have read more about what was going on with the family of the little girl during her misadventure. This one is best left to the collectors (myself included). Please Steve, more horror like what I read in 'IT', 'CUJO', 'SALEM'S LOT', etc."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This was truly a great book that amazed me because it certainly wasn't his usual work. It kept me interested, but I wish it was a bit longer! I can't believe it ended when it did. There were a few situations that weren't developed enough (caller with misleading info about Trisha). Otherwise, I really liked it. Suspenseful, and exciting, no doubt!!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I thought that this book was a good way to pass the time, or catch a few zzz's, whichever you prefer. I collect King's books and will continue to do so, but this one would have been better if combined with 2 or 3 other novellas."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I think this book should have been marketed or labeled to the correct readers, 15 and under.

He doesn't have to be scary to succeed at being the alltime best author of our generation"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I would rank this with the finest Stephen King works (my other iconoclastic favorites being The Library Policeman and The Green Mile). In addition to showing King's deepening and maturing spirituality (no gentle, nurturing, Santa Claus God for him), it profoundly illustrates just how fragile is our everyday, normal, taken-for-granted reality--the one we inhabit without a second thought until something goes wrong and the underlying chaos of things is revealed."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This was the first Stephen King book I read. I had heard about his other books and how scary they were, but frankly I was more frightened with the airplane ride I was on while I was reading it! Good book but shouldn't be labeled as 'scary'."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I read all of the reviews of this book to help me teach a Sunday School lesson about Jacob and his dream and his wrestling in the wilderness. I think King shows an awareness here of the importance of the spiritual development in children, even ones without formal training. I was reminded of the insights of Bruno Betelheim incorporated into Soundheim's musical &quot;Into the Woods.&quot; This is actually an important book, something King does not usually write, but which he is beginning to write. I hope his audience grows with him, in more ways than one."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This book was a real page turner. If you had time to do anything but read this book until you finished it I would be surprised. I haven't done much in the last day and a half but read this book. While reading this book I felt as if I were Trisha. I found myself feeling as if I needed to swat bugs away. I could almost feel the cold mud on my face that she used to relieve the bite and sting of insects. Stephen King really captured the feelings of isolation, pain, and hunger in this story. It was amazing that he could capture all that through the eyes of a nine-year-old girl. I liked his use of imagery when describing 'The Special Thing'. The 'Special Thing' respresents our most basic and primal fears when we are most vunerable and powerless. Don't we all have a 'Special Thing' that stalks us when we are alone and feeling vunerable? I know I have felt a presense when camping in the Maine woods. This story was very captivating. It was amazing that a nine-year-old girl could go through so much and 'Save the Game'. My vision of the game of Baseball and the Boston Red Sox is forever changed."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This book was not a typical Stephen King horror novel, true. It was, however, a chilling glimpse into the mind of a terribly frightened young girl. Some self-proclaimed die-hard Kings fans complain that this book was just a reason for King to publish or to make money. I strongly disagree. This story, depending on the reader can be a tale of terror. Each reader experiences something different here. The writing is such that you are not just a passive reader, but also a participant in the story, creating for yourself whatever horrors lay beyond the trees. I love King's writing because of his ability to create stories that let the reader's mind take off. This book certainly does that!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"&quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; was an okay novel. As an avid reader of Stephen King, I bought this book with great expectations. Being lost is one of my biggest fears and if anyone can put this into words, Stephen King can right?....WRONG! This book would have been so much better if it was written as a short story. King spent too much time with lame explantations and not enough time on things such as &quot;The God of The Lost.&quot; The book was too reality based, although it picked up toward the end. My suggestion for any potential readers of this book is to skip the entire middle of the book; read the very beginning and the very end (Top of the First and Bottom of the Ninth). The middle of the book could best be described as &quot;The Girl Scout Camping Survival Guide.&quot; A definite disappointment Mr. King."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Within everyone of his novels, Stephen King keeps suprising me. I found this to be one of the most touching stories I have ever read. You feel as though you are alongside this poor girl, struggling to survive. Plus, I must say that the 'Lord of the Flies' esk theme was genious. I loved the Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. /\\\\SET THE CONTROLS/\\\\ Josh"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"AHHHHH!!!! As a Stephen King fan I was greatly disapointed with this &quot;book.&quot; King definitely has a way with words as he has proven in all his other novels, but this one misses the mark of being a King book."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This one was the second novel by King in a row that I consider &quot;boring&quot; (after Bag of Bones). I really can't believe, that this once wonderful author of shockers like &quot;It&quot;, &quot;Pet Semetary&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot; or &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; has written down such a lame story. I must say, that I knew this story would be boring, but I bought it just for the baseball scenes in it - and these are pretty good. But could one honestly say that this novel has something like an interesting &quot;plot&quot;? No! A girl, struggling for survival in the woods - or: wandering around -, that's not a story I would want to read a second time. That's barely enough for a short story."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Read this in two sittings. A well written suspenseful journey into the mind of a young girl lost and alone. The more vivid your imagination-the more you'll like this book. As is so typical with Stephen King, everyone &quot;sees&quot; a different monster or horror. This is fast paced enough to keep you on the edge. A good read!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"After being to a couple of Red Sox games this year, and seeing the flashing red banner talking about Tom Gordon being a character in Steven King's new book, I had to read it. I started it Saturday afternoon and was done Sunday night. I got to a point where I felt that I had to speed up reading it or else I was going to give in and read the last page. I don't know if that is a compliment or not! But, I did enjoy it and it certainly kept my interest. It was not up there with Misery, but it was certainly well written. Unfortunetly, I had just finished it when I heard on the news the tragic accident Steve was in. Thank goodness he survived and will recover! My thoughts are with him.."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I love when King uses one character and creates a world out of it. This is classic King, and I can't get enough of it. Even though you are routing for the little girl, you are curious to see what else is out there."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Kept me on the edge of my seat. I thought he developed the little girl's character very well...her remembered conversations with her friend sound like the stuff my neighbor and I talked about 15 years ago. I'm a baseball fan and last year's home run race got me through what could have been a really stressful fall...If I was lost in the woods I'll bet Mark McGuire would be leading me out!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Stephen King is a master storyteller and proves it again with The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I found it as suspenseful as any of his greatest novels. If amazon will let me, I'd like to save time here and mention four other recent novels I greatly admired, THE GREEN MILE, by King, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, by Steven Edward Rustad, and LONDON, by Rutherfurd."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"&amp;#65279;Book ReviewThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon Stephen King Scribner 1230 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10020Stephen King has the uncanny ability to get into the mind of anyone and anything that he writes about, be it car, dog, or nine year old Trisha McFarland who wanders away from her mother and brother and manages to get lost in the Maine woods. Her only link to civilization is a walkman radio where she can listen to the play by play account of her favorite pitcher, Boston Red Sox closer, Tom Gordon. Her faith in him, her dogged determination to get home, and her desire to stay alive, take you step by step through pine woods, marsh, and water falls. She rises to each occasion, overcoming mosquitoes, wasps, rocks, fever, and \\"the woods\\" to make you share minute by minute in her agonizing search for anyone human in the wilderness. As intended, Stephen King reaches into the depths of your soul and drags out the fears and emotions that you refuse to acknowledge as your own. This book, unlike most of his, is more realistic than fantastic, but is still typically and wonderfully Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Though this was unlike any Steven King I've read (Bag of Bones being my favorite), it was interesting. This young little girl shows the strength and stamina you seem to expect from a young child. Her undying love for the game of baseball and in particular, Boston Red Sox player Tom Gordon, is in itself the fuel she uses to keep going. The games her mind plays on her makes the long lost journey in the woods even more real. You want to take her in your arms and make it all go away and give her a good warm meal and a hug. He's right, I wouldn't want this to happen to my daughter or anyone else's for that matter. I think being alone in the woods and lost at night would probably be the scariest thing a child could imagine. Try reading it through a child's eyes. What a brave little girl!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This is a disappointment. Although the premise sounded quite good, the book isn't. It fails on the most basic point: You do not care very much about the little girl, she is utterly unengaging. She talks like an adult (and I don't refer to the four-letter-words she uses) - a beginner's fault for every writer: You don't just say that a character is nine years old - you also WRITE him/her as a nine year old. Furthermore, the incedents that happen to her aren't particulary interesting. The only joy in this short novel is King's writing style - which still shines in some places. Even though the book is quite short, I would exchange it with Mr. King's brickstones any day. Review by Oliver Naujoks, Marburg/Germany"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon is a must-read for Stephen King fans. It was tantalizing and suspenseful. I liked other King books better. Namely, Insomnia and Gerald's Game. The first hundred pages of The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon were relatively uneventful. However,this was of minor importance because the entire book can be read in an afternoon. I designated this book with such a high rating based on the fact that it is an invention of the genius Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This story stayed with me long after I finished reading it. The scenes portrayed by King were so real to me I could almost believe I'd been there. Of course it helps that I am an avid baseball fan and have watched and admired the players, especially the pitchers, of that game for many years. I know some of SK's fans will not enjoy this one because it lacks the far out horror of some of his books, but I have always thought that the scariest things come from within the brain and not walking around for everyone to see. A great story of strength and endurance."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I really, really like this book. Much of the plot was about being both quietly and aggressively pursued by fear, staying focused on your journey while being tempted to give in, thinking outside of the box to survive, facing fear, and faith in a good, Higher Power. Pretty much all of the ingredients to a good read, in my opinion.I really appreciated the element of faith and the involvement of a good, caring Higher Power. Even if you don't have a certain religion or faith, I think that you'd still enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This book is definitely a surprise, coming from Stephen King. I read it several years ago; and I thought of it again as a birthday gift for my 12 year old grandaughter. I think it is entertaining and also brings an inspiring message for young girls. The side about the character of the baseball player is also a good model."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"At this point it is a cliche to state that Stephen King could make a best seller out of a grocery list. And while that term is used mostly as a derogatory statement, I feel it also implies that King has found his stride as a popular author to the point where he could actually make a page turner out of a shopping list. The man certainly has an innate sense of pacing and plot timing.THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON gets right to it, with the protagonist getting lost in the woods right at the start. the point of view of a 9 year old girl is told believably, and king doesn't resort to making his child protagonist some gosh-gee innocent at the mercy of the woods. She's actually quite resourceful, but never to the point of feeling implausible; King found a satisfying middle-ground. What feels a little less satisfying was the ending. It was not all that dramatic, after 200 pages of something lurking in the woods, especially for a book that keeps bringing up Tom Gordon's being a 'closer'. Mr. King needs to work on his own closing skills, methinks.Some readers may find the book to be scary, but I think it's pretty tame, although I suspect it wasn't King's intention to make a flat-out horror story, anyway. Rather, it is part harrowing survival story, part contemplation on faith. The survival elements push the plot along briskly and with the collective force of an author in his prime; the spiritual elements, however, may not be King's forte. King has delt with the intervention of the divine before (The Stand, Desperation, etc.), but having the little girl becoming more and more detached from reality through sickness and weariness, King stays ambiguous as to whether or not the divine really is intervening to help the girl, or whether her belief in something is ,in itself, what helps her to persevere. This is all well and good, However the ambiguity was compromised by the inclusion a certain plot device. Without spoiling anything, the girl's knowledge of a certain object days before she gets to it seems to make it very obvious that there is no ambiguity by the end. What could have been something that each reader could have subjectively taken differenty is instead spelled right out, which undermines some of the point. I have zero problem with books that deal with the Divine, but I thought King set out to deliberately confuse what is real and not by making his protagonist venturing on an aboriginal 'vision quest', however, he does not keep it that way and spoils the signifigance of a 'what is true' story with facts that point the way.The book is a short read, and will probably take most readers no more than a couple days to get through. It's length is appropriate to tell the story, but there isn't a whole lot of substance to it. It sort of feels like it took King only a little longer to write then it does for the audience to read. I don't mean to bash mr. King, but I'm just comparing it to his earlier works, and like THE COLORADO KID he seems to be making a short, brief, and quaint book that is neither at the top of his literary peaks, nor his horror best.recommended if you want something light to read on a trip, or a page-turner while on vacation. I suspect the story won't stick with you long after you've finished it."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"One of the few King novels in the horror genre that maintains a logical consistency throughout, this work contains one of the most remarkable extended descriptions of the American wilderness ever attempted in literature in English. A masterful work, and probably the only King novel I will read more than once. Oh, and by the way, it's scary as hell. Far and away King's best work."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"The novel really isn't a horror, but it is suspenseful. It's somethingthat people can relate with - childhood fear - being lost & alone. I actually found this on my grandmother's bookshelf. She isn't the type that would normally read a Stephen King book, but this one she did & enjoyed it too!Also, those who may be anti-baseball & think \\"uuuggghhhh baseball\\" & be turned off, shouldn't be. I'm not a fan of baseball & enjoyed the book. It's more of a book about primitive fears, survival & coming of age.I really liked this book. Plus, it reminded me of being lost as a kid. As a kid I once got off the path/separated from uncle/lost in the woods. It was less than a day, but alone in the woods as kid when it's dark, cold & rainy *IS* scary! So on a personal level it added something to the book.The only real problem I had w/ this book was how both Trisha's parents were sleeping at a hotel room while their daughter was lost in the woods & searchers were out looking for her. That just bothered me & seemed unrealistic. I know my parents weren't shaking up at a hotel rm. when I was lost. Also, I know if my child was lost either both my husband & I would be helping the searchers or at least 1 of us would be.Anyways, a good quick read."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I just finished it. Very realistic read. Didn't scare me, but it entertained me well. Stephen King is still keeping up that great writting style of his. I would recomend this to fans of his, but if you want to see a great king book, check out, Christine, Carrie, and Salem's Lot. Still I recomend it though."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I picked up this book on a Saturday afternoon and read it overnight. It is definitely entertaining and interesting. I expected it to be scarier, but then again if it was, you'd be quickly leading down the path of Blair Witch...which I'm actually glad it wasn't. The outcome was pretty predictable and it's very short for a King book, but I'm glad I bought it. I agree it keeps you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"While I enjoyed this short story of survival as a typical King read and move on work of fiction (Insomnia only comes once in a while and The Stand comes once in a lifetime), I was blown away at what I consider a major flaw in King's research. His name is Jason V-A-ritek, not V-E-ritek. Come on Stephen! While I am sure you know how to spell it now, how could you, as someone heavily tied to Red Sox Nation, misspell any of the players names.I am glad to see you redeemed yourself in Faithful."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Stephen King has an outstanding ability to make his stories come alive to readers, to not only see the story vividly but to see it through the eyes of the character(s) in the story. This certainly holds true about \\"The girl who loved Tom Gordon\\"; a story about a nine-year-old girl lost in the woods, her only connection to the outside world, giving her hope, is listening to Tom Gordon save games for the Sox.Only Stephen King can take a story so seemingly boring and turn it into such a fascinating tale, weaving between the rational and realistic to the mystical and hallucinatory. He so lovingly takes the skill of a closing pitcher in baseball, and turns it into a running allegorical theme on gaining hope and victories in life.This book is for anyone who appreciates stories well told, with great imagery and imagination. I found myself turning pages, and couldn't put it down untill the final lines. Although I've always loved King's writing style, I've often been turned off by his some of his real strange storylines, not so in this case. The girl who loved Tom Gordon is an absolute winner."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I was on the edge of my seat during this read. I loved it. King lived up to his name on this one."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Thank you, Stephen King. You are the best writer since John Steinbeck. I really appreciate what you have done, and how you have effected this world. I advise everyone to read this book, and every other book by him, because he is a book genius. He deserves all five stars for this book."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I've been a fan of Stephen King's for years. I enjoyed &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; tremendously. The Trisha McFarland character is spunky, resourceful and very brave. I now understand how very easy it is for a person, child or adult, to get lost in the woods. I think every child at some time or other thinks &quot;They'll be sorry when I'm not here anymore&quot; and for Trisha it actually happened. Stephen Kings description of the White Mountains made me feel as if I were right there with Trisha, he still has the ability to keep me glued to the book wishing it wouldn't end. Excellent story!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Steven King has once again proved that the monsters within us are the most frightening. He really knows the &quot;inner person&quot; and how to dig 'um up. Good book,a page turner!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"1 word &quot;OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!&quot; This is one of the best novels he has ever written. Bravo!!!!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Stephen, it's time to move on.King pulls out all his patented gimmicks in this quick read. The ewwwww factor, the bogeyman, the troubled pre-adolescent, the faceoff at the end. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Stephen wrote of his methods in &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; and now it's time to move on.&quot;The Girl...&quot; is not without some fun (in the King sense) but why try to shoehorn the gimmicks to fit the story.Someday (soon I hope), King will drop his compulsion to shock and gross-out and simply write a good story. Ya know ya got it in ya, Steve!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I have to admit that I have never been a baseball fan. Even a few years ago when the Braves started their thing, I pretty much ignored it. But now, thanks to King, I may be looking at the game in a whole new light, or at least have a better understanding as to why it's so important to so many people. I heard somebody once say that a baseball game is a microcosmic version of life. Aside from all the B.S., salary disputes, and silly mascots, I think that's not too far off the mark. Maybe I can learn something from the game after all.Regarding the book, King's writing never ceases to amaze me. I don't agree with people who say he's declined in the past few years. The truth is, he's only gotten better. His ability to convey the inner monologues of a person is amazing. And he's given us a hero in the shape of a nine year old girl. Ignore those shallow reviews below that bash the book because it &quot;lacks horror&quot; or has no &quot;scariness&quot;. I don't think that's the point. The point is to give you characters you can get to know, make friends with, and care enough about to see them through to the last page. That's what King has done . . . again."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I was surprised at how King somehow makes the woods come alive once again, how he can describe the perils of one young girl in the woods so amazingly well. I for one believe this was an excellent book, and the lowered price means that it IS supposed to be sort of a novella, rather than a full-fledged novel. It may have been just a few weeks out of an author's time to bring us an incredible journey, one that is well worth reading.And, on another note, I for one thought Bag of Bones was a great story, a little wordy (but all of his books get that way a little *cough* It *cough*). However I really enjoyed the fact that we could get into a writer's mind like that, how the pages of the author's &quot;new story&quot; spelled out exactly what he needed to do. My two cents anyway."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"As a die hard fan of Stephen King, I spent my Saturday afternoon curled up on my sofa reading and expecting to be looking over my shoulder for a week due to whatever creepy crawly SK cooked up this time. The book didn't pull up the basement files of my imagination like his books normally do. Trish is a great character, but the baseball references just didn't do it for me. Personally, I am still patiently waiting for the next in the Gunslinger series. I can't get enough of that story (even with the strange Wizard of Oz references). If SK reads these reviews - I hope he is only taking a break from the next book in that series. Also - I missed the little note from him at the beginning of the book letting us know what he is working on and what dark places he has been to lately."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I was so excited that there was a new King book out after the horrible &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; , but after I read this one, I was asking myself if we were ever going to read anything as good as his older stuff again. I found it boring, the main character was okay, but I found it hard to believe that a nine yr. old girl would say some of the things that she did. All in all, when I was finished reading it, I thought what Trisha thought at the end, &quot;That's it? That's all there Is????&quot; Very disappointing.(Especially for $16.00)"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I am a King fanatic and this book just didn't set off any bells and whistles for me. It was very short and I don't feel it went into enough detail (I never thought I would say that about King!). You are given almost no ideas about the &quot;special thing&quot; until the very end, which makes it very hard to be afraid of.It's a good enough read if you need a King fix, but not his best work by far."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"As a rule I love Stephen King...but not this time. This book started out slow but I kept reading hoping the plot would pick up but it never happened. If anyone besides Stephen King would have written this I would have given up and not bothered to finish it. If I didn't know better I would think someone else had written this one!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I didn't really like this book. King uses his same old mastery of mental pictures to make the book vivid... but in my opinion, it really wasn't a very good story to begin with."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"i have found nothing but praise for this book in the reviews i sought out after wasting my time finishing this book, looking forward to reading common discontent views on this, the biggest let down i have read in some time from an author i had grown to appreciate. have read in other reviews about the suspense created in this book and was thrown back at others' mention of horror! this is not horror to put it plain and to the point. this book is about a lost (and very exaggerated) nine year old walking through the woods near canada somewhere. that is it. so she just keeps walking, of course stumbling in and through to the very poor to life threatening natural conditions which are obvious, expected and unremarkable as a whole. several times it seems as though King forgets that this girl is nine as he writes her, based on my comparison to my nine year old daughter and the girlfriends she has stay over. initially i am under the notion that this is going to be a 'bug horror' type story when trisha is accosted by several winged insects at the beginning of her journey. that passes as she makes her way into a swamp where you would think there is going to be a peak of an overwhelming infestation but instead is where the insect theory is stunted by decreasing mention of that particular problem. the 'creature' that follows her loosely through the story is sparsely mentioned at all and when King actually bothers, the lack of details is discouraging and vague, not the suspense creating vague either, the 'should i even make note of that' vague. i about threw the book across the room on page 170 (which i bookmarked after overcoming that urge) where the chapter closes up with the bold statement that pretty much nothing of interest is in this books near future and there is no distant future when you are over two thirds of your way through the book. i have not reviewed books before being inspired by this book to take time to vent about my discontent with this book. i honestly am not a nay-sayer by any means and really am normally pretty happy just being able to have time to read anything. perhaps i simply expected more from this book because it was written by king and i had great previous experiences reading his larger novels."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Who wants to read 200 pages about a girl wandering around in the forest?

Don't waste any time or money on this one! The only positive thing I can say about this is that although I read it a long time ago, I still remember it. However, not because it is any good, but rather because I felt so stupid for spending my time reading it. It is hands down the dumbest book I ever read that I finished. It was gross, disgusting, and moved very slowly (which I believe was purposeful to show how long it seemed to the girl to find her way out of the woods). This was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and my last! I couldn't understand why he is a best selling author and truly believe that if an unknown author wrote this, it would not even be published. It was soooo boring!When I finally finished it, I was relieved I was done, shocked that the whole story was about the girl trying to find her way out of the woods and nothing really ever happened. I kept reading only because I thought there must be more to it than just this, but there never was. I was very disgusted that I wasted my time reading this! I certainly don't recommend it to anyone.Karen Arlettaz Zemek, author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\""},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read.

Like Gerald's Game, this book doesn't have enough of a plot to keep you interested. It is basically just this little girl wandering about the woods, and trying to survive. King is an enigma because in latter years he is trying to write diffently than his successful ventures! He needs to stick with what he began with-horror, suspense, etc. This story should be labeled young adult. I think teens might enjoy it.

There was really no mistery to keep you on the eagde of your seat."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Fans of Stephen King will not believe he wrote a book you can lift with one hand. Friends of the blow-'em-up endings of Needful Things and Insomnia (among others) may be disappointed that the fireworks is missing. But in this short, tense novel you will find all the slowly mounting fear, dread and terror that Stephen King writes so masterfully. And he does it slowly, carefully, and, as always, letting us fill in the blanks with the worst of our own nightmares. A little girl gets lost while on a hike in the woods with her mother and brother. She is lost spiritually and psychologically, too. Her parents have divorced and her brother is stuck in his own anger. King uses the clever device of the samness of the woods, the sameness of her attempt to find a way out as a counterpoint to her interior struggle with despair, the existence of God, her relationship to her angry parents. As her Walkman fades out she is left utterly alone. Well, except for the hallucinations (or is that scrabbling in the leaves real?) In this book, King shows that that terror can travel slowly, and that if the world ends with a whimper instead of a bang, it can still be terrifying."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I recently read Stephen King's book The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. This is the first book that I have ever read by Stephen King, and I feel that it was an excellent way to become accustomed to his literary style. King's experience as a proficient writer shines through in this work. The novel basically has one character throughout the entire read, and the whole story is told through this character's eyes. I think it is quite an accomplishment for a successful male writer to be able to pull writing about the world through the eyes of a frightened little girl. The story flows and does an excellent job of keeping the reader caught up in the plight of this little girl lost in the woods alone. The imagery in the book is so real, you can feel and see the wasps, swamp, and forest closing in on the main character, Trisha McFarland. The suspense does not let up for one moment through the entire read, and therefore you never want to put the book down. I also, really liked the way that King leaves the &quot;monster&quot; in the story completely up to the reader's interpretation. You keep wondering if the monster is real of a figment of Trisha's imagination. Then finally at the end, the style is such that you really can't tell whether or not it was there at all. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone, and have!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"My all-time favorite King book is IT, which is chockful of supernatural elements. But my other favorites are Cujo, Misery, and Gerald's Game, none of which have supernatural elements. Whether The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon has a supernatural element depends on how you interpret it.The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is essentially a one-character book. Few writers could pull that off, but King does it beautifully. Except for a brief prologue that provides background, Trisha is all alone, lost in the woods, trying to survive, and the reader is very much with her, swatting at bugs, slipping through mud, listening to the sound of something moving in the dark forest. Since King can't be counted on for a happy ending, the question of her survival is real. I had to really force myself not to check the ending to see if she survived. The last page made me cry, and I don't cry easily.I have seen some criticism of the length of this book. Fans of King have come to expect lengthy works, but a book should be as long as it needs to be to tell the story and no longer. King tells a good story here, and nothing is missing. This is storytelling at its best.

Usually, he likes to write the gory horror stories, while this is more spirital. This one of my favorite stories by him.It's about a 9-year-old girl who gets lost in the woods. The only thing that keeps her sanity is her walkman radio, which she has tuned into a baseball game.

Trisha is very real, caught between being a little girl and a mature one, as all pre-teen girls are; but she actually has to live with her own life and death choices in a way most kids don't. I'm not a fan of baseball but it's involvement doesn't ruin the story, it enhances it.

This book is a first edition, in good condition, and has all pop-ups working and in very good condition. Was sent very well packaged."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"King's talent for writing, for creating scenes rich in character and original plot lines, is very clear. Those who review this book negatively seem to be type-casting King as only a horror author, yet he has been writing non-horror all along (at one point using a pseudonym to do it). Anyone who enjoyed \\"The Body\\" in King's collection of novellas, _Different Seasons_, will very much like this book, _The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon_. There is a bit of the supernatural in here, but it is mostly a survival story of a girl lost in the woods. At times the suspense is in wondering if the protagonist is imagining a monster following her in the woods (as we all would do if we were lost in the woods at such an age) -- or if there really is a monster following her in the woods.I've knocked off a star only because it didn't give me the ending I was hoping for... I enjoy the psychological thriller more than pure horror... and it's at the end that the horror writer side of Stephen King comes through.

For one, like most Stephen King books it is well written. It is written in such a way that you want to put it down because its so scary but you can't stop reading it. King sucks you in like a vacuum and wont spit you out until the end. It's also written in a way that you can understand what's going on and you do not get confused. Also the content of the book is amazing. It's a perfect example of a perfectly written novel. The book brings something so true to writing and makes you realize how a poor choice can lead to a life threatening adventure. It tells you the story of a little girl's survival and the mistakes she made on the way. This prepares you for whenever a journey like this is thrown your way. It also goes to show that your mind can either help you or hurt you by explaining how she imagined the baseball player Tom Gordon to survive and she dreamt of a wasp king in which scared her. I love how realistic the book is and there are so many things to just come along and tick you off. It is just like you're in the girl's place. When she's hungry you feel hungry, when she's scared you become scared, and when she made mistakes you wish you could turn back the page and redo what she did wrong. This is a book I will gladly read time after, after time. Almost the whole book keeps you in suspense and has a surprise ending you would never suspect. I recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a suspenseful book full of adventure that they cannot put down."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I have not seen the pop-up version yet, but it sounds like a great idea. My 13 yr old daughter and I have each read the book twice - we both found the book wonderfully frightening and emotionally upsetting, yet we both count this as one of our favorite books. The book was in the older children's section of our library and is written at a level for children 10 yrs or older, although it might be too frightening for children under 12. It is a very intense story if you put yourself in the shoes of Trisha, the girl lost in the woods, and you won't want to put the book down. I believe the story was deliberately written in a slow moving manner because that is the way it would be if you were lost in the woods - one hour would seem like a day... It is a survival story (physically, mentally & emotionally) and is a good story to introduce older children to the importance of being prepared before hiking or camping in the woods - there are many real dangers lurking in the wilderness..."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Most of pop-up books are made for juvenile audience.

One of my top five of the year."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Wow, man!!!!I haven't read too many books by SK yet, in fact this was my first. It was no less intriguing than I thought, but rather much more. As always, SK uses different concepts and writing styles to lure us into his crazy mind, and it always works. Here, he even uses his first sentence as the quote he displays before the book starts, which is a little ironic. But it works. &quot;The world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it wanted&quot;, etc.My favorite thing about this book is that King never ever treats the little girl as the 9-year-old she is. He throws her in any element of danger and horror he feels like it, and explains her emotions and sufferings exactly like it would be. Which is the reason he can't sleep at night without a night light, I believe, but it doesn't stop him from publishing books like this one.By this book I think SK wants to send a message that in this country we give kids too much attention, pamper them too much. In movies that center around small children they are made idols and adults go nuts if they can't &quot;spend enough time with them&quot;, etc. Many those movies, like &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, I find corny for that very reason, and SK does the exact opposite, I believe.Towards the end he makes you doubt a few times what will happen. He does this using his general reputation as a horror writer, so we know if he wants to, he'll end it as horribly as possible. I won't go any further not to spoil it for anyone, but I was literally cryng at the end, and not ashamed to admit it. The little girl's struggles here, and her courage and spirit really got to me. Stephen King knew what he was doing. The book is not boring at all, even though there's really no action in it. I read it in a couple of days, which is almost a record for me.So, don't hesitate at all when making the choice for purchase. You can't regret it; not when dealing with SK."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I enjoyed every word of this book. It was the perfect post Christmas book for me.

Very hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I chose to read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Steven King. It is about a little girl who gets lost in the middle of the woods and can't stop thinking of how many people die in the woods because of starvation, thirst and even disgusting creatures that lurk in the dark. (I really liked this book because it kept me reading and wanting to keep reading. I am not much of a reader myself, but this book captivated me in a way that most books wouldn't have. The main character was a city girl who went by the name of Trisha. During the novel she shows that she has a very wandering mind.)I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense, drama, and a little sense of reality. A person with a good imagination and multiple personalities would also, I believe find this a very indulging novel. This is a short book, which makes it very easy to read for speed-readers. There are a lot of plot changes throughout the novel, which adds to the reader's suspense. I would most definitely recommend this book to all readers in general."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I picked this book up only when I found myself with nothing else to read, and up until the middle to end, I was completely enthralled. I am not an avid Stephen King reader, but do enjoy a lot of his work, so perhaps my opinion of this one would be far different from that of a person who reads all of his novels. The basis for this book is fear itself and how it can so easily consume us, and in that aspect, it was very well done, considering it is written from the perspective of an adolescent girl. His talent for character really shows through here. He is very good at evoking a sense of panic in the reader by so delicately informing that Trisha, our young heroine, is going deeper and deeper into the wooded abyss of the forest. This book is very good, and very strong, up until the ultimate &quot;showdown&quot; between Trisha and the evil _______(I don't want to ruin it.) It makes a complete turn and becomes downright silly very quickly. I admit, die-hard fans of Stephen King may disagree, but I was so disappointed. Such a letdown."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I've been in the Maine and New Hampshire woods so I was familiar with the setting Stephen King was writing about in The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, and what Trisha had gotton herself into. Trisha is a nine-year-old girl who was hiking in the woods with her family one minute, and the next minute, she is lost in the woods. Trisha has to endure the swampy, bug-filled, and scary forest with pine trees and a \\"thing\\" that seems to by stalking her in the woods. All she has with her is a little bit of food, her radio, and her imaginary Tom Gordon by her side.I liked Trisha and how she handled being lost in the woods. I could relate to her feelings of paranoia and overall fear. I could relate to it, and be scared and paranoid while reading it. Trisha also was a Red Sox fan, which made me pretty happy. She was a pretty die hard one, at that. She was so die-hard that she listened to the games in the woods and imagined that Tom Gordon was with her most of the time. She imagined him to be there to shield her from the ever so real \\"thing\\" that was in the woods with her.As for the plot, I felt that it was a huge let down. When I found out that I had to read the book for English I was pretty happy, mainly because I heard great things about Stephen King. So I kept reading page after page waiting for King to make me double-check that my door is locked, make me think that the noise downstairs wasn't just the landlords, or make me watch a comedy before I go to bed- anything! But I got none of this. All he managed to do was ramble on about how the woods were scary. It seems as if he spent the entire book trying to set the scene when he could have saved a couple of trees from the forest he was describing and done it in half of the pages. The woods are scary? They have swamps and bugs? Ya don't say. New rule: if you are lost in the woods, everything is going to be scary unless you know there's a rescue chopper that is ready to pick you up. That is what really \\"grinded my gears\\" in this book.In general, Stephen King let me down. I felt I was cheated of my time. His great reputation gave me false excitement which made the book worse. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is an below average book written by a, what seems to be, over-hyped author.Reviewed by Cormac Fitzpatrick"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Trisha McFarland is a 9-year-old girl who goes on a hike with her brother, Pete, and her mom, who is determined to spend the weekend with her kids. Trisha's parents recently divorced, and her brother is constantly feuding with his mom. In an attempt to avoid the spiteful quarrel between her brother and mother, Trisha steps off the trail to go to the bathroom. She falls behind and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, but becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror.Trisha's odyssey succeeds on several levels. She descends into hallucinations of her beloved Red Sox baseball pitcher Tom Gordon. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero. But when her radio's reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her and protecting her from an enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods.Although I have never been much of a Stephen King fan, I decided to read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon because it seemed appealing and related to my English theme of survival. I must say that King does a remarkable job of showing how Trisha's anxiety over her situation slowly begins to escalate, and how the time alone in the woods begins to affect her mentally. He also does a wonderful job of making a complex, believable character out of a simple 9-year-old. Another pleasant aspect of the book is that it is very feminist, being that Trisha is the sole character throughout almost the whole story. She is determined and resourceful and easy to root for in her quest to survive.Unfortunately, though, the book leaves much to be desired. My dissatisfaction with the book began with the plot. It started out slow and monotonous, but with hopes it would pick up, I kept reading only to find that it indeed did not. The story simply goes on too long and begins to seem repetitive after awhile. Trisha continually falls down, runs the wrong way, etc.Another negative factor of the book is that King is characterized as the master of terror. Although I was hesitant about reading this book because I feared it would be too scary, when I finally decided it would be appropriate, I was expecting a thrill. Sadly enough, I was disappointed to find that there was almost no terror portrayed in the story. It was very difficult to relate to the story, and, because of its absurdity, I found the novel to become boring and strung-out.I have taken into consideration that I have not always been fond of King's style of writing; therefore, I may not be the best critic of his work. But having read many books in the past, I feel that this novel was not very well written or organized in a suspenseful, interesting manner. I must credit Stephen King for his attempts to create such a novel, but it was disheartening to find that he had to spoil what could have been a good story line."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"A simply wonderful book! Very suspenseful, and impossible to put down. King made the reader feel as if we were in the woods with Tricia, with vivid descriptions and realistic terror.

I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Stephen King's novel &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; was an excellent piece of literature! It was the type of book that makes you think of your life. I agree that it gives you a a spiritual feeling of understanding the girl's situation. It makes you think of how you would feel if you were in the woods all alone with nothing but a walkman as a companion. This book is just one example of how talented King is as a writer. It had some chilling characters as well. The priest was scary and really creepy! This book would be a lot scarier to a person who has actually been in the woods at night, on their own or in a group. Like many have said, it's a real page turner!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This is one of htose books that is so intense that you want to keep on reading because you need to know that there is a happy end around the corner.

Stephen King knows how to make normal life scarry as your worst nightmare."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This is the story of a young girl lost in the woods. While I was reading this, I was actually THERE with her, or maybe I was her. King made me feel her emotions, her growing desperation, and her utter terror. While this is different from some of his previous books, the horror is still there - only this time in an all-too-believable realm. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Nine year old Trisha McFarland, wearing her favorite blue Red Sox batting practice shirt and Red Sox cap, began her six mile hike in the woods with her mother and brother Pete. Her troubled brother and recently divorced mother were constantly bickering. This hike of the Applachian Trail could not for one moment extinguish or interrupt their steady flow of quarreling. To evade this annoying and endless confrontation, Trisha drops back and wanders off. She decides to go forward instead of backtracking to the path and unknowingly strays further and further into the wilderness. Trisha listens to her Walkman for comfort and hears the Boston Red Sox game being broadcast and anxiously awaits the performance of her hero, number 36, relief pitcher, Tom Gordon. Trisha truly amazed me with every turn of the page, displaying courage, faith and a will to survive. Stephen King transports the reader to a new plateau of emotions in this novel. Did I mention that I was also a Red Sox fan?"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I have to admit that I have never been a baseball fan. Even a few years ago when the Braves started their thing, I pretty much ignored it. But now, thanks to King, I may be looking at the game in a whole new light, or at least have a better understanding as to why it's so important to so many people. I heard somebody once say that a baseball game is a microcosmic version of life. Aside from all the B.S., salary disputes, and silly mascots, I think that's not too far off the mark. Maybe I can learn something from the game after all.Regarding the book, King's writing never ceases to amaze me. I don't agree with people who say he's declined in the past few years. The truth is, he's only gotten better. His ability to convey the inner monologues of a person is amazing. And he's given us a hero in the shape of a nine year old girl. Ignore those shallow reviews below that bash the book because it &quot;lacks horror&quot; or has no &quot;scariness&quot;. I don't think that's the point. The point is to give you characters you can get to know, make friends with, and care enough about to see them through to the last page. That's what King has done . . . again."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"All of a sudden, the mother and brother walking through the path in the woods stop fighting. The brother looks back, and doesn't see his nine-year-old sister Trisha, who was supposed to be following behind. Where is she? Where could she have gone?This is Opening Day of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, the new Stephen King novel about faith, and perserverance, and baseball. Little Trisha McFarland, purely by accident, gets lost in the Maine woods after seperating herself from her family. What begins as a family outing one early Saturday morning becomes a long, dark journey for this little girl, one whose outcome is always uncertain. For Trisha may not be alone in the woods ... and whatever is out there may be hungry.The bulk of this short novel deals primarily with Trisha's lonesome journey deeper and deeper into the heart of the woods. One is often reminded of a similar journey by Jack Sawyer in the earlier book The Talisman, but Jack had the backdrop of America to rely on. Here, Trisha has only her wits, her rudimentary knowledge of the woods, and her Walkman, which broadcasts Red Sox baseball games, featuring her favorite player, Tom Gordon. The games become sort of a lifeline for her, a way to connect with the world of lights and people as she moves further and further away from that world. To keep her company, she imagines Gordon is with her at times, talking to her and generally keeping her sane. As the actual broadcasts begin to fade out, she relies more and more on her make-believe Tom Gordon, who speaks to her philosophically, and has faith in a saving God.Trisha herself begins to lose faith in Tom Gordon's God. She has to contend with mosquitoes, wasps, water that makes her sick, a dwindling food supply, encroaching lonliness and a series of darker and darker hallucinations. In the midst of all these trials, she senses something, a God of the Lost, stalking her as prey, following her on her dark journey. This God becomes more real when she finds angry slash-marks on the trees in her path ... and severed heads of animals seemingly left specifically for her to see.Whether or not The God of the Lost is real becomes the true focus of the novel, and the issue of faith has never been more subtly presented. At every turn, Trisha is knocked down, but she gets up again (it's no mistake that Chumbawumba is the tape left in her Walkman), and it becomes fascinating to watch this little girl survive. At times, her adventure becomes disheartening (a trip through a boggy swamp is especially upsetting) but as Trisha puts more faith in Tom Gordon, we put more faith in her. Every time Gordon makes a save for the Red Sox, he gestures briefly toward the sky, an acknowledgement of his trust in God. We sweat out the pages of this book that bares his name to see if Trisha will make her own save.The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is one of the most tense and scary books Stephen King has ever written. The writing is crisp and clear, and he doesn't seem to have time to go into much exposition. He tells us what we need to know, and moves on. This is no long, flowing narrative; here, the pages whiz by in a flash, perpetuated by the need to know if Trisha will ever get out of the woods, and what the God of the Lost truly is. If ever King wrote a book with &quot;the gotta&quot; in mind, this is it.Intense, dark, and short enough to be read in one sitting, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is ultimately one of King's most satisfying novels. God may not love the Red Sox, but to Stephen King fans, He's been pretty fair. Play ball!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Patricia McFarland, (a nine year old girl whose parents are recently divorced), is taken on a walk through the woods with her constantly arguing mother and brother. while on the walk, trisha steps off the trail for a little bathroom break(and to get away from the whining of her brother). She soon finds that she can't remember which way she has gone. About an hour later, she realized she was definitely lost. Left without a compass, without a map, only a backpack with 1 sandwich, water, and some twinkies, this would have to be her survival food as long as she was lost. Close by, an animal is lurking and following Trisha's every move. Along the way, she is stung by wasps, forced to walk through a swamp, and can't find any more water. She is slowly getting sick and is losing hope when she knows that the search party won't even find her. What keeps her going though is listening to her favorite baseball player Tom Gordon on her walkman. She listens to him save the game and soon starts hallucinating that he is there with her. She doesn't know whether she'll survive or not, whether the animal will eat her or not, but she has to find someway to survive. But how?"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This novel is thought provoking as it evokes many literary comparisons. It is a fable, a fairy tale, a parable, and a coming of age story. Developed with a small cast of characters and lacking King's trademark horror, this work is somewhat of a departure from his normal style.As a reader of all his previous novels I had started to tire of his recent story structure and thought his style was getting stale. However, starting with Bag of Bones, King has really started to mature and evolve.Tom Gordon is a great work and not only did I enjoy it but I found it very refreshing. I am disappointed that other reviewers here gave it one star &quot;cuz there ain't enough dyein&quot; or &quot;it's just a girl lost in the woods&quot;. If you want an emotional and thought provoking book you have one. If you don't, there's always V.C. Andrews."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Another sleepless night &quot;lights on page turner&quot;! 9 year old Trisha's lost wandering in the woods is so vividly described I could hear the buzz of all those bugs - ugh! - circling her. Chapters are &quot;innings&quot; and I could not put down this book till I reached the end of 9th inning. Trisha is pluckier than she realized trying to remember advise for &quot;townies&quot; how to read nature's signs - follow the brook and it will take you to the ocean - eventually. Her only comfort is her walkman. Listening to Red Sox game and waiting till her hero pitcherTom Gordon comes in as the closer.Tom ends up being Trisha's companion of sorts during her adventure. This book reminded me of King's Shining - same lyrical style -playing with our fears - being alone, darkness, hunger, thirst and that feeling of someone out there watching us and waiting. I know if I ever hit a hiking trail again I will &quot;stay on the path.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Can you write a whole book about one 9 year old girl being lost in the woods for 9 days? Stephen King can. Can you make a snap of a branch in the dead of the night make the hairs rise on your neck? Stephen King can. Can you wrap it all up in a metaphor of a baseball game and deliver a winning throw just when you thought all was lost? Stephen King can. Apart from slowing down in places where I couldn't understand the baseball references (didn't grow up with this game, in fact, I still don't get it), and apart from some things the girl utters that don't quite belong in a 9 year old's vocabulary, it was an excellent read with a masterful payoff at the end."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Though horror king Stephen King's books have no shortage of monsters, the best of his horrors emerge when real life people come face to face with the monsterous that exists in reality itself.In this book 9 year old Trisha McFarland comes very much face to face with reality's most monsterous. Little Trisha's trip starts with an innocent seeming nature walk with her mother and older brother and ends...let's just say...not so well.As Trisha's journey takes her deeper into the Maine/New Hampshire woods it also takes the young girl deeper inside her worst fears as she faces her worst nightmares.It's King's ability to seemlessly develop the story along all its various permutations that marks his skill as a master story teller. To be sure this is not one of Stephen King's greatest stories but it remains great story telling nonetheless.With King as our guide no venture towards horror goes unrewarded or should I say, unpunished."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I had a hard time deciding whether to vote this as a 2 or a 3. I ultimately chose a 3, because it is an average read when comparing it to most books; but it is not what you would probably expect from Stephen King. To me this seemed a short book, that had a way of drawing on and on. Still good writing though, and the story is interesting in it's own respect.A must read for those \\"true\\" Stephen King fans, because, well, what book he's written isn't? NOT one I would suggest for first time ventures into the masters works."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Stephen King has the spectacular ability of taking our deep seated fears and turning them into our worst nightmares. With \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" he has done it again.Have you ever gone hiking and went off trail to do your business without your hiking companions knowing where you were or what you were doing? Did you ever imagine that you could get lost even a few yards away from a well-traveled trail? Now imagine if you were a 9-year-old girl. Perhaps you have had a little wilderness training, would it be enough to spend many nights alone in the wilderness with nothing to eat but a small bagged lunch, nothing to drink but one soda and one bottle of fresh water and a surprisingly undamaged walkman that is the only thing keeping you sane. Now how would you feel if you thought something was stalking you through the forest just waiting for you to give up?Stephen King does it again with his wonderful portrayal of a child faced with a truly adult situation. The terror for the character that Mr Kind forges for the reader is classic. This will become one of those King novels that you read and re-read and still feel the terror of and for Trisha and the hopelessness of the situation."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is not Stephen King's best work. It's short, but not very captivating, so it makes for a long read. It had sat on my bookshelf for years, and, after completing it, I'm glad I didn't rush to read it. The main character is young and likable. She's also much smarter than I imagine most kids her age are. The baseball analogies are light throughout the novel, so please don't let that deter you from reading it. If you're looking for a true Stephen King thriller, this may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Imagine being lost in a seemingly endless forest in Northern New Hampshire all alone with little food or water and having to overcome the elements around you with only a small knowledge of wilderness survival. Add in an evil creature stalking you who leaves behind a trail of mangled trees and slaughtered animals and your in the same situation as Trisha McFarland, a nine year old girl who wanders far off the hiking trail in The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Stephen King.I love to hike and explore and hike through the woods and up mountains and by reading this novel I felt like I was back in the forest enjoying the wilderness. King does an excellent job of describing every little detail of every plant, animal, setting, and emotion that Trisha experiences while being lost. The forest is lush with vegetation, and places of terror and beauty keep fueling the story with different events and encounters with animals, some Trisha enjoy and some not.Trisha is not very nervous when she first wanders off the trail and thinks that they will realize that she is gone and will turn back around to search for her. After a while though, Trisha realizes that she has gone farther than she had considered and needs to stay calm and think up a plan to find her way back to civilization. Also after realizing that she was really lost she immediately starts rationing her food.Trisha is the victim of many terrible events physically and psychologically. She does keep a cool head during some of the most difficult situations and uses some of the few wilderness survival skills that her mother taught her. You will feel and pity and frustration for Trisha and you'll wish that you could just tell Trisha where to go and what to do. Trisha learns the hard way that \\"The world has teeth and can bite you at any time\\". She learns how to become independent and survive using the resources that she has.If you like a book with a lot of action and suspense and a bit of terror this is he book for you. You never can predict what is about to happen next. Although the book never gets too scary some parts can freak you out. I loved this book and I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"\\" The world had teeth and it could bite you with them at any time.\\" This quote comes out of a great book I read called The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Stephen King. I liked this book because Stephen King used so many descriptive details that it made me feel like I was there.There is a little nine -year -old girl named Trisha. One day Trisha her mom and her brother all go on a hiking trip but Trisha's mom and brother won't stop fighting. Trisha starts to get so mad that she goes off the trail to go to the bathroom even though she doesn't really have to go that bad. When she is done she decides to take a short cut that she thinks will take her to her mom and brother faster. When she gets on it though she is walking a really long time and figures out that she is lost. While she is lost there are many unpleasant surprises awaiting her and an enemy leaving behind slauttered animals and scratches on trees.My favorite character is Trisha because she is the main character. Everything happens to her on this hiking trip. She is the one who gets lost in the woods by herself. She is also a very interesting character. The fact that she is very determent to find her way back to civilization and find her mother and her brother. Trisha is a very brave character even though she is in a lot of danger. Trisha taught me that if you get lost you have to stay fairly calm.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes an interesting book. I would mostly recommend this book to teens and adults. So if you like a good book then I think you should read this book. It isn't really scary as it is interesting. I really loved this book and I think you would too!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is the first Stephen King novel that I have read and I found it very boring, it makes me wonder what the rest of his books are like. I have heard great things about Stephen King's work, but after reading this book I'm not sure what all the exitment is about. It was not that scary at all, it was not exiting, and frankly it almost put me to sleep! I did not like this book that much, and I would not recommend buying it.Overall Thought: If you like Stephen King, but not sure if this book is worth buying, get it from the library. I hope the rest of King's novels are better than this one."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"Growing up I started camping at a young age and before I knew it I was wandering thru the woods with my younger brother, scared to death to go too far but wanting to know what was around the next bush and always being disappointed when my parents would discover what I was trying to do. Trisha at the young age of 9, gets lost accidentally and stumbles across a world in the deep woods that I always knew was there but never had the opportunity to discover. At times I felt she was entirely too smart for a 9 year old (knowing and remembering all the info about the berries and plants) and other times I felt that in the real world, she would have had a lot more close encounters with snakes, but overall it was neat book with a happy ending. Unusual for a King book but I'm not complaining."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I have read many mysteries and terror novels before, however, I feel that this book is more interesting than the others. It is about a nine-year-old girl called Trisha; her parents are divorced and now she now lives with her mother and her older brother, Peter. Trisha is deeply in love with a player named Tom Gordon; she always feels that he is with her. One weekend when her mother takes her and Peter out for picnic, somehow Trisha does not follow the trail with her mother and is lost in the woods. She was frightened and worried. However, she still believes that Tom Gordon is standing besides her and he is leading her to the right pathway. This book describes in depth all the horror and terror of being lost in the woods, and how alone a little girl would really feel in this situation. I like how the author conveys this girl&iexcl;s love for the player, even though she is lost in the woods, she has the feeling that he is still with her. Her strong feelings for Tom Gordon are realistic and the book shows how a nine-year-old girl really thinks. When she is lost in the woods, the author uses many ways to convey the fear of what might happen, and also allows the reader to experience what it feels like to be lost in the forest alone.When I was reading this book, I would sometimes think and ask myself&iexcl;If I were this girl, would I be as brave as her, or would I be terribly afraid?&iexcl;It made me think about being alone and how I could cope. I enjoyed reading this book and enjoyed the fear of being in the woods."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"When I started reading this book I thought it was a joke. After all how can you write a 260 page novel out of story of the girl who talks to herself and nature? However it turned out an exiting book and even conversations with her other self seem not only normal, but even exicting. I guess it is important to speak to a smart person once in a while. This story starts, endures and ends in the forest. Basucally very enviromentally consience novel. A girl who gets lost tries to get out of the forest for days and eventually almost feels sorry there are trees still left standing.In the process of making this journey she battles her fears and stupid ideas her other self gives her. Her other self should get another novel to fully unveil itself. It is seem to have much more fun than a girl herself. She tells everything straight to your face without hiding the truth and even jokes with the girl. She even got herself in the swamp and made her to go throught the deadly place.Overall I have to say the book turned a big suprise for me and turned into interesting and exiting even thought it had basically only one physical character."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a brave attempt by Stephen King to scare us, and yet touch us, with his harrowing portrayal of a little 9 year old girl who gets lost in the woods. Although he succeeds to some point (Trisha McFarland is a very compelling character) the novel falls short. We really never feel that Trisha is in any sense of danger, and that takes a little away from the suspense of the novel, and what King is trying to do. However, he is, after all, trying to tell a story, a routine one at that, but with a little bit of a twist. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon isn't King's worst novel of which I have read (Misery) but it also isn't his best work and skill of writing. Disappointing, but I think we can forgive Mr. King."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"This book was excellent. It was the third book I've read by Mr. King and I was very impressed! Having been lost once in the woods (Eagle River Wisconsin school trip), it scared the h*** out of me, it brought me right back to that personal low point in my life. The thoughts that go through her head, except the Tom Gordon stuff of course are very real. You see everything as a potentially harmful animal in this situation (when it gets dark). I also loved the short &quot;diary&quot; of his son's baseball filled summer at the end. Brought back great memories (football instead for me, but same idea and atmosphere basically, any sports stories grab my attention). Not too long so anyone can finish this in a day, a great book to start with from his library!!"},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I consider this the worst book by King that I've read (please note that I haven't read many bad King books). It was way too short so there was no time to really develop a relationship with the character. I found myself not caring whether or not Trisha lives or dies.I gave it three stars because I think there is potential in the idea. The plot was interesting at first, but King has an inherent tendency to add little supernatural twists to his plots. This story would have been great if he had kept it completely real and possible. The survival techniques of little girls is a fascinating story by itself; King just threw the integrity of that concept away by adding the weird-creepy-following-monster into it."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"In my opinion to be one of Kings best. Scary and fast. You won't be disipointed. If you don't like the monstrous King novels this is a great one to start with and make your way up. Yes, there is baseball but the story is mostly about a young girl lost in the woods with a horrific evil following her and leaving clawed trees and dead animals in her path."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"The Girl Who loved Tom Gordon is not Stephen King's best work. Its not complicated and involved as The Stand, or as bone chilling as The Shining. But It works. The woods are a scary place, and I used to be terrified of them as a kid. The idea of a little heroine with a possibly haunted walkman is a simple formula, not too big on horror, but big on courage and faith; which is another formula used in most of King's books. Trisha joins Dolores Claiborne or Jesse from Gerald's Game in Stephen's heroine against evil club. The baseball stuff was boring, since im not a sports fan, but it did have its purpose, and the ending could have been a little more scarier, because we were expecting a big climax. But it didnt, and it is an enjoyable book nevertheless. Not laying it on too thick, horror tactics this time around were replaced with old fashioned suspense and anxeity, and thats not so bad. A good quick read, worth giving a try."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"I believe that Steven King went out in a entirely differnt limb on the book 'The Girl Who loved Tom Gordon'. It is beyond his normal supernatural thrillers. Even though it deals with an issue that has been replayed many times...the story of someone lost in the woods and their quest to find rescue, it is still filled with action and suspense which makes you want to continue. The only piece involved in the book which botherd me throughout the novel was his characterization of Trisha (the main character). She is supposed to be a 9 year old girl. Although the knolege she has in the situations she is presented with do not account for a nine year old. That is in no way a reason not to read the book. It just is a part that I found oddly made and if she had been older than possibly the book would have been more realistic. He also seems to try to make it like a non-fiction book mixed with one supernatural &quot;thing&quot; that occures throught the book, which doesnt really go together but it at least throws in some extra intrest to the reader. I would recommend this book since it isnt that long especailly for a King novel and it is well written even if its a story that has a predictable ending."},{"Title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","review":"There's a saying that goes, \\"Everything under the sun has been done,\\" and considering the style-over-substance programming that has infected most of the recent mass media output, this quote has a ring of truth to it. In most forms of entertainment, the symbols and strife of ancient myth are given a whitewash job, with modern equivalencies stenciled over to make it more palatable. Often times the result is transparent, a good example being the latest crop of Hollywood derivatives (it almost seems as if that writer's strike did go on after all - )... but even when the story has been hopelessly canned, if the creator injects a certain amount of passion, thought and individual talent into the artistic process, oft times the results are so impressive, so emotionally resounding, that it doesn't matter than we've seen it a dozen or a hundred times before - for a short time the power and pathos captivates us, leaves us spellbound and in awe, in that state we seek entertainment for.One might say that Stephen King, possibly the single most successful author of the 20th century, has mastered the ability of recycling those time-worn myths into packages of blissful escapist fun. _The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon_ is standard paint-by-numbers King: a child in danger, a malevolent force in pursuit, and the struggle between them. King has used this theme before: _The Shining_, _It_, _Christine_, _The Waste Lands_, _Cujo_, _The Dead Zone_ to name a few...and, thanks in large part to a vivid imagination and strong character-building, King managed to make each of these books seem (fairly) original, unique from the other. _TGWLTG_ is no different. Using the \`lost in the woods' archetype mixed with baseball and the power of a child's imagination, King turns this novella into a blueprint example of how to build suspense, pushing the subject (and the reader as well) to the very brink before climax/resolution. The inclusion of the \`good vs. evil' paradigm, a motif so hoary that one can't see the frost for the foundation, is strengthened by this build-up pattern; but even more important (IMO) is the introduction of the \`stillness,' the meditative core that exists in all religions and (worthwhile) philosophy. King has used it many times before in his fiction, but rarely to such effectiveness.I've knocked off two stars from _TGWLTG_ for two reasons: one, that this is a novella and should really be part of a compilation (like Different Seasons), and two, King uses words and phrases that no nine year old (other than a savant) would recognize or incorporate, and the inclusion of such is jarring. Still, this is a nice read for a kick-back afternoon.

This book, lavishly illustrated with scenes from the film, describes the characters, locales, and species that appear in the film.The book is a visual treat. Disney used cutting-edge techniques to bring the creatures of &quot;Dinosaur&quot; to life, and the book captures each animal splendidly. The soft fur of the lemurs, the bony neck frill of the styracosaur, the fierce teeth of the carnotaur--all the details are vivid and memorable.The book's effectiveness is, however, compromised by the fact that the authors seem unsure of their purpose. Is this book supposed to be a guide to the fictional world of the movie, or to the real world of dinosaurs as science understands them? For example, the book is filled with scientific-sounding observations like &quot;Herd dinosaurs are highly social animals, and during the nesting season the lake is the center of their bustling community.&quot; Sidebars with titles like &quot;Cretaceous Life&quot; add to this pseudoscientific flavor. But as far as I know, there is no evidence that dinosaurs spoke English or formed multispecies families with lemurs, as depicted in this film!

Then add the backdrop of the Duke of Monmouth's return during the reign of King James, so there's rebellion, insurrection and treachery on all sides. That's pretty much what this title gives you, along with a healthy dose of Sabatini-style chivalry.It's a rollicking read--you never know what's going to happen next, but suspect it'll keep getting worse and worse for our hero. Yes, the characters are a little unround and not far from 'types', but for tense plotting and a very Victorian moral code welded to history, you can't beat Sabatini. It's not his *best*, but it's still a great ride!"},{"Title":"Mistress Wilding","review":"Chronicling the fortunes of Anthony Wilding as he attempts to woo his lady and help the Duke of Monmouth in his uprising against King James, this book was an entertaining read. There's romance and adventure, intrigue and suspense. It was also interesting to have a story that kind of overlapped with the story of Captain Blood, who was wrongly condemned for involvement in the Monmouth uprising... for those of you who are ridiculously obsessed with Captain Blood, like myself : ) Overall, I'd recommend this though, if you can get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Mistress Wilding","review":"Although certainly not on a par with the author's more famous works, Captain Blood, Scaramouche or The Sea Hawk, Mistress Wilding (first published in 1910 under the title Arms and the Maid or Anthony Wilding) can be ranked among the best of Sabatini's early novels. In it are all the seeds of his later genius: a tight and twisting plot, historical accuracy, sparkling dialogue and plenty of lively humor. As with Cpt. Blood, the story takes place during the ill-fated Protestant rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth against James II. The characters are carefully drawn, though the protagonists are not quite as appealing as in other novels. What makes the story unique is that we really do not know who will be the hero and who the villain until the latter third of the book. Perhaps that is why Sabatini changed the title for the American edition. Not the best the author has to offer, but Sabatini fans will love it, as will lovers of historical romance."},{"Title":"Mistress Wilding","review":"I rate MISTRESS WILDING with CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE BLACK SWAN as Sabatini in peak form--as good as swashbucklers get. As always, a hero who should have been played by Errol Flynn and a suspicious--but persuadable--woman--spiced with treachery, battles, duels and less formal swordplay. This one's set in Monmouth's Rebellion--right up there with the '45 for improbable adventure--and Sabatini uses it well.The book itself is a nice hardcover with the standard Bibliobazaar cover. I would say the text had been scanned in from an earlier edition with the use of an OCR program. This leads to a few typos, but nothing which hinders reading, and where else will you find a Sabatini in new hardcover?Just buy it."},{"Title":"Mistress Wilding","review":"If you like the works of this excellent (though somewhat underrated) author, you will not be disappointed by this compelling page turner! It follows the basic formula of Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, and Scaramouch, but it is yet another engrossing and fresh take on that winning formula.

This book is an excellent resource for engineers familiar with fluid dynamics who want to better estimate aerodynamic or fluidic performance of their products and/or systems. For example, the book eliminates risky guess-work by providing frictional loss coefficients for a broad and deep variety of commonly (and uncommonly) used air passage geometries, obstructions, and other sources of flow resistance. The reader would be hard-pressed to find the same information in a similarly compact and convenient format. Not only that, but Idelchik's work is, by-and-large, a presentation of actual test data which, despite being a few or more decades old, is still considered extremely valuable today."},{"Title":"Flow Resistance: A Design Guide for Engineers","review":"I am an instrument engineer. I calculate trim loss coefficient of control valves often. I use three books: (1) Crane Technical Publication 410, (2) Blevins Applied Fluid Dynamics Handbook, and now (3) Fried and Idelchik Flow Resistance: A Design Guide for Engineers. The third one covers tons of flow geometries more than the first two, with many tables, diagrams, and graphs, and is easy to use. The only not-so-good about this book is that it uses unfamiliar symbols and nomenclature that we don't use in N. America, and it does not give derivations of the equations used. The later issue is understandable due to the huge number of flow geometries described. But one can derive the loss coefficient equations for many flow geometries based on normalization and basic geometries desbribed in Crane Technical Publication 410 and then cross check the results against those shown in this Fried and Idelchik book. The Blevins book is for advanced users, and is more accurate since theory is given. Regarding the first issue, it is not a big problem because the nomenclature is fairly consistent in this book. A 5-star book for all engineers who deal with fluid flows! except it is pricy. I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Flow Resistance: A Design Guide for Engineers","review":"At one point in my engineering career I was tasked with developing estimates of the thermal conditions within a family of electronic enclosures. Our senior engineering staff resisted introducing a CFD package to support these analyses. In response, I used this book to develop airflow \\"circuits\\" within our equipment by defining the flow resistances within connected definable regimes within these enclosures. With a bit of thermodynamics and a mathematical performance model for our variable speed fan set, I was able to produce very good results running the flow path studies on a math package. I set up the math package to iterate to a solution, knowing the distribution of heat generation within various regimes of the enclosures (the general locations of the hot parts). Among other things, the iterative process adjusted variable speed fan performance, via the model, accordingly. The regime specific flow resistance equations were borrowed directly from this book. This book was a godsend in that analysis."},{"Title":"Flow Resistance: A Design Guide for Engineers","review":"This book is essential for anyone who does detailed hydraulic calculations for a living and is looking for a comprehensive guide to estimating minor losses or other non-standard frictional losses. The number of configurations listed for tubes, fittings, valves, bends, valves and wyes is astounding; light years beyond any textbook or reference guide I have seen. For the most part, the Design Guide cuts out a lot of the PhD-type derivations and gets to the point, hence it's title.One drawback is that the nomenclature used for formulas is not the standard used in the U.S. (i.e. \\"F\\" is used for cross-sectional area). Also, the presentation of material tends to be math intensive and detail oriented, so be prepared to do some reading before jumping right in. This is not a book for the faint of heart but, once I got used to the setup, the book has proven to be an invaluable tool in my work."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"This book is quite interesting because it holds within its many pages a teaching that is deeper than what it may seem. There is a deep psychological teaching that mixes itself with high spiritual principles, esoteric Christian Gnosticism in its raw form, and countless viels that keep such things hidden from the eyes of the average literary scholar... Why would Burton write in such a way? The same reason Dante did...But what is it that Burton is trying to show us, with his quotes from the Alchemical Master Galen and Latin stanzas?Why must we understand the \\"Anatomy of Meloncholy\\"? The anatomy of our own suffering and the suffering of the world...The Master M refers to Burton in his books of Occult Mysticism.For us, as common \\"modern westerners\\", to understand such esoteric psychology-and not have to learn Latin, Tibetan, Sanskrit or Chinese, we must study the books of SAMAEL AUN WEOR. He writes in such a way as to unveil those truly hidden mysteries: \\"Know thyself and thy shall Know the universe and all its Gods\\".Find the book of \\"Revolutionary Psychology\\" or \\"The Perfect Matrimony\\" by the said author. These books are amazing supplements to books like Burton's. These books give the western student a strong foundation in the psychological aspect of Occultism. SAMAEL AUN WEOR's books can be a bit difficult (to find), as they are continuously being translated from the original language (Spanish). Yet they can be bought from any Gnostic Institute (www.gnosticinstitute.org)."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"This book is almost unreadable. First, physically. It is a paperback, but very thick and heavy, and does not allow easy reading except on a table; almost impossible to read in bed.Second, subject matter. These are the ravings of a totally unbalanced mind. Yes it is arcane and interesting to see how someone (admittedly brilliant) thought so long ago. And he had an opinion about everything! Everything, I say! Talk about motormouth. He goes on and on long after anyone could possibly find him interesting. Oh, how this man needed an editor.Third, he is viciously anti-Catholic. Yes, I know it was (is?)the fashion in England for the best people to be anti-Catholic, but this guy can't be beat for vitriolic, venomous, bigotry. If you like that sort of thing, or some peekings into a pretty nasty anti-feminist, anti-modernity, deluded melancholy mind, be my guest.My advice: save your money."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"First of all, one has a very difficult problem in defining exactly what this compendium is. Is it a book, a poem, a history, an epic? Well, I think it is all of those and many more. The Anatomy of Melancholy is, without a doubt, the best book ever written, bar none.It was compliled from all the books of the 17th century and is not really about melancholy, per se. It is, rather, Robert Burton's view of mankind and mankind's condition. All mankind. And all conditions. It is about melancholia, sure, but it is about everything else as well. Melancholia was just Burton's excuse to write about everything under the sun in a strikingly original way and then have the nerve to remind us that there is nothing new under the sun. This is a book filled with both endless quotes and endless quotable material and, to the surprise of many, it is a comic masterpiece. Perhaps &quot;the&quot; comic masterpiece. Burton chose to publish this book as having been written by &quot;Democritus Junior,&quot; and if that doesn't give you a hint regarding the humor that follows, then not much will.If you like good literature, you'll love this book. If you like psychology, you'll love this book. If you want to seem pretentious, you need this book. Mostly, however, this is a book for people who love words. Burton may have seemed like a raving madman to some, but he was a man obsessed with a love for the English language...and it shows.The Anatomy of Melancholy wasn't meant to be read from the first page to the last; I have never met anyone who did that and one would have to be more than a little mad to even try. Just pick up the book. Open it to any page. You may find lists, digressions, bits of 17th century prose, quotes, much Latin. Whatever you find, it is sure to please if you only give it half a chance.The Anatomy of Melancholy is definitely &quot;the&quot; desert island book. The only problem with taking this wonderful book to a desert island with you (or anywhere else, for that matter), is its size. If you have the one-volume edition, as I do, it can be terribly unwieldy. I once tried reading it on a trans-Atlantic flight and had difficulty keeping my grasp...physically. I highly recommend the three-volume set, if you can find it. If not, make do with the one-volume. Just don't go without. That would be a terrible mistake.Be warned: this dense and brilliant book is extremely addicting. Once you start leafing through the pages and writing down your favorite passages, you'll find you never want to be without the book. And, as you'll come to see, that won't be such a bad thing at all."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"Of all the editions of THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY that have ever been published, this may be the best for the general reader. The NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS CLASSIC edition wisely reprints the great 1932 Everyman's Library edition, with its wonderful introduction by the noted bookman Holbrook Jackson. (Readers are advised to skim or skip the rather pretentious new introduction by William H. Gass.)Unlike the &quot;all-English&quot; edition referenced..., the Everyman/NYRBClassic edition gives the Latin tags as Burton scattered them through his work and translates each and every one, either in brackets immediately afterward, or (sometimes) in an endnote to each of the three volumes (now bound as one). I've tried to read the &quot;all-English&quot; edition, and it's disappointing, because it turns out that Burton wanted readers to read the Latin tags whether they could understand them or not. He included their syllables in the rhythm of his prose, so as you read this edition, you can almost hear him quote, then translate, then continue onward.No booklover should skip this one, and this is the edition to have."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, nor by what others may have told you about it. In the first place, it isn't so much a book about 'Melancholy' (or abnormal psychology, or depression, or whatever) as a book about Burton himself and, ultimately, about humankind. Secondly, it isn't so much a book for students of the history of English prose, as one for lovers of language who joy in the strong taste of English when it was at its most masculine and vigorous. Finally, it isn't so much a book for those interested in the renaissance, as for those interested in life.Burton is not a writer for fops and milquetoasts. He was a crusty old devil who used to go down to the river to listen to the bargemen cursing so that he could keep in touch with the true tongue of his race. Sometimes I think he might have been better off as the swashbuckling Captain of a pirate ship. But somehow he ended up as a scholar, and instead of watching the ocean satisfyingly swallowing up his victims, he himself became an ocean of learning swallowing up whole libraries. His book, in consequence, although it may have begun as a mere 'medical treatise,' soon exploded beyond its bounds to become, in the words of one of his editors, &quot;a grand literary entertainment, as well as a rich mine of miscellaneous learning.&quot;Of his own book he has this to say : &quot;... a rhapsody of rags gathered together from several dung-hills, excrements of authors, toys and fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgement, wit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, phantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet, ill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess all...&quot; But don't believe him, he's in one of his irascible moods and exaggerating. In fact it's a marvelous book.Here's a bit more of the crusty Burton I love; it's on his fellow scholars : &quot;Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers.&quot;And here is Burton warming to the subject of contemporary theologians : &quot;Theologasters, if they can but pay ... proceed to the very highest degrees. Hence it comes that such a pack of vile buffoons, ignoramuses wandering in the twilight of learning, ghosts of clergymen, itinerant quacks, dolts, clods, asses, mere cattle, intrude with unwashed feet upon the sacred precincts of Theology, bringing with them nothing save brazen impudence, and some hackneyed quillets and scholastic trifles not good enough for a crowd at a street corner.&quot;Finally a passage I can't resist quoting which shows something of Burton's prose at its best, though I leave you to guess the subject: &quot;... with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more than we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a racket, that as Fabius said, &quot;It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.&quot;To fully appreciate these quotations you would have to see them in context, and I'm conscious of having touched on only one of his many moods and aspects. But a taste for Burton isn't difficult to acquire. He's a mine of curious learning. When in full stride he can be very funny, and it's easy to share his feelings as he often seems to be describing, not so much his own world as today's.But he does demand stamina. His prose overwhelms and washes over us like a huge tsunami, and for that reason he's probably best taken in small doses. If you are unfamiliar with his work and were to approach him with that in mind, you might find that (as is the case with Montaigne, a very different writer) you had discovered not so much a book as a companion for life."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"The Anatomy of Melancholy may be a worthwhile read.

NYRB has reprinted the three volume Everyman's Library edition in a rather thick paperback. This is not the first time the three volume Everyman's Library edition has been reprinted in one volume. Everyman's Library had a one volume edition in the 1960's and Vintage had an edition in the 1970's, but these have been out of print for many years. Except for some minor changes such as a new introduction by William H. Gass, and the removal of the out-of-date select bibliography the NYRB edition is identical to the earlier reprints.There are disadvantages to this reprint. Perhaps the biggest is that this reprint does not take advantage or even acknowledge the 70 or so years of scholarship that has come and gone since it was published in 1932. In the 1990's Oxford University Press issued a multi-volume scholarly edition of the Anatomy but the price is prohibative for most readers. You should know that NYRB edition is still good as a reader's copy, but it is not a scholarly edition.Another problem is the editorial decision that Holbrook Jackson made to clear away Burton's anotations that were originally printed on the page, and moved them to the end of each partition. Instead of looking on the page for Burton's citations the reader is flipping back and forth to track them down. Burton sometimes has a great deal of fun in his marginal glosses, and you will miss them if you are not careful.A third problem is the index. If you wanted to find Burton's references to English writers such as More, Shakespeare, or Spenser you would be out of luck if you used the index in the NYRB edition, but you wouldn't be if you were reading Shilletto's 1893 edition. In that edition authors Burton quotes are listed and you have no trouble tracking most of them in Burton's Anatomy.These days I am more likely to read one of the 17th century editions of Burton's Anatomy or Shilletto's edition, but it is good to have Burton available again in a popular edition, even though this one is not ideal."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"Usually available only in expensive private editions and nineteenth century complilations, the New York Review Books paperback edition of Robert Burton's \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" is handy and relatively cheap. It reprints the sixth and final edition that Burton issued, each edition expanding with afterthoughts by the author. The original in 1621 was one-half the size of the last edition.Burton was an Oxford scholar who had spent much of his life in Christ Church College of that institution accumulating quotes, ideas, and general collectible wisdom from the classics. His self-styled anatomy of the causes of melancholy is both ponderous and witty--quite in tune with Burton's styling himself as \\"Democritus Junior.\\" Democritus, you will recall, was a Greek philosopher of the 5th century BC who developed the idea of atoms forming the basis of the universe. He was also sometimes called the \\"laughing philosopher\\" because of his wit.Burton himself has a good time with this kind of humor, and his book is not at all a gloomy analysis of melancholy. What it is is a compendium of every kind of thought on the subject, and is replete with Latin quotations and Greek philosophy. It is a museum of myth, ignorance, and insight. Written in a uniquely antiquarian style, it is a treat for the modern reader. Like Sir Thomas Browne's gothic prose, Burton's is unique as well as intriguing. His book is meant to be dipped into, not to be read straight through. The wonderful thing is that it's not just a classic but a readable classic.

The author, it seems, was easily distracted, and his distractions are our gain. The passages on the Melancholy of Scholars, and the Melancholy of Lovers, are themselves worthy of the price of admission.His prose is unlike anything before him or since him.

This is one aspect of this Gargantuan tome, and the most delightful one. The other aspect is rather more nebulous: What exactly is this book about, and why was it penned? The obvious answer to the first part of the query is &quot;melancholy.&quot; But melancholy, as here laid forth, is a seemingly ubiquitous and all-encompassing malady, as it were. &quot;For indeed who is not a fool, melancholy, mad?&quot; And who knows exactly why it was penned? So little is known of Burton and the incidents of his life: Save, of course, that he was well-acquainted with the unfelicitous side of things. - There is a sweetness in his accounting of it though, that is oddly reminiscent of the subaqueous tones of Debussy. One is not surprised either to find that Keats was one of Burton's readers.-The same dulcet sadness lures us into a kind of bittersweet repose, as in the opening lines of the poet's &quot;Ode To A Nightingale.&quot;-Burton had a calling and this book was his answer to it.- All arguments in re the whys and wherefores are really for naught.- He had a calling and his answer remains a unique monument in Western literature, to be treasured and pored over again and again by all of us logophiles and solitary scholars...And anyone else, by the way."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated.

And even then they wade gently through a few pages rather than simply plunging in and learning, perhaps for the first time, that words are more intoxicating than any drug could be. There is no melancholy in the book, at least not to the extent that one might think because of the title. Instead the intrepid reader finds that Burton has attempted what we now know to be the impossible: to master the sum total of human knowledge in one book. Astoundingly, Burton did not know that it was impossible, so he went ahead and tried anyway. He came damn near close to succeeding.Robert Burton was typical of many contemporaries, many of whom tried to be a master of all trades, but it was only he that came close. Burton's love of learning and his dry and droll wit excuse his failure to such an extent that we do not even care that he failed. Rather, we focus on his successful attempt to draw us into the magical world of knowledge for its own sake. His critics have been merciless in their snippets that TAOM is no more than a collection of informal and disorganized essays on man's dissatisfaction with the universe. They complain loudly of his wild abandon of Latinate phrases that pepper every paragraph or his frequent mention of obscure authorities that exist nowhere else save this book. Yet, I suggest that wild abandon has its charm too. If one considers his book as a very nearly unlimited number of paragraphs, each of which exists in its own self-contained universe, then that paragraph sheds light on the human condition itself. Human beings have eternally sought knowledge of the macro universe and its mirror, the microverse. It is only in such seemingly unwieldy tomes as TAOM that humanity may find answers. The beauty of Burton is that the effort to find Eternal Truth is worth the effort. One need not be a grad student of literature to know that."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"There have been recently some reviews complaining of shoddy paperback editions of this book, published cheaply and with many dubious errors, lacking translation of the Latin, etc. (These problems are due largely to the publishers' use of outdated or uncorrected texts.) Only buy this paperback version:The Anatomy of Melancholy (New York Review Books Classics); it's by far the best available and of durable construction (for a gigantic paperback, anyways). It also has two introductions, wonderful in their own right, especially Gass's. It also contains the translations for the Latin phrases which so often appear. Don't buy any other copy."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"There are many reviews of Burton's \\"Anatomy\\" ranging from the 'best book ever written' downwards. I have been involved with many editions of this work over the years, and have a couple of things to add to what's been so eloquently said. First, it's a reference book and not a novel, and therefore shouldn't be read in a continuous way. It becomes tedious and incomprehensible. Like grandma used to say: \\"Take small bites so you don't choke!\\" There are parts of it that are dated but much that is totally applicable today. Second, it is a book about society, and the hypocrisy of the way different people get treated:\\"A sheep-stealer is hanged for stealing necessary victuals but a great man in office may safely rob, pillage, and destroy, and be honored for good service, and no man had best find fault with him.\\" This prefigures much of Enlightenment thinking and can be seen to relate to Culturalist Analytic thinking, like the works of Karen Horney. Third, it is a historical contemporary look at the Jacobean age, and even the Elizabethan world. If you're interested in the cultural climate of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, here is an overview of what was known and opined by a scholar. One wonders how melancholic he really was (in the modern sense) since the preparation and writing of such a compendium certainly requires motivation and energy, not generally associated with chronic depression. I would suggest the Preface and the Digression of Air as fascinating views of knowledge in the early 17th century. Even if you don't like it (which I didn't for about 5 years), it tends to grow on you as long as you go slow!"},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy, 2 vols","review":"The book deserves 5 stars, but not this electronic edition.

There are enough really good questions for me to list it as 4 stars, but it's not a solid 4... more like a 3.2 rounded up."},{"Title":"Islamic Anti-Semitism As a Political Instrument","review":"This is (as far as I know) the first book on a very necessary subject: Anti-Semitism in the modern Arab world (mid 1950s - present). It seems to do a thorough analysis of trends in Islamist and pan-Arab circles, Arab governments, elites, intellectuals and masses. It is amply illustrated with samples of anti-Semitic writings.I gave it 4 stars, even though there are some questionable issues. For instance, the author seems to imply that Egypt's signing of the peace treaty with Israel was nothing more than a trick. It seems to me that Anwar Sadat paid too high a price for it to be just a trick. The quote from Alija Izetbegovich does not look very convincing, since there has been no anti-Semitic persecution in the modern Bosnia.Another major problem is total lack of reflection on Arab Muslim non-Anti-Semitism. Does it exist at all? I think it probably does. So I think it should be written about, at least for the sake of comparison.The author also writes (and quotes others) about the terrible threat fundamentalist Islam presents to the Arab states. But so far I don't see a single Arab regime falling. It seems to me that the ability of Arab leaders to lie to/manipulate their population is underestimated. The author also mentions lack of legitimacy of Arab governments. But the question here is: legitimacy based on what? The popular vote? Descent from Muhammad? Being the toughest? It seems to me that people who have never known democracy might view things differently.Possibly there are other problems with the book, but since it is the only book on the subject, I have no way of knowing that.The style of the book is also somewhat heavy and repetitive. The author tries to follow a complex web of ideological trends across different countries and strata of Arab societies - a very hard task. The same &quot;precepts&quot; are drilled into the reader's mind over and over: &quot;Enmity between Muslims and Jews is eternal and irreconcilable&quot;, &quot;Scheming, duplicity and corruption are at the root of Jewish character&quot;, &quot;The Torah has been distorted by Jews, and the Talmud promotes hatred, racism and arrogance&quot;, &quot;Jews eat matza with human blood&quot;, &quot;All tragedies of Jewish history are due to their wickedness and despicable acts&quot;, &quot;Israel is the first step in the worldwide Zionist conspiracy&quot;, &quot;The entire land of Palestine must be returned&quot;, and a few others. These are repeated throughout the book ad nauseam.Perhaps this repetition is necessary, because it gives the reader a feeling for the spread and intensity of such sentiments in the Arab world. On the other hand, this obscures the message the author is trying to convey, &quot;the Islamists have brought their relationship with the Jews a full circle - back to their Qu'ranic roots where relationship is based on enmity and confrontation.&quot;, i.e. that the status of Jews as Dhimmis (minority within Islamic world, protected from outright extermination, but not from all kinds of indignities) is not possible any more, and therefore Israeli Jews would face outright extermination should Israel fall, just as the Jews of Arabia were exterminated at the time of Muhammad. This is a good argument. Unfortunately, the author never tells us the reason for presenting it. And there is a reason.Still, if just one tenth of the book is true, the amount and viciousness of anti-Semitism in the Arab world is staggering. (It is far beyond anti-Semitism in the Western and even the Soviet world.) It is everywhere: in the media, schoolbooks, summer camps, official speeches and religious sermons. When hatred is so massive, it becomes a threat to everyone around. There is a major need for drawing conclusions, yet since nothing had been written on the subject of modern Arab anti-Semitism, there is no knowledge of it, so no conclusions are drawn. Israel and the world have engaged in appeasement (withdrawal from Lebanon, &quot;peace-process&quot;), which has become a major impetus to growth of Muslim extremism and further hatred. Thus the process which was supposed to bring peace is actually bringing war. No one until recently asked, &quot;What is wrong with this picture&quot;. I hope that now, when this book has appeared, someone will."},{"Title":"Islamic Anti-Semitism As a Political Instrument","review":"&quot; Yossef Bondansky's scholarship is generally of considerable value, though his writing style is often dry. Here, in a work that is far too short, he seeks to examine the anti-Semitism that is rampant in the Muslim world and its roots. (Please note, I like Professor Bodansky am aware that Arabs are Semites, however, the term, originating with 19th century racists and in use to the present day, then and now refers only to hatred of Jews). Bodansky does a fair job of tracing how these European concepts entered the Arab world view, beginning with the famous Damascus blood liable, but does not give the topic the attention it deserves.Some reviewers have argued that Bodansky overstates the pervasiveness of anti-Semitic content in Arabic papers. Clearly, they are ignorant of the facts. As Bodansky documents, major mainstream Arab papers such as the semi official press organ of the supposedly moderate Egyptian government (whose editor and chief is hand chosen by the President) has continually reported such stories. Examples of what can be found in theses papers pages on any given day include:*Jews are responsible for the September 11th attack in order to defame Islam (included in the charge is that no Jews died in the WTC, even though Jewish casualties numbered over 1,000).*Jews engineered AIDS and spread it among Arab youths.*Jews have infected Arab women with a virus that loosens their morals.*Jews kill Arab children for sport and use their blood to make Matzo.*Bill Clinton, George Bush and Colin Powell are all really Jewish.*Jews tricked Saddam into invading Kuwait.*Jews have a secret plan to castrate all Muslim men.The list goes on. Where Bodansky's work shines is in showing how propagating these lies helps prop up the brutal autocratic regimes of the Arab world. By creating an all powerful entirely evil foreign enemy, these nations can attempt to excuse their own barbaric and repressive tactics that include some of the world's worst human rights abusers in places like Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and others (all of which always rank worse then Israel on lists of human rights abusers). The book also includes several excellent examples of anti-Semitic cartoons.Readers should note what this book is and what it is not. It isn't a comprehensive history of Jewish-Muslim relations. For that I suggest looking at the work of Bernard Lewis. For what it is, however, it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Islamic Anti-Semitism As a Political Instrument","review":"I cannot recommend a better book that shows the true face of the Arab world.Their ideology is built on hatred and propaganda which is used against Christians and Jews. It shows the reasons why totalitarian governments(which are the only kind of governments in the Arab world)use this kind of propaganda to promote their politics, especially in the Arab world and suppress democracy."},{"Title":"Islamic Anti-Semitism As a Political Instrument","review":"Although the definition of anti-Semitism has been subjected to some mis-interpretation, it's original and true context is that of anti-Jewishness or anti-Judaism.Yossef Bodansky, in another of his fine works examines the significance to the ongoing, intensifying hatred and vilification towards the Jews throughout the Moslem/Arab world.Bodansky investigates how this anti-Semitism, today more than ever, constitutes an enormous political instrument, being so venomously applied by both regional and international Islamic terrorist organisations and also Moslem/Arab governments.The author delves into how these same entities, government & terrorist leaders, use anti-Semitism/anti-Israeli incitement as such extremely effective weapons of populist agitation in order to achieve the desired political and public results on the ground and amongst their populations.Bodansky extends his analysis to the consequences that this incitement of hatred have in mobilising Arab/Moslem public opinion against Israel and the popular intent of destroying the Jewish state, irrespective of any diplomatic or political initiatives/peace-process during what can only be seen as an interim period within that same agenda or purpose.In under 200 pages, Bodansky provides a worthy reference towards this timely subject. Further recommended reading is Bodansky's most recent work, \\"The High Cost of Peace: How Washington's Middle East Policy Left America Vulnerable to Terrorism\\"."},{"Title":"Islamic Anti-Semitism As a Political Instrument","review":"Interesting exploration exposing a shameful thread that winds its way through Islam and the Arab world today. Whereas it is possible to draw many positive lessons from the Quran, it is clear that politically some have chosen to capitalize on religious sentiment and historicity to inculcate a culture of incitement that continues to this day. Anti-Zionism and antisemitism is both a touchstone and scapegoat that an unpopular leadership uses to convince the masses that they are actually on the same side.There is an underlying paranoid theme of a global conspiracy to eliminate Islam and that the Jews are Islams' worst enemy.Particularly illuminating was the section dealing with ideological founders of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sayyd Qutb and al Banna, and the prescient selection of Al Zawahiri, ideologue, bin Ladin's right hand man and chief organizer, more than 2 years before 9/11. (starting pp 151)In some cases I was surprised to find earlier echoes of current themes - ie: the \\"pig leaflet\\" episode (1991). An Israeli student who drew a cartoon showing Mohammed as a pig writing the Quran drawn spawning widespread riots as far away as Bangladesh and is reflected in more recent reactions to the recent Danish cartoon controversy. It is ironic (Bogdansky points out) as Christians and Jews are routinely referred to as the descendants of \\"apes and pigs\\". The accusation of Israeli engineered biological agents in chewing gum to promote sexual promiscuity (undermining Islamic values) and genetically engineered fruits for the same purpose would be two recent examples. However other tropes such as Jews controlling America, the banks, the use of blood libel re the preparation of matzah - these I know of. The more things change the more they stay the same.There are a considerable range of examples that I've only touched upon here for a relatively short book. 5* for the content and the presentation of the thesis. One less for not having an index at the back. Over time I suspect this will be available digitally (ie: Google Books) and one will be able to index automatically.

She has red hair, is literally and figuratively hot-headed, and is still hurting from a breakup with Liam, a dashing character from the Village Militia. Ryna isn't looking forward to running into Liam over the next seven weeks at the Pendragon Festival, and she is in a foul mood at the beginning of the book.Bea Saunders' brother Daniel has finally talked her into assuming a role at the Ren-Fest. The kind-hearted Bea becomes Phoenix, an exceedingly cranky old herb-witch who, over the course of the book, develops a suitably caustic and funny way of dealing with the Festival patrons. Liam sets his sights on Bea, and she is flattered, but as the story goes on, it's not Liam she becomes emotionally entangled with but Ryna.So, at heart, this novel is a romance, but it is also oh-so-much-more. The book is immense, and every page is packed full of colorful characters, the hustle-bustle of the crowds, and all the wit and humor found at a Renaissance Festival. Seen mostly through Ryna's and Bea's different perspectives (with some flashbacks to the 1500s), the story unfolds at a pace in keeping with the best stories of old. I am reminded of all the interconnectedness of an Austen novel, the breadth and scope of Dickens' work, and the wit of The Canterbury Tales.Ultimately, Ryna and Bea's relationship is central, but there are so many sub-plots running throughout the novel that many of characters become dear to the reader's heart (mine being the gender-reversed Robyn Hood & The Merry Maids who count one lone male, Lord Marion, as a member. They get into a lot of funny scrapes.)The book truly is a tour-de-force about the Renaissance Faire traditions. From the Ashes contains a wonderful mixture of the Gypsy, Irish, Italian, and English characters we associate with the Olde World: Knights, Lords, and Ladies, peasants and witches, fairies and rogues, minstrels, fortunetellers, a little bit of Magick, and Harvey, the Privy Monster. To keep us on track, the author has provided a glossary of the peculiar lingo that the Rennies use as well as a character listing.If you enjoy Ren-Fests, King Arthur, Robin Hood, or stories about Merry Olde England, or if you ever wanted to be a part of a benevolent group working toward an entertaining and rollicking common cause, this book's for you. I highly recommend it.~Lori L. Lake..."},{"Title":"From the Ashes","review":"This is a wonderful book that reminds me of one of my favorite Renaissance Festivals. It's quite uplifting. When I'm having a bad day, all I have to do is open the pages to laugh along with Ryna and Bea, and all of the other life-like characters of the Renaissance Festival family. The concerns of the characters are real and down to earth. It's quite easy for the reader to identify with many of them. This book presents a side of Rennydom that most patrons never even know exists, aside from wild stories that they hear passed on by urban legend. The book lets the imagination soar with how life could (should) be with just a bit of Magick."},{"Title":"From the Ashes","review":"The magic of Renaissance faires is that, for a few weekends a year, you can visit times far past and lose yourself in the world of the rennies, the people who become the peasants, nobles, gypsies and thieves populating the medieval villages. There's plenty of that magic in Meghan Brunner's From the Ashes. There's also plenty of real Magick.Ryna is a gypsy, as unlucky in love as she is talented in music. Her fiery red hair matches her temper. She grew up in Renaissance faires, and her family is a group of gypsies that travels year-round as full-time rennies. She takes the magic--and the Magick--that surrounds her almost for granted. She's recently had her heart broken by the dashing, yet sinister, Liam.It's Bea's first year at the Pendragon Renaissance Faire and everything is still novel and wondrous for her. While Bea is still a newbie, her character Phoenix is already fitting in as if she'd always been there. When Ryna and Bea meet, it's as if they've known each other forever. The two quickly form a close friendship, and Ryna begins to see the faire--and life-through new eyes.Someone isn't happy about their burgeoning relationship, however, and dark forces are being drawn into play to keep them apart--forces that have been at work for longer than anyone could possibly suspect.From the Ashes is Brunner's first novel, and it's an impressive debut. Brunner self-published the massive doorstop of a book, but don't let that intimidate you. While she could have benefited from a good editor in places, her spirited writing draws you in and surpasses any flaws. Her descriptions are priceless, bringing the world of the faire alive even if you've never been to one before. I laughed out loud over and over at the antics of the peasants. Her depictions of everyday life in the faire were the highlights of the book for me. It made me eager to attend a Renaissance faire.I also enjoyed her use of Magick, which is such a part of the character's everyday life that they barely think about it. They use their gifts to do things like lock doors after they're already in bed and open doors when their arms are full. This approach gave the supernatural elements a much more realistic feel. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys magical realism and good, hearty sheep jokes."},{"Title":"From the Ashes","review":"From the Ashes is the kind of book that makes you want to go out and find the charecters and places in it when you have finished reading it. Everything is so real, so alive, you can't help but want to seek it out for yourself. Pendragon Faire offers more magick and adventure than you could ever expect in a few short weekends. The peasants kept me laughing, and the gypsies made me want to hit the road as a full-time rennie. The author shows a maturity that I find lacking in most books in the genre, I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"From the Ashes","review":"When magick spills over between this world and the Otherworld, you have Pendragon. New author Meghan Brunner holds her own with some of the best story tellers of our time. Her annecdotes of the fun, heartache and hardships that happen during the mythical Pendragon Renaissance Faire bring to life the ambiance of faire and put the reader into the middle of the action, pranks and out-and-out fun. But over and above that, she weaves a complex tale of karma that spans centuries and blends true magick, mystery, passion and loyalty that keep the reader wanting more.If I have any reservations, it would be that at times the faire annecdotes slowed the pace of the story more than I might have liked. However, these same annecdotes so enlivened the characters, both the main and secondary ones, and were so wonderful just for themselves, that this was a minor drawback to the book as a whole.All in all, From the Ashes is a marvelous work of fiction and a phenominal achievement for a first-time author. I look forward to the upcoming installments to this intriguing story."},{"Title":"From the Ashes","review":"From The Ashes is a fabulous book. It is set in a present day Rennaissance Festival environment with interlude flashbacks to late 1500s England. As the story unfolds, the author creates a believable, realistic world where magick is commonly used--by those who know where to look. This world, backstage of the Pendragon RenFaire, runs side-by-side with the mundane world of patrons and commerce. The characters are well-written, each with personal weaknesses to deal with and strengths they must learn to use, and the relationships formed are believable.The book opens new doors in literary courage. The primary romantic relationship is between two women, though it is not a book about homosexuality. Much of the story is the development of this relationship, but it is not a romance or a love story. All the main characters use magick, but it is not a fantasy story, nor is it about witchcraft. There are many struggles and battles, but it is not about action.Simply put, it is a fresh look, incorporating many previously successful ideas, but putting a new face on them. It may even be a new genre....I eagerly await Book II."},{"Title":"From the Ashes","review":"This is a wonderful book that reminds me of one of my favorite Renaissance Festivals.

From the Ashes contains a wonderful mixture of the Gypsy, Irish, Italian, and English characters we associate with the Olde World: Knights, Lords, and Ladies, peasants and witches, fairies and rogues, minstrels, fortunetellers, a little bit of Magick, and Harvey, the Privy Monster.\\"That's a pretty good characterization. Having worked at a Renaissance Faire for ten years, the Faire phenomenon has clearly developed its own culture, complete with stock characters, traditions, common stories, in-jokes, and folklore.This RenFaire culture doesn't, however, have very much to do with actual history.This is not necessarily a fatal flaw, if you're prepared for it. But you won't learn history from a RenFaire (and especially not from this book). What you will get, as here, is the \\"movie version\\" of history, complete with Irish peasants eating potatoes, lots of mud, King Arthur, Scots with kilts (and sheep jokes), gypsies, and people shouting \\"Yea, verily, yea!\\"I agree with other reviewers that the author has a real knack for character and dialog, wit and repartee. She captures very well the sort of interaction with the Faire's customers that I've seen a thousand times. I laughed out loud at the procession of chanting monks solemnly intoning \\"boop bop a-loo-bop\\" between lines of Latin. And the peasants' antics, while often rather gross (a good deal of bathroom and sexual humor) are hilarious. Oh, and if previous reviewers haven't made this crystal clear yet, it's a lesbian love story.The plotting, however, needs work. There are three interwoven subplots here, and I didn't think the connections between the sub-plots and the main plot were clear, making the transitions rather jarring.The past-life interludes \\"explaining\\" why the three main characters are drawn together are a roll-your-eyes clich&eacute; by now, and more than a little heavy-handed (and the history isn't well founded either -- though I have to give the author points, the \\"witch\\" in the story is hanged, not burned as is the common misconception).The second subplot, the main character's series of nightmares, didn't make symbolic sense to me: I could NOT figure out what the sequence of freezing and burning was supposed to mean, and the descriptions of each nightmare were absolutely copy-and-paste identical (dreams don't do that).And the third subplot, the Evil Villain making a bargain with the Dark Spirits, is just lame. If your villain is going to make bargains with dark spirits, it would be helpful if they were _competent_ dark spirits and didn't (as these seem to) dither around Just Being Evil for three-fourths of the book before they acted. Granted, they do eat the villain in the end. I was never clear on what he was promising them in return for them getting him what he wanted, though.So if you know what you're getting into, it's an entertaining book, and the author shows promise. But don't expect the Renaissance."},{"Title":"From the Ashes","review":"Still, \\"From the Ashes\\" has a lot of appeal for both Rennies and Mundanes (if you have to ask, you probably are one, but the definition is loosely folks who don't participate in Ren Faires, sci-fi cons, etc.) Anyone who's ever attended a RenFaire or been curious about one gets a good look at what goes on behind-the-scenes. In some ways, too good of a look, though. Brunner's anecdotes are interesting in relation to character development, but they bog the plot down.Essentially, the story is about friendship, good and evil, that takes place against the Magickal backdrop of Pendragon Faire. Ryna, who is a career Rennie and magickally gifted, has been in the Faires for so long they're ordinary to her. Plus, she's working to overcome a romance-gone-bad with Liam. Bea, who just started in the Ren Faires, is seeing the event through fresh eyes, but having some 'rookie' problems. Liam is attracted to Bea, but Bea is feeling more interest for Ryna. The story between the two is engaging and interesting.For a first novel, \\"From the Ashes\\" is not bad, just not quite mature and developed. Brunner does wonderful character; however, the balance between that and plot is uneven because of too many side trips."},{"Title":"Signed, Sealed & Committed (6 Audio Cassette Tape Set in Clam Shell Case) (Adventures in Odyssey Audio Series, 29)","review":"They're starry eyed.

It is very difficult to read in terms of trying to comprehend the cruelty and misery of that place and time. The author, Richard Chardkoff, is a history professor at the university in Louisiana where the subject, Sol Rosenberg, now lives with his children and grandchildren. Dr. Chardkoff was funded with a grant to travel to Poland and Germany to document the events and Sol's movements during this time.Salik Rosenberg was born a Jew in Germany in the late 1920's and moved with his family to Poland before the Nazi invasion. The story evolves around Sol's life during the rise of the Nazi's through to his rescue by the American troops at Dachau. What you see in this horrific odyssey are the captors and guards who embody the worst evils of humans, contrasted with a person like Sol, who seldom questioned his ability to go on and had just an incredible will for survival. Dr. Chardkoff adeptly adds historical facts surrounding the locations and timeframes of Sol's journey.This book can be read by anyone easily and is definitely recommended for students of the holocaust. Due to the graphic nature of the conditions of the prisoners, I would not recommend this book to children. I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they had a difficult childhood."},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"This book brought the Holocaust to life in great detail. It truly was educational and gives you a great deal of admiration for Sol Rosenberg. We have prisons filled with people who say they had a bad childhood so that justifies their crimes. They should make this book available to people in prison and then tell them to stop their whining. Dr. Chardkoff did an excellent job!"},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"During my adolescence, I had the pleasure of growing up across the street from the Rosenburgs in Monroe, La. While in middle school, I had the opportunity to hear Mr. Rosenburg speak of his experience with the Nazis. At the time, I didn't grasp the seriousness of his situation. Now after more than 20 years, I am fortunate teach the history of the Holocaust to high school students in Alabama. This is my second year to teach the Holocaust and I will have my students read this book to gain a better sense of the events that took place and how difficult the day-to-day persecutions were for the Jews.Dr. Chardkoff takes readers through Mr. Rosenburg's journey of survival by illustrating the tragic events with attention to detail. Dr. Chardkoff does an excellent job of preparing readers by describing the Rosenburg's way of life before the Nazis begin to exercise full power against the Jews. The anti-Jewish policies, propaganda, emigration, separation, smuggling to survive, paticipating in the Warsaw ghetto uprising, extreme hunger, escape from death camps, and a face-to-face encounter with one of the main perpetrators, Mr. Rosenburg's will to survive would endure everything the Nazis unleashed until he was finally liberated. I have not read another book that is able to portray the true sense of the Holocaust quite like Mr. Rosenburg's story. I added this book to my class readings and my students are looking forward to reading it later this semester. Sol's Story does more than allow readers to relive his experiences, the book describes just how close death really was for millions of innocent people. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks to gain a greater sense of understanding the Holocaust and the impact it has on those who were fortunate to survive."},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"The book was a great read. I knew Mr. Rosenberg but did not know his story. He was a remarkable person and now that I have read his story I find him to be even more remarkable. He lived thorugh NAZI persecution and hatred through sheer determination and will to survive. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"I read 'Sol's Story' 10 years ago and it remains one of the most memorable and important books I've ever read. 'Sol's Story' stands apart from the other historic/true books I've read because Sol actually walks the reader along with him through his entire experience as a Jew striving to survive the Holocaust. Sol shares his thoughts with the reader every step of the way. He shares his realizations with the reader as they dawn on him. He ponders his relationships with others during those dangerous times. For example, there are the German girls he encounters--Sol ponders not only his thoughts about the girl, but he ponders (in a life or death way) what the girl might be thinking about him, Sol being a handsome man but Jewish. Can he trust a young German woman or not?In other words, Sol is basically just a nice young man going through his life the same way we all went through our young lives--wondering what others might be thinking about us, wondering what lay ahead of us in life, wondering which course to take whenever we had an important decision to make. Sol's really no different from the rest of us--he could have been in our high school graduation class--but through no choice of his own, Sol found himself in extraordinary circumstances in extremely dangerous times during one of the worst chapters in world history. One reads this book and wonders \\"What would I have done in that situation if I were Sol?\\" \\"What would I have decided to do if a German woman offered me shelter?\\" One becomes part of Sol as he walks you through his young life.It's a fascinating read. It's a book I've never forgotten and never will forget."},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It takes you though Sol's journey from being a regular teenager to living in the Warsaw Ghetto to living in concentration camps. I enjoyed learning about what it was like for people living in the Ghetto. It's amazing that Sol survived considering how many times his life was in imminent danger, but he survived on his wits and his luck. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"This has got to be one of the best book's I have ever read. It explaines so much about why he is the loving caring man that he is and why so many people care about him. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"There are few and diminishing number of holocaust survivors who can offer first hand accounts on this horrific period in history. Sol's story covers a six year period that includes surviving the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, Treblinka, Majdenik, Buchenwald and Dachau.Sol Survived from physical strength and stamina (at 77 today he is still in remarkable health), personal pride in being a Jew, incredible resourcefullness, and an indellible will to live. He just refused to die.This story will appeal to any student of Jewish or Holocaust studies, but it holds real value for anyone who wants to understand the strength of faith and spirit, regardless of religious background."},{"Title":"Sol's Story A Triumph of the Human Spirit","review":"To be completely honest, I haven't read the book. But I live in Monroe and I've heard Sol speak out before and that was incredibly moving. I'm waiting to get my copy.I was in the eighth grade at my junior high (I'm a senior in high school now) when he visited and spoke about his experiences. He really is inspiring. I drive past his piping store nearly every day...And amazing man and I'm certain that the book is amazing as well."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Herodotus (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","review":"Herodotus, called at times the \\"father of history\\" and the \\"father of lies,\\" was the most important early non-fiction writer in Greece. This is an excellent collection of essays on Herodotus.The emphasis is more on the literary than the historical context, so the reader might want to supplement this work with other writings, such as Nino Luraghi's excellent THE HISTORIAN'S CRAFT IN THE AGE OF HERODOTUS."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Herodotus (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","review":"\\"Arnaldo Momigliano remarked of Herodotus nearly forty years ago that 'the secrets of his workshop are not yet all out', and this is still the case; paradoxically, new approaches to the ancient world and to the writing of history in general have shown more clearly how little we understand the genesis of this great work and Herodotus' own accomplishment.\\"-- The Cambridge Companion to Herodotus (Cambridge Companions to Literature series)I am in the process of reading THE HISTORIES by Herodotus and I just wanted to post what an invaluable resource this book is. I will not list the table of contents and the vast number of classical scholars that have contributed to this book (you only have to take a peek at the Table of Contents above to gain that useful information); but I would like to note that Carolyn Dewald and John Marincola who edited this book did a fantastic job; not solely as editors, but also as contributors.There are few editors who can do such a credible job of evaluating the literary aspects of a work as great as this undertaking was. Some believe Herodotus to be the father of history -- while others cannot understand or fathom some of his other portrayals of the non-Greek lands and yet others like to criticize his stories which were steeped in oral tradition.But Dewald and Marincola get beyond all of the above and have focused in this book on the literary aspects of Herodotus and point out the greatness of his writing. That despite some of the factual debates that rage on, that his words still do make him the first historian of Western tradition and that their focus was on this literary masterpiece viewing him as an artist who was \\"also\\" the creator of this first inquiry into cause and effect.Some of the chapters examine Herodotus as a \\"literary craftsman\\". These essays show how Herodotus was able to bridge for his readers the wonder of the literary past of his own Greek culture with the wonderful achievement and historical work which we have with us today. This ancient was able to give us a glimpse into what life was like and what was valued over 2500 years ago!In reading Herodotus, I have found this resource a valuable one and frankly there are not many resources which span multiple topic areas as does this compilation. Many of the others seem to focus on historical references or their specific hypotheses. This book synthesizes the various views of Herodotus as a literary work and assists the reader who may be meeting Herodotus in his travels for the very first time as I am. For those of you who are traveling with Herodotus like I am doing today and are reading his formidable work for the first time, Dewald's and Marincola's edition will become your staunch and faithful armchair companion.Bentley/2008"},{"Title":"THE LETTERS OF SIGMUND FREUD AND ARNOLD ZWEIG","review":"Sigmund Freud's correspondance are mostly fertile, but sometimes, according to his correspondent, they are quite better.

When Freud was not in a rivalry position, he could be a very nice character."},{"Title":"History of Topology","review":"This book collects 40 essays on various themes, events, and personalities in the history of topology. I have browsed half of them and carefully read 6 or 8. Plus I have used the book as a reference, and so gained isolated facts from many of the essays.The essays assume various amounts of background, proportionate to their subjects. In generally they are very clear and if you have any knowledge at all of a topic you can read an essay on it here at least well enough to decide if you want to work harder on it.The book concentrates more on manifolds, fixed point theorems, algebraic topology, and homological algebra, than on issues in general or point set topology. It covers Poincare, Brouwer, Weyl, and gets up to derived categories. It could not possibly cover everything in that range. For one, Lefschetz is mentioned often but he could well have deserved a whole article on himself. Or there could have been an article on the Princeton school. But incomplete we must all resign ourselves to be.The book is a huge amount of information, very well organized and presented."},{"Title":"History of Topology","review":"A sublime account of the history of topology from it's earliest incarnation as analysis situs to contemporary research.No home should be without one."},{"Title":"Napoleon's Italian Troops (Men at Arms Series, 88)","review":"This excellent book tells you all you need to know about the Italian troops during the Napoleonic wars.

There is also a very informative section that tells us what units fought where and when. A must for Napoleonic buffs and wargamers."},{"Title":"Napoleon's Italian Troops (Men at Arms Series, 88)","review":"This was and is a great starter into looking at Italian and Neapolitan uniforms. The uniform plates are nice, but there are more indepth period plates available. Unit histories are brief and the Neapolitans get little to no treatment and what is said is with a definite bias.

Daniel Wright has Caravaggio's vanity, obsession with art, contempt for others' opinions, violent propensities, envy and emulation of his class betters, and not least, inner demons that propel him into escalating violence. This allows Griffiths to make subtle points about art, obsession, love and betrayal. It also leads the knowing reader to expect a tragic end and indeed Wright comes to grief in Naples, not far from Porto Ercole where Caravaggio reportedly met his lonely death. Griffith's sideways evocation, homage even, works better for this elusive, schizophrenic artist, than some more direct reworkings such as Christopher Peachment's 'Caravaggio'."},{"Title":"Race and Resistance: Literature and Politics in Asian America","review":"The first reviewer has not only missed the point; he or she is naive and has almost certainly not read the book. By building on and critiquing the works of his predecessors such as Elaine Kim, Cynthia Wong, Rachel Lee, and Lisa Lowe, Viet Thanh Nguyen offers the most cogent and viable view of Asian American literature that I've read to date. What he critiques is precisely how Asian American intellectuals over-rely on racial identity for self-definition, and how this leads to the canonization of only those Asian American texts that offer \\"resistance\\" to the dominant culture. He argues for the reclamation of Asian American texts that employ other \\"flexible strategies\\" besides resistance, such as accommodation and assimilation. By the end, he suggests that Asian Americans might even come to be considered white or at least aligned with whiteness in America, which suggests the elasticity of racial categories. This book is far, far from racist. In fact, ideologically, it is the most even-handed of the well-known works of Asian American literary criticism. If you have any interest in Asian American Studies or how to negotiate Asian American identity, you should read this book. And I say this as a Ph.D. student in English, not as someone who has any personal connection to the author. Quite frankly, I resent reviews like the first; they are acts of ignorance and sabotage."},{"Title":"Race and Resistance: Literature and Politics in Asian America","review":"Yes, I would agree that Japanese Baptists have more in common with American Baptists than, say, Japanese Satanists or Buddhists, but that is an irrelevant digression. For one thing, you cannot tell by looking at someone what beliefs he holds, or whatnot--but you can (at least most of the time) tell the person's race. And that is how we lump people together--not based on what they really believe, but on the superficial side. So this book is not racist; it just points out (accurately) the unpleasant truth. Would you rather have the author sugarcoat everything and make it seem as if we all only care about &quot;what's on the inside&quot; a la Barney the big purple dinosaur? If so, you might want to go back to watching Sesame Street, I think the commercials are about over."},{"Title":"Race and Resistance: Literature and Politics in Asian America","review":"Anyone who continues to think of race as a primary characteristic of someone is a racist.This book is racist.Culturally, there are so many divides within any given &quot;race,&quot; that it is an illusory category that should be abandoned.It would be much better to look at people in terms of common beliefs. For instance, Japanese Baptists have more in common with American Baptists than either group has with Satanists.It is religion, or the lack of it, that unites or divides people, or at least what it is that they believe.As ML King put it, it's the content of one's character that should be judged.

In this historic novel, the author portrays the construction of the railroad Wood-Mamor&eacute;, in the middle of the tropical forest, an ambitious work that involves deaths and corruption, in the beginning of the century XX, in the middle of the peak of the economy of the latex in Brazil. The romance also involves illustrations of the Brazilian politics and fictitious characters, as a native without hands explored as diversion. It's a great novel, touching and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Mad Maria","review":"Almost a hundred years ago the Brazilian Amazon was a place, on the one hand, of exorbitant wealth, based on the extraction of rubber in working conditions that would, on the other hand, come to arouse international concern and condemnation. To help get the rubber to markets overseas, a railway was built in some of the most unpromising territory imaginable--only to be completed just as the bottom fell out of the rubber market and the region's good fortune collapsed utterly.M&aacute;rcio Souza, a prolific author who has also written more conventional histories about his native Amazonia, here tells the story of the Madeira-Mamor&eacute; railway, or \\"Mad Maria\\", in the form of a novel. More accurately, he describes life in one particular work camp along the line of construction, alternating these scenes with others set in Rio de Janeiro where the railway's owner--the historical and scoundrelly venture capitalist Percival Farquhar--schemes to gain the support of a new Brazilian administration.The scenes in the forest are appropriately dark, even macabre, with workers dying left and right from disease, poor working conditions, and violent conflicts amongst the workers themselves. Souza's main characters here are the head engineer, a cynical Englishman (or does he really have a heart of gold, we are perhaps invited to wonder?); a young American doctor who starts out, at least, as a punctilious idealist; a young Bolivian woman whose adventures lead her to the work camp by chance; and an Indian whose life gets tangled up with that of the whites in a particularly dramatic way.Souza has the habit of conveying his characters' thoughts and attitudes as much by informing us of their introspection as by what they actually say and do. Here's a parody of his style that may convey the feel: \`\\"Look over there,\\" said the Englishman suddenly. He always felt uneasy when thus taken by surprise, but didn't like to show it to his subordinates.' Yet there is, nevertheless, a great deal of activity in these scenes, some of it violent though not, I believe, gratuitously so. And Souza does a fine job of conveying the sights and sounds of the forest (as I know, having been myself to just this part of the Amazon).The scenes in Rio present Souza with a different challenge. Now he must convey the sense of a quite different kind of danger, that of intrigue at the very heart of the new administration. If the stakes perhaps seem lower to us than they were in the forest--Farquhar, an American, is at one point threatened with mere deportation when, a chapter or so ago, his workers were graphically described suffering gruesome and fatal diseases--yet, on the other hand, the subtlety of Farquhar's machinations gives rise to some fine moments. There is one brief scene where the American capitalist is called in to meet the Minister of Justice, and it is stretching things only a little to say that we are reminded of Raskolnikov's cat-and-mouse game with the prosecutor in \\"Crime and Punishment\\". But this is a high point, and at other times Souza doesn't make it entirely clear just what Farquhar is hoping to achieve. Perhaps the author is constrained by having to include, in these Rio scenes, a greater number of actual figures from history--including, besides Farquhar, the gifted lawyer and politician Ruy Barbosa, and Marshal Hermes da Fonseca, the president of Brazil. As often in this genre, it is hard for the nonspecialist reader to know just how much is factual, but it seems that Souza had much less of a free hand in Rio than he had in the forest.(Whilst talking of historical accuracy, I have to admit being surprised when, very close to the book's end, one character leaves the town of Porto Velho on foot and arrives at Guajar&aacute;-Mirim the following day. I've been to both places, and they are, at a guess, well over a hundred miles apart. Souza is, elsewhere, a generally careful writer and this kind of lapse is uncharacteristic.)At some point, as one could see from the start, the two sets of characters--one in the forest and the other in Rio--get to meet. One feels, though, that Souza has brought them together in the interests of a pattern that he had in mind for the book; there's no inevitability in the encounter, and it passes calmly enough on the whole (although, again, with some striking incidents). By this time the story is almost finished, and the concluding scene has a neatness about it which suggests, once more, that Souza felt this would provide a pleasing symmetry--rather than being a scene driven by the motivations of his characters.If my comments have come across as somewhat unfavourable, I should add that by and large I enjoyed the book. I don't generally read much fiction (I read this book, as it happens, out of interest through having recently returned from Brazil), so perhaps that influenced my views. The translation is adequate, though not entirely fluent: too often the Portuguese shows through, as in \\"he commenced to do such-and-such\\" rather than \\"he began\\". Souza's style, though, might be a challenge for any translator.How, then, can I say that I enjoyed this book? First, for someone who loves the region it is gratifying to read any account of it, fictional or otherwise (though I must say there's nothing here for those readers concerned, primarily, with what they see as environmental issues). Second, Souza expresses from time to time that nationally characteristic pride which alternates between confidence and self-deprecation; I think one could tell, without being told, that this book was written by a Brazilian. There are few enough Brazilian novels that have been translated into English, and we should read them whenever we have the chance."},{"Title":"Mad Maria","review":"Just what I was looking for - glad to have finally found it - thank you for offering it."},{"Title":"Sparrows Of North America And Canada: Photographic Guide","review":"In the winter time here in Virginia we get a number of differnt types of sparrows that migrate in. I love watching them but was having difficulty determining which types were which from just the regular field guides so I asked around and one of our local birders recommended this to me. Its terrific! The pictures of the birds are close-up - as if you were holding the bird or were sitting on the ground less than a foot away looking at the bird. This really helps when trying to distinguish the slight differences in colors or patterns. Each species has a chapter that strats out with measurements (size, weight etc) then there's a range map, and some text on habitat, then some text on behavior and voice/songs. There's writing about similar species, geographic variation, distribution (winter, breeding, migration periods), conservation status, and molt. There's also text descriptions for specific markings etc to hone in on, and discussion of hybrids if any. Then the chapter has pictures, of boys, girls, adults, juveniles, etc. Really a great book that has helped me a lot.

Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Sparrows Of North America And Canada: Photographic Guide","review":"Sparrows can and are difficult to identify at times, in particular if you live within the area of major migrations. This difficulty comes from the fact that there is a large difference, at times, between male, female, juveniles, molting stages, variations in plumage and even at times, confusion over calls and behavior. Add to this the fact that, for the most part, all these wonderful little winged creatures are about the same size and shape, and you have real problems.I do not use this particular book as a field guide, i.e. one that I carry in my kit bag when I am in the bush. I have quite a number of other guides and no end to the pure junk I have stuck here and there. I have had to simply draw the line somewhere, our buy a mule to help me haul the stuff around. I use this book as a study reference to which I can compare my field notes, photographs and memory. The photographs in this one are not a numerous as in some other like volumes, and as has been pointed out, thee is quite a lot of test. This is the strong point of the book though. By specializing, the author has been able to give exact data on habitat, habits, feeding patterns, migration patterns and obscure little facts that are most helpful. I love the way the slight plumage variations have been addressed and noted. This can make all the difference in the world when fretting over a difficult to identify species.The photograph quality is excellent and this volume does contain some of the clearest close up view of birds of any of the many books I do own. Sparrows and warblers have always been my bane, and I do appreciate this work as it has made my life and major hobby much easier and more enjoyable.Recommend this one highly.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Sparrows Of North America And Canada: Photographic Guide","review":"As part of a state wildlife agency effort to band migratory birds, we sometimes encounter fall sparrows that are difficult to identify. Most field guides show limited views of fall adult or juvenile sparrows. This guide includes many photos for each species and for different parts of the country.

After her own father recently beat her and rejected her and his granddaughter, further dismissal would not shock Sara. Instead her sister-in-law Louzanna welcomes the fallen woman and her niece \\"Lissybeth\\" to live with her.The next day, Sara's spouse Dr. Dru Talbot comes home after serving time in a northern prison and recovering from amnesia. He is stunned to learn that his beloved, the only reason he survived the war, had cuckolded him with another woman. He cannot even look at her lovechild without ire. As Sara tries to atone for her transgression and regain what she once had before the war, an epidemic threatens to destroy the town.MAGNOLIA CREEK is an exciting Reconstruction Era romance that is more of a historical character study of the aftermath of the deadly American Civil War. The story line uses coincidence (or as Louzanna felt divine intervention) to move forward the plot yet engages the audience through the trials and tribulations of the lead characters and the secondary cast that does not always end in happily. Fans will understand the dreary pessimism of the locals as Jill Marie Landis makes the audience feel the pain from the loss of loved ones and the suffering from economic ruin.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"Although Landis is not a favorite author of mine I favor civil war era stories so gave this one a chance. The plot was very unique. Frankly I never gave a thought to what the returning soldiers would find at home....especially given the years it took some of them to regain their health, freedom and get home. This surely put that in perspective. The characters were very realistic and quite wonderful. Landis makes her meaningful points very subtly throughout the book with the various relationships and issues that arise. I rated this less than a 5 only because our heroine is a backwoods gal, much like 'Tammy\\" in the old movies and the author put too much emphasis on the 'voodoo charm witches brew' medicine of that backwoods culture. Although it didn't take much away from the story itself, I just found it distracting. Sarah herself was everything a heroine should be with a great deal of perseverence, heart and courage. Although our hero, Dru, eventually comes to care for her little daughter, lissybeth, it is barely noticeable to the reader. You have to look for it and I think that precious little girl deserved more than a tokenacceptance. A better than average book for sure.........not one I would read a 2nd time so not for my keeper shelf but it may be for yours."},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"I find with Jill Marie Landis that it's either hit or miss, I loved \\"Blue Moon\\" and \\"After All\\", but some of her others I simply couldn't get into. \\"Magnolia Creek\\" fell somewhere in the middle.This is a story set in the Civil War, where Dru and Sara were married for a very short time when Dru went off to war as a doctor. When he returned - years later - he found Sara back home - with a child that was not his. This story deals with how Dru and Sara handle this and are able to get over it.Just one problem - when Sara explained her side of the story, I simply did not see that there was a problem at all. From where I sit, Sara did not do anything really wrong, maybe only a small lapse of judgment, and from then on I found Dru's reaction not-understandable. It's one thing when he walked in and was hit in the head with it - so to speak - quite another when he gets the explanation and still reacts like she did something terrible - well, Dru did not come across as my favorite hero, at all.And Sara as the heroine was not too much better either. Okay, she's a pretty nice person, and a good person, but she does some small, but stupid things in this novel that make me like her alot less. First, there is all this stuff about her grandaddy's charms. I have no problem with charms, and I'm sure her grandaddy helped alot of people, and in those days charms were probably almost as good as real medicine - almost, but not quite. She herself explains how the charms work - the placebo effect, so to speak.but she IS married to a doctor - you'd think she'd have a little bit of respect for his profession - even if she really DID think her charms worked better than his medicine (doubtful) - have a little respect for your husband, please? If I go to a doctor, and the doctor examines me and gives me a prescription to follow, and on the way out the nurse whispers to me - take this herb, it'll work - how long do you think the nurse will be working for that doctor? And if that person would be his wife - well, I don't know about you, but I would be wondering about the state of their marriage, wouldn't you? And this is supposed to be a romance novel.Jill Marie Landis has her formula - she writes decently, with a strong emphasis on emotional depth, in which she explores her characters - why they do things, how they feel as they are doing it, etc. Sometimes this formula works for me, sometimes it doesn't. I suspect this has to do with how much I like the h/h - in a character driven novel, this is essential. And I just couldn't like these two characters that much.I would rate this only an average read, that's how it was for me."},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"Dr. Dru Talbot has returned from the Civil War looking forward to the life he will lead with his &quot;new&quot; wife Sara.

Sara was lead to believe Dru was dead and being the naive, backwoods girl she was, fell under the spell of a Yankee soldier, who used her and left her with a baby. Sara returns to Kentucky and is an outcast by everyone except Dru's mentally disturbed sister, who takes her in. Can the damage done to this family be repaired??? Can mistakes be forgiven??? Can love conquer all???This book was absolutely wonderful. It was so easy to read and had characters who seemed completely believable and sincere. I agree with the other reviewer that it is nice to read books about characters other than the ton and royalty. It is great to read about our country and the past it has with characters who are written to fit right in to the time period. The characters were well developed and the storyline seemed to be well thought out before the author started writing the book. If you love romances or books about America's history you will love Magnolia Creek.Magnolia Creek was such a good read that I had the book finished in just two days! It was just too good to put down. I just love a book that leaves you wanting more after the last page and this book definitely does that.

She seeks shelter at the home of her sister-in-law, Louzanna Talbot. Though Sara left Kentucky in disgrace over a year after discovering that her husband Dru had been killed in the war, Lou welcomed her back with open arms.But Dru has in fact survived the war, and struggles with his damaged male pride when he learns that Sara hasn't spent recent years pining away at the Talbot family home. For her journey west to Ohio resulted in a surprise that Dru never expected when he dreamed of his homecoming. As Dru and Sara try to maintain a platonic truce, she hopes for his forgiveness even as he struggles with his attraction to her. And when a devastating tragedy involves the whole town, Dru, the physician, and Sara, the healer, must employ all their skills to save as many lives as possible.Ms. Landis is a standout in the sub-genre of historical romance, not merely for her page-turning stories, but also because her novels are filled with the emotional angst appreciated by many romance readers. Once again, this latest novel is filled with emotional conflict and an intense story line. While the drama is not quite as compelling as previous reads, fans of Ms. Landis should not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"I am not a romance novel reader per say.

This is like real people! YEAH, Keep those books coming!!"},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"Despite all the rave reviews, I wasn't in the mood for a novel set in post-Civil War. Obviously it'd been a while since I read a Jill Marie Landis story because the focus shouldn't have been on the setting at all. I'd forgotten what a great story teller Ms. Landis was - no matter what the era.Sara and Dru haven't been around each other much but know as all young lovers seem to immediately know that they are meant for each other and thus they marry right before he goes off to join the war. He's young and she's even younger at 17. When Dru gets home 6 years later, everything and everyone has changed, including himself.Dru's image of the Sara he carried in his heart for the 6 celibate years he was away from her is crushed when he returns and finds his wife with her baby who is much too young to be his child.How Dru and Sara deal with that and how they grow from that is the crux of this heart wrenching love story. I wet a few pages reading this endearing romance about idealistic young lovers who thought they had the perfect love to two adults who come to realize the meaning of what love is really all about.The secondary characters also make this book. Louzanna, Jamie, Sara's grandfather Daniel and A little girl crying for her &quot;Woo&quot; have been engraved in my previously-thought-immune-to-boo-hoo-about finctional-characters-heart.This is a love story revisisted. About redemption. And Ms. Landis has written another keeper for us romance fans."},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"As Kentucky struggles to recover from the consequences of the Civil War, her people do not easily forget the transgressions of the past. Small town Magnolia Creeks bears the memory of Sara Collier, a widowed woman who dared to flaunt her relationship with a Yankee soldier before disappearing with him. Now the war has ended, and with nowhere else to go, Sara returns to the town that would prefer to reject her and her small child. Only Lou, her former husband's sister, opens her doors to Sara.Dru Talbet rises from the dead to return home, dreaming of the bride he left behind. Little does he suspect that he has been reported dead. The months and years of surgeon's life during the war have taken their toll, and only the memory of Sara has kept him going. But the war exacts a higher price than just battle service when he's faced with proof of his wife's infidelity. As he sets up practice in Magnolia Creek, he will find the town does not forgive him easily for not forcing Sara to leave immediately. Worse, Dru can neither easily forgive nor forget Sara's infidelity, or his own responsibility in the past.A bold and daring tale of the aftermath of the Civil War, author Jill Marie Landis creates a searing tale of love and betrayal in MAGNOLIA CREEK. Sara's justifiable infidelity challenges readers' perceptions of right and wrong, even as she wins their hearts with her courage and determination. Dru's own responsibility in events gone awry is not to be dismissed, either, as he struggles with the town's opinion of his wife, his feelings, and his attraction to the woman he struggles to scorn. Secondary characters likewise spring vividly to life from Dru's hysterical sister to the devoted freedman who once lived their slave. With surprising plot turns and entrancing characterizations, readers will be mesmerized by this masterful storyteller's voice. Add this one to the keeper shelf. MAGNOLIA CREEK earns the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"Jill Marie Landis is wonderful author who has written many books I have enjoyed reading. However, Magnolia Creek was difficult for me to enjoy. I had a hard time liking the main character, Sara.The story begins right away with the conflict that Sara is trying to overcome. As a reader, we don't really get to know Sara first...before she makes life mistakes and creates the conflict she is in. I had a very hard time feeling any sympathy for her, because she starts out bringing her bastard child home and being turned away by her family and town where she grew up. We don't know much about her first and I had a hard time trying to understand what would have made her run off with a Yankee soldier without being re-married.It wasn't until about half way through the book that her story finally comes out. I don't like giving up on a novel...and since I really enjoyed previous books written by Jill Marie Landis, I stuck with it and finished the book. It was entertaining, but not my favorite.Magnolia Creek was well written and the other characters were rich and unique. I just didn't care for Sara's conflict and I never really enjoyed her personality very much. She could have been stronger and more intelligent to show her maturity and her healing abilities. She still seemed \\"backwoods\\" with her poppets and charms. Overall, it's a good book, but not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Magnolia Creek (Aventures & Passions (Text in French))","review":"Don't tell me this scenario didn't happen in history! In fact, I've heard old Civil War songs about the men coming home and finding a strange baby in the house and they hadn't been home in years. So this was great to have it enacted and not to have to pity or imagine it! :)Just a very interesting story played out well til the end.A doctor, hard bitten from the War, finally arrives home after all these years and finds his wife has also just returned, with a strangers baby in her arms. The slaves have gone and his innocent sister has had to turn self sufficient.Theres a lot the story plays on besides romance---yellow fever, war issues, that I was surprised and delighted to find in a romance.

Let's hear it for Rosaly Lopes, Tracy Gregg, Katherine Cashman, Ellen Stofan, Lisa Gaddis, Susan Sakimoto, Joy Crisp, Louise Prockter, Mary Chapman, Gudrun Larsen, and Susan Kieffer! These ladies were the logical authorities to be chosen to write their respective chapters. And they did a great job.Cashman leads off with a discussion of hot spot volcanism and subduction zone volcanism. The part on hot spots deals mostly with volcanoes in Hawaii, but the Laki volcano in Iceland is chosen as the most dramatic example of \\"the deleterious effects of volcanic gases.\\" The section on subduction zone volcanism includes topics such as silicic lava flows and lava domes as well as caldera collapse. And there's plenty about the hazards associated with such volcanism, including a speculation that the eruption of Toba, Sumatra (74,000 years ago) may have reduced the human population to less than 100,000 back then.Gregg talks about the exploration of volcanoes hidden at the sea floor on mid-ocean ridges. This includes some discussion of hydrothermal venting there, which can raise the ocean water temperature near a vent to over 400 degrees Celsius. And, of course, it is mentioned that there is speculation about similar volcanism (and even life) on the Jovian moon Europa.What about \\"Earth's evil twin,\\" as Stofan appropriately calls Venus? Thousands of volcanoes have been identified on Venus. We learn about lava flows there as well as long sinuous channels. Some of the lava flows there are much longer than were predicted. Hopefully, we'll learn from them how to better predict how far lava flows will travel on our own planet!Gaddis tells us about lunar volcanoes. She shows a picture of a sinuous rille on the Moon. A few decades ago, some people speculated that such rilles were produced by water, but Gaddis explains that they are now known to have been carved by lava. And she says that volcanoes on the Moon range from about 4.3 billion years old (since the formation of the lunar crust) to 3 billion years old. There hasn't been any volcanic activity on the moon in the past billion years or so.Sakamoto and Crisp then have sections on Martian volcanoes. Besides an overview, we get a detailed discussion of what Mars Pathfinder discovered from the Martian surface.Lopes (who is almost literally the girl from Ipanema) has a fascinating section on the Io volcanoes observed by the Voyager and Galileo missions. She is now working on the Cassini Mission, where she is getting a chance to investigate calderas and cryovolcanism on Titan. I think we'll need a new edition to tell us about this!Procter's section is on ice volcanism. She shows us evidence of cryoclastic eruptions on Europa and on other moons of major planets. The most interesting part is the discussion of the \\"cantaloupe terrain\\" of Triton.Well, what do volcanoes produce? Um, ash! And Chapman and Larsen tell us plenty about it. Larsen is an expert in tephrachronology, and she knows all about the varied ages and types of ash deposits in Iceland. This detailed knowledge is used by the authors to draw conclusions about volcanic deposits on Mars (Chapman's specialty).The book concludes with a chapter by Kieffer. She begins with the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. She contrasts these geyser eruptions with volcanic plumes on Mars, Io, and Mount Saint Helens. And from here, she makes analogies with volcanism on Triton and Titan.Volcanoes are very interesting. But one can see that it takes hard work and talent to do work in this field. In my opinion, there is one other requirement, namely courage. Volcanoes are dangerous! In any case, let me express my sincere admiration for all the authors in producing this fine book."},{"Title":"Volcanic Worlds: Exploring The Solar System's Volcanoes (Springer Praxis Books / Geophysical Sciences)","review":"This is a great book for everyone interested in volcanoes. It is very readable and talks not only about the science but also how the researchers do the science - with some very charming stories. It is really amazing that all chapters are written by female experts. We hear a lot about the lack of women scientists but there seems to be no lack of women studying volcanoes! A great book to give as a gift to a high school or college age daughter or niece."},{"Title":"Volcanic Worlds: Exploring The Solar System's Volcanoes (Springer Praxis Books / Geophysical Sciences)","review":"Despite being presented for the community of professional astronomers, this book is fascinating and essential for anyone interested in geologic phenomena around our solar system. Thanks to recent discoveries by the various spacecrafts that have been sent to the furthest reaches of the solar system, plus steadily improving earthbound observations, we can see that volcanoes are very common on other worlds and also offer a great amount of variety in their structures and behaviors. This book is composed of chapters written by various planetary geologists, starting out with volcanoes right here on Earth, in order to establish basic knowledge on volcanic processes. We then learn about the volcanoes of Venus and Mars, plus several of the solid moons of the giant outer planets. Most interesting are two of Jupiter's moons, the hot-headed sulfur-spitting Io, and the watery and possibly life-supporting Europa. For the interested layperson, note that there are some readability issues with this book. It was written by scientists for scientists, so the prose is not exactly compelling, and a glossary (or at least better explanations of the many obscure scientific terms and jargon) sure would be helpful. Meanwhile, there is a vague feminist slant to this book because all of the chapters were submitted by women scientists, but fortunately this only applies to some of the introductions, and in any case this concept can be dismissed as inconsequential. That's because anyone is capable of teaching us about these fascinating aspects of nearby worlds.

This book was my first exposure to the Norman Conquest, but from an English point of view, and I re-read it once or twice in the next few years. Just recently, I picked it up again to see if it was as good as I remembered, and it stood up well. There are now many more sources of historical record regarding the Norman Conquest that are not weighted with the natural prejuicide of the conquerors (example: David Howarth's 1066 - The Year of the Conquest), but at the time, R.

On the contrary, the multiple story threads are well paced between each other so as one does not get lost in the overall story direction and forget about certain characters or situations like other novels are known to do.Here we find ex-cop Kerney just months after his role in 'Tularosa' just making ends meet as a temp park ranger for the forest service investigating a recent string of animal poaching. It just so happens that two Mexicans (a grandson and grandfather) find themselves in the wrong place and the wrong time, and one of them gets murdered, Kerney finds himself as part of the investigations.Enter his new pseudo partner, a young Jim Stiles, all too eager to impress Kerney and his superiors and ends up getting shot at, but by who? Kerney is impressed by this young mans detective skills, but realizes that he himself was the target.Omar Gatewood, the local sheriff is more a politician than a cop, and proves to be inept at the worst times, or does he have a master plan?A family feud between ranchers Edgar and Eugene Cox has kept the twin brothers from speaking to each other in over sixty years, but when a note is delivered to Edgar he breaks the silence to confront his oppressive and abusive crippled brother. Why did Eugene's wife disapear all those years ago?Karen Cox returns to her roots as the new local ADA, and takes notice of the strong and silent Kerney. She likes him, but has to work with him, and how does she deal with her fathers lie, and ensuing family feud. And how does her current case and the assassination attempt on Kerney fit into all this?The positive aspect of introducing a new female interest for Kerney is that the author really does not push it. In Tularosa, Kerney was smitten by Sara who left at the end, and the author realizes that a new woman can't pick up the pieces immediately, but develops Karen for future novels.The only problems I had with this novel, keeping it from five stars, was the authors constant, almost unending reminders that Kerney has a bad knee suffered from an injury years back. Okay, I got it...knee hurt. Also Jim Stiles girlfriend Molly's dialogue seemed a bit...fake. I believed in all the characters in this novel except Molly...she seemed to stick out like a displaced soap star...thank God she was only a minor part of the novel and does not detract from any one else.Other than those two quirks, I believe that Mexican Hat was an excellent adventure that had me guessing for quite a bit on how all these threads would weave together and I was happy with the end result. I will be reading future installments."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"Kevin Kerney is back in McGarrity's second novel in this well-written series. Kerney is now a seasonal forest ranger in New Mexico's Gila Wilderness. A Mexican tourist is murdered, and his senile grandfather wandering around the area; seems, too, like there are some poachers in the area. Add to this a sixty-year old family feud, a lovely ADA, and a great partner (Jim Stiles), and Kerney is off and running in trying to find murderers, poacheers, and the harvesting of rare animals for illegal sales. As in TULAROSA, the plot is thick and juicy, and Kerney once again the penultimate hero. A great read in this wonderfully engaging series."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"I picked up Mexican Hat in the San Juan airport because I had time to kill. It turned out to be a wise choice. It was like reading a good Western movie. McGarrity paints wonderful word pictures, especially for someone like me who has never been out west. The plot twists kept me going and the minimal profanity was a breath of fresh air. Thanks, McGarrity, for a clean book that was fun."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"Kevin Kerney is a former chief of detectives of in a major southwest city. He was seriously wounded and retired with a bad knee. He has taken a summer job as a park ranger in New Mexico's Gila Wilderness. A rancher finds a poached black bear,a Mexican man is killed, and an elderly man found in a cave. Kevin Kerney is pushed aside by his superiors in the investigations. He keeps investigating with the help of other intelligent rangers and a divorced district attorney,Karen Cox. More people are wounded,a couger is killed, and Kevin's home is blown up. Karen Cox's family is part of the mystery, many family secrets abound. The pace is fast,the action believable and the characters engrossing. The scenic descriptions are vivid. The plot plausible. I enjoyed the story and now must read the other books by Mr. Mc Garrity."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"I really enjoyed this second book of the Kerney series. To me, it was much better than the 1st (Tularusa). This book was about family secrets, militia organization, pouching in the remote areas of New Mexico. I really like the Kerney character McGarrity has created. The guy is tough and relentless but he also has a good heart. I also like the choice of settting. I am not that familiar with that part of the country. I find myself going to mapquest and locating areas mentioned in the book. Can't wait to read book #3."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"I don't want to say more about this book, all I want to say is that when I turned over to the last page and finished this book, I was kinda smiling and happy for Kerney, although his situation in most part of this book was miserable and tough. Mr. McGarrity, please, more and quicker!!! Just hope your Muse won't be drained up or withered away too soon. God bless."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"Finally, we have a writer that gives you the flavor of Hillerman with the smoothness of Cussler. A very enjoyable read. From time to time I live in the area and McGarrity is right on with his portrayal of the people and beautiful settings of the New Mexico southwest. McGarrity knows how to bring forth the story in an enjoyable and believable plot. Lets hear more from Kerney"},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"After the blood and gore of McGarrity's first Kerney novel, Tularossa, this is a much improved second effort.Kerney is now a seasonal ranger who quickly realizes all is not right when a young, well-to-do Mexican is killed in a forest meadow. His inquiring mind leads to poachers, land grabs, militias and family secrets.McGarrity provides Kerney with some solid, if a bit two-dimensional, supporting characters -- sexy assistant district attorney, want-to-be a cop assistant and lots of crusty ranch types. Still it is the imagery of the Gila mountains and the desert surrounded highways that is lingering days after I finished this book.Bottom-line: Excellent sense of place, good plot and players."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"Kevin Kerney, once a well-regarded police detective, has retired from police after a serious injury. Now, he works a seasonal ranger saving up for his dream-buying and running a small ranch.However, his investigating days are far from over. A series of big-game poaching put him in conflict with more senior Park Service staff, until a murder of a Mexican tourist take precedence in the investigation.This is a colorful mystery, full of likable characters and the New Mexican nature; with the taste of conflict between ranching and environmentalism, as well as old greed; and even some unobtrusive romance.Kerney and his friends are well-described, although the villains are rather shallow. The old mysteries are somewhat predictable, but the investigation holds much suspense and danger.The resolution is satisfying, and the only (minor) flaw one finds in this enjoyable book is the switching between multiple viewpoints.--inotherworlds.com"},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"The second entry in this series shows that intimate knowledge of your subject, skillful writing, and a fine sense of place and history, can hook and entertain a reader.

After reading over 100 pages, I had to put it down. Also, the author is given praise for his varied background that is supposed to make the book more authentic. Well, he has never been around horses. His accounts of the main character and others pulling stallions out of a herd of horses jumped out at me. Is he serious? I read a lot of books, several a week, besides work related books and I look for new authors, they need support and they need for people to give them a chance. This author is going to have to try harder if he wants me to buy another of his books."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"What we have here is one heck of a plot, one that is populated by a few really good &quot;good guys&quot; and a whole bunch of really bad &quot;bad guys.&quot; In the middle are an even greater number of folks who are question marks. You don't know just where they stand until late in the book.The plot is really two plots that mesh neatly at several points.Plot A involves a gang of poachers of exotic animals who harvest various animal organs to sell in the Oriental marketplace as aphrodisiacs and curatives. One young man who fits neatly into plot B (described next), is murdered when he accidentally comes across a poacher from plot A harvesting organs from an illegally killed animal.Plot B is the more complex of the two. It traces its beginnings to a murder that took place over 50 years ago. The murder victim from out of the past was a Hispanic landowner and the young man killed by the poacher is a present generation relative of this landowner. Somehow this old death and a feud between two brothers, dating back to the same time frame, are related.Now, let's talk about good guys, bad guys, and question marks.Good guys: Our first good guy is Kevin Kerney, a former Santa Fe Detective who has been retired because of crippling wounds received on his last Santa Fe case. He is now working as a part time employee of the Forest Service and has been dispatched to investigate reports of an illegally killed bear. On this investigation, he teams up with our second good guy, Jim Stiles, a young New Mexico Game and Fish Officer. During this investigation, they find the body of the young man murdered by the poacher. In the ensuing investigation of the murder thay team up with the third good guy. (Can you call a woman a good guy?) She is Karen Cox, an Assistant District Attorney who is also the daughter of Edgar Cox, one of the feuding brothers.Now let's take a look at the bad guys: First there's Eugene Cox, the other feuding brother, paralyzed from the waist down, he's one really nasty bad guy. All of the poachers are bad guys who are willing to murder at any time. Then there are the members of a particularly violent paramilitary militia group who consider all federal agents, Forestry Service Department Personnel, and all environmentalists to be fair game. They don't mind killing either.Now for the guys in the grey area. For starters we have Sheriff Omar Gatewood who is either incredibly stupid, or incredibly evil, or both. Now we have Karen's father, Edgar Cox, the other feuding brother who is hiding some very old secret that might make him a member of either camp. Then there's Phillip Cox, Eugene's son and Karen's cousin. He's not a very nice person, but he, too, could be in either camp. There are a number of construction workers, ranchers, Sheriff's Deputies and a Judge who might be good and might not. Playing &quot;Who can you trust?&quot; is part of Kerney's dilemna.During Kerney's investigations there are two serious attempts made to kill him. He is not sure by whom, or why.Okay, you get the picture. A trio of white hats against a whole bunch of black hats with no knowledge of who else might be friend or foe. There's a lot of suspense here, a lot of heroics, and, I'm afraid, a few too many lucky coincidences.All in all, I think that MEXICAN HAT is well written with a trio of protagonists that I can really care about. It provides several hours of pleasant escape reading."},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"The extremely likable Kevin Kerney, former Santa Fe Chief of Detectives, was a rising star in the police force until a bullet shattered his knee &amp; put him out to pasture.

I am also a resident of Catron County, New Mexico and retired from a careers in law enforcement, military special operations, and university professorship in criminology and forensics. I was prepared to thoroughly enjoy my first read of Michael McGarrity as I am always interested in trying new authors of western fiction. I was very disappointed not only in the word craft but in the quality of plot and the very blatant support of authoritarian and police state attitudes advanced by the author's protagonist, Kevin Kearney. The book was not intended to be read as a political piece, nonetheless, the subtext messages in the book were clear.I am of the opinion that the hero of the book, medically retired Santa Fe Police Detective Kevin Kearney, represents the real time attitudes and police procedural philosophies of the author Michael McGarrity. Kearny fawns over the New Mexico State Police - an organization that is not well respected within the law enforcement community for either their sophistication or professionalism, and who look and often act like the Gestapo. Kearny offers unabashed support for federal law enforcement personnel, particularly the Forest Service, and seems to think that whatever law enforcement does, it can be justified, no matter the insults to the Constitution. He represents local law enforcement, particularly the office of the sheriff of Catron County to be nothing but corrupt, bumbling fools and worse.Now, I understand that this is just a story, but there is a thread that binds the story together which reflects the general contempt of the protagonists for rural citizens and a sycophantic support of the coercive apparatus of the state. I will be the first to admit that many of the real citizens of Catron County are the most parochial, provincial and petty people I have ever encountered in rural settings. There is a pathetic lack of education, work ethic, sophistication of world view, and, in many cases, basic integrity. There are a disproportionate number of folks on welfare who demonstrate a committed dedication to avoiding work at any cost. On the other hand, there are some of the nicest, hardest working, honest and most helpful folks I have met in my travels throughout the West. I could not ask for better neighbors.The book is mildly entertaining at times and the plot is interesting but presented in a very single dimensional format certainly not on a par with the talents of Patricia Cornwell or Michael Connoly. The bad guys are clumsily evil, and law enforcement personnel are presented as paragons of intellectual and physical superiority and virtue. The academic data of this honorable, blue collar occupation presents a very different picture. The citizens are all village idiots and are not to be trusted with firearms or information.Having worked as a ride-for-wages cowboy and horse trainer, and as a horse mounted law enforcement ranger for federal land management agencies, I found McGarrity's descriptions of the \\"stallions\\" kept by the Forest Service to be ludicrous. Very few folks use or keep stallions for any purpose except breeding. In another instance, which I might be misreading, New Mexico State Game Warden Stiles unhooks the horse trailer and lowers the tongue of the horse trailer to the ground. I was amazed. The guy would have to be Conan in physical strength. Most horse trailers have tandem axles and a front tongue wheel for support due to their weight.The contempt which McGarrity seems to hold of the views of citizens that oppose the excesses of the federal government as it drives loggers, miners and ranchers off of public land and essentially locks the public out of public lands is distressing and sounds like the propaganda of the various extremist environmental activists.The use of local history by McGarrity is very interesting and his stated appreciation for the beauty of the rough and rugged land that comprises the 7000 square miles of Catron County is admirable. However, his descriptions of the country lack the thorough though often tedious detail of Zane Gray, and they also lack the ability to capture the grandeur and beauty of wild and rough country as offered by Louis L'Amore and Edward Abbey. One gets the impression, perhaps false, that he is a \\"roadside tourist\\" and does not personally know the realities of backcountry travel and the view of such country from between the ears of a horse. His descriptive title of the fictional book \\"The People of Pie Town: The Last of the Frontier Homesteaders\\" is based on a book published by a local author but his use of the term \\"Frontier Homesteaders\\" demonstrates a lack of understanding of the term and does not account for the bitter rivalries which occurred in this part of western New Mexico between the sheepmen, cattle ranchers and the sodbusting dustbowl bean farmers.The romantic interests were boring and had the breath of modern feminism. With the exception of the character of Margaret Cox, none of the women in the story exhibited either the strength or the feminine grace once so commonly found in the women of Western cow country.Stories, even fiction, shape our perceptions and attitudes of people, groups, places, and events. The perceptions put forth by Mr. McGarrity do a disservice to all of the people, groups and places he seeks to portray. His hero, Kevin Kearny, is not representative of what we want in a law enforcement officer. He commits felonies and justifies them as a necessity to bring the guilty to justice. This is the basic formula for a police state. The language of morality has always been the language of justification and most of the world's evils have been perpetrated by just such rationales.I might recommend this book to my University students taking a course on Law Enforcement Ethics just as I would urge them to watch reruns of \\"NYPD Blue\\" and to compile a list of the Constitutional violations committed by law enforcement in the name of justice. As a read graded for its literary qualities of plot and wordcraft, I would assign it a grade of C-.[...]"},{"Title":"Mexican Hat","review":"I found myself looking forward to bedtime so I could continue reading about the (mis)adventures of Kevin Kerney.

With a bum knee and half a stomach, life is edgy for him no matter what he decides to do. Having lost his family ranch to the military, he takes a job as a seasonal employee of the US Forestry Service in the back end of nowhere New Mexico.You know that there's going to be a mystery somewhere relating to the loss of ancestral lands by an hispanic family to the US Government during the Depression. Murder, mayhem and some so-called Patriotic Militia. The Militia issue tends to date the book, with a lot of angry yahoos! pissed at government interference in uses of land for mining, logging and grazing.Once again, Kerney is involved with a woman (Sara from Tularosa has been shipped to Korea) and gets rapped up in her old family feud. Her father and his twin brother haven't spoken in sixty years, and she's just moved home from Albuquerque with her two children (a girl and a fiesty little boy) and become the new ADA for her home county. All this is a little flat and too two-dimensional (did I mention her mom has breast cancer) to be good reading.But McGarrity still seems to pull of an interesting story that doesn't defy logic or reality.

And there was a romance, which might have added depth, but the romance was pretty inexplicable--the 30-year-old heroine sees a guy with white hair and immediately has the hots for him.My biggest problem, though, was the tone of the story. It felt like the first-person narrator was on valium or something, or that she was bored by the story. There was a distinct lack of feeling, even in dangerous or romantic scenes."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This the the third Aurora Teagarden mystery by Charlaine Harris I've read. After inheiriting big bucks from a deceased acquaintance, Roe quits her job at the library and joins her mother's realty company at least for a little while, to see if it's something she enjoys. Unfortunately in one of the houses she shows, the corpse of another realtor is found bound to a bed. Who is the murderer? Shortly thereafter another body of yet another realtor is found. Per usual, Roe has a hard time keeping her nose out of it. Add in a new, older businessman (new in town) as a love at first sight romantic interest and Roe certainly has her hands full. The last 1/4 of the book is the most interesting. There was several little suprises that grabbed my interest more than anything up to that point. I didn't think I cared for her new man Martin, until this point and I still am not crazy about him. Maybe he will grow on me. This brings me to a pet peeve I have about this series. In the first book \\"Real Murders\\" I thought it extrememely cute when Aurora noticed that she had never had a man interested in her and suddenly she had two. By book two gone were the previous two suitors and suddenly she had a new preacher boyfriend. Now in book 3 she has yet another man. So for the majority of her life she never had a man find her attractive and suddenly in the span of three books she has attracted a minimum of four men? What kind of love potion is the chick taking? Rather unbelievable, I say. Another problem I have and the reason for the three star rating is because I just don't care about these characters. Aurora is boring and bland, so is her mother, so are all the other realtors, so are her men, so are the victims, and even the suspects. No one ever has had a real motive for the killings up through this book. The whole town is darn bland. It pains me to say that because Charlaine Harris is up in my favorite top two or three authors. She has changed the entire type of books I read and collect due to her Sookie series. I love Charlaine and I love mysteries. Why can't I love these books? It makes little sense to me but its true. I don't mind this book, it killed some time, but the whole time I thought about my TBR stack and couldn't wait to read something else in it. \\"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse\\" is not a winner but is not really a loser either. Its just Bland."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This is the third book in the Aurora Teagarden series. Aurora, known as Roe to her friends, is happy and thriving in the small town outside of Atlanta where she has lived all of her life except for college. Independently \\"comfortable\\" since an inheritance from a friend, Roe is trying out real estate as a possible new career. Unfortunately, while showing a house to a client, she finds a body in the bed of the master bedroom.All the small town chatter could be trite in lesser hands, but in Harris's writing, it reminded me of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and her belief that anything is possible in a small town. In many series, the secondary characters appear only to disappear and never recur. In this series, you find yourself getting to know the locals and their foibles.I enjoy this series and look forward to more in the series. Charlaine Harris is a talented writer with multiple series. While I find her vampire series not to my taste, I thoroughly enjoy her other books."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (1994) is the third mystery novel in the Aurora Teagarden series, followingA Bone to Pick. In the previous volume, Roe spent the night in Jane's house. She awoke in the night to find that someone was searching the house.Roe called for help and they subdued the intruder. The intruder confessed to the killings. Then Roe put the skull with the other body.In this novel, Aurora Teagarden was born and raised in the small town of Lawrenceton, Georgia, in the suburbs of Atlanta. She is the child of Aida. Roe used to work at the local libray, but quit after inheriting the estate of Jane Engle.Aida Brattle Teagarden Queensland is Roe's mother. She owns Select Realty, a very successful real estate firm. She is now married to John Queensland, who has two sons by his previous marriage.Martin Bartell is manager of the local Pan-Am Agra plant. Martin was born and raised in Corinth, Ohio, and served in combat as a Marine at the end of the Vietnam War.In this story, Roe is thinking about getting her realtor's license. She tags along with her mother and learns a bit more about the real estate trade. She is waiting with Aida for a closing, but the clients are late and Aida has an appointment to show the Anderton house.Aida decides that Roe can escort two clients around the house. Since Roe doesn't have the license, Aida warns her to not show the house per se. Roe agrees to unlock the door and mention the points on the fact sheet. She thinks that not showing the house will be less boring than watching her mother signing all the closing paperwork.Roe is standing outside the door as a white Mercedes arrives. When she sees the client, Roe is almost overcome with lust. She carefully avoids his eyes and takes the clients inside.Martin has come with his sister Barbara. His sister thinks that Aurora is a funny name, but asks Roe to call her Barby. Roe shows them the downstairs and then takes them up the grand staircase to the master bedroom. When she pulls the doors open, Barby shrieks loudly.Roe then looks into the bedroom and sees a body propped up on the pillow. Her mother appears and identifies the victim as Tonia Lee Greenhouse, another realtor. Martin checks for signs of life, but Tonia is definitely dead. From the looks of her throat, she has been strangled.Aida goes to call the police. Naturally, Detective Sergeant Jack Burns heads the homicide team. After a thorough interrogation, Martin decides that Barby needs to leave and Aida also departs with Roe.Somehow the key to the Anderton house mysteriously returns to the key board at Select Realty. The police take Mackie Knight -- a Select Realty employee -- in for questioning, but the black man has a very good alibi and they soon let him go.Meanwhile, Roe has a date with Martin and they spend the night in a motel room outside Atlanta. They both are head over heels in lust. Roe feels afraid of him because he affects her so much.Luckily for Roe, her former beau has found someone else to occupy his attention. Martin kisses her in public and establishes his claim. He even openly attends a function with her.This tale exposes many of the foibles and quirks of the local real estate trade. Several small items have been stolen from homes for sale. And then there is the House Hunter.Roe decides that she is not interested in selling real estate. But the next installment --The Julius House-- has her buying a house. Read and enjoy!Highly recommended for Harris fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of coldblooded murder, realtor secrets, and highly curious women. For anyone unfamiliar with this series, the initial volume isReal Murders.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This is my second mystery by this author in this series and I liked it as well as the first. Harris does a great job of making you feel like you're right there in this small town in Georgia (I think Lawrenceton was modeled after Covington). Detective-character Roe Teagarden, formerly a librarian, is now a lady of leisure, since she unexpectedly inherited quite a bit of money. She's looking around trying to find herself, and is trying out being a real estate agent in her mother's firm. Just as she's deciding this is really not for her, she discovers a body in a house that she's showing. When another body is found in an empty house, people begin to wonder if someone is going around killing real estate agents.The plotting was good and I was a bit surprised at the killer. But mostly I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of this small town and interesting inhabitants."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"I enjoyed Book One of this series, not Book Two, but this one, Book THREE, is a winner. Charlaine Harris has demonstrated in all of her series that she is a reader's writer. She creates interesting characters, engaging plots, and keeps things moving.These are cozies, friends, so don't be so critical. That said, this story surpassed what I usually find in cozies. No silliness here, just believable situations and people you care about. Roe really evolves in this story and gets a heated little romance going. I don't usually like romance in mysteries, but this one is fascinating. Harris has demonstrated in other series that she has a flair for describing romance. She is particularly adept in this series at describing the relationships so you have no misconceptions, but you are not provided with so many details that the book deserves an X rating. She did that in another series, and it was disturbing. Yet, she doesn't wallow in the details here to the detriment of the story. However, I look forward to seeing her gentleman friend again.The plot is believable. Another reviewer said the murders were silly, but stranger things have happened. Years ago I read a story of a car salesman kidnapped during a test ride. He was later found shot and tied to a tree. So, it's not such a stretch to think the kind of murders she sets up here could happen. I also found the murderer believable and hadn't guessed. Up to the last few pages, I didn't know, and she threw a curve near the end.I also think the story was tight. She closed all the holes and tied up all loose ends. She also introduced some tantalizing possibilities. I am glad to see that more books for this series are in the hopper. I hope she maintains the quality.I must say that I don't enjoy seeing the author's photograph in the book. That always spoils my impression of the protagonists. After seeing the picture, I have trouble imaging the protagonist as she or he is described. Just a quirk of mine. Maybe Ms. Harris will read and take note. :) You take note of her. This is a series you can enjoy."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"Good book to read on the beach or at the end of a hard day. It required little to no thought. The charaters are flat and the ending is obvious, but the story in general is amusing."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"\\"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse\\" does not rank as one of my favorite Roe Teagarden mysteries. The plot was actually pretty silly in my opinion, & the book seemed to center more on Roe's relationship with Martin Bartell. Seeing that I don't particularly like Martin, I struggled to finish this book. I also feel that their relationship is ridiculous to a point."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"After receiving a sizable inheritance from a library patron, Aurora \\"Roe\\" Teagarden quits her job and is helping her mother out at her real estate agency to see if that would interest her as a career. While at the bar waiting for the couple to sign the papers for a house they are buying, Roe's mother sends her to the Anderson abode to show the home to Martin Bartell, the new plant manager of Pan-Am Agra, and his sister.When they get there she takes them into the master bedroom; where to everyone's horror Tonia Lee Green lies dead on the bed. The realtor is cut up and posed in a very lewd position. The police look at the husband because Tonia was constantly cheating on him but his alibi holds up. A second realtor Idella is found murdered in a house for sale and Roe who loves to investigate a mystery starts looking into the murders when she is not being courted by Martin. Roe and Martin fell in love at first sight even though Roe feels he is no stranger to violence and he affirms her belief when she is at the mercy of the killer.This book was published fourteen years ago but remains a refreshing original regional cozy whose heroine won the hearts of the reader. This engaging southern cozy stands the test of time. Charlaine Harris scribes a well constructed mystery with a bit of romance to produce a memorable work.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This was one of the worst mysteries I've ever read. The writing was sloppy, the story bland, and the romance unrealistic. And without reading too closely, I caught two errors that an editor obviously neglected to correct. Ms. Harris refers twice to fixing a female cat as &quot;neutering&quot; and later in the book she sets a party up to begin, in one conversation, at 6:30 and in the next chapter at 7:30. This is a huge mistake in a mystery story! It leads the reader to expect something will happen as a result of someone getting the time of the party wrong. But it was just sloppy writing. Do yourself a favor and avoid Ms. Harris's novels."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"Aurora Teagarden returns in the 3rd book in the hilarious mystery series. Aurora is a short, respectible, 30-something single female in the small town of Lawrenceton. She used to work at the library until she unexpectedly inherited a fortune from a friend. Now she is footloose and fancy free with no job to tie her down, no boyfriend (due to a recent break up) and no money problems. Too bad that she is bored to death. Aurora decides that she needs something to do, so she starts learning about the real estate business from her mother, the best real estate agent in town. When her mother asks her to go and open up an expensive home so that her wealthy new clients can take a look, Roe is agreeable and cheerfully sets off to show the home to the best of her ability. Within an hour she has decided that the real estate business isn't for her, that the new guy in town, although quite a bit older is really hot and there is definitely some attraction there, and that, no matter how trashy in real life, no one deserves to be murdered and put on display in an empty house for someone to find. When her friend's husband is accused of being the murderer, Roe feels that she has to intervene and find out what really happened. Along the way she has to deal with her completely physical reaction to a gorgeous, wealthy older man, a cantankerous cat, shopping for a new home, and a disgruntled ex-employee of her new boyfriend who has started stalking her. You know, the usual problems...I thought that Three Bedrooms, One Corpse was quite entertaining and finished it in one sitting. Charlaine Harris is a very talented author and, while there may have been a few small errors (which I didn't notice because I was too caught up in the story), she has a very smooth writing style that allows you to be amused and informed at the same time. The plot moves quickly and there are several subplots that keep the reader involved with the characters. Although I still enjoyed the Lily Bard/Shakespeare series and the Southern Vampire series more, I have grown quite fond of Aurora Teagarden and know that I will pick up anything that Charlaine Harris cares to write. At the cheap price that these books are available for, why not treat yourself?"},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This author is a real &quot;find&quot;. It's great to stumble across an author who really manages to balance humour, plot and character development. I'm looking forward to reading more of these books because Ms. Harris obviously intends for her characters personal relationships to change and develop. Hope she writes more (and soon)"},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This series is definitely not a keeper but can be a mildly entertaining read. My biggest gripes about this book are the same for all in the series so far.One: Aurora's interactions with the other characters is my favorite part of these books, and what I enjoy about a good series in general. In this series she seems to find great chemistry with one guy, is seemingly falling in love, and then all of a sudden by the next book she is with the OTHER guy (the one you didn't like all that much and is obviously wrong for her.) In this latest installment the \\"love at first sight\\" is simply not believable to me... Martin is not very fleshed out as a character and now all of the sudden he is the ONE? What happened to Robin? Harris never goes into this in detail, which is annoying, and leaves the reader vaguely unsatisfied.Two: Aurora is just not that great a character! Kind of dumb and never learns from her mistakes. She hasn't the charm of Sookie nor the depth of Harper. She is the dumb blond in the horror movie who decides to investigate the noise in the scary motel room while the audience heckles and throws popcorn at the screen :(In short get this series from the library."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"In this 3rd. book of the series, Aurora Teagarden has quit her job as a librarian and decides to try her hand at her mother's real estate business. In the very first house she goes to with a client, she discovers a dead body. The deceased is a rival real estate agent who was reputed to have numerous extra-marital affairs. There are many suspects--jealous husband, rival realtors, spurned lovers, but Roe is the one who uses an obscure clue to track down the murderer. Also in this book, she meets and falls in love with Martin Bartell, a wealthy older man who is the manager of a large company. His attraction to Roe seems unlikely, but their relationship proceeds very rapidly, if unbelievably throughout this book."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"\\"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse\\" by Charlaine Harris is the third book in her series about Aurora Teagarden. (FollowsReal Murders: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery, Bk. 1andA Bone To Pick: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery, Book 2) The story begins with Aurora aka Roe showing a house to Martin Bartell and his sister Barby who are interested in moving nearby. Everything is going swimmingly, well if you ignore the attraction between Martin Bartell and herself, until she opens one of the bedroom doors and finds a dead body.The dead woman was also a realtor, and had been showing the house the day before. But with the key to the house put back in the office, it points to a fellow realtor being the murderer. Roe is determined to get to the bottom of this, and deal with the attraction between Martin and herself in the meantime (while still dating Aubrey).I fully recommend this book. I did figure out who was the murderer before Roe did, unlike the previous two that I read. Don't forget to check out the rest in this series. Next isThe Julius House: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery, Bk. 4, followed byDead Over Heels: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery, Bk. 5,Fool And His Honey: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery, Bk. 6,Last Scene Alive (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries), andPoppy Done To Death: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery, Bk. 8.Or if you'd like to try a different series by Charlaine Harris, check out the Lily Bard mysteries.(Shakespeare's Landlord (The First Lily Bard Mystery), \\"Shakespeare's Champion\\", Shakespeare's Christmas\\", \\"Shakespeare's Trollop\\", and Shakespeare's Counselor\\")Or her new supernatural Southern Vampire Mysteries (Dead Until Dark (Southern Vampire Mysteries, Bk. 1), \\"Living Dead in Dallas\\", \\"Club Dead\\", \\"Dead to the World\\", \\"Dead as a Doornail\\", \\"Definitely Dead\\", and \\"All Together Dead\\")"},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"When you love or admire someone, it's easier to forgive them. Not that Charlaine Harris, is looking for my forgiveness, but nevertheless, I forgive her. This book isn't bad but it's not one of her best.Since Roe had inherited some money, she was able to quit her job as librarian and is now testing the waters to see if she wants to go into the real estate business. Luckily, her Lauren Bacall resembling mother is the owner of the most successful real estate business in the town of Lawrenceton (almost a suburb of Atlanta). Upon showing a house to the hunky, distinguished and brand new-to-town, Martin Bartell and his sister, a corpse is found in one of the bedrooms and heavens, it's the body of trampy Tonia Lee, another real estate agent from a rival agency. The mystery here is almost secondary; much more time is spent on the newly developing quite passionate relationship with Martin. This book has its moments of fun but more reminds me of taking a ride with a friend whom you really wanted to spend time with yet doing nothing but sit in the car while she runs her errands."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"I started reading the Charlene Harris Sookie Stackhous series and totally enjoyed her style of writing. So I decided to try another one of her series. So far out of the Aurora Teagarden series, Three Bedrooms, One Corpse is my favorite. This series is something a parent could have a 12 to 13 year old read with out worring about the content.I find her books funny, relaxing and easy to read."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"A great book for the beach or vacation, perhaps even for a long soak in the tub. The writing requires no extra brain power and the main character, Roe, is an interesting person. It tickled me the way Roe was such a mystery book fanatic. She seems to have books scatered throughout her house, as well as her purse. Whipping out a paperback even if she was only standing in line at the checkout counter. The story was short, the action moved quickly, but the who-done-it was extremely easy to predict."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"I was a little disappointed in this Aurora Teagarden mystery. Little time was spent on the actual mystery because most of the story centered on Aurora's love life. It was nice to see the main character \\"fleshed out\\" a bit more, but not at the expense of time spent on the mystery.I look forward to reading the next book in the series and hope it will be on par with the first two."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"If you haven't picked up the Aurora Teagarden series - you should!

It is light, funny, and keeps you guessing."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"The more I read of Charlaine Harris's books, the more I learn about life in small towns, and this book is no exception. I wish the seeding had been a little more blatant this time, since it felt very Agatha-Christie-like (and the scene at the realty conference as well as what Roe did after that was writer-pushing-story instead of character-pushing-story, IMHO), but I will make allowances.Point-of-note: Aurora Teagarden has far too many beaus for this to be realistic in any way, shape, or form. Just saying.What I wish had been in this book: more real estate stuff. However, this is a cozy mystery, not a real-estate howto."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"This is my least favorite series by Harris. I started out trying to give Roe a chance, but at this point I'm only still reading them because they've got to get better or the series would have ended by now. For a character that's supposed to be intelligent, Roe just isn't. Her love life is too ridiculous to care about, and you're not given enough information about the secondary characters to even wonder who the bad guy is. It's not to say the stories aren't mildly entertaining, but the revelations are so anticlimactic that if the books were any longer it just wouldn't be worth the time it took to get through them."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"A better than average cozy mystery series: Aurora Teagarden Mysteries. This is the third in the series. Aurora (Roe for short) is assisting her mother in the real estate office. Upon unlocking a home for Martin Bartell and his sister - they discover a \\"dead realtor\\" in the upstairs bedroom. Roe is very attracted to Martin and he seems to like her alot, too. Of course, Roe is trying to uncover who committed the murderer. Good Fast Read."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"I have to say that this book was the most bothersome of the first three, but it's time the series went a little darker, considering its genre. The book is about Roe's five minute delve into the real estate industry (her mom's already a successful agent). Roe finds a dead body in a house, and when the body count keeps climbing, Roe solves the mystery to keep her and her fellow co-workers safe. This is the book where Martin is introduced, and their relationship is nice and sexy. This book is worth the read, of course, and necessary to continue to series for true fans of Harris."},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"After havin fallen in love with Harri's vampire books, I found she can also write a wonderful straight who-dun-it.

This time she finds a body of a saleswoman in a house she is showing to an enigmatic and sexy client.I think I like this book more than the previous ones because it seems Charlaine Harris has finally found that little something that makes her books addictive. And this \\"something\\" is certainly sexual attraction between her characters. She does a great job describing intereactions between Roe and Martin in this book. Although I have to mention, Charlaine still avoids bedroom scenes that are a huge part of the success of Sookie Stackhouse series, in my opinion.Overall, it is a very entertaining, fun read and I will pick up the next book in the series - \\"Julius House.\\""},{"Title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, Book 3)","review":"Enjoyed reading these books so far.

Her immediate attraction to Martin even while dating the Minister. Their first date is very interesting.

Charlaine Harris' popular mystery series from the 1990s (originally published in hardcover by Walker, Scribner, and St. Martin's with mass market distributiion by Worldwide) is being reprinted by Berkley Prime Crime. I picked up the series with Three Bedrooms one rainy day, kicked back, and started to read. Before long, I felt more like I was relishing a long, juicy letter from a girlfriend than reading a book. Can't wait to dig into Real Murders and A Bone to Pick, the other two works in the series.Harris' light approach to the dark side of mayhem, murder, and real estate games in a small town just outside Atlanta was entertaining, warm, and real; her characters could easily have been my neighbors in my own small town. Aurora (Roe) Teagarden, ex-librarian and current super-sleuth, is one of my new favorite heroines. She manages to deal with life, lovers (old and new), lechers, and Mama with equal parts sugar and spice with a bit of exasperation thrown in for balance.For a weekend at the beach or an evening by the fire, this cozy little mystery is just the release from humdrum reality that you may be looking for.

The readings are up-to-date, the notes are astute, and the mix of law, history and policy is illuminating. Professor O'Connell presents all sides of the many controversies that roil this field. She reprints, for example, two contrasting legal opinions on NATO's bombing of a TV station in Serbia. She even includes near-gibberish such as the State Department's attempt to justify the Panama invasion as an act of self-defense -- which may have been included to warn students about the ethical and intellectual perils of public service. (I work for the State Department.) Perhaps best of all, the length of the book is manageable -- law students weary of 1,000-page casebooks filled with small print will appreciate O'Connell's reader-friendly (and readable) approach. Overall, it's a neat book. Even non-lawyers and non-law students will get a lot out of it.I knocked off one star because there are far too many typos for a $95 book published by a major legal publisher. I knocked off a second star because the discussion of Jus in Bello (Hague/Geneva law) is too patchy and abstract to really immerse students in this complex field. In future editions, O'Connell should give more space to Jus in Bello by shrinking the section on Jus ad Bellum (the rules governing the decision to go to war). Although Jus ad Bellum generates heated political and intellectual disputes, this is mainly because governments twist the law to justify illegal policies, and because policy-oriented law professors conjure up \\"developing\\" customary international law virtually out of nothing. In reality, the rules on Jus ad Bellum can be found in a few articles of the UN Charter and are relatively clear and straightforward.One note: It's clear from O'Connell's published writings that she regarded the invasion of Iraq as illegal. However, this view doesn't come across so strongly in her casebook. O'Connell is a powerful legal thinker; I hope she didn't dodge this controversy in order to boost sales of the book."},{"Title":"Arcturian Songs of the Masters of Light : Arcturian Star Chronicles Volume Four","review":"This is the last of a four volume set, and I'm nearly finished with it.

Each book has a more refined and subtly conveyed message than the previous. The final volume holds to this pattern.Its a very improbable story, her story. However, her personel story is only ancillary. Regardless of whether you believe her assertion of the source, the eloquence of the prose and the spiritual message are incredibly powerful.

Anna had grown up loving the wilderness and the mystic about the ranch and the people that raised her. Tavas was a demanding man, but a fair man and she loved him dearly. So when she found out that Tavas didn't have long to live, she dropped everything and raced home with mixed feelings. She was anxious to see Tavas and spend time with him and hopefully brighten his remaining days, but yet dread filled her at having to see Ivan, Tavas's nephew, once again. He was the reason she had left The Devil's Gate to begin with. Rumors of the Cult of Akerra performing their evil rituals on the ranch are surfacing and it is not helping that some of their cattle are being killed in a sacrificial way. But Anna doesn't believe that the cult is behind this and that someone is doing this to gain control over the ranch. Little does Tavas know that when he passed away and left the ranch to Anna in his will, he put her life in extreme danger. Who can Anna trust? Every time Anna thinks she knows who she can trust something else happens. But one this is for certain, someone is trying to kill her.The book is fast paced, action packed and full of thrills and chills that will keep you on the edge of your seat and hanging in anticipation until the end. Vickie Britton has captured the magic of the remote rustic wilderness and the mystical heritage of the Basque people and their traditions then mixed it beautifully to support the events and characters."},{"Title":"The Devil's Gate","review":"Have you ever read a book and kept saying, 'Don't open that door' but the heroine does anyway. Well, this is the way I felt when I read this book. Anna came home because her adopted uncle was dying. She had no way of knowing that he'd leave The Devil's Gate, his ranch to her. Now it seems as if everyone wants to get rid of Anna. Who should she trust? This book is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Gate","review":"With the death of her long time friend and male role model, Tavas, looming Anna leaves school and heads back home to the Devil's Gate ranch. Once there she has to face not just her fading friend, but also her childhood crush, Ivan and his textbook nasty wife, while she's still not quite over him. Except that things aren't quite as Anna left them at the Devil's Gate. It's been haunted over the summer by the strange ritualistic killings of the livestock.After almost revealing a dark family secret Tavas passes, leaving Devil's Gate to Anna. He also leaves her with a mystery to solve, not to mention leaving her to settle her own issue of the heart.The Devil's Gate mixes many familiar themes; a ranch on the edge of destruction, suspicious and dangerous people afoot, the best friend who loves the girl, the bad boy who never treated her right and many, many secrets that must be discovered before they claim Anna's sanity, or her life.While it reads similarly to older cozy mysteries, like the Nancy Drew books, and features plenty of events to keep the world expanding and solid writing there's also a slow pace to the story. Anna finds herself undeniably drawn to the dark, broody and married Ivan. Even when best friend-for-life Brad asks for a chance to court her Anna seems to spend all her date time brooding over Ivan. Ivan's wife, Colleen, is pointlessly mean and cruel, but Brad keeps falling for her manipulations, even to the point of letting Colleen force herself into their big date to the fair. No one's to be trusted, of course, especially when Colleen shows up dead and just about everyone is hiding something.The romance angle is muddled as Ivan is married and potentially dangerous and Brad is unsafely desperate. But in the end the strings come together and the tension skyrockets. The Devil's Gate is more Murder, She Wrote than fast paced car-chase-and-explosions fare. There's no gore or sex, making this a good tale for readers who shy away from horror and erotica. And the western flavor adds a bit of spice that might be missing from romance or cozy suspense diets."},{"Title":"The Devil's Gate","review":"A very interesting book. It is one of those books that once you start it, it is very dificult to put down. The start of the story is a little slow but that soon changes as the plot thickens. When the father dies a very convoluted outcome makes it dificult to work out just who is who. A very frightning time soon makes one think. Getting near the end a twisted outcome pulls the whole story together to a satisfieing conclusion."},{"Title":"The Devil's Gate","review":"Anna Haspura is home on The Devil's Gate Ranch because Tavis, the man who raised her as a child when her parents died is now dying. Anna grew up with Ivan and Brad on the ranch. They are not blood related but they have known each other all of their lives. Ivan has gotten married but Anna still wants him. She always has and it seems, she always will.Danger and secrets surround the ranch and when Anna become Tavis' heir, things get worse. Something or someone is killing the cattle, is it the mysterious Akerra or devil worshipers? Or something even worse, someone they all know and trust?The Devil's Gate has a good storyline filled with lots of suspense and many secrets. Unfortunately the secrets become abundant and the story goes onto several tangents. The relationship between Anna and Ivan is a bit awkward as well. Ivan is married through most of the book and Anna leads Brad on a bit.

It made me want to go right out on the South Platte River southwest of Denver and start fishing. Mr. Thomas is a good writer who knows how to convey the excitement of fishing. I could identify with some of his stories. At points I found myself thinking: I've been there or done that. The only thing that put me off about this book was the very faint tinge of high-falutinism that comes through. What I mean is I get the feeling that I couldn't afford to go on most of the trips he takes.

He was very versatile. Most painters lock themselves into a painting method and stick with it for awhile. All their paintings during that period of time use the same method. Renoir locked into what he painting and let it determine the method. If he were painting outdoors, he would choose impressionism with an emphasis on people having a good time more so than the outdoor setting. If he were doing a portrait, he would typically choose the older style but with less formality. His chose of method would be similar to a photographer choosing to use black and white film for certain shots and color film for others. Children are very sensitive to their surroundings. Their response can at time be instantaneous. They go with the moment and therefore will appreciate Renoir's similar approach.My favorite painting in the book is Renoir's &quot;Umbrellas&quot;. He let the figures chose the method. He chose impressionism for the more formally attired, and he utilized a more formal method for the less formally dressed woman on errands with her basket.Venezia's illustrations are humorous. His narrative is delightfully entertaining. His approach brings the artist within reach of the young. His embellishment of the variety of surfaces on which the young Renoir chose to draw with chalk is creatively done.The size of the book is perfect for smaller hands. It enables the young to have art within their grasp. Venezia gives the locations of the paintings and as result if the child lives near one of the museums or will be near one on vacation, she/he would be able to see the original.This is the 20th in Venezia's &quot;Getting to know the World's Greatest Artist&quot; series. His series is a wonderful way for the young to be first introduced to the brilliance of artists. He also has a similar series on composers. Venezia's back cover illustration ties back to the subject. &quot;While studying Renoir and the Impressionist movement of the 19th century, Mike was inspired to ...&quot;.The price of the book is well worth paying.

Peter, the office he was appointed to, and the ramifications of the succession of that office as well as the ancient and historical contexts and beliefs attached to that office. Ray knocks this one out of the park. One is left in awe of the Church Christ founded and the amazing love and provision he gave and is giving her. As someone who is currently Protestant, i have a totally new outlook on the historical and spiritual significance and validity of the Chair of Peter. One cannot help but be drawn to the truths found in the ancient church through the Church fathers. While perhaps not agreeing 100% of the time there is no doubt that the See of Peter vested in the Bishop of Rome was the singular point of unity for the first 1500 years of the Church. Of course this doesn't \\"seal he deal\\" for Catholicism's claim but it forces the Protestant and Orthodox alike to take a hard look at history and decide whether our church is THE Church founded by the Lord Jesus. Ray makes an amazingly convincing argument to the negative. The reason I gave this book 4 and not five stars was of course not because of content or argument but because of structure. It's a difficult read because you have to bounce back and forth from narrative to footnotes but anyone who has read Steve's other books is familiar with is style.

The footnotes do contain essential information, but these should have been part of the text. Constantly going from text to footnotes could aggravate one's vertigo. Some extended footnotes are even needlessly repeated such as that dealing with St Augustine on pages 92-93 and again on page 227. The book's information is valuable but the editing job is terrible."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"I highly recommend this book because it's full of histirical proof for what the Catholic Church teaches about Saint Peter and about the Papacy. I have checked some of Mr. Ray's sources, too, and the checked quotations were accurate.Ray often quotes Protestant scholars, who agree with some Catholic teachings, and others who disagree with them. That helps a lot, too, because some Catholic books about apologetics seem not to quote Protestant sources that confirm Catholic beliefs.\\"Upon This Rock\\" includes an extensive bibliography, too.But for me, the book has an annoying feature. Often, a footnote will fill most of a page. So after you read a paragraph or two of bigger print, you need to get most of the page's detail from the small print in the footnote. The book would have been much longer without the footnotes, but I would prefer much normal size print to much tiny print.Buy this book.

However, this book has the oddest \\"style\\" of any book I have ever read. Basically, the book is a list of patristic quotations defending papal primacy. That's fine and useful as far as it goes, but the \\"book\\" part of the book is in the footnotes. Many, many pages are 80% (or more) footnote and 20% (or less) normal text. That makes reading the book a different sort of experience.Beyond that, if you already agree with the Roman Church (as I do) about papal primacy, it's a great patristic reference source. Comprehensive, in fact. But if you are wondering about the doctrine, perhaps because you are considering converting to the Roman Catholic Church, I think you'll be very disappointed.

Ray presents a strong argument for the Roman Catholic position on the primacy of St. Peter and the Papacy.Other reviewers have done a far finer job than I can hope to in review of this book, its message, and its author. I encourage you to scan their remarks if this topic and book interest you. But I will address the prime off-putting remark made by some reviewers - the extensive footnotes the author uses. Given the controversial subject, I consider the objection to extensive footnotes to be off-point. \\"There is little in the history of the Church that has been more heatedly contested than the primacy of Peter and the See of Rome\\" (p. 11). Extensive footnotes *are* needed in this discussion. The author provides them. He does so in a manner that augments and does not detract from his argument. Had he omitted to include extensive footnotes the omission would have undermined the supporting wall of his argument. Case closed.\\"History has a clear and distinct voice, but it does not force itself upon us uninvited. History is prudent and waits quietly to be discovered. Conversely, the ingenious inventions of recent theologians and innovators are loud and demanding, bursting upon our ears and minds, our lives and hearts, demanding our immediate attention and loyalties. The riches of history fall quietly aside as the prattling innovators blast their trumpets and loudly parade their followers through new streets, trampling the knowledge of the ages under their cumulative feet. Here we will allow the voices of the past to speak again - for themselves. And what the reader will find is that the utterances of the past still resound with one voice, with clarity and force\\" (p. 11).Because I am not a scholar trained in this subject, I cannot judge on the impartiality of this book's argument --- an argument that certainly seems to be overwhelming in the affirmative. \\"It would take volumes to deal thoroughly with every biblical passage, every Father's writings, and every argument against the Papacy\\" (p. 18). But this book is a veritable treasury of information on the primacy of Peter. \\"Every list of the twelve apostles in the New Testament has Peter prominently placed at the top of the list, and Judas is placed last... Except for Christ himself, no other person receives nearly as much attention as Simon Peter does through biblical references.... Jesus loved his devotion and courage\\" (p. 23, 26).How is the book organized? \\"Our current study comprises four interrelated topics. The first two sections examine the life and ministry of the Apostle Peter from biblical and historical sources. The last two sections examine the continuing authority of Peter through the centuries, carried on through apostolic succession and the primacy of Rome\\" (p. 17).The breadth of information here is vast. The author's conclusion is stark --- the New Testament, the Church Fathers, and Church history up to the Reformation all *appear* to speak with one loud voice: The primacy of the Holy See is no accident of history nor some man-made political contrivance; rather, it is the declared will of God.\\"[T]he primacy of Rome was established and recognized by the universal Church long before the New Testament canon was closed.... [I]t is less a difficulty that the Papal supremacy was not formally acknowledged in the second century than that there was no formal acknowledgement on the part of the Church of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity till the fourth. No doctrine is defined until it is violated\\" (p. 150).Greatly recommended for anyone with an interest in this topic, along withIf Protestantism is True."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"This is a great book for instruction or review. It traces the position of the Church on the authority of St. Peter. The conclusions in the book are based both on scripture, history and tradition. This book is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"Stephen K. Ray has done an admirable job of putting together this apologetic for the papacy. If someone were not well read in the fathers and in early church history he might even find Ray's case convincing. It is quite simply one of the best defenses of Roman Catholic distinctives that I have seen.Unfortunately the book does have flaws. Part of the problem, for example, is that Ray spends over 100 pages at the beginning of the book defending a proposition that all but the most fanatical anti-Catholics would grant: that Peter ministered and died in Rome. The Orthodox do not deny this fact. Most Protestants do not deny this fact. So what is Ray doing and why? He's softening up the unwary reader by toppling a rather flimsy strawman defended only by radically anti-Catholic fundamentalists. After 100 pages, the unsuspecting reader will be wondering how anybody could be ignorant enough to disagree with Rome's position. So after spending 100 pages defending a view that is almost universally held anyway and getting the reader ready, he jumps right into the really controversial material.The remainder of the book essentially consists of commentary on the writings of early church fathers. (One technical complaint about the formatting - The main text is nothing but quotations from the fathers. All of the commentary is in the footnotes. To follow the argument, the reader must constantly be flipping back and forth between pages. This gets aggravating.) The commentary section is the heart of the book. The problem here, however, is that most (not all) of the evidence provided in this section is dramatically overstated. The evidence from Clement, Ignatius and Hermas, for example, exists more in the mind of the author than in the texts themselves as any cursory study of recent patristic scholarship will show. Numerous assertions are made about these documents without any real supporting arguments.The evidence from later fathers in the book is more of a mixed bag simply because in later centuries, the Bishop of Rome did gradually begin to assert more authority than he originally had, and of course some of the fathers agreed. What Catholic apologists like Ray continue to successfully do is something of a bait and switch tactic which many readers do not catch. They find evidence for Roman primacy in the fathers and then argue that these fathers taught Roman supremacy. Primacy magically becomes supremacy. A primacy of honor as first among equals (which did exist early) is simply not the same thing as a supremacy of jurisdiction (which developed much later). Read Ray with that distinction in mind and watch his hands to see how many times he makes the switch. You'll be surprised.It must also be briefly noted that Ray does a fine job of demonstrating that a number of early fathers interpreted Matthew 16:18 as Rome now does. He fails to mention, however, that Eastern Orthodox scholars and Protestant scholars have also amassed lists of patristic quotations by fathers who did not interpret Matthew 16:18 as Rome now does. There simply is no historical evidence for a consensus of interpretation on that passage. Some interpreted the rock to be Peter. Some interpreted it to be Christ. Some interpreted it to be Peter's faith. The Catholic apologists apparently do not wish their readers to be aware of this easily verifiable fact.My suggestion would be for anyone who has read Ray's book and who thinks it conclusively proves his thesis to also read William La Due's &quot;The Chair of Saint Peter: A History of the Papacy&quot; and some of the works by historian Brian Tierney, especially &quot;Origins of Papal Infallibility: 1150-1350&quot; an absolutely outstanding and exhaustive scholarly study of the origins of the doctrine of papal infallibility in the late 12th century. I would also highly recommend the book &quot;Two Paths: Papal Monarchy or Collegial Tradition&quot; by the Eastern Orthodox author Michael Whelton. Another good Orthodox study of the issue is &quot;The Primacy of Peter&quot; edited by John Meyendorff.Ray presents a good case, but he doesn't present both sides of the case. It's up to those who really desire to know the truth of the matter to check out both sides.Proverbs 18:17"},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"Already in the First Century you see the Church of Rome exercising it's jurisdiction and Vicar of Christ Role with St. Clement's Letter to the Church at Corinth!

As far as Roman Catholic apologetics goes, this book is one of the best and is without a doubt the best Catholic book available defending the papacy. Ray begins his book by discussing the issue of whether Peter ever resided in Rome. Ray begins by analyzing the Bible verse I Peter 5:13 and illustrates how this enigmatic reference to Babylon can only be speaking about Rome. Ray argues for this primarily on two reasons: 1.) Babylon was a code word used for Rome and 2.) there were no recognized and documented Christian settlements in the actual city of Babylon. With this proof established Ray then begins to document references from the Early Church Fathers validating Peter's presence in Rome. His list is impressive and he devotes the first 100 pages of his book to prove that Peter was in fact in Rome. Finally, he deals with some of the comments made by other Christians who doubted Peter's presence in Rome. This includes wrestling with remarks made by John Calvin and other present day fundamentalists who deny this historic truth. I think Mr. Ray did an excellent job of making his case, my only complaint is that the belief that Peter resided in Rome has been established and believed by a majority of Christians, even non-Catholic ones. The only ones who still argue for such an erroneous position are virulent fundamentalists who dislike everything Catholic.In the second half of his book, Mr. Ray attempts to prove that the Papacy was in fact granted a historical and successive power of jurisdictional rule. I think Ray does a good job of arguing for such a concept, but that his argument isn't airtight and is not a slam dunk case. First, his quotations from the Early Church Fathers are selective, and he doesn't do a good job of clarifying the context from which those quotes are taken. Second, Mr. Ray does not truly take William Webster's argument to heart because Ray never attempts to prove that the modern understanding of the papacy is the same as it was in the Early Church. Relying on an argument from silence will not work because the argument from silence could just as easily support the opposing position. What is needed is positive proof that the Fathers believed that the Bishop of Rome was the ruling Bishop supreme over the rest of the Church. In fact, I think a vast majority of Ray's proof-texts could just as easily fit in with an Orthodox understanding of the Bishop of Rome as the the bishop with the primacy of honor, and a limited role in singly defining Church issues. Finally, Ray weakens his case by not dealing adequately with all of the evidence that disproves his case. In the beginning of the book he says that no Church Father ever questioned the Pope's authority to intervene in local Church affairs, but Cyprian and Augustine did do just this. Cyprian would not abide by Pope Stephen's demands and showed that some Bishops did question the Pope's rights thus disproving Mr. Ray's assertion. Lastly, Ray does not even mention documents like the letter of Gregory the Great to the Bishop of Constantinople that completely disprove his argument. In this letter Gregory of Rome says that no bishop should be made a bishop above bishops because to elevate oneself to this rank would make all other bishops no longer bishops. Yet, this is exactly what the Gregorian Reformes did when they made themselves Universal pontiff over the entire Church, thus strictly contradicting what Gregory the Great, a previous Pope, had said.All in all, this work is a great work for any Catholic who wants to understand the historical roots and reasoning for the papacy. The case is well argued for, well developed, and well documented. Nevertheless, this book still contains some serious weak spots and is not as air tight and concrete as some would like to maintain. To understand both sides of the argument read this book in conjunction with William Webster's, The Matthew 16 Controversey. By reading both books I think the reader will be able to understand both sides of the argument and make an informed decision on their own."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"I highly recommend this book. It was very informative and fairly easy to read. My only complaint is that there were too many footnotes, or to be more accurate, there was nothing but footnotes. The bulk of the book, 80% or more I'd say, was presented in the form of footnotes. I feel the book could have done away with the footnotes and given better flow by incorporation into the main text. Otherwise an excellent book and easy to understand which I would recommend without reservation."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"First I have to say that this is a wonderful book. It's a slow read but full of a wealth of information. I've given away my first copy and have ordered a second for my own use. Though some have complained about the footnotes I find them of great use and one of the reasons why I think the book is wonderful. I would have taken me months (if not years) to research the same information on my own.

Extensive excerpts from scripture and the early church texts expounded upon in copious footnotes are Mr. Ray's signature. This style may not be the easiest to follow but the point is well made for the primacy of Peter. Instead of cluttering the primary thread of his work with endless commentary telling us what an author said, Mr. Ray let's the author's words stand on their own while giving the more curious reader the level of commentary they desire in footnotes. So, though the organization may seem confusing to some, it is precisely the kind of approach this subject requires. There are countless polemical works from all sides, Orthodox, Protestant, and Roman Catholic. Mr. Ray has stepped back from the polemic to let the source writers convey their agreement on the role of Peter and the bishops of Rome. The evidence is formidable and difficult to set aside in volume alone.There is clearly evidence for the primacy of Peter in scripture and history - it is our goal to find what that primacy means to us and our relationship to the bishop of Rome today. One could argue the significance of the question but not the relevance to our faith. Pope John Paul II issued a call for evaluating this topic in order to heal the rift between Protestant, Orthodox, and Catholic. Mr. Ray's book is a good place to start for the scriptural and historical foundation on which we should build our understanding. Unity of any kind must be based on truth and an attempt at mutual understanding. The role of the Pope is a topic that cannot be ignored if there is any hope of healing the wounds that brought us to this division."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"This book is fantastic at explaining the Catholic Church's teaching on the Pope, from a Biblical and historical perspective. It also clears up the misconceptions and objections some people have to the Papacy. The information is pretty thorough, but it is also down to earth and easy to read and understand. Steven Ray goes through all the Biblical passages on the papacy and authority, as well as what the earliest Christians believed and taught, as well as the modern thoughts on the subject. The book is an awesome book! It's a definite must read for anyone interested on the topic!!!"},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"Stephen Ray offers a very convincing defense of the Roman Catholic position on Peter and the Papacy, but as an Eastern Orthodox, I am bound to encourage the readers to read other perspectives for the sake of balance. There are two main issues with \\"Upon this Rock\\" which need to be pointed out: (1) Ray does not seem to understand that in the mind of the Fathers and of Eastern Christians, Peter is connected with the office of bishop, not the specific office of bishop of Rome. When they speak about Peter's primacy and prerogatives as \\"first,\\" they apply this to the episcopate, not to the papacy. In other words, Peter's successors are the bishops in the Church, not the bishop of Rome. It is only in a secondary and geographic sense that Rome has a special Petrine connection. (2) Ecclesiology (\\"what is the Church?\\") is not dealt with except to assume worldwide ecclesiology, i.e. the Roman Catholic approach. For this reason, Origen and Cyprian are (as is so often the case), completely misunderstood. I have tried to discuss this issue at length in my own bookHis Broken Body: Understanding and Healing the Schism between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches (Paperback)and two other books would be my recommendation for a careful consideration of this issue:Eucharist, Bishop, Church: The Unity of the Church in the Divine Eucharist and the Bishop During the First Three Centuries (Paperback)andThe Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church (Paperback)."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"As another reviewer mentions, Ray proof texts the Patristic Sources in the same way Protestants proof text Scripture.However, it does contain much material that sheds some light on early church thought/history that many Christians are unaware of. Hopefully, one will gain an appreciation of the entirety of Tradition that is taken for granted (in terms of theology) by modern day Christians, even if the conclusion as presented in this book is incorrect."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"Mr. Ray's book about Papal Primacy focuses much of its attention insisting that Peter lived in Rome. In other words because Peter had his P.O. Box in the secular city of power, that entitled him to a primacy of authority which later Roman Pontiffs inherited (even when there were two or three popes at the same time in France and at Rome?!) But there can be a difference between power and authority which Mr. Ray fails to acknowledge.The Church of the Scriptures and Early Church History had several places of authority (e.g., Jerusalem, Ephesus), that may not have seemed very powerful by secular standards. Yet they were places of authority because of how the &quot;heads&quot; of the churches in those communities (apostles James, John) lived their lives as well as laid down their power and their lives in faithfulness to Christ as much as Peter. Mr. Ray's own Roman Catholic Church points this out in its ecumenical document &quot;Papal Primacy and the Universal Church.&quot;His church's document informs us that primacy (papal or otherwise) is not a right that a leader has because he had/has an address at Rome or by what Jesus said to a &quot;Rock&quot;; rather, primacy in a leader is recognized by how one serves the other equals (leaders)and followers. People are attracted to truth and want to be authored by leaders who use power in service to others. Jesus Christ showed his greatest power in powerlessness or when he let go of control/power for the sake of others.Mr. Ray has done extensive research and is to be applauded for his efforts. At the same time his Roman Catholic proof-texting of early church fathers and patristics is reminiscent of how some fundamentalists do proof-texting from the Bible. That can the raise question about how far he has actually &quot;Crossed the Tiber&quot; (river), or if he is still standing in the middle of it as a Baptist.I wish him God's speed on his spiritual journey as he rolls the dice to see what turns up as primary in the Church so that others are attracted to Christ and Christ's Church. Will that be power, or authority, or maybe both governed by the universal principle of Christian service. Papal Primacy raises more questions for all Christians not so that we will become part of the Roman Catholic Church, but so that the Catholic/Universal Church may be a better witness about authority and power in and for the world."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"Upon This Rock was a well written and thought out book.

But Mr. Ray's further, deeper development on White's/Webster's study showed me that I had only been given an incomplete story. What else about the Protestant faith is only \\"partially\\" developed ? Mr. Ray's presentation is overwhelming. One particular nugget in the goldmine of truth was not detailed in the New Testament, Old Testament, or the Church Fathers. It was a geography lesson on Caesarea Philllipi. It had never dawned on me what a long journey this was for Jesus and his disciples.

It is not a reason-based approach to the issue of the primacy of Rome in the early Church as it is an overwhelming number of references and citations. The argument relies mostly on historical proof, however, it can get a bit tedious at times.As a soon-to-be Catholic I think this book erased any questions in my mind about how the early Church regarded Rome and it is a nail in the coffin of independent congregationalist fundamentalists.It is a great reference book which could be used by armchair apologists, if you are into that sort of thing.

From the Catholic perspective, this verse points to the office of the Pope where Jesus grants divine authority to Peter and his successors. Obviously, this interpretation does not sit well for Protestants who deny this authority. But do Protestants correctly interpret this verse as well as other verses regarding the Papacy? The answer is no and this book will explain why. The office of the Pope will come alive for you as the author takes you through the Old and New Testaments as well as the writings of the earliest Christians outside of biblical times. The author left no STONE unturned (pardon the pun) as he methodically destroys any attempt to disprove the Papacy in Scripture. An insightful book and a must read for both Protestants and Catholics. Reviewed by Gospel Truth."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"...... Anyway, I loved this book because it deals with many of the Protestant and Eastern Orthodox arguments against the papacy. I am extremely glad Steve Ray gave evidence for Peter being in Rome despite what our Eastern Orthodox friend says. This book was aimed more toward the fundamentalist Evangelical Protestant than the Eastern Orthodox. And as many people know many of the Evangelical fundamentalists one talks with deny the fact that Peter was ever in Rome. If you don't believe me then go to an Evangelical messageboard to find out. Even some major Protestant apologists also has denied Peter presence in Rome so it was essential for Ray to give the evidence for Peter in Rome. The Eastern Orthodox also mentioned that not all the Fathers interpreted Matt 16:18 the same way as Rome and the Catholic apologists don't want to let that be known. This assertion is untrue and many Catholic apologists have said that was true. But there is a great answer to that and the answer can be gotten from the author if you e-mail him. Btw, most if not all of the books that the Eastern Orthodox recommended were part of Upon This Rock's bibliography. Please get this book and e-mail the author if you have any questions. Another book I would recommend is Jesus, Peter, and the Keys. Look out for follow-up books to JP&K; to answer more objection to the Papacy using more of the Church Fathers. Upon This Rock would make an excellent gift for non-Catholics or Catholics who don't know their faith. Catholics must learn how to defend their faith."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"Stephen K. Ray does an excellent job of presenting the scriptural and historical case for the papacy. He writes clearly and well. I would like to make a point about a book mentioned in the review by the Eastern Orthodox gentleman, namely Brian Tierney's &quot;The Origins of Papal Infallibility&quot;. Moved by that review I read Tierney's book. Brian Tierney, though a good scholar, has an axe to grind, specifically a liberal Catholic axe. I am surprised that an Eastern Orthodox person would commend the arguments of Tierney, since Tierney obviously is against not just PAPAL infallibility, but ALL infallibility, including the infallibility of Ecumenical Councils and the infallibility of the Church herself, both of which doctrines are believed in by the Eastern Orthodox. Tierney, as a liberal, does not believe that the Church can definitively commit herself to truths. In other words, he rejects the possibility of dogma. Essentially his position is that of Hans Kung.The mistake that this Eastern Orthodox reviewer makes illustrates a basic problem with attempts to interpret the historical evidence in an Eastern Orthodox or Anglican way: these via media are self-destructive, as Newman realized. The Orthodox accept the hierarchical authority of bishops and the infallibility of Ecumenical Councils. But the scriptural evidence and the evidence from the ante-Nicene Fathers is stronger for the papacy than for the authority of Ecumenical Councils. One can pick holes in the evidence for the papacy, but only by using arguments that ultimately can be used even more effectively against other doctrines that the Orthodox would wish to uphold. Protestants have the same problem: the same arguments that are used against the papacy can be turned even more effectively against the New Testament. To return to Ray's book, I recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"Upon This Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church (Modern Apologetics Library)","review":"As a Catholic convert of just two years I had much to learn about the history of the universal church of Jesus Christ.

WARNING: This book is for serious Bible and history-lovin' Christians only! This work is another 'must-have' for Catholic apologists. The only criticism that I had for this book is that it provided too much evidence for the Catholic position of the papacy.

Avon does a fantastic job with photography and capturing the colors and conformation of the different varieties. Walker has updated some of the information in the book. The only area I find lacking in information (or providing MISinformation) is the section on song canaries. The exception would be Rollers - he obviously did a lot of research on them. American Singers seem to be well-researched, but I'm not very familiar with that breed. The Waterslagers and Spanish Timbrados, however, were not well-represented. There is an obviously lack of information available on those two breeds for him to research, and the information that is provided is not very accurate.

Then Jack showed the dustjacketed cover of this autobiography and inquired about an incident where Davis had been hospitalized for osteomyelitis of the jaw. She was released after six weeks of what the actress described as \\"sheer hell.\\" That same day, Walter Winchell erringly reported that Davs had jaw cancer, potentially runious gossip, for studios won't risk hiring an actor who may not be able to complete a picture.Some serious chat about the harmful effects of gossip columnists followed, then, switching gears, the star showed a great capacity to laugh at herself by teaching Jack, Jonathan Winters and Gisele MacKenzie how to smoke a KENT (Paar's sponsor) like Bette Davis does inTHE LETTER(puffpuffpuffpuff... \\"Petah!\\").The bulk of THE LONELY LIFE as expected is Bette, probably speaking on tape, in plain launguage. Unfortunately, significant passages are by her unnamed but not invisible ghost writer, who philisophizes in pedantic polysyllabics on a number of unrelated subjects such as the Cold War, African independence, the Moon Race and British actors. Appropriately, Bette's Hollywood career and family life are her main concerns. She's respectful of nearly everyone mentioned, never damns an enemy beyond a mention of animosity. This is definitely not a tell-all exercise in revenge, not by a long shot.Her early Hollywood struggles to escape typecasting as a sexless kid sister lasted four long years. Certain directors, like Michael Curtiz, simply did not want Bette Davis in their movies, thought her devoid of talent and allure. Others were kinder and helped Bette climb the ladder of fame, if slowly. Her big break (and a first Oscar nomination) came when the actress convinced Warner's to loan her to RKO forOF HUMAN BONDAGE(1934). According to Miss Davis, her own studio actually lobbied AGAINST her winning the statuette, but the ploy backfired. Negative publicity about Warner's devious actions reinforced her celebrity status. Even the doggy roles they gave her for a while longer couldn't hold this winner back.The subsequent parts of the story that are in Bette's voice make for a fascinating read. The narrative ends with her mom's illness and demise. The book is in fact dedicated to the memory of Ruth Davis with a repro of a note to \\"Ruthie\\" signed \\"Pinky.\\" Two photo sections are included, a total of 76 quite rare snapshots. Highly recommended to all fans of classic era Hollywood."},{"Title":"The Lonely Life: An Autobiography","review":"Bette Davis was the first one to tell her story via a ghost writer and it certainly wouldn't be the last time.

One thing is certain, Bette Davis was never boring - ever!"},{"Title":"The Lonely Life: An Autobiography","review":"She was a very secretive woman and she was exciting to watch in movies. A great woman of the movies"},{"Title":"The Lonely Life: An Autobiography","review":"Bette Davis. The Golden Age Hollywood actress, spitfire, and drama queen extraordinaire, wrote an autobiography in 1962 that hasn't lost its luster. Bette Davis' book is a joy to read; her insights into her own and the human nature are uniquely stated and memorable. At times the book has a tone of speaking, other times beautifully crafted prose as we follow her from a New England upbringing in a complex single-parent home and a self-sacrificing mother ( possibly smothering), \\"Ruthie\\", to finding her home in the theater and settling in Hollywood. Davis is honest about her triumphs, struggles, challenges, and battles, as well as disappointments (hence the title \\"The Lonely Life\\"). The book is juicily detailed but not bawdy or tawdry; her New England values come through. I found so many pages a revelation- in thought, expression, analogy, philosophy, and strength of vision and character. Whether she is insulting a co-star, a \\"weak sister\\" (her pet name for certain vain actors), or discussing her vulnerability and desire for support in her endeavors: \\"I have never functioned well when anyone is doubting my ability to do something,\\" Ms. Davis is a powerhouse of a woman and an actress. The book succeeds by making her struggles and harsh-self-evaluation integral to the complex portrait of a life fully, and well-lived. Bottom line message: strong, ambitious, and determined women will always face opposition and mixed messages from society, themselves, and in their relationships. Davis shows us the ultimate triumph in standing up for what you believe in, fighting battles that mean something, staying true to your craft, and recognizing your enemies and those who are worthy of your time and energy: \\"The weak are the most treacherous of us all. They come to the strong and drain them. They are bottomless. They are insatiable. They are always parched and always bitter. They are everyone's concern and like vampires they suck our life's blood. It is the strong who need care. It is they who need constant replenishment. It is the strong who are vulnerable. It is the strong for whom I will do anything. It is they who need consideration.\\" Bette Davis certainly lived the words that E.M. Forster wrote: \\"only connect.\\" Her connections with audiences, fans, fellow actors, Hollywood business types, family, friends, husbands and lovers make one realize that Bette Davis was an extraordinary intellect, a supremely talented performer, and a complicated and passionate woman. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The House in Dormer Forest","review":"As soon as I started this novel, I was very aware this must have been the book that inspired Stella Gibbons' parody, 'Cold Comfort Farm.'Featuring the aptly named Darke family of Dormer House: stern father Solomon; mother Rachel, who spends her evenings tearing rags to shreds; their four adult children, all named after precious stones as their mother 'had been so bored by the advent of each child...that she had refused to think of any names for them', leaving the Rector, an authority on gems, to do so. With them live distant relative Catherine - outwardly lovely but malicious - and Rachel's mother, Mrs Velindre, undoubtedly the inspiration for Gibbons' Aunt Ada Doom.' \\"Let us pray\\", said Solomon, and they all went down, with more or less grace, on to their knees.When the others knelt, grandmother remained seated, like a stone idol which is immune, through its very stoniness, from human movement. It was understood that grandmother could not kneel. Only grandmother and her Creator knew that not her knees but her pride of years deterred her from this religious exercise...This remaining upright amidst a grovelling family gave her a satiric glee.'Amid the at times quite comic family, and the more serious romantic plots involving the young people, Webb immerses us in lengthy paeans to the countryside and religion, some of which left me quite baffled:'Enoch was never quite at his ease at Dormer. He liked to be out on the huge purple hills under the towering sky, where the curlews cried out strange news to him in passing, and the little brown doves murmured of a hidden country, a secret law, more limited than those of man, yet more miraculous. For there, to dream a nest is to build it. To desire the sea, or an orange tree in Africa is to obtain it. Genius and love are the nearest approach we have made to this wholly mysterious life...'There's a LOT of this.Over-the-top gothic melodrama; not recommended."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)","review":"I read this entire series!

She combines skillful storytelling with faith-promoting stories that will leave you on the edge of your seat.

The novels are evangelical, but they also speak strongly to Christians. And they do tell suspenseful stories that are strong but not graphically violent. This entry starts with a church burning and murder and then introduces us to a youthful cult that masquerades as a Christian group, but is in truth a neo-nazi racist gang headed by a brother and sister who are a former KKK leader's grandchildren.

When ever I loan one of Terri's books out I make sure my name is in it and to whom I loaned it for a read."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)","review":"Blackstock's Newpointe 911 series is a somewhat melodramatic series revolving around 911 responders (firefighters, paramedics, and police) in a sleepy little Louisiana burg. The book starts with the local Calvary Bible Church being burned to the ground with the son of one of Newpointe's finest, Ben Ford, found dead of a gunshot wound in the building. The mystery deepens as another church is burned and, later, a young black teen is beaten severely.The pastor/firefighter of Newpointe, Nick Foster, is having a hard time dealing with the loss of his church as well as the discovery that he has not-so-platonic feelings for unbelieving paramedic and party girl, Issie Mattreaux, whose cousin Jake is somehow involved.There are a few subplots revolving around what affect the death of a child has on a family (Susan and Ray Ford's rejection of God is all too realistic) as well as what affect a teen's friends have on him (Jake's realization that his friends are KKK-influenced cultists). There's a birth as well (Stan and Celia Shepherd, whose pregnancy was revealed in the last book).The Nick and Issie subplot is the most interesting by far, since it deals with the Christian concept of being \\"unevenly yoked\\". It's very important, from a Christian standpoint, that both mates have common beliefs and principles. Marriage to someone (like Issie) that doesn't share Nick's faith in God would make it more likely that there would be severe disharmony. Mutual devotion to the Creator is the strongest basis for unity, and this is seen reflected in the marriages of Mark and Allie, Stan and Celia and, eventually, Ray and Susan.Blackstock makes her points very well in this book without it being overly preachy (which happens all too often in her Cape Refuge series). This book is, for my money, the best in the series."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)","review":"I love to reread this story, even knowing the outcome of the suspenseful plot, because Nick represents Christ so powerfully. He's willing to love someone who others would avoid, yet he also stands strong in purity. I love the scene where he brings Issie from the bar and watches over her. It costs his reputation, but he does it anyway because he longs to show her she isn't alone. The relationships in the story speak clearly to our lives, revealing the mercy and forgiveness we're to show others. This is the kind of story that ministers to the soul as well as fascinates the mind. --Ayrian Stone, author ofLove That Is Blind"},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)","review":"Keep the books coming, Terri. She holds your attention so vividly that you want to read that next page and next chapter. I'm reading all of her books and this series is awesome. If you aren't fortunate enough to have read each series in order, it's not a problem because Terri Blackstock reintroduces certain characters or events very well. I love the way she weaves faith issues into her works. Love this book!"},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)","review":"Issie has a problem: she finds herself more and more drawn to the handsome pastor/fireman Nick Foster and she knows that she is not living the life that she should. But in the midst of trying to sort out her feelings, a crisis occurs: Nick's church burns to the ground, killing someone trapped inside. Further investigation reveals that the victim, a young black man, was dead before the fire started and that perhaps Nick's church was picked to burn because of its open door policy to people of all races. More complication arises when Issie discovers the involvement of her own nephew in this skinhead-type group. Issie has no time to sort out her feelings for Nick as she tries to rescue her nephew from the crowd he is with before another incident occurs, and Nick becomes so disheartened after the burning of his church that he considers leaving the ministry. You will not want to put this one down as you see how the Lord leads Issie, Nick, and the other characters through their trials and troubles. Trial by Fire is another great suspense story by Blackstock, and I am anxiously awaiting the next one! (Hope Issie and Nick will be husband and wife in it!)"},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)","review":"The Newpointe 911 series is just what I needed. Intelligent, fast paced thrillers from a Christian author. Who would've \\"thunk\\" it. I was searching for books that I could read and not have to skip whole passages, pages or even chapters to avoid explicit violence, sex and language. To find that and not have to sacrifice the type of plot lines and genre of reading that I enjoy was indeed a blessing. In this, the fourth of the series, we find bad girl, Issie Mattreaux, fighting her attraction to the town's pastor, Nick Foster. And, Nick is fighting just as hard. However, the Lord just keeps bringing them together. Their relationship in itself is enough to make you want to read the book, but add on a mystery set in a small town in Louisiana and revolving around the firefighters, cops, and rescue units and you have a recipe for a winner. The book also makes a strong statement on the effects of peer pressure and how kids can be lead astray. It also doesn't wimp out and make the ending one that is always perfect in the eyes of the world. However, it does show how bad things happen to good people and how good can come out of it. The only downside is that the next book isn't out yet. But, you can always re-read the first three books in the series, \\"Private Justice\\", \\"Word of Honor\\" and \\"Shadow of Doubt\\"."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)","review":"The book discription does not do this book justice.

I read it in one day!The continuation of the 911 series is only getting better. Trial by Fire relates to the trials in anyone's life. Lots of times, people think that Christians are immune to suffering. This book shows that isn't true. We all have trials, including the preacher, Nick Foster. Nick is having trouble dealing with the fact that his church has burned down, a murder was committed, and how these events are affecting his congregation. It reminds us where we should go for wisdom &amp; strength.Trial by fire also does a great job of portraiting how many of the kids that are raised today are so numb to immorality. They often get in over their heads by trying anything to feel &quot;accepted&quot;. Best friends, Jake and Benton, have been accepted into a group that practices neo Nazism. Jake's aunt, Issie, who is known as the bad girl in town, places herself in danger trying to save her nephew. And why has the preacher taken such an interest in Issie?

A charming tale of leisurely--but never idle--life in the era, the author's cunning wit and ladylike charm adorn every page. In the oddly Amazonian town of Cranford, all the men have gone off to seek their fortunes in nearby indutry or simply never were born; the ladies of Cranford, then, occupy their time with ever-modest hostessing, challenging games of Preference, and demure speculation on the comings and goings of the penny-ante gentry that breeze through their midst. The copy I read offered a quote from Mrs. Gaskell, saying that she herself often read _Cranford_ when feeling ill or sad, as it was good for cheering her flagging spirits. Any modern reader would, no doubt, reap the same mirthful benefits."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Orginally published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, _Cranford_is in fact a collection of stories about the people (mostly women)'s lives in a city called Cranford in the 19th century. It is said to be Mrs. Gaskell's most popular book, and the only book that Mrs. Gaskell herself would want to re-read again. This book is indeed full of funny, ridiculous and heartwarming stories about some old-fashioned but really friendly and kind-hearted women (mostly old maids or widows) living in this little town called Cranford. I think Mrs. Gaskell did a good job in bring up themes like the confrontation of the old and new world, the comparsion between the life in an industrial city like Drumble (believed to be based on Manchester) and the little tranquil town Cranford. If you are interested in Victorian Literature, this is one of the few relaxing novels belonging to that period that is definitely worth a reading!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Gaskills character sketches are delightful to read. Her descriptions of village life are spot on. I have lived in a small village all my life, and with the exceptions of technologies and British class systems, this is how a small town still operates. Loved reading it and followed with the other novels based in Cranford ASAP."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I bought this for my wife - but, after we both greatly enjoyed the BBC miniseries, I ended up reading it myself as well. Compared to the miniseries, as expected, the book expands into more details and can be savored in many more levels.Sometimes escapism may require an action page-turner. Other times the same effect can be achieved by a slow novel about middle-aged women and their daily troubles.Pettiness and kindness, age and genders, nobles and lowborn, progress and tradition, all come together and weave the tapestry of rural middle England of the 1840's.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I would like to begin by saying that this book is very little like the PBS production that is being aired on TV right now. There are many characters that make their way into the miniseries, but many that the producers seem to have borrowed from other Gaskell novels. However, though the producers do not stick to the plot of the book, I feel they have captured the spirit of Cranford.If anyone were to ask me what this book is about, I am not quite sure what to tell them. In essence, it is a book about nothing in particular and everything meaningful in general. The key characters are elderly ladies who, like prim Amazons in middle-aged caps, look after each other and those around them. The adventures in this story are so mild, yet taken so seriously by the characters, that I was myself as excited as they were to learn that a magician had come to Cranford, or that the new fashions had arrived, or that a Lady was to marry someone quite beneath her. The most moving part of the whole story is Miss Matti's past love, a love that she sacrificed for the sake of her family. Her stories brought many tears to my eyes.Overall, I am so impressed with how such a simple story could be so altogether moving, and, quite unexpectedly, very fast paced. I read it very quickly yet I feel as if the tale will live with me forever."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It's true that the novel \\"Cranford\\" doesn't mirror the recent Masterpiece dramatization, however this is because the adaptation was based on a series of Mrs. Gaskell's works, of which \\"Cranford\\" is only one. The others are \\"Mr. Harrison's Confessions\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"The Last Generation in England\\". Taken together, all four give a complete -and more familiar- portrait of the delightful village we saw televised. I recommend each of them highly."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell, follows the lives of a group of women living in a small English town.I enjoyed this book very much. More of a collection of stories than a novel, it reminded me of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, to whom Mrs. Gaskell pays particular homage in more than one place in the book.Like most Victorian novels, the humor is droll and significant attention is played to social class. But it is also a quick, somewhat easy read, adjectives that don't usually come to mind when describing works of this era.This is a book about women, a point that Gaskell makes clear in the first line:\\"In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.\\"And while the middle-aged spinsters of Cranford are a far cry from the women warriors who came to the assistance of the Greeks at Troy, the stereotypical rich, handsome man who comes to marry the woman in distress and therefore saves the day is absent from this story.Told through the eyes of Mary Smith, the two main characters of the novel, Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Matty, put me very much in the mind of the Miss Brownings in Gaskell's final novel, Wives and Daughters. The foibles and misadventures of these two sisters and their circle of friends often had me laughing out loud.This is a delightful book. Written at a time when a woman's worth was often tied to how well she married, the gently humorous but dignified way in which Gaskell treats her characters in this novel is lovely."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it. Vivid portraits of the largely single women--spinsters or widows--who dominate the social life of the town and their struggles to control who gets invited to tea parties etc and who doesn't, their criticisms of who doesn't observe the proprieties, and their underlying good-heartedness. In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A very quick review. A beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th Century life. A very interesting read to myself as I was born at Cranford Lodge, Knutsford, the true market town in the north of England that Gaskell based her novel on. A visit to Knutsford itself brings out the flavour of the writing and tours of \\"Cranford\\" including Miss Matty's house and the Assembly Rooms at the George can be arranged through the Gaskell Society!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A sweet, gentle story of a small English town not unlike Jan Karon's Mitford, only 150 years ago. No high drama- only caring people with all their flaws. I read it years ago and remembered it fondly. Reading it again recently, I was not disappointed. Don't miss this little jewel."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Ever get invited to spend a long, long weekend with an unmarried great-aunt and her closest unmarried friends, when what you really wanted to do was hang out with gals your own age? Well, that's exactly what a reader experiences on picking up CRANFORD, when she's come to it after delighted hours spent with WIVES AND DAUGHTERS and NORTH AND SOUTH. Take one of those wonderful, wonderful novels, delete all the men, all the romance, and all the passionate class critique, and that leaves CRANFORD.All I can say is, this novel is like Barbara Pym's QUARTET IN AUTUMN or her EXCELLENT WOMEN, only more so. More old ladies, more \\"spasms and flutterings\\" of old ladies (to borrow from Andrew Davies' P&P; screenplay), more petty snobberies and antimacassars.A plot of some sort does rear its head at about 75%, but don't look for one before then. I'd say I enjoyed the last 25% the most--found it comparatively un-put-down-able!--but only because I'd abandoned all hope by then.My book club was going to read this one, but I frantically steered them away when I was 60% in.

Here is an idea for Dover Press: Rename the line Dover Classics, Dover Thrift makes it sound like a book you buy at a Goodwill for a quarter- have some class, some pride- after all you are publishing classics.Gaskell was a well known literary figure in her day- she wrote non-fiction as well as fiction, including a biography of her homie Charlotte Bronte. Even though this is a book putatively about small town genteel widows and matrons, the timely references to characters being enthralled by Dickens Pickwick Papers (one of the few men in the novel is hit by a train because he is standing on the platform, so enthralled by the latest installment of Pickwick that he is slow too alert a child stuck on the tracks.)Elizabeth Gaskell in fact chose to be known as \\"Mrs. Gaskell\\" to the point that contemporary editions of Cranford read \\"by Mrs. Gaskell.\\" Although Cranford is not exactly what you call \\"action intense,\\" it is well observed, and at 130 pages you can read through it in a couple hours. Gaskell's country matrons don't sparkle with the life of those of Stendahl's the Red and the Black, but she does an equal job of portraying a specific time and place (the 1830s) from a vantage point twenty years in the the future (published 1852.)In the end Gaskell's genteel spinsters come together to save the day in the manner of a book like \\"the Little Women,\\" it's a bit TOO pat of an ending but hey it's just a minor classic, nowhatimean?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A lovely book about a lovely village of lovely people. The inspiration for BBC/Masterpiece Classic's Cranford and Return to Cranford. I read this book in only a few nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The glossary/notes regarding material culture (clothing, terminology, expressions) are not always correct (based on my own research and experience as an historic interpreter), but most of the information was new to me and referred to books and events of which I was unaware. I'm glad I watched the tv series first, including \\"The Making of Cranford,\\" before reading the book; it made clear how and why the series was created as it was. That being said, the book is charming and should be read by all high school students, especially female students, to understand that they are not so very different after all."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"For those expecting the book and PBS Mini-series of the same name to mirror each other, your expectations will probably fall short. Although the book is very well written, it is definitely not light reading, and requires a great degree of concentration to understand the ins and outs of the plot - the characters are intertwined, but it is sometimes hard to remember how they relate to one another.Overall, this book is a good, classical tale, but not recommended for bedtime reading! Strong coffee and concentration is needed!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"i chose this book because i liked it on tv and wondered what the 'raw material' was like.

I had expected a regular-size paperback (I failed to notice the dimensions when I ordered) and find this size unwieldy and floppy.

I have not finished reading the book because of this and would not order this particular item again."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Let me just say that I don't remember which cover is on my Cranford book so I don't know that this is the correct issue. I have read this work however and enjoyed it immensely. It is most amusing and I must say that some of Gaskell's works are deep compared to some classic novelists. I felt this had a little of everything. I'd suggest a read if you want to be ready for watching any TV adaptation."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This Penguin Classics edition of Cranford, with a cover design by Coralie Bickford-Smith, is a beautiful book, a pleasure to hold and read. I wish Penguin would release more books in such high quality editions.I'd never read any of Gaskell's work before, so Cranford was a pleasant surprise. It's a lively and warm-hearted novel which will appeal to fans of Garrison Keillor and Alexander McCall Smith.Another reviewer described Cranford as \\"not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches.\\" Certainly Cranford is nostalgic, perhaps even sentimental, but it's more than a series of sketches. I would go so far as to say that Cranford demonstrates a remarkable tightness of plot and character development, though Gaskell works with such a light touch (and elliptical style) that I can see how it would be easy to overlook the unity of the whole novel. If you read Cranford as a collection of anecdotes, I encourage you to ask yourself which parts could be removed without undermining the book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"In the last few years or so, I've been noting a resurgence of a writer who was very popular in nineteenth century England. Not quite as famous as Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell did find a niche writing about everyday people in the small towns and villages that dotted England's landscape.Cranford is a slim collection of vignettes. Each little story explores a person, a gathering, or an incident in the past or present. Some are humourous, others are very poignant, and some just look at the life and manners of the time. In specific, to one particular group in the village.For Cranford, as we are told in the opening sentence, is a place that is governed by Amazons. The Amazons are a group of elderly spinsters or widows who have fallen into genteel poverty, supported by meager savings left from legacies and inheritances. As a group, they inhabit nearly all of the homes of Cranford, deciding on questions of taste and morality, the correct behavior of servants, managing gardens, discretion in clothing and so forth. And where are the men, you might ask? Nearly all of them have fled, it seems -- to the military, to the navy, to the nearby city of Dumble (a stand-in for Manchester), frightened off, no doubt, by the formidable array of feminity before them.As the 'leaders,' there are the two daughters of the former vicar of the town. Miss Jenkyns and her younger sister Miss Matty, have risen to a level of respectability in the community, leading their little bevy of companion in acts of charity, mourning, welcoming (and shunning) strangers, and even to such details as what is to be considered suitable literature. When we first meet them, the town has been sent into turmoil by the arrival of a retired military man with two daughters -- and he has the temerity to actually suggest books to Miss Jenkyns. Horrors!But there is more to the story, and as the nameless narrator leads us through the various members of the village, there are stories that are humourous, such as when a string of burglaries occurs, or when a traveling magician arrives. Other stories are very poignant, such as Miss Matty and a collection of old letters, or when a bank in Dumble defaults and one person's savings are wiped out.What makes this collection stand out is the level of compassion between the various women as their little world is shaken up by the encroaching Industrial Age, and their somewhat stubborn intent on keeping their village just the way it is. And underneath some of the bristly exteriors, there are acts of selflessness and care that they extend to each other. This and the humour that the author brought to each story, was what made the book for me.I really don't want to reveal much more of the book as not to spoil it for anyone. The collection itself is rather slim, just sixteen stories of about twenty pages long. Along with the stories, there are extensive notes that have been added by Patricia Ingham, which really do help to understand the terms and usage of the language, and help to clear up some very unfamiliar terms.All in all, a very enjoyable read that is much lighter in tone than most Victorian fiction. Great fun to read, and to sigh over as well.Four stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is a really good edition of the book. If you by classic literature you know that some editions are better than others, this is a very good version of the The Cranford Chronicles. This volume houses Mr. Harrison's Confessions(86 pages), Cranford (188 pages), My Lady Ludlow (203 pages).The type is not ridiculously small it's pretty average, this is a very readable version of the Cranford Chronicles. The story of the town of Cranford and it's inhabitants, the comings and goings, the slow and steady development of the women of Cranford and their coming together."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not a novel, not an anthology of short stories, Cranford is perhaps best described as a cohesive series of vignettes. Recounted by a young woman of about 30 from the city of Drumble [Manchester], these stories depict family, friendship, and love lost and found in a village dominated by poor but genteel spinsters and widows. \\". . . all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are women.\\" Small, rural, and elitist in its way, Cranford is a place out of time, where faded fashions and proprieties still matter.Gaskell begins Cranford with a series of descriptive statements. Some are accurate, while others prove to be ironic. For example, \\"Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.\\" While discovering Cranford and the Amazons who possess it, we also learn the dry perspective and voice of the narrator, who clearly loves the village while gently highlighting the foibles of its female inhabitants. \\"But I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.\\"Like Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, Cranford is focused on gender roles and the different lives of women and men. The sexes share many characteristics; Captain Brown and Peter Jenkyns display the thoughtful, neighborly solicitude associated with women (with Peter going so far as to don a woman's dress), while Miss Jenkyns (the woman Peter impersonates) exhibits a manly will and resolution. It is the opportunities they have and the way in which they live that separates the sexes. Captain Brown, Peter, and Signor Brunoni have traveled and seen some of the world, and have even influenced it, while Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, Miss Price, the narrator, and their friends are constrained by their gender, gentility, and social code to hearth and home. Here, they perform their small household tasks, including ensuring that their maidservants are not disturbed or distracted by \\"followers,\\" or interested young men. The social code that prevents any of them from working in \\"trade\\" also determines the hours that can be spent outside the home. \\"Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls . . . 'from twelve to three are our calling-hours.'\\"In such a small, interconnected village, everything that happens is noteworthy, and every decision is important if the occasionally cruel social order is to be maintained. \\"The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betty Barker's Alderney,\\" whose fall into a lime-pit warrants Captain Brown's advice, \\"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers . . .,\\" so the narrator can ask the reader incredulously, \\"Do you ever seen cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\\" Miss Matty's decision not to marry against her family's wishes keeps the peace at great personal cost, and her wistful decision to allow Martha to have a follower recompenses her later when the outside world intrudes into her realm with its ugly realities--one of the many signs that Cranford must and will change. When Lady Glenmire renounces her title and takes the name of Mrs. Hoggins upon her remarriage, Cranford reels with shock and dismay, and it takes Peter Jenkyns, and his broader perspective from India, to reconcile the village and its de facto leader, Mrs. Jamieson, with the new ways.The narrator, who divides her time between her father in the progressive world of Drumble and the slowly and reluctantly changing Cranford, finds herself under the village's influence. As an observer, she describes the complex set of rules that governs Cranford society and the social slights they necessitate, not without a sense of regret. She is aware of the absurdity of Cranford society's beliefs and behavior combined with expediency, such as the occasion of Miss Betty Barker's party for the Cranford elite. \\"'Oh, gentility!' thought I, 'can you endure this last shock?'\\" when \\"all sorts of good things for supper\\" appear. \\". . . we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility--which never ate suppers in general--but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\\" More seriously, she pities Miss Matty and her lost love and life, and like her other well-meaning friends determines that she shall be happy.With the arrival of Signor Brunoni and the ensuing panic over the perceived crime wave that seems to hit Cranford, the narrator loses some of her wryness and seems to become nearly as frightened by the rumors of strangers and robberies as her elderly friends. It is the new outsider, Lady Glenmire, who \\"never had heard of any actual robberies; except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.\\" Even while caught up in the panic, however, \\"I could not help being amused at Jenny's position . . ..\\" When she speaks of Jenny's ghost, the narrator says, \\". . . for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be . . ..\\"Through the narrator, who seems to represent Gaskell's own perspective, Cranford pokes gentle fun at a time and place that had already become a fairy tale-like setting, where goodness outdoes pettiness, justice prevails over setbacks and hardships, and even the prodigal son (or prince) can return to set things right. In Cranford, Gaskell reminds the reader of a recent past that is both amusing and moving, a time to look upon fondly but without regret for the changes that Peter and the marriage of Lady Glenmire/Mrs. Hoggins bring about. The one constant in life is change, and in Cranford change is at least as much for the better as for the worse."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives & Daughters and North & South have recently become two of my favorite books, so it stood to reason that I should check out her other novels. When I read Cranford I already knew that it wouldn't have a coherent plot, so I wasn't disappointed about that. What I found was a short but slow read made charming because of Gaskell's humor and elegant style of writing.Plotwise, it reminded me of L.M. Montgomery's stories, because Montgomery usually features young girls being brought up by dominant spinsters in small towns. Cranford doesn't include children of any variety, but similar quirks of aging ladies and domestic life are depicted. Of course, Gaskell's writing is not quite as saccharine as Montgomery's.Men are so rare in this novel that they are great curiosities, to the main characters and to the reader. My only complaint is that the narrator (I think her name was Mary Smith) did not talk more about herself. Was she destined to grow old without love just like her friend Miss Mattie?This isn't a book I would read more than once or twice. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed as much if I hadn't already been obsessed with the author."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not really a novel, but more of a series of stories of the narrators recalling of her time spent in the fictional Cranford. Quite funny in parts (\\"When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity, 'Fetch me \\"Rasselas,\\" my dear , out of the book-room.\\" You know things are going to heat up when someone is going to go and get the Dr.). Once upon a time writers used to have love for their characters they created, which I believe is why so little of fiction from the last 50-100 years or more appeals to me.Unfortunately, the Introduction is a horror of modern criticism bugaboo gone wild. I'm remined of Kerouac's saying \\"I have the critics explaing me to me.\\" This is the sort of intro that trots out the writers (and what about the practise of putting the editor, the person who does the introduction, and the likes, NAME on the cover, inside and everywhere else, as large as the Authors? Its quite funny to look up a writer on Amazon and see someone elses name tagged along, as if Dante and Homer and the rest had a helper writer we didn't know about!) pet peeves and overly biased views: \\"In his healthy appetite for food ('the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,' p. 33) we see an image of sexual appetite, unhampered by social shibboleths.\\" We do? Maybe you do, but I don't. It's amazing how many writers attribute their loony views to poor writers who, in all probability, meant no such thing (Freud, Fraud, Freud...). And they can't refute such nonsense and drivel, most being dead (and being dead being beyond refutation)."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century. This book was first printed as serials as so many books were at that time. By the time Mrs. Gaskell wrote Cranford, she was extremely popular with the English people. This book is essentially a comedy of manners. The people in Cranford live genteelly and they are very proud of that fact even if they don't have much money. The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead. Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful. Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip. This is a book about ladies. There are very few men in it, but we certainly get a good description of the male species from the ladies' observations. It's a wonderful world that Mrs. Gaskell has created for us. Come and meet the wonderful ladies of Cranford."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book wraps you 'round and carries you into into the humble, hilarious and understated society of the women who inhabit the small town of Cranford; it is a treasure that you will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's 1853 novel \\"Cranford\\" is a subtle and often sly portrait of life in a fictional mid-19th century rural English village. At the center of the novel is a circle of spinster and widowed females who wrestle mightily with the challenges of lives of genteel poverty. On its surface, \\"Cranford\\" is a comedy of manners, but its episodes have surprising and often moving depth.\\"Cranford\\" was originally published as a series of short stories, all narrated by Miss Mary Smith, a frequent visitor to the village and the young friend of its leading spinster ladies Miss Deborah and Miss Matty Jenkyns. The chapters are therefore not quite chronological in the telling; characters overlap but plot lines appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear.The narrative works through the relationships of the circle of women, as they deal with births and deaths, marriages, questions of fashion and manners, and such mundane events as a traveling magic show and a bank failure. Men are suffered to live in Cranford, but it seems that it is the women who actually arrange everything important in the village. The reader cannot help but be drawn into their lives through Gaskell's authentic dialogue and superb sense of place.\\"Cranford\\" was the basis for a Masterpiece Theater mini-series in the Spring of 2008, and is well worth reading on its own for its sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle now a distant memory.

Among the particulars that reading Cranford the book put my mind at ease about are why Miss Mattie's brother Peter never wrote or returned home and how Martha and her beau end up married and living with Miss Mattie. Also, after watching the TV series it was a treat to have a little more time to spend with the wonderful women of Cranford in their book forms."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is one of the better-known novels of the 19th century English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. It was first published in 1851 as a serial in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. The fictional town of Cranford is closely modelled on Knutsford in Cheshire, which Mrs. Gaskell knew well. The book has little in the way of plot and is more a series of episodes in the lives of Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two spinster sisters.But what is it about Cranford and its deceptively simple tales of country life that makes the work so appealing? It has been aptly described as \`a piece of exquisite social painting' ... \`tender' and \`delicate.' Narrated by Mary Smith, a friend of Miss Matty and frequent visitor to Cranford, the lives, loves, tragedies, and triumphs of the inhabitants of Cranford are woven together seamlessly to create a tapestry portraying timeless emotions and choices.The petty social bickering, cold shouldering and jockeying for importance in the village's pecking order are outlined in a humorous yet pointed way--the author loves her characters, with all their faults, and is tolerant of their foibles while holding them up to gentle ridicule. In every community there is an arbiter of good taste, a setter of trends, a leader of public opinion, and all the other social whimsies that make up this colourful collection of characters. It is not easy to keep secrets in this closed environment, and as Mary Smith remarks, \\"It was impossible to live a month at Cranford, and not know the daily habits of each resident ....\\" Despite the squabbles and occasional \`no speaks,' the ladies of Cranford would rather die than see one of their own fall by the wayside. It is the community spirit that inspires Miss Matty's friends to decide to donate a portion of their annual income to sustain their beloved friend when an investment goes sour.As a different kind of history book and one that very possibly the author did not set out to write as such, Cranford is actually an analysis of an early Victorian country town. The inhabitants are shaken and disturbed by inevitable changes such as industrialization, the advent of the railway and other events that force an inescapable transition into an increasingly modern world.The appeal of Cranford cannot be better described than in the popularity of the BBC drama series. The teleplay by Heidi Thomas was adapted from three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell published between 1849 and 1858: Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions. (The Last Generation in England was also used as a source.)A gentle, charming read, Cranford has much more to offer the discerning reader than a unassuming look at country life."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This was a birthday gift for my younger granddaughter.

They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face). I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension. The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans. The introduction by Charlotte Mitchell says a lot more about the place of this book in feminist history. Basically it is something you'd read for historical interest rather than immediate entertainment.

The makers of that series used the authors name, the title of the book and some of the characters but the remainder of their production is pure invention. I am enjoying watching the BBC program, but it is not this book.Ms Charlotte Mitchell provides an Introduction and Notes for this book. It is my belief that it is essesntial to read the Introduction in order to fully understand Cranford. Elizabeth Gaskell had written a series of stories which appeared at irregular intervals in a magazine edited by Charles Dickens titled Household Words. The stories first appeared together as a novel in 1853. Ms Mitchell uses the Introduction to explain the chronology for the publishing of this and other novels by Elizabeth Gaskell. She also takes this opportunity to explore the question of whether or not Cranford was ever meant to be taken seriously by readers of Ms Gaskell since her other novels are so very different in tone from this one.One of the things I really appreciate which Ms Mitchell did was to include the Notes section to explain words and phrases which appear in the book which were very well understood in the 1800's but which may be unfamiliar to readers today. I read a lot of historical romantic fiction and these Notes gave me concrete explanations for words and phrases I have been too lazy to research for myself. I thought I knew what they meant before, now I know for sure. Items such as:1. gigot - a sleeve style described as leg-of-mutton2. baby-house - a dolls house3. sarsenet - a soft thin silk material4. blind man's holiday - a proverbial term for night or twilightMs Mitchell states in the Introduction that Gaskell later came to regret the fact that she had caused Colonel Brown to be killed in the first story. If he had remained a character longer in the series, I think that Cranford might have gone in a very different direction. As it is, Cranford is the story of a certain class of women, either unmarried or widowed, who live in a small English villiage. The main character is Miss Matty Jenkyns who only comes into prominence after the death of her older sister, Miss Deborah. The women relish their lack of male inhabitants and see themselves as lucky in not having to deal with the ways of men, which they see as uncouth and almost barbaric (they will speak too loud!). There is a very strict social structure among these women, even as to what time of day they can visit each other and what kind of clothes they should be wearing when the visits take place. These rules are in place to keep everyone on an even keel, so that everyone understands the rules, and no one may change the rules without the approval of the most prestigious ranking member of their set.Cranford is a study in contrasts. The differences in the male approach to the world, with their freedoms, and the female approach to the world, with all the restrictions placed upon them. I can honestly say that I had fun reading this book. I grinned, smiled, chuckled and even laughed out loud. No episode was too tiny to cause a complete, unrealistic upheaval among the ladies of Cranford. One of my favorite parts of the story concerns how they all react when rumor and half-truths have them convinced that a gang of thieves and burglars are roaming the countryside. It is funny and heartwarming but also sad to see the lengths they go to in order to protect themselves and their households from these thieves who are, in reality, simply the result of gossip and overactive imaginations. Another part I am particularly fond of is when the main characters allow themselves to unbend to the extent of divulging to their friends what their worst fear is. Miss Matty revealed that she was afraid each night that a man was hiding under her bed. Her method of reassuring herself that no person was there was actually quite astute and surprising for this woman's character. But Cranford is not all warm feelings and quaint happenings. There are real tragedies which effect these women and move their lives into totally different directions.This book is told in the narrative style, something which I usually do not like. There is very little dialogue. The name of the narrator is not even mentioned until page 137. I had read the persons name in the Introduction but I was very surprised to see that this type of presentation did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all. It is not the most exciting book I have ever read, it is not a very long book, and it does not require much stretching of the readers intellect but I enjoyed all of the time I spent reading it and will certainly read it over and over.Very highly recommended for any reader who enjoys historical fiction. It is not a romance, more a journal of the everyday lives of women who depend on themselves and their friends for comfort and companionship."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This Viking edition includes \\"Mr. Harrison's Confession,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow,\\" the three novellascombined to produce the Cranford BBC series. The works are quite different from each other, \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" differing the most in tone and style.\\"Mr. Harrison's Confession\\" is the droll account of a young doctor who comes to Dunscombe (a Cranford stand-in) to practice with the much older Mr. Morgan, an old friend of his father's. As young Harrison makes the transition from the lively streets of London to the quaint lanes of the little town to which he has moved, he is involved in many humorous misunderstandings--and especially troublesome are those caused by a prankster friend of his! There are poignant moments too, as Mr. Harrison and the townspeople learn to know each other, and the young doctor finds love.\\"Cranford\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the three novellas, and easily the most readily absorbed by the modern reader. To one who grew up in New England of swamp Yankee parentage, the mindset of the Cranford ladies is completely familiar. Why care about dress when everyone in your town knows what clothes you own, and why care when you are away where no one knows you at all? The various subplots of the story are very reminiscent Sarah Orne Jewett, who wrote a few decades later in the US--\\"The Country of the Pointed Firs,\\" for example. The novel comprises several interlocking stories centering on Miss Matilda Jenkyns, her family and her friends who inhabit the little town of Cransford--a town of Amazons. Very few men live in the village. Though many of the stories are humorous, there are those that touch the heart.\\"My Lady Ludlow\\" is the most old-fashioned of the three novellas--set decades before the others at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and full of sentiment. Lady Ludlow, herself in old age, must learn to change as the world around her does. The story, narrated by a young woman in frail health, from the vantage point of later years, contains a lengthy and melodramatic subplot reminiscent of \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"\\"Cranford\\" is a wonderful piece of work, and the other two novellas are very enjoyable. Especially if you liked the BBC series, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" is likely the best known novel of Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. The novel follows the day-to-day social lives of a group of upper-middle-class women in the small, fictional town of Cranford, England. Rather than having a strong narrative, the novel delivers a tableau of social goings on that illuminate the characters and their lives. These stories are told largely through the eyes of a younger lady (Miss Mary Smith) who often visits from a nearby town. The ladies of Cranford are not rich, but wealthy enough to belong to a certain social strata, and much of the comedy derives from their careful considerations of who to include and exclude at various social gatherings. Miss Matty is essentially the main protagonist, and she is a basically kind woman if a bit miserly, especially when it comes to candles. She and her friends typically look to the most prominent member of Cranford female society, Miss Jamieson, and then assiduously follow her lead. Unfortunately, Miss Jamieson is sometimes rather narrow-minded, unlike the other ladies, which creates certain socially awkward situations.This enjoyable novel may seem a bit meandering to some readers, given that there is not a main narrative thread. The novel was originally published in serialized form in \\"Household Words\\" (edited by Charles Dickens), which may partially help explain its lack of a strong plot. Indeed, the 2007 BBC mini-series versions of \\"Cranford\\" included stories from several of Gaskell's other novels. However, the stories here all add up to a devastatingly accurate picture of small town life and the sometimes vicious yet amusing ways in which people in them behave. Gaskell clearly understood human nature, and readers are likely to recognize many truths about human foibles in her stories. I found myself laughing and touched often.Note: This review is for the Kindle version. The text is well-arranged and does not contain any noticeable errors, although there are lots of spaces in between section and subsections (which actually makes reading easier). This version has no extras, such as a biography of Gaskell or an introduction to the text; however, such materials are so easily available on the internet now that this exclusion is not a major debit."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"To you scoffers who find this novel uneventful - I say read it again toward the close of your life. The stories of these genteel ladies with their 40 year old lost loves and their strong familial relationships are very moving. I also like the way the book is contructed in a series of vignettes. But most of all I am enchanted with the \\"feel\\" of the portrait of village life in the middle of the 19th century - such a contrast with the mores of today it's hard to believe we are the same species! If you like Mrs. Gaskell, be sure to read Barbara Pym for the 20th century version."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have just discovered this wonderful author after watching \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre. I ordered several of her titles and I am hooked. I will read everything she has written. As someone who always wished that Jane Austen had written just one more book (or two or five or forty!!!), Elizabeth Gaskell is a real find. Her works are more \\"worldly\\" than the mild Miss Austen, but her characters are just as compelling and I love her."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I read this series of village sketches as an independent study and found that it is most commonly referred to as &quot;charming.&quot; This so called charm is achieved through the humourous realism with which Gaskell depicts the citizens of the small, rural town of Cranford. The women presented are 'old maids' and though genteel, their economic status is far from certain. Perhaps the tender concern Gaskell shows for their welfare, and the friendship demonstrated for a friend in need is most pivotal in creating the charm of the novel. This book has the feel of a 'chick flick': no grand action necessarily, but little episodes of social excitement followed by periods of daily activity. The book provides both comic scenes and tear-jerkers and the method of storytelling could be likened to that of movies such as &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; or &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Delightful, surely one of the most charming novels ever written. Using the lightest of touches, Mrs. Gaskell pokes fun at the simple people who inhabit the provincial community of Cranford in rural England in the 1840s, a village we are told at the beginning that is curiously \\"in possession of the Amazons\\": its male inhabitants nowhere to be found. Told in the form of reports by a frequent visitor to the village (Mary Smith) from a more cosmopolitan place, we are made privy to the disappointments, hopes, fears, and affronts of a number of the female residents, particularly Miss Matty Jenkyns and Mrs. Jamieson. All are related humorously, some wildly so. My favorite scenes include Mrs. Jamieson's defense of Samuel Johnson over Captain Brown's preference for Dickens's Boz and the sad story of Peter Jenkyns who is insulted by his father and runs away to join the navy. But every chapter offers its delights, and it's easy to see, as Frank Swinnerton mentions in the introduction, how many people at one time knew the book by heart. Long a best seller in the Everyman's Library, it's sad to see the book not included in the recent reissue of 100 of that library's most popular books, a gross oversight for sure."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Sherwood Anderson once described life as a \\"history of moments\\". Miss Gaskell has created in Cranford a glimpse into a dying culture of the more egalitiarian rural Bitish Yoemanry of the 18th century collapsing under the urbanization of the society and with a more repressive capitalism to claim the lives and souls of the youth leaving the village for better lives. Goldsmith's the \\"Deserted Village\\" comes to mind.The story is told from the lives of elderly mostly female, spinster as well as widowed community of genteel rural poverty- self imposed and otherwise. Quaint yet, but with vinegary pithiness of death, stoicism and social veneer, in other words real life. This is civilized 19th century social writing at its best, like a journalistic Austen. The narrator is a wise insightful character commenting on the eccentric and slightly mad village women who make up this world. The rivalry between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns based upon their literary preference of Dr. Johnson vs Charles Dickens is especially amusing considering that Cranford first appeared in Dicken's magazine, \\"Household Words\\". Endearing and haunting- much more than its surface appearance."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Reading \\"Cranford\\" is a lot like spending an afternoon in the doily museum of a provincial city; you can't help but admire the skill of the embroidery but you have to wonder at your own sanity for being there. I stuffed the book in my carry-on, as a relief from the 20th C anguish in the novels I'd been reading recently, and found myself waiting out a snow delay with nothing to read but this staid portrayal of a circle of spinsters nourished chiefly by their own proprieties. Cranford is not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches of the old-fashioned manners and quaint habits of genteel but impoverished provincial ladies, gently satirical, a porcelain cup counterpart to Charles Dickens's \\"Pickwick Papers\\". Dickens is explicitly mentioned in several chapters of Cranford; Miss Dorothy Jenkyns, the most literary of the Cranford ladies, finds him vulgar and less eloquent in every way than Dr. Johnson.Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens were quite well acquainted with each other's work; in fact \\"Cranford\\" was first published in serial form in one of Dickens's magazines. There are many parallels, particularly between Dickens's \\"Hard Times\\" and Gaskell's \\"North and South\\". Both books focus on the dire conditions of labor in 19th C England; both can be considered liberal protest novels. I suppose Gaskell is never as knee-slapping funny as Dickens can be, but she has other virtues, closer to Trollope, in terms of cogent story-telling and sympathetic insight into characters of all classes and both genders.Gaskell was totally 'out of fashion' when I went to college. The luminaries of Victorian literature, as taught at Harvard in the 1960s, were Eliot, Austen, and the Brontes, with Dickens and Thackeray cast as their knaves and Trollope as their butler. But Gaskell has made a comeback. Aside from \\"North and South\\", her novels \\"Ruth\\", \\"Sylvia's Lovers\\", \\"Wives and Daughters,\\" and others are in print and well worth reading. As her titles suggest, her feminism was more overt than that of her peers, and her sympathies were clearly 'liberal' in the current American political sense. Above all, she could tell a good story.Cranford was immensely popular in its time, when perhaps most readers had their own maiden aunts to caricature. It's quite well done in its way, but if you've never read Gaskell before, I wouldn't suggest starting with it. You might find it challenging to sit quietly with the ladies as they crochet and dither over their bonnets."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Quaint\\" is the first word that comes to mind. I would almost describe it as one of Eliot's idyllic novels, if it had been written by Dickens. I would say that, if it weren't a disservice to all the authors involved. Jane Austen would be a more apt comparison, if Austen's works were more episodic. Mrs. Gaskell has a sweetness and a wit throughout the novel, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the inhabitants of Cranford, that brings to mind both the works of Dickens and Austen--especially the characterizations, which are quite good. This is important, as with only a thin veil of a plot to tie to chapters together, the responsibility of drawing the reader in falls solely on the shoulders of her characters. Moving from incident to incident, as was not uncommon in Victorian novels, the novel begs us to pay attention simply because the characters are worth giving our attention. Obviously, a weak novel is one wants to study plot, but one could certainly choose a worth book to pick up to study the art of comedic characterization. With less on it's mind than some of Gaskell's other works--from what I've read--Cranford is an easy, enjoyable read, but far from life changing. It is simply a well-written, enjoyable read, and there's nothing wrong with that. Something to enjoy over afternoon tea."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Last winter, I rented Cranford, the BBC miniseries (starring Judi Dench), from Netflix--and that got me interested in the book on which that's based. The book is a series of vignettes about the ladies of the town of Cranford, many of whom are elderly spinsters like Miss Matty Jenkyns and her sister Deborah, or Miss Pole (much as I tried not to, I kept seeing Judi Dench and Imelda Staunton in the roles of Miss Matty and Miss Pole).This short story differs significantly from the miniseries; the miniseries focuses a lot on the encroachment of the railways on the town of Cranford, and there's a romantic subplot going on there. The book is much more centered on the middle-aged and elderly ladies of the town, as seen through a semi-outsider, Miss Mary Smith, the daughter of a family friend of the Jenkynses.As another reviewer said on Librarything, reading about the ladies of Cranford is a lot like reading about the Golden Girls. This is a very lighthearted, funny book in many places, but still very touching. The ladies are very provincial, focused on the mundane details of their lives--but very loyal to one another, as seen when Matty looses her money and her friends conspire to help her out. It took a few pages for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was fully engaged in the lives of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have always been a fan of 19th century novels and many of my favorite authors come from this time period. I have never read anything by Gaskill, and finally grabbed this book after seeing the BBC miniseries of the same name.It was a sentimental look at several spinsters in the town of Cranford, all of which are likable and good people. The overall tone of the book was very positive, with one of the main lessons showing that people love to help genuinely good people. It is a nice contrast to many novels that show the worst in people.Note that this does not match the BBC series in all aspects since the BBC series took all 3 Cranford books and condensed them into a miniseries, but many of the episodes from the book are included with modifications. I enjoyed the book and the TV show, even though they did not match exactly.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this type of literature and who wants a refreshing glance as a time that was."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"...I came to the conclusion that this printing of Cranford has the CUTEST cover (i.e. a pretty teacup and a great font), therefore I bought it.My wife agreed.Mission accomplished hubbie. Mission accomplished.But seriously, if you or your wife are into Jane Austen(ish) stuff like my wife, Cranford is a MUST have. And of all the printed versions, this one is by far the cutest looking, which apparently is somewhat important to wives who like Jane Austen and her crowd of Victorian/Regency era authors. If you're a husband looking for a gift for your wife, this is a great one.And definitely buy her the DVD bundle of Cranfod and return to Cranford.And definitely buy her the DVD first few seasons of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\".Believe me...it's worth the money.She'll feel like you understand her a little bit...and she'll have some of her friends over for a \\"girl night\\" where they watch their DVDs and drink tea and dream about living in mid nineteenth century Britain, and you'll be able to work on the car/the yard/whatever without feeling like you're neglecting your wife because she'll be having way more fun than you.That's worth any price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Explore the 3 life perspectives of the folks in Cranford and surrounds and you'll settle in for a cup of tea at Miss Matty's in no time. These are the 3 character-filled and -driven collections that the PBS Cranford series and Return to Cranford series were adapted from, so I recommend Gaskell's set here for any and all who've enjoyed the film versions.And this particular offering from Amazon is priced so frugally even Cranford's own Miss Deborah would approve. So, settle into Cranford for the summertime and enjoy the rhythm of their lives."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Inspired to grab a copy of the book after seeing the PBS series, I am very pleased with this version of Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell. With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the \\"tea cup\\" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I was inspired to read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell after watching the PBS/BBC miniseries last year. The town of Cranford is dominated by women. There are relatively few men, at least in the social circle of the characters in this book. The main characters are all single, either spinsters or widows, and they fiercely guard their way of life.The book, originally published serially in 1853 in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, is a series of vignettes of the daily life of Miss Mathilda Jenkyns. This book is definitely character driven and starts off slow. Nothing truly exciting ever happens in Cranford and you have to get to know the characters before you understand how small disruptions can make huge waves in their lives. Gaskell manages to convey how important small events are to these characters. You get the sense that if anything big ever happened they'd die from the shock. The narrator, Mary Smith, a frequent (and slightly more worldly) visitor to the town tries to keep molehills from turning into mountains and for the most part is successful. But, sometimes even she gets sucked into the daily drama.Fans of the miniseries might be disappointed with the book. Many of the funniest storylines from the series are added. But, the loyalty and friendship the characters display towards each other should endear this book to all but the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"When I finished the last sentence of Cranford, I was so sad. I was so sorry that it was over, that I would not be sharing more time with these wonderful people, especially the dear and familiar Miss Matty. I was moved to laugh and cry over the events of this book, and I will not forget the parts that touched me most. I found the most real and lovely part of the book was when the friends came together when Miss Matty needed them most, and they did this just as real friends do, without mentioning it. I have purchased the mini-series and look forward to watching that, but nothing compares to the days and nights I spent \\"walking\\" the streets of Cranford and sharing an inside knowledge of all that was going on."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This novella has a good deal of charm and real feeling--I don't think you'll soon forget Miss Matty, who is the center of these little stories, even if her older sister was much more forceful in character. The efforts of the ladies of the village--and it is pretty much ladies--to cope with limited incomes, burglars, death, love, tea, cows, servants, and addressing the nobility are both funny and poignant. However much they bicker and contend with each other, when the chips are down, you'll find them (or their handmaidens) at the door with the 19th century equivalent of a casserole. (For one born in New England, these ladies are very reminiscent of much older relatives.)Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book.

It is a story about a town and it's upper crust society among middle aged spinsters.

There are times when I wondered why I continued to plow through to the end."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have the video and the book 'Cranford' and enjoyed both.

Unlike Austen, she provides not only the humorous descriptions of characters' actions and speech; she will at some point explain how that character came to be the way he/she is. I bought this because I had seen a PBS series based on the Gaskell's books. The TV shows omitted some characters and subplots and shortened or combined some actions. Even if you've seen the Cranston TV series, the novels are enjoyable because of the depth. They are a really good read."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book was very entertaining.

How can be sure to get the right one?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I hate to be a naysayer, but I truly do not understand the appeal of this book. Old maids sit about pinching pennies (or farthings) poke their heads outdoors to frown on their neighbors and head back inside to grouse. A reader of this review commented that some of the details (I considered them banalities) do indeed constitute spoilers and therefore I have deleted them from this edited version (12/5/11).That same reader was kind enough to point out the history of the novel which explains its disjointed narrative and lack of cohesion. Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion. The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot. Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end? A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored. Some of the reviewers here have compared Gaskell to Austen. Sorry but not even close.I can't imagine this being a Masterpiece Theater selection. Did they film Judi Dench taking an hour long nap?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"...do try the book. I had to read this at school at 14 (so often enough to put anyone off anything) but it has remained an absolute favourite which hardly anyone else seemed to have read until recently.

You will know what I mean - but you'll need something to wipe away a tear!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It is fun to read the book from which the TV miniseries was taken.

I think that it is good to have both and to explore more of Gaskell's creations."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is a delight and an idyll of calm in our clamorous twenty-first century world of clutter and clatter! The short novel was first serialized in Charles Dicken's edited periodical \\"Household Words\\" during 1853. Its author was Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) of Manchester who was the wife of the Unitarian pastor William Gaskell. Despite a busy life of charity work, raising several children and a wide correspondence she managed to develop into a fine novelist. Gaskell was friendly with Florence Nightingale and became the biographer of her good friend Charlotte Bronte. This novel has become a popular miniseries on BBC TV and is being broadcast in the United States on the Masterpiece program on PBS.Cranford tells the story of Miss Debroah and Miss Matty Jenkyns late middle aged daughters of a Church of England clergyman. We visit their quiet world of sewing, morning visits to friends, afternoon teas and trips to church events. We learn that they are old fashioned disdaining the coming of the railroad. Miss Deborah engages in a very humorous argument with Captain Brown (significantly this character is killed by a train) over whether Dr. Samuel Johnson or Charles Dickens is the best writer. We learn that Miss Matty had been courted by the eccentric farmer Mr. Holbrook. We learn he has 26 cows or one for each letter of the alphabet. Holbrook dies as an old man after fulfilling his dream of visiting Paris. We discover the story of the siblings wandering brother Peter who leaves home after a quarrel with their stern father. Peter becomes a sailor. Several years later he returns from India to be reacquainted with his surviving sister Matty and his friends in Cranford.We meet such eccentric old maids as Miss Pole and learn of other residents of the tiny village. Cranford is based on Knustsford the village in which Mrs. Gaskell grew to womanhood. Knustford is located close to Manchester in the industrial north of Great Britain.One of the most heartwarming tales of Cranford is to see how the friends of Miss Matty rally around and support her when she loses all of her money in a bank which failed.Cranford is a gentle glance into a rural England which only exists on the printed page. It is a loving little story of ordinary men and women bound together by blood, love and common interests. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time. But there isn't much of a plot. Far more worthy are Mary Barton, North and South or her others, I can't comment on Ruth as I haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Such a very pleasant read and gives a nice view into the lives of spinster/widow women of the 1850's in England. This particular Kindle version is very well formatted."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This story is wonderful if you love to read about people, their quirks, their daily life. The story itself is not what the book is focused on but instead it's about this group of women in a small English town and their view of life and the odd inner workings of their minds. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I believe there is also a movie made but it might be hard to track down. So far my favourite Elizabeth Gaskell book is North and South."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Just fun to read. Easy to become a part of the setting and to know the characters. Just plain enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It took a few pages and a bit of patience to appreciate the voice of the author- but once my modern mind slowed sufficiently to the pace of a small town, and the understated comedy of little quirks and eccentricities of character and custom, it was very enjoyable. Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford. Has many elements from the BBC mini-series but in many ways quite different."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" like the village to which it refers (only 30 miles by train from the larger town of Drumble in which narrator Mary Smith and her father now live) offers multum in parvo as Rector Jenkyns might have said: much in little.Woven together in chapters that build quietly but skillfully on each other are the stories of Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matilda Jenkyns, their friends Miss Pole, Mrs FitzAdams, Mrs Forrester, Captain Brown and his daughters Miss Brown and Miss Jessie, Lady Glenmire, the Honorable Mrs Jamieson, Signoir Brunoni and his wife, the requited and unrequited lovers, the servants Martha and Mr Mullinare and others sketched swiftly but memorable such as Mr ffoulkes who was so very choice and Mrs ffarington whom he married \\"...and all because of the ff's in her name\\" though being very genteel, pretty,and wealthy were no hinderance.Connected aned interdependent they are: had Signoir Brunoni not performed in Cranford, had he and his family not been sheltered during his illness by a kind innkeeper and his wife, had the ladies of Cranford not discovered his plight and come to the rescue, then Mary Smith would not have heard the story of the wife's journey through India to protect their daughter Pearl, of the kindness of a plantation owner,a Mr. Jenkyns....and she would not have written to him thinking he might be the Miss Jenkyn's long-lost brother, Peter, and more yet would not have ensued.We care about the little town whose portrait is drawn in \\"Cranford,\\" drawn in the watercolors of Beatrix Potter and with the same precision of observation. The much that we get in this book includes a compassionate study of life in a small English town in the early 1800s before Victoria, using as Austin does, the stratum of families (mostly single and widowed women) who saw themselves as genteel though needing to practice elegant economy as the viewpoint. We get writing where each word is exquisitely chosen yet unpretentious; we get a quiet but clear sense of the social stratification where servants were kindly treated but unpaid including the little workhouse maiden whose arms were too small to carry a tea-tray. We get laughter as in the story of Miss Betsy Barker's cow going to pasture in grey flannel after she lost her hair when she fell into the lime-pit.Most of all, we get love: the love between sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers; the love between men and women;lovingkindness to strangers; and the love between the lifelong friends who are the women of Cranford.My copy is over 100 years old, illustrated in pen and ink drawings that are as witty and compassionate as Mrs Gaskell's writing. Found it in an odd lot in a Maine shop years ago, and it has been a good companion since, timeless as good stories and beautifully written work is, from Gilgamesh on."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"There are rules and regulations at Cranford, and women, and a society of women. The town keeps early hours. The inhabitmts of the town exchange kind acts.Captain Brown is killed by a railroad as he removes a small child from the rails. There is a general absence of men in Cranford, but not of the kind of young men suitable for dating the servants. The central postion in the story is occupied by Mathilda Jenkyns, daughter of a clergyman, an unmarried woman.The author has amusing ways of describing the people in the village, their quirks, their eccentricities, their habits. One character prefers Mr. Boz, (Dickens), to Dr. Johnson. Miss Mathilda Jenkyns is persuaded by her friends to visit Mr. Holbrook, a former beau who was considered by a member of her family to be unsuitable. The guests wonder whether it is possible to eat peas with the utensils provided. Shortly after the visit Mr. Holbrook dies to the secret consternation of Miss Matty Jenkyns.From letters it is learned that her mother expected Matty Jenkyns to grow up to become a great beauty. Her brother Peter, after mischief-making and being whipped by her father, disappears. He is sighted in Liverpool and it is understood his employment takes him to India. He sends his mother a shawl and then the family ceases to hear anything about him.Mrs. Gaskell describes a milliners shop in Cranford and another establishment selling general goods. Expenditure of dress in Cranford is mainly a case of new caps. A hostess gives her dog cream with his tea and her guests, milk. In misfortune, a bank failure, kindness and love are bestowed by friends and associates for the victim's support and betterment. Harmony, reciprocity are the qualities clearly evidenced.The appendix contains an essay of Gaskell's,\\"The Last Generation in England,\\" which bears upon her knowledge of the sort of society portrayed in CRANFORD."},{"Title":"Sports Illustrated NCAA Womens Basketball Championship Commemorative Issue, 2007","review":"This is a great commerative issue with some awesome photos from the best basketball team in 2007. a true keepsake for any true basketball fan-well except the ny guy who should be thrown off the boards for his retarted comments."},{"Title":"Spongebob Squarepants Trivia Book","review":"This is a fantastic, wholesome cartoon. Finally, something that is fun for young and old alike. I find myself calling the kids in so I don't feel guilty about watching it alone. This cartoon has everything: a good messsage, and a lot of fun. This book is a perfect companion. We've had a lot of fun with trivia questions when we're out."},{"Title":"Spongebob Squarepants Trivia Book","review":"I am a big fan of Spongebob, despite my age. Yes, the cartoon is for young kids, around 5 - 10, but the producers made it sure that there are jokes that is aimed for mature audiences, to entertain watching parents or to those who are simply looking to feed their inner child.Now the book, I can say is very informative and funny. You can learn a lot that surrounds the life of our yellow, squared friend; from what he thinks about his friends to the menu and price of the foods in the Krusty Krabs - all said in Spongebob fashion - stupidly funny. There are only a few quizzes though(so why call it trivia book?), like a driving quiz(it starts like a real driving test, but ends up very funny and silly, number 9 and 10 cracked me up!), and match up who said certain quotes(which I admit is quite challenging). Infos about the cartoons (and out) are in this book too.I gave it 4 stars because for a Spongebob fanatic, there are only a few things that you dont know. Most of it, you do; and some parts here are taken from episodes, like how to blow a bubble(\\"do this\\"?, to those who seen it in TV we know its from an episode, but to those who hasnt wont get it - they should have added pictures to those!). I think it is more aimed for newer fans, and to the very fanatic of fanatics... in the end, I still recommend this book, cuz even though we know most of it, the way they explained it still makes you laugh, its like watching reruns of Spongebob, we know what will happen but will still bring tons of laugh."},{"Title":"Spongebob Squarepants Trivia Book","review":"Very cute book for fans of Spongebob.

It is a total of 44 pages, more than half of which are drawings and the majority of the rest are things that anyone that has seen more than a dozen episodes of Spongebob already know. For example, it tells you who SB's neighbors and friends are, what they like, where they live and where SB works! Why they couldn't make a fun trivia book with the answers at the end is incredible. My 8 year old thought it totally lame and I totally agree. Take my advice and don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Spongebob Squarepants Trivia Book","review":"I love SpongeBob!

Badly printed photographs and reproduced drawings (plan, section etc) occupies most of the volume. Each of the project is provided with a journalistic review that an undergraduate student in any reputable university could utter. There is no technical data to support the writings. For example, nobody in their right mind would call the Treasury Building in Singapore an environmentally friendly building. To promote environmental design, we do not need pseudo-science. My advise is: save your money, buy a science fiction, you probably get better advice there. For me, I have bin the book."},{"Title":"Between Sundays: Black Women and Everyday Struggles of Faith (George Gund Foundation Book in African American Studies)","review":"I had a chance to read an early copy of this book. (Full disclosure: I know Dr. Frederick personally.) As an anthropologist of religion, I very much appreciated her careful ethnographic work in understanding the subject of African-American spirituality. As she points out, the Black Church in the U.S. is generally understood in political and institutional terms; individual experiences of faith get elided into the overarching category of &quot;The Black Church.&quot; Thus whether people see this church as a good thing (progressive social institution, empowering ideology) or a bad thing (patriarchal institution of control) they do not necessarily see the nuanced understandings that individuals can hold. Frederick's book is a wonderful companion to those focusing on the history of the black church as an institution or political agent by bringing in the ethnographcially rich element of faith, interpretation and agency from the 'ground up.' Her own perspective as an anthropologist trained at Duke, now a faculty member at Harvard, an African-American woman from the South and a practicing Christian provides a richness to her analysis and relationship with her subject that is often absent from these sorts of works. Well written, interesting, and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Business of Child Care: Management and Financial Strategies","review":"This book is a must for anyone starting up a daycare business or for those whose creditors are demanding a financial and/or business plan. I created my business plan using this and other resources, but this was by far the most helpful. The spreadsheet examples took half the work out of my way, and I was able to set it all up in Excel using her strategies. With my spreadsheets in hand I was able to back into my expenses using her method, and then work my way into the rates charged from there (as opposed to setting rates and then realizing later that my costs exceeded my cash flow). A very helpful resource!"},{"Title":"The Business of Child Care: Management and Financial Strategies","review":"This is the most helpful book I have bought.

Finally, an author of a vocab building book has figured out an effective, yet simple method to build vocabulary. And that is to learn a new vocabulary word across three contexts - in a phrase, matching it with a synonym, and using it to fill in narrative. Thus, the 1100 words are learned in multiple contexts and that is the way vocabulary occurs naturally (in sentences, in texts, in writing and in reading). The only reason I would give it a four is that no book can really 'teach' the subtleties of meaning a word may have in varying contexts. \\"Real life\\" texts read consistently with the same word occurring in slightly different situations is the way to really grasp the 'essence' of the word. For a book, this one does the job at least as well as any--definitely better than the test prep books for the SAT and similar torturous trials in demonstrating knowledge"},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"I tutor kids both in school and privately and I find vocabulary is one of the most important things for passing reading and writing tests.

Great for vocab building though and I will keep using it."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"I purchased this book in 11th grade and was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was. The book expects you to do about 5 words (and one idiom) four days of the week, but I personally went the extra mile and did a \\"week\\" (24 flash cards, 20 words and 4 idioms) per day over the summer break. I'm almost done with the book now. If you're willing to fully delve into the program, you'll definitely see some improvement. While some may think I went a little too fast, in the initial passages for each day (in which they use all of the day's words in a coherent paragraph in conjunction with previous words), I always made sure to extract the words from previous days (denoted with an asterisk in the passage) and define them on a separate piece of paper, to ensure that I completely retained the information. Also, as I alluded to earlier, I used flash cards (the result being my desk having a surfeit of index cards...over 1000 at the moment).All in all, despite my deviation from the standard program, the book is extremely good, and I recommend it to anyone who seeks to augment their vocabulary skills.

I really enjoy it so far."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"What I like best about this book is that it's not centered on high school standardized testing. It's also for college students who want to improve their grades, as written on the cover. The selection of the words of this book extends well beyond what a public school expects of a high school senior. Also, this book is presented very professionally, you might want to consider getting this book for your kid when he's/she's in middle school. That way, it's much more likely he'll/she'll not only get an A in English when he/she goes to high school, but also get accelerated to advanced placement! AP courses usually come into play in junior year, so stress the value of this book in freshman and sophomore year, but don't stop afterwards! That way, when your kid goes to college, he'll/she'll most likely take English 102 or English 111 in his/her first year instead of English 101, depending on the college's policy on AP credits. I think that's a much better idea than getting a book like \\"100 Words Every Middle Schooler Should Know\\", because if you get this book instead, the preparation will make your loved one stand out rather than working at grade level. It's an incontrovertible fact: English is the most important subject in high school and college. Math comes in at a close second. Everybody needs to know how to work with words and numbers. Take them both seriously and expect nothing but the best!"},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"This is a fantastic workbook for new vocabulary and for learning some common English idioms.

I only have the original edition. I don't even know when it was printed. All I know is that my mom got the book back in the late 80s. The book was incredibly old by the time I started to use it.When I decided to study for my GRE, I began with this book. The book provides an easy means to remember new vocabulary as all the words are in context, and there is a storyline to it. The only problem with this text is that the student often have to consult the dictionary for a clearer definition of a word. Thus, requiring more time on each section then needed.However, the word choice is very good. When I first started my GRE Verbal model exams, I could only get somewhere between 350~450. After this book, I was scoring solid 400~500.The way I studied this book was much faster than the pace suggested by the author. I actually took on one week every day. That is 25 words each day, because I was in such a hurry to build up my vocabulary for GRE examination.After finishing this book, I continued to use other vocabulary builders to build up my verbal power to eventually 670 in Verbal.The next book that I used is:Word Smart: Building an Educated VocabularyAs a final note, I would recommend this book to people who have at least a more decent word power to save the time from constantly consulting the dictionary.

While my peer students flocked together and weren't paying much attention to developing their linguistic skills I ploughed through this book and brought my English vocabulary to a level higher than of an average native speaker. There is only one caveat that should be taken with this book. The words, in isolation, do not teach you how to speak plain English. The right combinations of words is what distinguishes a good English speaker from a person who possesses a rich vocabulary. These combinations are called collocations. Therefore, this book should be used in conjunction with a good collocation dictionary since many of the words in it cannot be used in all occasions. For instance, the word \\"inclement\\" which appears in this book can be used only with a word \\"weather\\" which creates a unique collocation. Unfortunately, the book serves the reader the words but does not teach them when and how to use them.Another salient feature of this book is the ability of it to improve your brain capabilities. One of them is your memory. Once you develop a study regimen in which you religiously memorise the words in this book your memory will begin to improve immensely. When I had begun with this book, memorising five words was a mammoth task; however, in more advanced stages I was able to memorise more than twenty - forty words in the same amount of time as before. This is an invaluable skill which can be handy in many aspects of life.It has been mentioned that this book contains quite a few mistakes, which is true. However I believe that the mistakes do not stymie the learning process in any way. An attentive reader will easily identify them and will arrive at a correct answer and understanding anyway.I believe that for both native and non-native speakers the quest of mastery of English is long and arduous. Even after memorising the whole book there is a lingering feeling that there is still a massive void in your vocabulary which sometimes can be frustrating. However, with the skills acquired, this void will be slowly disappearing over your life. Believe me I know what I am talking about."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"I needed this book for a class at school. I found it to be very long and boring.

The presentation and layout are excellent, the extracts are interesting and informative, and the &quot;Panorama&quot; section is relevant. I am concerned, however, about the errors in the answer section and the occasional typo. I have found a total of 21 errors - surely too high for a text which aims to &quot;improve college grades&quot; and to help you &quot;score high on the SAT1&quot;.

The text stimulates and preps your mind to soak up the definition of each word by first showing you its use in a paragraph, then testing you with fill-in-the blank sentences. Finally,you learn the definitions via a matching quiz. But, after the paragraph and blank sentences, you almost know the definitions already! Also, each day a language idiom is presented as a further boost to a highly functional vocabulary.This is a great vocabulary book. I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"The method used in this book is the best technique I have ever seen. Each word is used in context, and you are encouraged to guess the meaning. Then you review the meaning using a matching test and a fill in the blank test. It is a stroke of brilliance that the words you have already learned are continually reviewed by being used over and over again in the following chapters. Each week has 4 lessons plus a review lesson, and a different storyline is used each week. These stories are of high interest and very clever.

I really like the concept and the way the exercises are developed. I was pleased to see the changes from the 2nd edition to the 3rd and now I am anxiously waiting to see the 4th edition. However, I find that some of the idiomatic phrases have fallen into such disuse as to not be of much practical help. I also question the connotations implied in the context of some of the vocabulary words being used in the vignette. I still think it is the best book available for vocabulary development and I use it continuously throughout the school year."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"I tried wordlists and many different techniques to master vocabulary words, yet for whatever reason, I found this book most helpful in enabling me to remember the words. The short passages that you read with the words in context in each section repeat words that you have already mastered, or should have, and I think this method works particularly well. Moreover, the words that you study in this book are extremely useful for the GRE, SAT, or just strengthening your vocabulary in general."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"Pros:-The structure of the daily lessons is conducive to learning. Only five words are learned per day, first by exposure to the words in the natural context of a short paragraph, then by filling the words into cloze sentences, and finally by matching the words to their abbreviated definitions.-There are plenty of review activities at the end of each week of study, in addition to a cumulative review at the end.-Some of the daily paragraphs are linked together throughout the week of study, forming fascinating multi-part mini-stories.-Overall, I recommend the book. It's easy to use, and most of the daily paragraphs are interesting. I might use this book for my students, but I'd use it cautiously, as some sections of the book are quite a bit better than others.Cons:-While it's a difficult task indeed to create an interesting paragraph for students to read that includes five chosen new vocabulary words, I sometimes got the impression that the authors just weren't trying hard enough to make the words smoothly integrate into the paragraphs. Many of the paragraphs are sullied by short, choppy sentences with awkward uses of vocabulary words. Some of the paragraphs remind me of something a young student might write if he were given five completely new words and a shaky understanding of them.-We all know that the only effective vocabulary programs include plenty of repeat exposure over time to the vocabulary words. Because the authors were trying so hard to include repeated exposure to the words, a flaw in the writing emerges midway through the book: the paragraphs stop being interesting and readable, and they become so bogged down in flashy words that it's torturous to read them. I'm an English teacher, so I was able to muddle through these turgid paragraphs, but I wouldn't ask a student to read them. Even worse, it's possible that impressionable students may start imitating this grossly affected style of writing. Take, for example, a sentence from the paragraph on page 176: \\"The paramount objectives of the studies are to eradicate anything that will impede the discovery of creative talent and to exploit this talent to the limit.\\" Sure, the sentence makes sense, but I'd hate to see it in one of my student's essays.-The book does a fairly good job of teaching slangy idioms, which I could see as effective for students who are learning English as a foreign language, but the example sentences given for these idioms become overloaded with previously introduced idioms. The sentences become ridiculous, and it is my hope that no student would imitate those sentences in speech or writing. Here's an example from page 262: \\"The modus operandi was leading up a blind alley and they were barking up the wrong tree.\\" Even to a native English speaker, that sentence doesn't make much sense."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"I also bought this to help prepare for the GRE. It is broken so that you can learn five new words a day for 46 weeks (plus an idiom a day). I agree with a previous reviewer in that some of the definitions of the idioms, while they may be text-book, are not concurrent with today's usage. I still found myself referring to the dictionary when trying to understand a new word (hence the 4 stars--I thought some of the definitions were too brief to be fully understood). However it's a great series of exercises which can be done at whatever rate you wish (I usually do one or two &quot;weeks&quot; in one day). There are also weekly reviews and &quot;book so far&quot; reviews, if that makes any sense."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"I use this book while tutoring adults who are learning English as a second language. Each day, 5 new words are presented, activities incorporating the new words can be finished in less than a half hour and a review for the words learned for the week is also available. The words used are challenging but common. During my time helping the students i also get a good vocabulary review!"},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"I bought this book a few years ago. It's still a great book. I highly recommend it to anyone.As I'm a late learner in my forties, I would say this book has much augmented my vocabulary. Moreover, I've bought nearly ALL the vocabulary books from this website. I have SAT vocabulary books as well, all great too.My review on this book: I rate it as one of the very BEST. I most read this book during tea breaks, during babysitting. It has all the key answers to questions, articles with examples of usage, etc. Blank spaces around text allow me to pencil down my notes, mostly examples of usages. Every page has my pencilled notes. That's how much I love the book."},{"Title":"1100 Words You Need to Know","review":"This is a good book overall. It gives you 5 words a day, uses them all in a paragraph, lists the pronunciations, has you complete 5 sentences with the words, and then finishes with a multiple choice quiz, which matches the words to the definitions.Unfortunately, the definitions are frequently overly simplified. The definitions listed are great if you want a minimal and general meaning of the word, but for many words the definitions are inadequate if you want the full meaning of the words.I use online dictionaries to supplement this book. I do this book's exercises to get a general meaning of the word, and to see how they are used, and then I check the online dictionaries to get the full definition. I prefer merriam-webster.com and thefreedictionary.com. They are both excellent sites to use in addition to the book."},{"Title":"A bird's-eye view of our civil war","review":"Theodore Dodge was one of the most astute military historians and critics of his era, roughly the 1890s through the early 1900s. His books on &quot;The Great Captains&quot; of all ages from Alexander through Napoleon continue to do well in reprints.As a participant in the Civil War, he had some insights not available to other scholars. As Dodge's preface indicates, this book was pitched at high-school level students who wanted to learn more about the military aspects of the war and who were likely to be confused by the profusion of self-justifying post war accounts of pariticipants. But understand that high school level in the 1890s, unlike today, did not mean you had to feed the kids politically correct and dumbed-down pap.Dodge manages to give highly analytical yet very succinct accounts of the campaigns. He does not waste time in challenging one or the other post-war accounts of this or that action, but gets right down to describing and analyzing the combat and the leadership.The 6 theater maps and 42 battlefield maps are a good indication of the level of critical discussion.A glossary of military terms was appended because his readership was expected to be mostly civilians. However even the military service man or woman of today would need this glossary as many of the terms are antiquated or have different meanings today.This is one civil war book that has not lost its value despite tens of thousands of subsequent accounts."},{"Title":"A bird's-eye view of our civil war","review":"Being a fan of T.A. Dodge's works on ancient generals, I was anticipating reading his account of the war in which he was involved. Having not read much on this subject, I found this work to be an excellent over-view of the conflict without being over-bearing in details. As usual, Dodge gives his unique perspective on the main characters and opinions on some controversial subjects. However, if one is well-versed concerning our civil war, then this work is not worth reading for it is too general. But, for the initiate such as myself, it is a superb starting point for further reading. The only fault I found is that the maps of the various regions and even some of the battle areas were in too minute of detail and therefore difficult to read. This fault however does not detract significantly from the work and is but a minor nuisance. I look forward to reading the newly released novel on his journal as part of the Army of the Potomoc."},{"Title":"Manual of Prayers","review":"This book is beautifully printed and bound and built to last a lifetime's pilgrimage in the faith: heavy cream paper with full gilt edging, black and red type, leatherette binding, and two ribbon markers, all inside a sturdy matching boxcover.Its handsome exterior compliments the beauty of its substance--classic prayers that possess noble simplicity and quiet grandeur.

A few bring tears to my eyes as I pray them, feeling the amount of power and sincere sentiment and truth written into them by their authors. Beautifully tailored, very well produced and meant to last at least a lifetime, I recommend it to all of my prayerful friends. A person could go for the rest of their lives using this prayerbook alone.If I have one minor complaint, it is that the leatherette cover is too stiff. It folds back on the book and snaps shut. A nice feature, but it keeps flapping back across the page, necessitating holding it back with part of your right hand as you read and pray.

While it is a very nicely bound and printed book that willlast for generations I did not like the tightness of the binding which springs the book closed whentwo hands are not on it and the other thing is I do not prefer (personally) is the snap shut cover (burgundy leather edition)This is because when I am praying the loop around leather with the snap is a bit irritating asit has to be held out of the way with the back of my right hand and after awhile it can be distractingespecially when turning the pages. I suppose if I used it enough it will loosen up a bit.However this is a small issue compared with the overall quality of material and content.I ordered the black cover edition that is the standard book cover.The snap cover should be fine for plenty of people and I give the black cover 4.5 stars (still a very tight binding)"},{"Title":"Manual of Prayers","review":"I am no theologian, just an average person.

It snaps shut like a clam, but I plan to bend the spine as as much as I can to loosen it up. I'm not worried that anything will crack or tear, since the pages are sewn, not glued. The paper is cream color, thicker than \\"bible paper\\" (similar to the paper used by Ignatius Press). On the upside, that means that the pages won't get wrinkled and creased easily.

It would also make for a good Christmas gift."},{"Title":"City","review":"The thing that makes this book just a little difficult to get into at first is that the perspective is that of those who inherited the Earth from Mankind. The introduction at the beginning of the story is the kind of introduction you might find today in a book about legends and their sources. While the introduction slows down the reader's entry into the book, the reader later uses the introduction to help tie the eight short stories in the book together into a more coherent framework. What the introduction infers is that the storyteller is an intelligent canine, and the eight stories are the remaining fragments of stories regarding the perhaps mythic creatures called Man. The canine writing the story notes that there are conflicting viewpoints as to whether Man in fact ever existed, or was used to explain the origins of the intelligence of dogs. The perspective of the narrator in the initial introduction and in the introduction of each of the stories is quite interesting and gives the reader a unique perspective.The stories themselves are interesting, but venture beyond science fiction in a variety of ways. An explanation for ghosts is provided briefly. There are so many elements introduced that are beyond our current knowledge that the story is closer to fantasy. The stories cover genetically engineering dogs to have intelligence comparable to Man's. We see a society that is so wealthy that cities are no longer required and everyone lives on a country estate. Energy is abundant and incredibly cheap. Man has the ability to transform himself into other creatures. A class of man has mutated into incredibly intelligent and powerful beings that build doors to other worlds, and then they left the rest of mankind behind.Incredibly intelligent robots also appear throughout these stories. I kept wondering why a robot would serve man for millennia when it had intelligence that appeared to surpass man's, however, I had to suspend logic just a bit, though I also assumed that perhaps the robots had laws similar to those that Isaac Asimov later created for robots. A sort of toss in side story that appears in a couple of places regards advanced ants. The one flaw with that side story is that ants have existed for millennia in the tropics and have not had to hibernate. These tropical ants have had all the advantages of the ants in the story and have yet to become super intelligent. Once again Simak has included another fantastic story element.These stories were written in the 40s during a time of transition and development of modern science fiction. Science fantasy had yet to be defined, and many early works of science fiction were so bizarre that were they to be published today they might well be considered fantasy versus the previously all-encompassing science fiction category. However, even with the fantastic elements of the story the book is a good read. The perspective of the dogs in the later stories is plausible and interesting. I was most intrigued by the conclusion of the collection. I had anticipated several endings, and yet the actual ending was disturbing and somewhat sobering. Clifford D. Simak tried his very best not to be egocentric.I think that during the time these stories were written this collection was likely one of the more innovative and interesting works. Today the stories are a bit dated because we have accumulated another 60 years of knowledge. We have learned that hibernation is more difficult than we thought it would be at that time. We have learned that Jupiter does not have a solid surface, and the temperature on the planet is quite hot. It does not appear that cities are likely to be abandoned any time in the near (and from what we can tell, even the far) future. If you can ignore that knowledge, the stories turn out to be quite a bit of fun."},{"Title":"City","review":"Simak was one of those who helped it muscle in to the human consciousness.If you've read the other reviews you'll have noticed a lot of people encountered the book first during the 1950s and 1960s, as I did. I'm uncertain about the others, but I was a lot younger in those days and Sci-Fi was a lot younger. A book of this genre didn't require as much to impress us.During the past few years I've made an effort to go back and read a lot of books I loved or hated when I was younger. A lot of those I loved then were pure drivel to me now, and a lot of those I hated cause me to realize what a shallow level I was reading on. Or maybe, what a few decades of life does to change perspectives about literary works.City's one of the books I loved as a young man that I'm happy to say is still in my list of books I'm happy to have encountered this lifetime. I think you'll be glad all the reviewers said such nice things about it if it causes you to get the book and read it yourself. What else can I say? I hope you read it now, then again when you're my age, and love it twice."},{"Title":"City","review":"This masterwork tells of the history of Man, beginning with the fall of modern cities through Man's disappearance into planetary space. This history represents the mythology of the current dominant species, the dogs. So brilliantly told and so logically laid out, you are forced to believe this unbelievable premise. You will never see dogs (or ants) in quite the same way. Simak is a genius."},{"Title":"City","review":"What a pleasant walk with an old friend. Reading this book again after a lapse of 47 years was like meeting an old friend again. The story Desertion is one I have searched for over the years and never could find. My happiness was totally complete when I stumbled upon this treasure of a story. The ideas expressed in City were innovative and captivated a young boy stuck in a foreign country back in 1964. Reading it again took me back to those wonderful days when all was new and the universe awaited my attack. After 47 years a lot of those ideas became lost until being re-kindled by opening old doors so long closed in the mind. I am actually doing a few things I dreamed of as a kid that I had forgotten that I want to do. Going back to scuba diving was one small leap that I made. I had totally forgotten how wonderful it is. It's an amazing thing to re-waken the mind of a young boy in an old man. If you read this as a kid, please read it again for your walk. I'm certain other sci-fi books can do the same, but this one did it for me. Even though the stories are not complex, they are fun, imaginative and easy to read with a glass of your favorite wine.

Witness the present medium. I orginally read the book about 25 years ago..... it seemed an unlikely although entertaining scenario. Still is but highly entertaining. Probably one of my all time favorite Sci-Fi along with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and &quot;The Postman&quot;."},{"Title":"City","review":"Simak's classic science fiction novel (really a compilation of closely related short stories and novellas published by Simak in the '40s and '50s) is the kind of story that exemplifies why I love so many stories from science fiction's Golden Age -- it has stereotypical sci-fi elements like robots, mutants, and aliens, it has completely unscientific elements like talking dogs and intelligent ants, it has wild, breathtaking ideas, it has characters you can't help but love and hate, and its glimpse of the future is simultaneously grim and hopeful.It's far from a perfect book -- there are ongoing assumptions in the story that most of humanity, regardless of cultural differences, will always speak and act with one voice. There are no important female characters in the whole book. And some of the science is distractingly goofy. Nevertheless, Simak is one of science fiction's unrecognized geniuses, and this is his masterwork.\\"City\\" is the story of how mankind dies, told from the perspective of the intelligent dogs who have taken over the Earth in our absence. It's all framed as an attempt by the dogs to assemble an oral history of the planet, including the improbable myths of a creature called Man that used to run things in the distant past. Much of that history follows the lives of a single human family, the Websters, and a nearly immortal robot named Jenkins.In the initial story, told only a short distance in our own future, humanity is in the process of abandoning all of its cities. Mostly plotless, it serves mainly to allow us to follow the transition from today's urban society to a future society using advanced technology to embrace a more pastoral lifestyle. Technological advances in transportation and communications have rendered the city unnecessary -- people can live anywhere they want and still stay in contact with their friends, families, and coworkers. Anyone can feed themselves with a hydroponic garden.A century later, we get to our first really important character, Jerome Webster, a doctor who's been turned into an agoraphobic, terrified of open spaces, by his comfortable life at home. His every need is taken care of instantly by the family's robots, including the butler, Jenkins. Webster is called upon to travel to Mars, where history's greatest philosopher, Juwain, is gravely ill -- if he lives, he will soon develop a new philosophy that will propel humanity to the very peaks of perfect enlightenment. But Webster finds himself completely unable to undertake the journey to save his friend.We jump forward several decades and sees the introduction of the Dogs, as Jerome Webster's grandson surgically gives his pet the ability to speak. We also meet Joe, a mutant who is able to live for centuries and is gifted with extraordinary intelligence. A completely amoral creature, he has spent over a hundred years helping humans, but he's getting bored with that. So he steals the last notes on Juwain's revolutionary Martian philosophy, just for the pleasure of hurting humanity.The years march on, and we leave Earth to visit the hostile surface of Jupiter, where scientists have attempted to explore the planet by transforming themselves into creatures that can survive the corrosive atmosphere -- but none of these scientists have ever returned. What predator, if any, could be killing them off? Years later, one of the scientists decides to return to Earth to tell everyone about Jupiter's great secret -- but will the news trigger the extinction of humanity?Decades, centuries, millennia pass. The Webster family continues on, slowly dooming the human race with each decision it makes. The Dogs continue on, growing in sophistication and morality. Jenkins and the other robots continue on, shepherding the new animal civilization through the years. The ants continue on, becoming more and more powerful. Some species die off, some species evolve into new forms, some species abandon Earth forever. Life continues, on and on. Earth continues.No question, it's a melancholy, almost heart-breaking story. If you've long dreamed that mankind would live forever, this story will subject you to the spectre of the human race embracing extinction, of humanity's greatest works of science and art being forgotten, of even Man's Best Friend leaving our home planet behind in the face of an expansionist alien species. \\"City\\" is a book with few truly happy endings.And yet, I still see this as a hopeful book, and it fills me with joy when I read it. Why? I really don't know. Perhaps it's the beauty of the writing and of the story. Perhaps it's the fact that many of mankind's creations -- robots, dogs, storytelling, morality and ethics -- continue thousands of years beyond our end, even if our status as the creators are long forgotten. Maybe I just really like dogs.Maybe I enjoy the novel so much because I like the way it's acknowledged that, eventually, all species must die out -- extinction is inevitable, but I think Simak knew that our story isn't finished yet. Enjoy the good things that humanity has brought about, recognize the bad things that we've caused, resolve to help move the species farther along the evolutionary chain, scientifically, artistically, socially."},{"Title":"City","review":"Simak is a writer. I don't mean a guy who has a computer and works to publish books. I mean a writer. The City is filled with ten tales that feel like a thousand. Through the artifice of dog campfire stories about a mythical creature- called alternatively Man or Webster- Simak has created an entire history over thousands of years as convincing asA Canticle for Leibowitz. It's a world that you can step into all the more because it is only the occasional story separated by thousands of years.I particularly enjoyed the use of doggish thoughts and commentary, using historical criticism of spoken myths and ancient manuscripts to show how false the idea of Man is, using all the classic arguments often presented in historical and literary criticism against books likethe Bible. It gave the feel of simultaneous etic and emic, of stepping into another's worldview and at the same time viewing one's own- an idea that Simak plays with explicitly in this work. It's a hard thing to bring to the printed page.It is not a happy portrayal of humanity's future, though not completely sad either. It is social commentary not only of man, but of all those who seek to build and reproduce and control. One wishes perhaps that we had a better outcome, that we had a better future, than this book shows. But if the book is allowed to be prophetic, than perhaps there is still time. Simak has written myth, in the tradition ofGeorge McDonald. This book has a reality that will haunt you for years."},{"Title":"City","review":"CITY is perhaps the best known and most widely read work by Clifford Simak. It is a collection of 8 original stories that are interrelated, though a 9th story was added later as part of an anthology to honor John W. Campbell following his death. Because he had published nearly all of the stories in Campbell publications, Simak decided make his contribution to the collection a sequel to the earlier stories. Like many of Simak's works, the stories are set in rural Wisconsin. And there are dogs.There are many things that I really loved in this book and several things that I just found appalling. As I mentioned, the stories were almost all published under the aegis of John W. Campbell, who had very definite ideas about themes that were to be pursued. One theme that he strongly encouraged his writers to pursue -- \\"demanded\\" might be a more accurate word -- was that of evolution. Campbell was obsessed with what humans and other lifeforms might achieve in future evolution. He loved heroes who became something more than human, through physical mutations or the acquisition of new abilities. Several elements in the CITY stories -- humans taking on new forms through complete physical transformations on Jupiter, dogs who can suddenly talk and are exceptionally intelligent, ant that suddenly take on advanced intelligence, benevolent robots -- are preoccupations of Campbell, things that recur throughout the stable of writers under his command. Unfortunately, some of the other marks of Campbell's editorship are also present: weak character development (because realistic characters would detract from the ideas), lackluster writing (for the same reason just noted), and rather huge leaps of logic that you must make in abeyance to big ideas. The prime example of the latter is the philosophical breakthrough that the Martian Juwain is said to be on the verge of making, a discovery that if made will generate massive advancement of humanity in only a couple of generations. Well, the silliness of such a conceit is obvious, especially if you have actually studied philosophy. The problems with such a notion are so obvious it is painful even to bring it up. For instance, how in the heck could anyone possibly know that someone was on the verge of a breakthrough of such magnitude? And when has philosophy ever had such an impact? Descartes caused a revolution in thinking in the 17th century, but nothing of the magnitude ascribed to Jumain, and Rousseau's political thought hit Europe like a bomb in the 18th. But dramatically move humanity forward in only a couple of years? Of course, Simak qualifies Juwain by stating that Martian philosophy was effective and as precise as any science. Though a moment's reflection will reveal that to be sheer verbiage, only bald assertion. This unsupportable conception in reality is just a literary device -- and a very bad one at that -- to move the story forward, a hinge upon which some of the plot turns. These kinds of ideas come up all the time in Campbell-era stories and frankly, looking at it from the early 21st century, I'm not clear as to why readers of the day put up with it. Perhaps they didn't (I've not taken the trouble that some have of going back and reading Campbell's publications and looked at the letters to the editor -- perhaps dozens of readers were as bothered by the silliness of \\"the Juwain philosophy\\" as I am). Another silly idea in the story -- and this sort of thing crops up again and again in the Campbell era -- is people undergoing radical physical transformations that allow them a blissful form of experience unavailable to those not undergoing the experience. There are countless analogs to this in pulp-era SF. A famous one is everyone in Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND finding the protagonist a profound thinker instead of the banal bore that he actually is, the notion being that you can only grasp his profundity if you can speak Martian. So in CITY you can only experience the bliss of living on Jupiter if you undergo a radical physical transformation.OK, so that is the bad. The good is that Simak presents a delightfully fun and innovative view of the future. It isn't a terribly compelling vision, but once you get past that it is fun not as science but as fantasy. I mean, who doesn't like talking dogs? And ageless robots? And mysterious and powerful mutant humans? And intelligent ants? Well, actually, I guess the intelligent ants isn't all that great, but the rest are. In short, the stories are a heck of a lot of fun and delightful to read, as long as you can cut it slack on its short comings. My rating is based not on a comparison with contemporary SF stories, which are of a much higher literary quality, but on comparison with stories from the same era. The dogs are a lot of fun and the robot Jenkins one of finest robots from the period. While this may not rank among the best SF collections of all time, it is definitely one of the finest of the pulp era. Although its interest is more historical than literary, it is nonetheless among the more interesting from its time. Anyone wanting to better understand the history of SF should read it."},{"Title":"City","review":"I am aboslutely positive this is one of the best sci-fi books ever written, and it definitely transcends beyond the genre of fiction. It is a book about the ultimate universal question: Does the human race have any purpose and destiny or is it just merely there for an infinitesimal period of time? The book is astoundingly humane, kind and a little bit poignant and nostalgic. It really touched me. Read it!"},{"Title":"City","review":"Strange, but enchanting, sci fi. The demise of man and the rise of dogs (and robots). A little homesy to begin with, but all in context. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"City","review":"I was fortunate to read this the same time as the non-fiction bookEmergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Softwarewhich presents science that is amazingly close to the subjects Simak writes about. Perhaps some of you remember the original SimCity, SimAnt and SimEarth games the preceded The Sims. This book might have inspired those games, because the similarities are uncanny, even eerie. Also Simak presents ideas about \\"parallel worlds\\" and alternative timelines-- back in the fifties! The prose itself is not spectacular. Like a lot of other sci-fi writers, he annoyingly assumes the entire world will follow the American political-economic route into a prosperous homogeneous global culture. Settings like Geneva, Switzerland are presented without any landmarks or details of the landscape. But if you read sci-fi for the exploration possible future technologies and far-out ideas, this book delivers, and stands up to the test of time."},{"Title":"City","review":"I first read \\"City\\" when I was 15 years old, and the themes and message of this superb Sci/Fi-Fantasy has remained with me my entire life. I love this book; it's that simple. To have it in a Hardback Anniversary version is a huge Bonus. There's an Epilog Chapter that wasn't in the original paperback version that I read all those years ago, and it's Very good!I recommend this Novel to both young, new fans of the Genre, and to us \\"Old Timers\\", too."},{"Title":"City","review":"This book is often recommended based on the originality of the concepts, the fact that this is not a well known writer, and the cute factor of dogs inheriting the earth.If you're going to read this book its worth bearing in mind that this is not a novel, rather a collection of stories that first appeared in magazine format. Why is this relevant? well, you'll find that there is an increasingly large amount of exposition at the beginning of each story to explain the increasingly complicated and intricate plot line.Modern readers will also quickly note the dated language and world view- not a problem if you're a classic science fiction fan, but may well catch some unawares.So given those two caveats, is this book any good? Well, Simak certainly has some great ideas. He discusses the decentralization of the human race, the economic effects of free power and changes in land use. He also casts his mind forward in time to protray a post human world. It takes some guts to write a plotline measured in millenia. He even dabbles with alien philosophy and its effects on humanity- a difficult subject to communicate clearly at the best of times. So hats off for invention.This collection of stories also hits all the markers you would expect- robots, personal helicopters, atomic power, space travel, aliens, examination of human culture by outside commentary and so on. This shows a good grasp of the conventions his audience are expecting, so again, points for covering the strong points of sci-fi.Once you're past this however, the collection starts to degrade somewhat. Simak is chained to the short story format, and the feeling is that his imagination can never truely take flight. It feels similiar to a serialised Bicentenial Man, minus the long words. His style is pedestrian at best, and his attempts at lyrical prose are stilted. The need for persistent characters that turn up in each story cause a number of unsatisfying plot points, from seven thousand year old robots to a family line that seems to have a hand in every single significant event in human history.There is a sense in the later stories that Simak is beating the anti-war drum, however this is never really delivered with any confidence or conviction.I would have loved to have seen what he could have pulled off in a novel format, and if he could have included more of the dog's point of view. As it is, it was a c+ book- it passed the time, and had some interesting ideas, but would not merit a re-read."},{"Title":"City","review":"In a book of linked stories Simak tells the future history of man as he builds his civilization from Earth to the Moon and eventually to the moons of Jupiter. It is also the history of the growth and dissolution of cities, the history of one family that strives and survives, and the history of the evolution of the relations between men and robots.Everyone I've met who has read this book, everyone I've given it to--SF fan and not--has thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a classic that deserves to live."},{"Title":"City","review":"Simak does not write pulse-pounding, viscerally riveting, edge of your seat novels. Blood is rarely spilled in his books, blows are hardly struck, weapons are more often than not never seen. But to be perfectly honest, you don't miss it, because his novels don't require such things. Most of Simak's best work was written in the late fifties and sixties, when the Cold War was in full swing and everyone was afraid of being blowns to bits at any second. Simak, in his wisdom, looked to the future and not just to ten years from now, but many thousands of years and he wrote to reassure us, and himself, that while things right not might be tense and it might be tense for our children and maybe even our grandchildren, in time it will all become better and lead to something grand. &quot;City&quot; is probably the culmination of that ideal, telling a future history of not just mankind, but the earth itself and the creatures that in the end inherit it. The novel is told as a series of short stories, all linked by a framing device where the current residents of the earth (intelligent dogs) debate whether these &quot;legends&quot; are truly real or simply the product of years of storytelling. Each story brings the timeline further down and we see man begin to leave the cities, then the world itself and eventually leave it in the care of the dogs and the intelligent robots that were once their servants (among other beings). Through it all Simak keeps a quiet, calm tone, which amazingly brings a sense of realism to a situation that could only be properly be described as fantastic. SF in the fifties tended to be a bit on the &quot;goofy&quot; side of things so it's a credit to Simak that not only can he make this at all believable but that he manages to make it oddly evocative and poetic, as Man passes the torch to the dogs and sort of bows gracefully off the world, barely leaving any memories of themselves behind. The result is a charming, thought-provoking Future History that relies more on quiet moments and the passing of time than on violence and bloodshed, while heralding back to the optimistic tendancies of older SF, a trait that has come back but with a more ironic slant to it. This novel feels honest and Simak effortlessly conveys his hopes for the future through the pages. Not in print anymore, but easily uncovered, it's worth seeking out for readers interested in the quiet, thinking type of SF that isn't quite as common as it used to be, and even back then, wasn't all that common."},{"Title":"City","review":"I read this book quite a while ago (1990s). I was so captivated by the idea that in the future someone who'll come to inhabit the Earth after our civilization is gone will doubt that humans existed at all!! It was fun to follow this distant future canine historian that develops theories of what the previous civilization (humans) was like, and argues whether things that are our reality now ever existed. I think that in this book Simak takes an ironic stab at what our generation of scientists speculates about the past history of Earth and its inhabitants. If you ever wondered what civilizations were like before us, go for it! Could be a dry read at times, I have to admit, but my recollections about the time when I read the book are pure joy."},{"Title":"City","review":"When I heard this novel was about dogs, I guess I thought \\"fantasy\\" as in Watership Down. This book is nothing like that.Simak was writing in the 50's and the book reflects the issues of the times -- the death of the city, and growth of the suburbs, and the threat of the atomic age.If you are a generally happy person, I recommend this book. It is lyrical. To its credit, it made me depressed. I've read other novels that were depressing, but when I put them down, I left the novels and those feelings behind. The feelings this one evoked stayed with me -- the actual feeling of depression. Since I'm no stranger to that feeling, I didn't like the book, but as I've said, if you're basically a happy person, then you might enjoy it. It is lyrical and evocative, but not magical or hopeful."},{"Title":"City","review":"I've read this book at least 7 times, and as far as i am concerned it is one of the best sci-fi books ever written. It bogels my mind: not only the supurb writting but that Simak isn't read and appreciated by more people!!!!"},{"Title":"City","review":"I am impressed by the depth of these reviews, but I did not find the book as riveting, prescient or as well written as the other reviewers found.I think the main problem for me is the overwhelming tone of patriarchy in the book. In the thousands of years that see the devolution of the City and the rise of the dogs and the mutation of humans, not one Webster - the family who is responsible for everything in the stories - is a woman. Like most books written by male science fiction writers of that era, the woman when she is not half dressed is, as in this book, somewhere offstage producing male children and baking pies on the farm. In Simak's world, it is Jenkins the thousand year old robot who takes the place of the quasi mother wife and helpmate. In this way, the book feels old, quaint and not to be taken seriously. Oh yes there are a few women in it. There is a woman who is the best \\"transfer technician in the solar system\\", but she is there to perform the real function of womanhood - to be worried that something very bad is going to happen to the hero, Webster.The core of the book, that cities were abandoned because of the rise of hydrophonic gardening and therefore farmland became more available and so men rushed to the farms to live alone with their robots harkens I suppose to a misanthropic despair common to men who prefer robots. But come on.... hydrophonic tomatoes as the giant killer?The only interesting part of the book is the philosophical question at the end. Whether voluntarily surrendering being human to become a creature of another planetary species in order to attain nirvana and happiness is worth the extinction of the human race . Very good question from a not very good book."},{"Title":"City","review":"The last thing that this book needs, is more words, because it's speaking for itself. But still, I can't be without saying, that this was one of the best science fiction books beside &quot;The Time Ships&quot; by Stephen Baxter or &quot;The City And The Stars&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke. Despite the fact, that it told the story about the end of the mankind, it gave me so much comfort and feeling of piece thinking about our future in Clifford D. Simak's way. And, beside all this, it was interesting to read for the facts seemed to be quite realistic in every way. Big thanks to Clifford D. Simak for writing the book!"},{"Title":"City","review":"While the science is a little suspect, things like Lamarkian evolution and his views on atomic power, these do not really take away from the stories unless you let them. There are three aspects that are portrayed in the book- humans, as represented by the Websters; Jenkins, the robot; and the dogs. He compares and contrasts these three and uses them to define what it is to be human and humane. As others have pointed out- he does not do so with a club. IMO, he seems to be saying that each aspect has human qualities and each represents different facets of the human condition. For some reason I find this book very poignant. So far it is the only Simak book I have read so I cannot really say how it compares to the rest of his works."},{"Title":"City","review":"Clifford Simak was among the brightest luminaries of modern SF, and two of his novels have never lost their power to capture the reader and to hold he or she enthralled - TIME IS THE SIMPLEST THING and CITY. Even if you sometimes despair of, or have little interest in, SF, read them both.CITY, with its canine civilization, and its memories of Man, is one of the most touching of novels - unusual in this genre is an understatement.New editions of all Simak's works are long, long overdue!"},{"Title":"City","review":"A collection of stories organized chronologically more than chapter book. The first few stories don't forshadow where this book will eventually take the reader. Stick with it and you won't be sorry. To tell you more would spoil a great read."},{"Title":"City","review":"This is my favorite book--period.An astonishing collection of such brilliantly original ideas that they will stay with you for life. CITY is crafted in a deceivingly folksy style that anyone who is literate can enjoy (without going through the labors of, say, DON QUIXOTE DE LA MANCHA, CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, or MOBY DICK, for examples.) But that is not to say that it is simplistic---not in the least. This little book contains profundities not found in the majority of literature, of any genre. Sorry, no spoilers.Just buy it and cherish it.Sheer genius!"},{"Title":"City","review":"I read this book almost fifty years ago but had lost my copy. Was so happy to see it in hard back. This is an astounding book about humanity's future. Realizing how old the book is, it makes it even more amazing that he foresaw how we might slide into individualism without much regard for social interaction. He shows us where the current work from home mentality may take us. I love this book, and along with his \\"Choice of Gods\\" find it to be a truly fascinating peek at the next few thousand years. It will pull your mind down paths you may never have considered."},{"Title":"City","review":"This gem popped up on my recommendation screen and I had to just write how much I love this book. I first came across City when I was a pre-teen back in the Eighties, and even then many of the premises seemed dated (atomic helicopters et al) but that didn't matter. The flow of the stories and the issues they raise resonate even today. Throughout the novel there is a feeling of sadness tempered with hope. Humanity's time in the sun is done, but our boon companions the dogs are there to take up the torch with their robot allies.If you have never read Clifford Simak I recommend you begin right away, and this book is a perfect introduction to his wonderful style."},{"Title":"City","review":"You would think that a sci-fi world in which humans are no more and dogs are the masters of the Earth would be found in a fanciful book for kids. Instead, Clifford Simak turned that deceptively lightweight premise into this poignant, melancholy, and even creepy collection of tales. And these are actually tales within tales, presented as snippets of folklore that have trickled down into an advanced society of dogs, tens of thousands of years in the future. In a fascinating mode of storytelling, Simak posits how dog scholars of the future place doubt on the folktales that they were once pets to man, and even doubt if humans ever existed. Dogs claim to have proven scientifically that outer space is not possible, but that inter-dimensional worlds are, and that's because of the different intellects of dogs and humans. (Though in one familiar mental twist, dogs still really hate fleas and advocate exterminating them, or possibly placing them on reservations!) There are a couple of problems with Simak's mode of presentation, as the mutant humans and wild robots who supposedly have such a large hand in these future developments are barely explained; while having the Webster family represent all of humanity and shape its course for thousands of years is implausible. But otherwise, this book offers very compelling explorations on the nature of humanity and its possible futures, philosophical differences and similarities between humans and the creatures of the natural world, and especially the processes of thought and society. Simak's unique storytelling methods here add great depth and insight to these ruminations. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"City","review":"When you read the very beginning of the book, before the first tale, you get the notion that dogs can talk and that they live amongst robots. The immediate impression is that this could be the silliest science fiction ever concocted, but as you progress through the tales, you realize that this book is science fiction at its best. Overall, a well-conceived and executed work with a sad message about humanity. Skip all the Kim Stanley Robinson books and read this (or Hyperion)."},{"Title":"City","review":"I remember this book from when I was a child. My dad would read it to my brother and I before we went to sleep. I had a hard time finding a copy of it because, though I knew the author I only knew the title in French!

It is as good as I remember it perhaps even better in its Original Version."},{"Title":"City","review":"Then Simak's for you. Like Bradbury he's a rural Midwesterner, but the similarities sort of end there. Simak tends to be even more rural, folksy, more genrestyle, &amp; didn't write much horror or Gothic. Why do I give this book only 3 stars? Well it tended to verge more toward whimsical folk tale then I like &amp; was too strange. It is haunting though. The comparison I've told people is imagine mixing the movies &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; &amp; &quot;The Planet of the Apes&quot; now imagine a book predating even the stories they were based on."},{"Title":"City","review":"I ordered this because I thought it had a story about Petra. It did not. So basically I wasted my time & money. Too bad. So now I'm looking for the short story about Petra. I will then buy another book if it has that one. The ball is in someone else's court."},{"Title":"City","review":"The cities of the world are dying because of the rise of hydrophonic gardening and personal planes that make distances no brainer. Their remaining inhabitants spread out into separated, spacious countryside estates. John Webster pays the taxes of dying city and expels the city council to preserve the last piece of history; people's tumbledown homes that are now the only monuments left. His son, Jerome Webster is called to save a Martian philosopher, Juwain, whose work would sent humanity 100 000 years forward. The domestic robot, Jenkins, turn the delegation down because he knows Jerome's medical skills would not be available; he is a prison of his ancestral home, psychologically locked into his villa. A mutant Joe keeps appearing to fix all kinds of things. Just for fun, Joe advances ants by giving them carriages, all-year-round warm house where they can develop metallurgy and progress further. The Websters lose the invaluable Juwain manuscript to mutant Joe. Earth advances to colonize Jupiter by adapting the human form to local conditions. One of the adapted returns and announces that paradise awaits in the gas giant. Almost all of mankind migrate to oblivion of Jupiter where disease and death is no more. Those 5000 left teach dogs to speak, think and develop their own society. The robot Jenkins is left to nurture the progress of dog civilization. After over 10 000 years one single human, webster, fights against a slipped ghost from a parallel psi universe and wins. But humanity has already lost its case.We can hear echoes of Asimov in robot Jenkins who is left to teach and guide the dog culture after humans are almost extinct. This likable mechanical person has a passion to serve and help forward intelligence, loyalty and friendship where dogs and animals (birds, mammals) no longer kill each other. Jenkins has undressed relicts of bad habits of humanity to make room for pure dog civilization. Man's evil and immaturity, brutality form an ironic frame that qualifies the conclusions that Jenkins has disillusioned; he has sinked humans into legends that are no longer recognized to be real creatures that once ruled; a small colony of humans are called \\"websters\\". The dogs, mutant ants and robots follow their own destiny. Or almost. In the end intelligent dogs and the remaining humans escape to other worlds; the ants die. The Earth is no more seething of life.Two (2) stars. This collection of short stories was compiled 1952. Written when Simak was young, had seen World War II, and 10 years before hisWay Stationwhich won Hugo award for best novel. The doggish editor that prefaces every chapter gives an insight to the mankind's exodus from Earth. The noble ideals of non-violence and animal brotherhood are used to show that both civilizations have their weaknesses. Then a bravery act of the last Webster turns the table, only man can cope with a hostile universe. The book's moral absolutes -- peace --, definitive ethical pronouncements are told in gentle manner, typical to Simak's touch. Reading the story is a unsettling experience: the depression percolates from every story. There is no triumph for anyone. The destruction comes to cities, art, culture, whole of humanity and even civilization of the dogs; everything echo the words of the Preacher: \\"all is vanity\\" (bible; Ecc 1:2). The knotted thread is a written dream where the only tangible character is the Robot Jenkins who stays around to give continuum to the legends. I must admit that reading the City is part of top 100 science fantasy (not fiction) in the visionary category. The book is about loss, conveying mood, and the feeling is like paying a visit to the ancient Inca ruins. This book will soak the reader in melancholy like no other."},{"Title":"City","review":"The Old Earth Books edition of the classic CITY contains the rarely reprinted (& why is a mystery) final CITY story \\"Epilog\\" from Astouding: The John W.

This SFBC 50th Collection started out with a sample of 8 books from well-known SciFi authors that were published in 50's (Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Poul Anderson, Pohl, Simak, etc.), and I ended up liking City better than any of the other books from the 1st eight of the Collection. The Collection has turned out to be popular enough, that another 8 significant SciFi books from the 60's were republished as part of the Collection (I found some real gems in that 2nd set), and now 8 more from the 70's are being republished."},{"Title":"City","review":"I read this book years ago and it has stayed on my mind ever since.

I guess you could say I'm a Simak fan, I've read a few of his novels, and I've liked them all pretty well, but this was not really up to his standard.

In my opinion, if you are new to Simak's work, or just have not read it yet, Ring Around the Sun is the book to read. That is a great novel, of a much higher caliber than City. Plus, I think it's still in print. As I said, not bad, but not really great either."},{"Title":"City","review":"Thousands of years in the future, the canine population of planet Earth, along with their robot helpers, sit around campfires and tell each other controversial fables about how they owe their ascendance to an extinct and perhaps mythical species of benevolent, if misguided, humans. This bleak, melancholy portrayal of humanity's prospects for survival is unusual, then, not only for its dystopian vision but also for its often pastoral storytelling.Originally published during the 1940s as a series in Astounding Science Fiction, these eight stories were gathered into a novel in 1952. For the book, Simak made a few revisions and added a framework of \\"textual commentaries,\\" featuring remarks from canine critics who debate both the meaning of the tales and the likelihood that humankind ever even existed. The stories themselves focus on the role of the (human) Webster family, whose descendants during the course of thousands of years influence the future of humans, dogs, robots, and even ants. The only character common to all the tales is a robot named Jenkins, who serves first human, then canine masters as various threats present themselves over the course of numerous millennia.The first three tales describe a deteriorating human society that retreats from urban blight and escapes to remote family outposts, relying almost entirely on robots for supplying the labor and on the wired world for communication and supplies. (Simak's prescient vision of the Internet is one of the most hauntingly accurate prophecies in this book.) As a result, many of the earth's inhabitants suffer from agoraphobia--a combination of simple lethargy and a fear of leaving their homes--and this isolation is amplified in the form of nearly immortal human mutants that live entirely on their own, \\"disdaining all the artificiality of society.\\"The most memorable (and most original) pair of tales portrays a few humans who venture outside their homes to other worlds and who inadvertently discover a form of nirvana by assuming the genetic makeup of a mysterious, gas-based life-form on Jupiter. Humanity is thus confronted by a choice: either perpetuation of their own species or the allure of paradise under a different guise.Simak's initially relaxed pace soon surrenders to a more riveting style, especially because the later stories are more interrelated (both by common characters and by plot devices) than the first three almost-standalone tales. The book's underlying hopelessness, which often flirts with a subtle misanthropy, is hard to explain, however; there's no real apocalypse. Instead of doom or destruction, the future of humanity according to Simak is a world of isolation and loneliness, and perhaps that's the most depressing vision of all."},{"Title":"City","review":"City is great science fiction, a social commentary of sorts told in a unique and highly effective manner. The tales collected in this book are the myths that have been told by generation after generation of Dogs. Dog scholars debate their origin, and only Tige is so bold as to argue that Man ever truly existed. The majority argument makes sense--man was a highly illogical creature, too selfish and materialistic to ever survive long enough to form a lasting, advanced culture. These stories themselves basically tell the story of the Webster family, a remarkable family whose genealogical line was gifted with genius yet cursed with failures. As the story goes, humans abandoned the cities and sought a bucolic lifestyle, shedding the old tendencies to huddle together in cities for protection. They explored the solar system, and in time the majority of the population sought an alien bliss in the form of Jupiter's native life forms. One Webster had a vision of two civilizations, man and dog, working together to plot a new future--he utilized deft surgical means to enable dogs to speak, he designed special lenses to allow dogs to see as men do, and he designed robots to aid dogs by serving as their hands. Over the years, man's society continued to break down, and eventually a Webster manages to shut off man from the world at large, determined to let the dogs create a new earth free of man's dangerous ideas and influences. Jenkins, the faithful robot servant of the Websters, oversees the dogs' evolution. Unfortunately, the Dog world was not isolated from a handful of human beings after all, and eventually a man builds a bow and arrow and kills a fellow creature, thus upsetting the balance of life all over again. There are many more facets of the story than I have just mentioned, but one central point that seems to emerge from the stories is that man is inherently &quot;bad.&quot; Jenkins had tried very hard to erase the memories of the straggling number of humans living in the era of the Dogs, and the fact that a man eventually killed a fellow creature means that man's troubles did not arise from our remote ancestors' taking a wrong path on the road to civilization but that in fact the fault lies in fact finds an inherent flaw in man's social makeup. Reading this rich, multi-layered tale, one can certainly understand why modern Dogs simply cannot believe that such a creature as Man ever existed.I enjoyed this book tremendously. The ending did not provide a sense of closure, but such a work of fiction as this would be hard to wrap up tightly with no loose ends. Simak presents a valuable viewpoint on society and mankind in general, and the unique viewpoint offered through the eyes of the Dogs serves to highlight the points Simak makes. My favorite part of the book is the section of notes before each tale, wherein we learn about the debate among Dog scholars as to whether or not these stories have any basis in fact, with the stubborn Tige dissenting from the majority opinion of Bouncer, Rover, and others that these are just myths and legends with no basis in fact, that Man is effectively the anti-Dog and was created by ancient storytellers for satirical or educational purposes. From now on, when I hear someone say the world is going to the dogs, I will think to myself that such a happenstance would not really be that bad, all things considered."},{"Title":"City","review":"\\"City\\" is a magical book, a true modern fable, and I highly recommend it. But if you do read it, I hope it doesn't take you as long as it took me to get started. As the old saying goes, you can't judge a book by its cover. Or its first tale, for that matter.Not that it is a bad story. On the contrary, it has a certain nostalgic flavor, a dated atmosphere that has to be appreciated under the correct light, Like the light of the fireplace in the Webster House, the rural property that serves as the common scenery that connects the tales, and leads the story into its climax.But I guess I wasn't prepared for that when this book first got into my hands. I was attending a seminar for English teachers in Southern Brazil and the school where the event was taking place was giving away some old books, the kind nobody wants anymore. City was among the ones I picked.The graphic layout of the cover showed how old the book was, and so was the fact that it was literally falling apart. Anyway, I read the first story, and all these elements together left me the strong feeling that it was just another curiosity, an example of how far from reality SF writers of the past were, of how wrong they were when predicting the decades still to come, and what the end of the twentieth century would be like.Family planes powered by atomics? Yeah, right. Those guys in the fifties thought nuclear energy either would be the ultimate curse or the ultimate solution. References to World War II as \\"the war\\"? Of course there wouldn't be any other wars after that one. Hydroponics replacing \\"dirt farming\\"? People fleeing the cities to live in large estates in the interior? Yeah, like there would be room for everyone in the country.Th result, I thought, was almost laughable. I thought City was a tribute to the author's lack of sight, his complete inability understand the major social and economical trends. As many SF/fantasy writers have done, he picked one specific phenomenon, the bucolic lifestyle in American suburbs, (and from there to the country) and extrapolated that to the entire human race. All of this in the distant year of 1990...So I put the book aside and didn't touch it for another eleven years. But now, when I'm older and wiser, I did a little restoration work on those old yellow pages, and read it all the way though. As the story advanced, and hundreds, even thousands of years passed, I realize I was before a deep and thought-provoking tale of incredible literary and philosophical value. And the more the story progressed, the more my impression of the author's universe changed.The fact is that the book has many surprises, and is a real gift for the reader. When it finally ended, I was hoping for more, but of course, there won't be more, as it was written a long time ago, and the author is already dead. Like a message in a time vault from a distant past.Sometimes a book leaves me feeling this way. Another was the also classic \\"More than Human,\\" by Theodore Sturgeon. It's really gratifying when an author has the sensibility to look into the human nature in such an insightful and equally entertaining way. And, who knows, now that we have the Internet, who says people might not prefer to live away from the cities? And perhaps in a not so distant future, the author's predictions might get to be much closer to reality than we thought possible."},{"Title":"City","review":"I first read City when it was published in 1952.Then, we young people were used to \\"duck and cover\\" drills in school and the imminence of the nuclear destruction of the world. It was a normal thing to go to sleep thinking that there would be no tomorrow.This was the climate in which I first read City.My initial response was that the idea of dispersing humans to lightly populated rural realms was a surefire way to make the nuclear threat impotent. No cities, no mass destruction. Of course at the time the effects of radiation/nuclear winter were not that well known, and therefore I was not aware of the fact that something close to a nearly total exchange between the USSR and the USA would have affected everyone, not just those in the cities.However, Simak's idea of eliminating targets was a first step toward the realization that life would go on. Its military consequences are one of the \\"breakthrough\\" parts of the book, where humanity at last realizes the folly of killing itself due to an economic/political disagreement.Then, ah then, the real story begins. Alien philosophies, humans transformed into Jovian beings, Nietzschean evolution, interdimensional interfaces (often unpleasant), electronic memory, the passing of thousands of years, facts transforming into fables. Thank goodness for the story tellers!Humans are humans, after all. And dogs are dogs. And the twain is that the humans leave, the dogs remain, and we are privileged to experience the ultimate destiny of life on Earth. Or almost. There are always those pesky ants.City is a wonderful, epic, sobering, nostalgic, enthralling, non-anthropocentric, imaginative discourse on what might be the future of life on Earth.Simak's magnum opus."},{"Title":"City","review":"Clifford D. Simak's novel &quot;City&quot; sketches out the future history of the planet Earth: a future of genetically altered talking dogs, mutated humans, omnipresent robots, and other wonders. Simak uses a richly ironic structure to tell this vast saga. The novel is broken up into eight &quot;tales,&quot; each of which is prefaced by a short note. Each of these eight notes is actually part of Simak's fiction. The commentary on the first tale, for example, refers to humankind as a &quot;mythical race&quot; which may have never actually existed.Within this bold but witty structure, Simak deals with such themes as philosophy, phobia, history, legend, violence, culture, and evolution. The book is filled with memorable moments; one of my favorites is a poignant encounter between a genetically advanced talking dog and a primitive wolf. Simak's portrait of the ultimate fate of humanity is comparable to the work of Arthur C. Clarke in &quot;Childhood's End.&quot; Throughout the book, Simak has a charming, enjoyable writing style. &quot;City&quot; is a book that, in my opinion, belongs in the canon of science fiction classics."},{"Title":"City","review":"This is one of the best novels of its kind that I have ever read. City has an almost ethereal quality. That the future technology that the novel alludes to is so far removed from the present reality makes it all the more mysterious, almost as if one were reading science fiction written by someone in a similar, but alternative universe where the earth's future took an entirely different path.Of course, any book that contains intelligent, talking dogs cannot be all bad. Even the somewhat tedious Dean Koontz has mined this vein to considerable effect."},{"Title":"City","review":"I read this book as a teen, and find it still stands up, lo these many years later... The future of humankind (and its works) is explored in several parallel plotlines, one of the humans and ex-humans that have migrated to other planets and dimensions, another follows the fortunes of a family known as the Websters, initially a scientist who chooses to stay behind on Earth while others leave, and then, after the Webster line dies out, of the immortal robot who is left behind to tend the experiments the Websters left behind... As noted elsewhere, the book's premise is rooted in the paranoias of the Cold War era, but the semi-utopian alternatives Simak comes up with are presented in such a thoughtful, gentle way, and the characters themselves are so richly and sympathetically conceived, that this is one of the most emotionally resonant sci-fi books I know of. It's really a great book."},{"Title":"City","review":"City is a masterpiece of creative genius crafted in Simak's trademark soft-spoken, pastoral style - a breath of fresh air contrasted against today's hard-boiled, fast-paced and typically cynical style of writing.A series of loosely joined short stories is presented as the myths and legends that are told by dogs around their campfires to each other and their pups in a future so distant that no dog is actually certain that the creature Man ever really truly existed. From the standpoint of the reader, City represents a Michener or Rutherfurd style multi-generational family saga - a future history, in other words. Mankind, as represented by the Webster family and their robot, Jenkins, is seen as ascending to marvelous heights of technological achievement while evolving away from a traditional city style government, travelling to the stars and beyond, but ultimately descending into an agoraphobic, dystopian Spartan existence and disappearing into extinction. Jenkins - a ten thousand year old repository of flawless electronic memory and the only remaining human artifact - knows the true story of man's rise and fall but, acting in a fashion distinctly unlike anything Asimov might have attributed to a robot, keeps it to himself. Jenkins has concluded he owes canine society an opportunity to grow and flourish on its own unaware of the fact that dogs were once nothing more than pets to a mean-spirited and violent race of humans.Although City contemplates a lonely ending to mankind as a species, hard core tech weenie sci-fi fans will rub their hands with glee as they read of Simak's imagination and prescience at work - automatic lawnmowers, atomic powered private planes, televisor ports, laboratories and manned bases on Venus, Jupiter and Pluto, an inter-stellar expedition to Alpha Centauri, the demise of natural farming fuelled in part by the rise of mass production hydroponics, ICBMs, inter-dimensional transportation, fireplaces reduced to an anachronistic self-indulgence, suspended animation called \\"The Sleep\\" as a psychologically gentler form of suicide, and, of course, thinking, sentient robots as servants and work mates.To draw on a cosmological metaphor, the ending for man that Simak tells of is not the violent, catastrophic big crunch type ending that would see us wiped out in a blaze of glory. He rather talks of a much bleaker, almost unbearably sad ending to humanity as it simply disappears - the infinite boredom of heat death, as it were, as all motion ends and the universe reaches a boundless uniformity with the maximization of entropy. Simak is blistering in his criticism of man's arrogant opinion of his own place in the world, a theme he will return to again and again in such novels as \\"Time is the Simplest Thing\\" and \\"Time and Again\\":\\"But man had changed. He had lost the old knowledge and old skills. His mind had become a flaccid thing. He lived from one day to the next without any shining goal. But he still kept the old vices - the vices that had become virtues from his own viewpoint and raised him by his own bootstraps. He kept the unwavering belief that his was the only kind, the only life that mattered - the smug egoism that made him the self-appointed lord of all creation.\\"At once inspiring, frightening, un-nerving, depressing and yet touching, City is a classic that needs to be read by all true sci-fi fans.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"City","review":"The Clifford D. Simak Centennial Edition of \\"City\\" includes all the stories form the original book from 1952 (although in a different order) as well as an Introduction written in 1976, and a final story called \\"Epilog\\" written in 1973 as a tribute to John W. Campbell. This book won the International Fantasy award in 1953 for fiction, was rated 2nd on the Astounding/Analog Poll for books in 1956, and then 9th in 1966. It was also rated 30th on the 1987 Locus All-Time Poll for All Time SF Novels, and tied for 38th on the 1998 Locus All-Time Poll for SF Novels Before 1990.Like several other Science Fiction novels, this one is actually a collection of short stories written earlier. Unlike some other novels built from stories, it appears that these stories were always strongly linked together, and the linking premise of scholars looking back at ancient mythological tales, works extremely well. The amazing thing about this book is the number of science fiction themes that it touches upon, and yet it still maintains a steady pace, and moves forward.The stories are as follows:\\"City\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in May of 1944. It is this story that gives the book its name, and it is an unusual name since there are no cities in the rest of the book, and in fact they are dead even in the first story. The first story is about the death of cities, and introduces the reader to the Webster family with the character John J. Webster.\\"Huddling Place\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding in July of 1944. In this story we meet Jerome A. Webster M.D., a man who in his younger days traveled, but now in the later stages of his life he suffers from Agoraphobia. Prior to that, he had become friends with Juwain, a Martian philosopher. Juwain is working on a philosophy which will advance Earthmen and Martians alike by hundreds of thousands of years in just a couple generations. When Juwain needs an operation that only Webster can perform, he is forced to make a choice between the safety of his own home, and saving a friend. This story introduces the character of Jenkins, who is a robot that serves the Webster family, and appears in most of the stories. This is the only story in which there are Martians, although the lost of Juwain's philosophy is very important to many of the stories.\\"Census\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in September of 1944. This story is about a census taker, who is traveling around to get an understanding of the Earth's population, and also to learn about the Mutants. He learns about a mutant (Joe) who is able to fix things easily, and tries to get him to finish Juwain's philosophy. This story introduces the reader to several important characters and events. First there is the dog Nathaniel, who is the first talking dog, as well as Bruce Webster, the man who performed the operation to allow Nathaniel to talk, and Thomas Webster who invented the space ship drive that is allowing man to travel outside the solar system. The character Joe is important, as are the mutants. Joe's stealing of Juwain's philosophy, and his work with ants that allows them to evolve is also important to the overall tale.\\"Desertion\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding in November of 1944. This is the story of Kent Fowler, who is trying to find out if man can survive in a different form on Jupiter. The problem is that the people he sends to find out are not returning. Finally he decides that he himself must go, and he takes with him his faithful dog, Towser. This is perhaps the most unusual of the stories, as it doesn't include a Webster character, or Jenkins. However, the transformation to a Jovian life form is very essential to the story.\\"Paradise\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding in June of 1946. Kent Fowler decides to give up paradise, and leave behind Towser, so that he can let humanity know of what he experienced as a Jovian life form. Tyler Webster tries to conceal Kent Fowler's story, so that man will not abandon Earth and instead fulfill his destiny. This story is important, because it leads to the exodus of man from Earth, and the decision by Joe to turn over Juwain's philosophy to humanity, which ultimately serves his own ends.\\"Hobbies\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in November of 1946. In this story Jon Webster sees the end of man's reign on Earth. Most of humanity has left for Jupiter, and those that remain are engaged in various hobbies that do nothing more than pass the time, and the Juwain Philosophy makes it impossible for them to ignore their fate. Jon Webster journeys to see Jenkins, and learns that man must leave Earth to the dogs and the robots so as to avoid dominating them.\\"Aesop\\" is a novella, first published in Astounding in December of 1947. Peter, one of the few remaining humans, creates a bow and arrows. When he uses them to kill a bird, accidentally, Jenkins is forced to seek help from the Mutants. This story is important to the story, because we learn that the Mutants have left Earth, and this is also the first we see of travel between dimensions.\\"The Simple Way\\" is a novella, first published as \\"The Trouble With Ants\\" in Fantastic Adventures in January of 1951. In this story, we learn the ants that Joe helped advance way back in \\"Census\\" are still around and taking over Earth. Jenkins seeks help by awakening Jon Webster, but when the only solution he can offer is killing the ants, Jenkins realizes that he cannot allow the ways of man to return.\\"Epilog\\" is a short story, first published in Astounding for the John W. Campbell Memorial Anthology in 1973. This last story, written so long after the others, is a wrap up of Jenkins' life. He outlasts the ants, and then only he and the mice remain. The dogs return in a spaceship, and Jenkins realizes he has no reason to stay any longer on Earth."},{"Title":"City","review":"I still get choked up when I think of generation after generation of highly evolved dogs sitting around camp fires and debating over whether or not the mythical race of gods known as \\"man\\" ever really existed. Of course the same goes for the idea of robots carrying out man's dream of exploring the universe, as a sacred trust, long after men have ceased to be. And of course there is also the matter of the supreme sacrifice of man to ensure that his old companions will develop to their full potential- without human interference.As much as I love Simak's _Waystation_ and _The Goblin Reservation_, this book is probably his masterpiece. It is certainly his most epic, covering so many millenia. I am so glad that Old Earth Books has put it back into print. Here are themes that he would expand in such works as _Ring Around the Sun_, _A Choice of Gods_, and _Special Deliverence_. This is good, because when you finish you definately are left wanting more.I think that it was Heinlein that once said, \\"If you don't like Simak, then you don't like science fiction.\\" I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"City","review":"This is one of the most creative and intriguing books ever written"},{"Title":"City","review":"You can argue SF or Fantasy all you want, but the City stories are right up there with other classical works of American literature.While a little disjointed, this series of stories covers an awesome span of time, through the span of humanity and beyond."},{"Title":"City","review":"I bought this as I had to read a short story from it for an English course. Fell in love instantly. It's a bit archaic in the style and prose, but the story is great. I especially love the two part story about the man and his dog on Pluto; absolutely profound."},{"Title":"City","review":"I first read \\"City\\" when Eisenhower was President, and have read it frequently ever since. Clifford Simak was the premier pastoralist of his day, and \\"City\\" was perhaps his finest and most enduring contribution to literature. Much of it is whismy, but much, too, is logical, thought-provoking, and prophetic. Since its publication, in the early 1950s, many science fiction writers have respectfully borrowed from Simak. Terry Brooks and Stephen Donaldson come immediately to mind, as does D.B. Kier, whose \\"Jody\\" would have delighted the Master. At bottom, if your idea of science fiction is a good story, without gratuitous violence, vulgarity, and bug-eyed monsters on every page, \\"City\\" may be for you."},{"Title":"City","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed City. I gave this book 4 stars b/c I find parts of the premise under-developed and hard to believe, other portions I found just a little silly. However, overall it was a thought-provoking and enjoyable read.Simak pieces together several connected stories into an overarching narrative, much like A Canticle for Liebowitz. Simak does as wonderful a job as Miller did w/ Canticle. Simak gives us the opportunity to see the evolution of mankind over thousands of years while still giving us an anchor in characters that persist across all of the stories, specifically in the form of a long-lived robot and a human family whose scions play pivotal roles in human history. This is where the real meat of the story is, I had great fun reading Simak's view on humanity's future, while imagining my own. However, there were portions of the novel that brought the overall greatness of the story down, for me at least.1. City is a deviation from typical sci-fi, in which humanity is crammed into ever larger cities and facing the challenges entailed. In the first 2 tales, Simak's posits that humanity will eventually outgrow the need of the city as a hub of human activity. Simak bases this supposition on atomic energy permeating everyday life, making travel of 100 miles equivalent to walking down the street today. This dispersion from the city is one of the primary drivers of Simak's plot for the remainder of the book. Personally, I found this premise to be a little far-fetched and unbelievable. I believe Simak's upbringing shines through here as he believes everyone wants 40 acres and a mule, rather than the big city. I found Gibson's picture of the Sprawl a much more realistic view of the future of our cities. However, even if cities do not become as bleak as Gibson supposes, I still find it hard to believe that cities will altogether disappear when every inhabitant decides they want to live a pastoral life. Humans want to huddle around the fire w/ other humans. I found Simak's description of our future living conditions lonely and unappealing. I had a hard time getting over this premise as I was reading, but if you can accept it you will probably have a better read than I did.2. In the course of the story, dogs are modified by human scientists to be given speech through surgical means and eventually become the inheritors of the world. I don't begrudge Simak this imaginative scenario; however what I do find unappealing is that Simak blatantly skips over the question of the persistence of speech in the dogs' progeny. The human scientist who surgically alters the first dog has a conversation w/ another character in which he states, \\"the dogs are somehow passing it down\\" meaning their offspring are also able to speak. For some reason I got a little pissed off at Simak for this, it seems a little lazy. Even in Simak's time, biologists knew that parental traits acquired through surgical means would not be passed on to any offspring. Simak makes no attempt to explain how the progeny of the first dogs were able to speak and I think he knew he was glossing over that, hence the conversation I alluded to. I understand Simak wrote this book before Watson and Crick did their thing, but some sort of explanation would have been beneficial to the story.3. I did not care at all for the canine narrator's notes on the tales which are placed in between each one. I found these to be the weakest portions of the book by far, and ended up skipping them after the first three. I later went back and read them after I had finished the last tale. I felt that these notes really took me out of the story and interrupted the flow. I understand Simak provides these notes to give some insight into the dog culture of the future, but I found them to be unnecessary and a little silly. I think the book would be stronger had they been omitted.Overall, I found City to be thought-provoking and entertaining. My criticisms aside, this book is definitely worth reading. It was nice to read such an imaginative picture of the course of human evolution."},{"Title":"City","review":"This is truly a wonderful book, which also includes the only character in all of human literature who is consistently and apparently eternally happy, and who benefits all he touches.. Joe, the mutant, who helps mankind find happiness, sets the ants free, and laughingly fixes folk ray guns.I love this book."},{"Title":"City","review":"Beautifully woven together stories about humanity's ascendancy, legacy and decline, with an underlying theme about the hubris of misspent opportunities. Thousands of years in the future, Dogs gather together over a series of tales from the distant past and debates whether Man was truly real or was simply a myth. In Simak's version of the future hydroponics and cheap transportation have made cities and countries obsolete,. Humanity is guided into this by a benign World Committee who's long term goal is the advancement of humanity. But all utopian dreams of are a trap, and one generation's defining ideals become the Achilles heel of the next.Simak is more restrained here with his usual flow of ideas, and the result is improved characterization, with each of the character groupings representing a different archetype.A masterpiece of hard SF that should not be missed."},{"Title":"City","review":"I knew I was going to have read many of the stories before, collected in this or that anthology, but I was surprised to have read nearly all of them. Perhaps I'd read the book before.There was one story I was looking for but missed. One where animals sit around a campfire deciding what to do when a group of humans return to Earth. The dogs want to welcome them back but many of the other animals don't. Perhaps that one was by another author. There could be some question about Simak's intentions writing a story like this but this style of humanism or whatever was probably not the norm in the Science Fiction of the day. Surprisingly, when interviewed in 1975 and asked about the future of Science Fiction, Simak said, \\"I just hope we don't get faddish, I hope we don't have another New Wave, I hope that we don't begin writing topical stories\\". He once commented about one of his stories being shown on television, he said it was a nasty story, probably the reason it was his only story ever shown on television.For anyone writing about life on Earth, after humans, or even writing about animal life this is required reading. I suspect Clifford, the big red dog, borrows it's name from Clifford Simak.There's a reason this is called Simak's masterwork, or simply a masterwork."},{"Title":"City","review":"[&#8230;]I've loved this book for a long long time, all of Simak really. I'm still looking for a copy of \\"Way Station\\" though."},{"Title":"City","review":"Simak wrote these interconnected stories in the mid-1940s, and it's a mark of his talent that you can't tell. So much early science fiction is marred for the modern reader by a telltale stiffness of language and a jarring quaintness of outmoded science. With the exception that one of these stories suggests that surgical modifications have become hereditary, there's nothing dated about the science in \\"City,\\" while Simak's ideas about what it means to be human and about the ways in which non-human intelligences might be both far more than and vastly different from human are as relevant now as when they were written. \\"City\\" is a very slim volume to contain so much food for thought."},{"Title":"City","review":"The thing that makes this book just a little difficult to get into at first is that the perspective is that of those who inherited the Earth from Mankind. The introduction at the beginning of the story is the kind of introduction you might find today in a book about legends and their sources. While the introduction slows down the reader's entry into the book, the reader later uses the introduction to help tie the eight short stories in the book together into a more coherent framework. What the introduction infers is that the storyteller is an intelligent canine, and the eight stories are the remaining fragments of stories regarding the perhaps mythic creatures called Man. The canine writing the story notes that there are conflicting viewpoints as to whether Man in fact ever existed, or was used to explain the origins of the intelligence of dogs. The perspective of the narrator in the initial introduction and in the introduction of each of the stories is quite interesting and gives the reader a unique perspective.The stories themselves are interesting, but venture beyond science fiction in a variety of ways. An explanation for ghosts is provided briefly. There are so many elements introduced that are beyond our current knowledge that the story is closer to fantasy. The stories cover genetically engineering dogs to have intelligence comparable to Man's. We see a society that is so wealthy that cities are no longer required and everyone lives on a country estate. Energy is abundant and incredibly cheap. Man has the ability to transform himself into other creatures. A class of man has mutated into incredibly intelligent and powerful beings that build doors to other worlds, and then they left the rest of mankind behind.Incredibly intelligent robots also appear throughout these stories. I kept wondering why a robot would serve man for millennia when it had intelligence that appeared to surpass man's, however, I had to suspend logic just a bit, though I also assumed that perhaps the robots had laws similar to those that Isaac Asimov later created for robots. A sort of toss in side story that appears in a couple of places is apparently advanced ants. The one flaw with that side story is that ants have existed for millennia in the tropics and have not had to hibernate, and they had all the advantages of the ants in the story. Once again Simak has included another fantastic story element.These stories were written in the 40s during a time of transition and development of modern science fiction. Science fantasy had yet to be defined, and many early works of science fiction were so bizarre that were they to be published today they might well be considered fantasy versus the previously all-encompassing science fiction category. However, even with the fantastic elements of the story the book is a good read. The perspective of the dogs in the later stories is plausible and interesting. I was most intrigued by the conclusion of the collection. I had anticipated several endings, and yet the actual ending was disturbing and somewhat sobering. Clifford D. Simak tried his very best not to be egocentric with respect to his species.I think that during the time these stories were written this collection was likely one of the more innovative and interesting works. Today the stories are a bit dated because we have accumulated another 60 years of knowledge. We have learned that hibernation is more difficult that we thought it would be at that time. We have learned that Jupiter does not have a solid surface, and the temperature on the planet is quite hot. It does not appear that cities are likely to be abandoned any time in the near (and from what we can tell, even the far) future. If you can ignore that knowledge, the stories turn out to be quite a bit of fun."},{"Title":"City","review":"It would probably be appropriate to start this review with a critique of the science involved in City. Simak's grasp of some concepts seems elementary for his time and later developments put to ridicule other aspects of the book. Some examples would be the colonies on Jupiter. It would be very difficult for the Lopers to crawl around on Jupiter, as it has no solid surface. Even placing cognitive abilities aside, the idea of dogs being able to speak human tongues goes against all we know about the evolution of language and the human language organ as described by Chomsky. In one of the tales, some humans are described as choosing to go into some type of stasis referred to as sleep. Now, even given the improbability of human hibernation for short periods, longer hibernations would feature characteristics irreconcilable with the preservation of corporeal integrity. Muscles wither without stimulation. Stimulation keeps hibernation from happening. Plus, think of the bedsores after several thousand years!!!!!!! A full dissection of the scientific flaws of this novel would certainly run almost the length of the work in question.That being the case, how does a novel with physical flaws as its very base merit a five-star review? That is a fair question for anyone who hasn't read City. Those who have read it know the answer: the stories. City is composed of eight interconnected tales each introduced by an anthrop/cynologist. The tales as described by the canine narrator, begin with the downfall of the city as a viable community and extend through a doggish explanation, and attempt at debunking, the lack of historical artifacts as proof of the fabled race of man. The prose is solid throughout but the literary style is secondary to the development of Simak views of humanity and what it has to offer to the rest of the world.Simak's substitution of a race that appears, by human standards anyway, to be more arbitrarily brutal than man as its replacement is surely suspect but it is merely a prop for his story. The tales comprising City were originally published separately as stories in pulps in the 1940's during and immediately after World War II before being collected in book form by Gnome Press in 1952. Simak's hope for a bettering of mankind after the dark time he witnessed it pass through is obvious throughout the works. The evolution of humans (and other animals) beyond killing is one of many noble ideas presented. The one morally questionable idea is the development of a slave race of intelligent robots. The enslavement of beasts of burden is certainly bad enough, but enslaving something that understands its servitude is surely worse. Characters in the novel achieve peaks of knowledge and understanding but are unable to show it to their fellow man. They are able to perform unique acts of medical expertise but cannot reason out agoraphobia enough to leave the house to bring about philosophical revolution. They show all the flaws of humanity and some of its talents as well.What I found most interesting of all the ideas present, was the call for the complete changing of the guard for humanity. Severing all ties to the old cadre as a means of preventing their poisoning of the next generation is a neat concept. One loses all the benefits they provided but also shucked are prejudices, irrationalities, and codes/rhythms of behavior that produced them, outside of whatever among them are biologically induced anyway. All in all, I would call this book a great read and were it not for the publication of The Demolished Man in the same year, it surely would have been the inaugural recipient of the Hugo Award. It has an appreciable depth of imagination. It has a solid construction of sentence and flows wonderfully. It stimulates where many merely entertain"},{"Title":"City","review":"I read City back in the late 60's. I was captivated by the tale, or several tales actually, that make up the story. I realized that trying to explain it to someone unfamiliar with it just made it sound silly (talking dogs, lopers on Jupiter, robot butlers, etc.) so I would just recommend it to friends and let them discover the magic. Most did. Simak himself said he wrote the story to reassure himself, in the darkest days of the cold war, that there was a better world coming. And, in some ways the book is dated to that period. But in more important ways it's timeless. There is a poignancy to the stories that's difficult to describe, but which moves the reader more than at first realized. This is what keeps me coming back, these many years later, to re-read them. They seem to stimulate feelings associated with similar settings and activities in the reader's life, almost like prosaic haiku poetry. There is no hard science fiction here, and no high fantasy. There are wonderfully written, fanciful tales that will enchant and entertain readers of many different ages.

I have been using it for 3 years and have found it to be an excellent basis for conversation practice. The content in most of the chapters is interesting to the students so they enjoy talking about the subjects and learning the vocabulary by using it in real discussions. It's a buy!"},{"Title":"Pasajes: Lengua","review":"There are many Spanish textbooks out there, but this is one of the few that makes teaching yourself easy and interesting. (Learning at school as I did kills any enthusiasm for studying. To catch up on two chapters when I switched into Spanish IV, I studied constantly - with enthusiasm and interest - for two days and was able to learn them well enough to take the chapter tests. But as soon as I got into the class, my enjoyment of studying immediately vanished as we dragged through the lessons with much busywork and silly activities).Although it begins with the basics, this book is not designed for beginners. Rather, it reviews all Spanish from the basics to more complicated concepts for those who already have a base in Spanish.It's a fast but thorough review that gives an overview of all the rules and provides the nitty-gritty details and exceptions to help you completely master the basics, something probably not done in lower-level Spanish. It's designed for students who have already taken about two years of Spanish.The book does teach vocabulary, but its main emphasis (and strength) is in grammar, so make sure you have a solid vocabulary. Particularly helpful is the \\"Ojo\\" section, which explains common mistakes, such as words that are the same in English but different in Spanish, \\"false friends\\" (what appear to be cognates but are actually unrelated words), etc. (Examples: to work = trabajar (as in a job or labor); funcionar (as in a machine, watch, TV, etc.). Another: to support, which can be sostener, mantener, apoyar, all depending on the specific usage.)With the textbook and the workbook, you can go through the book quite quickly. Ignore the exercises in the book itself and the video sections, because the workbook is really the best way to practice what you learn.The vocabulary taught is sometimes silly but a lot more useful than certain other textbooks. However, it doesn't prepare you for actual conservations, only school-like discussions about the environment, gender roles, etc.Overall, it's a very good textbook. It's a bit expensive to buy on your own, so I'd suggest either taking a class which uses this book, or finding a cheap used copy."},{"Title":"Pasajes: Lengua","review":"I have taught out of Pasajes Lengua from time to time over the last 10 years throughout several editions. The Fifth Edition, with Rodney Bransdorfer added to the author team, appears to be their hottest edition yet. The grammar activities are better organized and cleaned up, and the presentation in the book is sharper and more comprehensible than ever. While many texts just lose steam after several editions, Pasajes has hit its peak!"},{"Title":"Pasajes: Lengua","review":"Why must today's textbooks writers nearly always revert to political themes? From Chapter 1 (Tipos y estereotipos) the authors LIBERALLY (no pun intended) salt the text with their political philosophy. Another example is the slum lord who exploits the poor single mother in Chapter 5. Given that today's textbook writers are graduates of the 60's and 70's, I guess this is no surprise. That said, I also find the layout of the book wonting and too complex. Between the textbook, the accompanying &quot;Cultura&quot; book, the combined lab/workbook and the tapes, you're looking at some serious coin to buy supporting materials for an intermediate Spanish course. Add in a dictionary, 501 Spanish Verbs, a tape recorder/player and notebook, and I have to carry it all around in a small suitcase. It also becomes challenging to coordinate all the assignments between the different books. Enough with &quot;learning systems&quot;. What ever happened to a simple, straight-forward textbook? Of course, there's even more stuff for the instructor (videos, instructor's manual). Surely these good caring folks couldn't be that heavily motivated by money -- could they?"},{"Title":"Pasajes: Lengua","review":"just wanna post a follow up to one of the other reviewers of this book who said this text is too political.

My mother purchased an earlier edition of this book, published in 1982. I had that edition until I recently ordered this one to replace it.I should preface the rest of my review by saying that I have a definite interest in medicine, and planned to become a paramedic. I did take my EMT-B certification (Emergency Medical Techinician-Basic) a few years ago, and this book was one of my resources for studying for tests and answering homework questions. So, I have a clear INTEREST in all things medical, and really enjoy just browsing through this book.I find that I look things up in this book at least once a week. Sometimes I'll hear the name of a disease or illness on TV and out of curiousity to know more, I'll look it up. If I have a strange symptom, I'll look that up. I am single with no children, but this book would be an invaluable first-aid resource for a family with children or for anyone taking care of a sick or elderly friend or family member.My favorite aspects of this book are the glossary of medical terms, the very complete and easy-to-use index, and the medication section. Several times I have looked up a medication to determine if it is safe to take with other medications, or to see if side effects are normal.I think every household should have a copy of this book. Most of the information is timeless and very informative."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"My 25 year old will soon have a baby.

With two children and another on the way, they could easily see that this book would be used time and time again. I have early childhood memories of flipping through the pages of this book and looking at the pictures. I have later memories of flipping through the pages and reading about different conditions and diseases and general anatomy. And now, even though I dont have any children of my own, I still go back to this book to reference symptoms and facts that I hear about in day-to-day conversation. Symptom flow charts are excellent.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"Everyone should have a medical reference book at home (especially if you have kids), and this is a good one.There are several things that I like about the book. First, there is a \\"self-diagnosis\\" chart section in the front. If you have a bad headache, stiff neck, sick stomach, etc, you can go through the flowchart and get an idea of what might be wrong. This is not to replace a doctor's diagnosis, but it really helps me determine if I'm being overly-concerned or if I should see a doctor. I definitely use that section of the book.There are also sections of the different systems of the body that include descriptions of diseases. A little while back I was having problems with my digestive system. It really helped to read the section on colitis and Crohn's disease to understand more about them so that when my doctor discussed them, I could better understand him.There are also sections on First Aide, caregiving at home, selecting physicians, and even a section on terminal illness and death. Though those last few items are things we don't really want to think about, there is information about how to handle making arrangements and whatever else needs to be done.There is also a drug dictionary in the back which can come in handy, plus a medical glossary.Overall, I'm glad that I added this book to my library. It has an abundance of useful information about illness and medicine. I do have another medical reference guide as well, but it's not nearly this comprehensive. I think everyone should have a book like this on their shelves."},{"Title":"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide","review":"Although no one should forego getting a doctor's opinion, this book is absolutely the best layman's guide to self-diagnosis.

When a patient or family member comes down with a new diagnosis, most people want more information to learn more about it. I use this book as a teaching tool so that they can start to learn about their health and personal illnesses. It lays a good foundation for initial health information. I personally like its emphasis on preventive care. It can also help you decide whether an ache or pain you have is serious enough to seek medical attention or not.

Once started, I could not close it up to sleep, but read straight through start to finish. It is a rich and complex novel, well-wrought and fascinating, especially for someone like me who did not grow up in the South, or in America at all, but in Australia.The story centers on Gayla Tyner, daughter of a respected Black doctor in Carolton, South Carolina, who comes back home to the painful task of confronting, and eventually overcoming, old hurts. As Fortune says, &#65533;It takes a lot of weight to break open the stones.'Gayla's story gives us a different perspective on growing up in the segregated South. It gives us the world of the educated, upper-class Black, showing us what it was like to feel equal, even superior, to the white people who, by reason of their whiteness, felt free to call her &#65533;nigger coon,' &#65533;jigaboo,' &#65533;darky,' &#65533;tarbaby,' &#65533;old yellow thing,' a world where even the compliment of being asked to sing for wealthy white groups, &#65533;who thought nobody could sing like \\"the Colored,\\"' was an insult, a world of dislocation, of not knowing &#65533;exactly where we're from in Africa,' of &#65533;white relatives who don't come to Christmas dinner.'Gayla's world is richly peopled by characters who walk right off the page into the heart. Their stories wind in and out of each other, turning back to look behind, leaping forward to peer into the future, a kaleidoscope of past, present, and hoped-for all happening together, the way they do in all of us.Much in this rich layering is dark, but the reader is not left in darkness. With her keen eye for the telling detail, Fortune gives us glimpses of the hope that has grown up since desegregation: a black hand in a white, a passing smile from white to black, a reference to the easiness together of black and white in her children's generation.Running through Gayla's story is the story of her husband, George, a compulsive and eventually doomed philanderer, who &#65533;loved women . . . Tall, short, light, dark, young, or a little mature. The only ladies George ignored were ugly ones.' Fortune shows him, a newly minted PhD, applying for his first real job, as an Aeronautical Engineer, and being redirected to &#65533;Altman's Custodial Placement.' His story gives Fortune the vehicle to voice her concern for the plight of her generation's Black man who, &#65533;knew how it felt to be invisible,' and as a result, &#65533;can't move forward, and . . . will not move backward.'Nigger Rich has a strong visual and tactile impact. Gayla's neighborhood comes alive with wonderful details of food and clothes and customs, the sound of voices. She gives us a place where dogs &#65533;wag their tails in simple pleasure for a clear, warm day,' a place of old women, the &#65533;grandmothers, who nurture all the children of their neighborhood.' Here is a funeral feast set out on &#65533;the round, oak dining table, baskets of golden, hot, homemade rolls wrapped in large, white, starched, cotton napkins, a buttery aroma announcing their entrance . . . Silver platters high with home-fried chicken, cut-glass bowls of creamy potato salad edged with slivers of oily pimiento, and sliced boiled eggs sprinkled with paprika, lined the dining table and sideboard. Coconut, pecan, and sweet potato pies filled two card tables because there was no room for them anywhere else.'Fortune spends some time considering the concept of how to name her people: Black? Negro? Colored? African American? She comes down to the delicious notion of &#65533;People of Color.' What a lovely phrase, and so apt. Never have I read a story with such a feast of skin color: yellow, high-yellow, molasses, umber, caramel, black-as-night, coffee, honey, cocoa, taupe, bamboo-brown, copper, buttered toast, henna, ebony, tea, chocolate. It's like a poem, or as one of her people says, \\"There's nothing prettier than a roomful of us, all decked out . . . A flower garden with all the colors of the rainbow. Yes, ma'am.\\"Growing Up Nigger Rich is a lovely book: an engrossing story, an education, and a finger pointing toward hope for true and lasting amity between the races."},{"Title":"Growing Up Nigger Rich","review":"This novel centers on the story of one black woman's attempt to come to terms with her heritage and therefore also the stories of the many people who shaped her existence.

Fortune's novel Growing Up Nigger Rich seems at first to tell a straightforward, simple story. College professor Gayla Tyner pays a visit of determined self-discovery to her parents and hometown. Caught in the ambiguities of a troubled marriage relationship, she contemplates her family relationships, connects with old friends, considers her options.But scratch the surface of Fortune's story, and you find a commentary full of wisdom and experience that proves the old saying that the personal is political. Gayla embodies the peculiar social and economic history of this country. She is a daughter of privilege, yet as vulnerable as any African American to the insults and outrages of racism. Through her story, we see the history of social change in this country and are confronted with troubling questions that remain. Who are we? What have we gained, and what have we lost? And most importantly, where are we going?Growing Up Nigger Rich is about reconciliation: Gayla's need for personal reconciliation with herself, her father, her husband's infidelity; but also America's need for reconciliation of its present with its past. Thanks to Gwendoline Fortune's skill as a storyteller, this is an alternately painful and exhilirating, ultimately enriching and most engaging process.(c)2002 Jan Maher"},{"Title":"Growing Up Nigger Rich","review":"There aren't many books that tell emotionally rich, detailed stories about the lives of second or third generation upper middle class or professional class African Americans. GROWING UP NIGGER RICH is one of those rare books. I compare it favorably with others that tackle the same story telling challenges, the same fictional \\"turf\\", with Ntozake Shange's BETSY BROWN, also about remembering growing up the daughter of doctors. Or with Andrea Lee's several books of stories, although Lee's stories aren't reminiscent. Or some of the story/chapers in Gloria Naylor's LINDEN HILLS. Much as I enjoyed and admire these other books, I think Fortune's book is the richest, has the broadest range of characters, the deepest and, to use Du Bois' term, most \\"doubly conscious\\" sense of history and identity, and, without stretching this reader's capacity for belief, the most hopeful vision for a future when communication, friendship, understanding, and love can grow and thrive across boundaries of generations, regions, classes, and race.

Fortune wove a touching web of loyalties amongst family members, children to parents and vice versa...regarding life's ambitions.Some of the issues were, of course, universal and we all will readily relate to them, too. But the others, those described from the black perspective, from those who lived it--the indignities, the pain, and the qualities necessary to be able to find joy in spite of it, and to survive the slow battle--not yet won.

Once I started reading, it took me a minute to realize that this is fiction and not the author's life story. That darn picture on the cover totally fooled me. Once I got that straight, I just muddled through until the end. I can't explain it. I usually find something appealing about stories about Black southern life, but this one did not move me one bit. I didn't even become slightly more interested until I got toward the end and the situation with Gayla's husband. I still am perplexed about how growing up 'nigger rich' was germane to the story. The main character still had to endure the prejudices that were prevalent during her childhood. The wealth her family had only seemed to allow for more material possessions, if anything.

With the Abarat series, I at first was thinking from the reviews that it was for young people, but Clive makes reading his work enjoyable and engrossing for all. Granted, I read the book in a day as well as the second one the next day, but his art is imaginative and it gives you a glimpse into this master storytellers minds eye. I love the storyline and cannot wait for the next parts to come out. For those of you, who think he is only\\"HORROR\\", you are very wrong."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Finally the plot gets going in the Abarat series. Book one is really a linear, I go on a journey story. It sets up all the plot lines for book 2 but they really go nowhere. Book 2, things heat up, the plot moves right a long and when I started I had a hard time putting the book down. I won't ruin the plot line by repeating it here. But its alegory is that of a young girl finding herself and her place in the world. Plus the usual chases, close escapes, fights makes it entertaining even for guys. My kids didn't like it as well as some other fanasty books they have read, but I think they under estimate the staying power of this book.In addition, Clive's illustrations have gotten a lot better. Practice has improved things tremendously!I will be awaiting book 3 at the front of the line."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"The second volume of the Abarat series is just as filled with wonders and visions as the first, but somewhere along the way you realize that Barker is plotting this whole series a lot more tightly than you might have thought at first. Days of Magic picks up a couple of weeks after the end of Abarat, with Candy and Malingo still on the run from the Criss-Cross Man, and with Christopher Carrion still intensely fascinated by Candy for reasons that even he doesn't fully understand. And based off of the first book, you might think that this will continue...but Barker pulls the rug out quickly, escalating things far more quickly than the reader expects. As the book unfolds, you'll start to realize just how ably Barker was laying groundwork and planting seeds in the first book; more than that, you'll start to realize that the scope of the series, and understand that the plotting here is far more complex than simply being a tale of light versus darkness. Nowhere is this more pointedly on display than in the book's finale, which genuinely shocked me on the first read; on a second, you can start to see how Barker's building towards it, and you have a sense of where we might be going from here. Luckily, now that book three has finally been released, I don't have to wait for another 6 or 7 years to find out what happens next, and that's great, because Abarat has the potential to be one of the great all-time young adult series. From its vivid imagination to Barker's beautiful artwork, from its complex morality to its compelling characters, from the villains to the heroes, it's hard to think of anything that's quite like Abarat, and even harder to think of a time when Barker's talent has been more on display."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"When I readAbarat (Abarat), I really liked it. However, I wasn't \\"wowed\\". I liked it enough to go on and read the second book in the series.Like many other reviews state, this book picked up where the first left off. We follow Candy around the islands on her quest to find out who she is, and escape Christopher Carrion. There is a review on here that says you don't get to explore any new islands in this book, and that is not true at all. You get to go with Candy and her friends to many other islands, both in Day and Night. And once again, Clive Barker's paintings make a great visual aid to the story.You will be missing out if you don't read the second installment to the Abarat series. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 14 as there are some very scary scenes and paintings, but anyone else, I would consider this series a must read!"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Well, you have to have read the first one to really sink your teeth in this one. Oh, were do I start. The story is fabulous and builds so much on what was gleaned in the first book. There's lots of intrigue and little subplots. Ooh, this book just packs a wallop of a story. The pictures are amazing and just draw you into the world of Abarat. You've just got to read this book to believe it. Warning the ending will have to begging Clive Barker to produce the third. Highly, recommended!!!!"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"The two books of Abarat are fun to escape into. The names and situations are goofy at times, but still make you want to read on to finish the story. This has lead me to read more of Clive Barker. The Great Secret Show and Coldheart Canyon, I am in the middle of Weaveworld. I have found no matter the earlier his works or the newer attempts are equally entertaining. There is some shock value, but is that not the reason for delving into this genre of books. Praise to such talent."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I loved both Abarat book and would highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys fantasy books. It is fast paced and intriguing."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"This book (along with book one, ABARAT) is surely going to go down in history as a \\"classic series\\" of books. It's the second in a 5 part series aimed at young adults and adults in general. Book one sets up the story and even though that book leaves alot unanswered this second book delivers on the promises of the first. The only problem is that we still have to wait until october 2007 (at the earliest!) for the 3rd volume!!. Clive Barker is currently writing an adults only novel at present called \\"The Scarlet Gospel\\" which he will hand in to his publishers toward the end of 2006 and then he will begin writing ABARAT 3: ABSOLUTE MIDNIGHT. It's worth a mention on how well produced these books are, rich glossy pages which contain some truly bizzare pieces of art work and even under the dust jacket the books have superb cover boards. Everything about these books has quality about them, they are heavy too which adds to thier sumptuous feeling. Buy the hardcovers for your collection and buy the mass market paperbacks (no illusrations) for reading copies. Im certain book 3 will go one better than the first 2 in the series and I for one, can't wait!"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Drat you, Clive Barker!I am completely charmed by this $#**#^& book. I can see right through the gimmick and I'm utterly entranced anyway. This is a perfect testament to Barker's descriptive powers.Ultimately this duology is an excuse to travelogue through Barker's illustrations, and the story meanders something fierce. The crux of the conflict -- the big reveal that the plot revolves around -- comes too late in the story, and is somewhat contrived (can't say why without spoiling). But the descriptions are so vivid -- even without the paintings! -- and the characters are quite well-formed -- that it winds up not mattering. His frontispiece poetry snippets are satisfyingly dark, and the villain is satisfyingly layered, contemptible and horrific (and wait til you meet his mom). And there's no cop-out of a happy ending -- it works while being neither sappy nor too depressing. Actually to be honest it doesn't really end... perhaps another sequel is planned? (If you like his art style, add an extra star, but even though I don't, I must sincerely admire the effort, and the book is attractively put together.)Disclaimer -- this is ostensibly a children's book, but am quite certain I would not have been able to handle this when I was a child without a couple of weeks' worth of nightmares.Overall, the setup in the first book is superior to the payoff in this second one. The pair of them are not nearly as moving or as seamlessly put together as \\"The Thief of Always\\" -- but then, this story isn't trying to accomplish the same thing; it's more action than allegory.My library copy is now a month overdue.I want to buy these books just for the poetry, now.

TOTALLY facinating! couldnt wait to read the second book, Days of magic and nights of war. it was enthralling. Need to know when book three is coming. cant wait. I know these are meant for the young adults but believe me, if you need something to take you away from any troubles you have, THESE ARE THE BOOKS FOR YOU. and i must say that amazon has none right by me in every thing i have ordered. thank you MARTY"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"\\"Days of Magic, Nights of War\\" is the second book in Clive Barker's \\"Abarat.\\" Not only does it meet any expectations I had hoped for from the first book, it exceeds and rises above them. \\"Days of Magic, Nights of War\\" is amazing, incredible, adventurous, and chock full of the most dream-like illustrations that are sure to please any fans from Barker's previous book.PLOT: Candy Quackenbush, still living in the amazing world of the Abarat, and Malingo, her Geshrat friend, are still running from the forces (Christopher Carrion, Mater Motley, Otto Houllihan and the list goes on. . . ) that want Candy captured. In her wild adventures, Candy finally meets up with the Prince of Midnight himself and some of her own mysterious history, a history that will soon become vital to the war of day and night that is soon to take place.But Candy is not alone and never will be. . . Join her as she and her friends (some new, some old) travel, barely escape from enemies, and wait for an end they know not what of, in this second book to the \\"Abarat\\".POSITIVE POINTS: As I said in my review of the first book, I was surprised (and relieved) as I read that this is not a dark, morbid tale. Instead, it was light, enjoyable, adventurous and completely absorbing. Yes, it's full of monsters and some illustrations to accompany the monsters, but they're there for enjoyment, not the kind to make you fall off your chair. ;)NEGATIVE POINTS: My own worry that Clive Barker will disappoint me in the next \\"Abarat\\".AGE RANGE: 10 and up because of the \\"monsters\\" and oddities.RECOMMENDED? Oh yeah, for pre-teens, teens and adults alike! Clive Barker has an incredible, at times humorous, imagination that is sure to please everyone.WHEN TO READ: Any mood, perfect on rainy days or when you'd like to be \\"somewhere else\\". ;) Surprisingly, this is very lighthearted, so I recommend reading it when you are in a negative or depressed mood. It will actually lift it.EFFECT: Read somewhere private or quiet, where you can envelop yourself into the imaginative world. If you listen to music when you read, I'd recommend listening to something light but deep. Such as Rock, Oboe, Viola, Pipes....As always, if you have a question about the book, feel free to email me.Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"This is a story many of us have read before, in one form or another: a child on the brink of adulthood finding themselves in another world and in a position to change it, often dramatically. We've seen it recently in Harry Potter, but before that we saw it in Neil Gaiman's \\"Books of Magic,\\" in Susan Cooper's \\"Dark is Rising,\\" in C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, and even earlier than that in Lewis Carroll's tales of Alice and her looking-glass world. It is perhaps to this last that Barker owes his greatest debt, but it is a common theme in literature, especially childrens' literature.What makes this story different is, quite simply, the fact that it's told by Clive Barker.Barker has long been a favorite writer of mine for the richness and depth of his imagination, and for the fantastic worlds he is capable of creating. From the horrors of \\"Weaveworld\\" to the depths of \\"Imajica\\" to the magic found in \\"The Thief of Always,\\" Barker is often a visionary without comparison. Some of his recent work does not live up to this potential, but his Abarat series is as bravely imagined as anything he's written.Just listen to the names he populates the world of the Abarat with: the people have names like Candy Quackenbush, Malingo, Christopher Carrion, Mater Motley, Finnegan Hob, and the Princess Boa. Places are named things like the Efreet and Babilonium and the Yebba Dim Day and the sea of Izabella. Creatures are named mantizacs and geshrats. Just Barker's names roll off the tongue in delightful combinations and spark the imagination.And the ideas -- if the names hint at a mystical world, the true magic lies in Barker's ideas. The Abarat itself is conceptually brilliant, a world in which time is place, and each hour of the day is represented by an island upon which it is always that time. The people of the islands go about their lives without experiencing time as we do, divided between day and night. For them, they always live at six o'clock in the evening, or at 10 in the morning, or at midnight. The only way to experience a different time is to brave the Izabella and visit another island. It's quite a concept to wrap your mind around, but it's incorporated into the story so well that it seems quite natural.And, oh, the illustrations. One mustn't ignore Barker's paintings in this book. He has spent years illustrating the books of the Abarat lovingly and profusely, and nearly every page has at least a morsel for the eyes to enjoy. Taken together, the illustrations of the Abarat are a visual feast, full-bodied, rich, and perfectly-suited to the depth of the story. Barker has long been a Rennaissance man of sorts, as both a writer and a painter, and it is a supreme pleasure to see both aspects of his work come together so brilliantly in the books of the Abarat.Make no mistake, this should be considered a very dark fantasy. While not nearly as graphic or brutal as Barker's \\"adult\\" fiction, the Abarat stories definitely have a dark edge and are probably a bit much for younger children. Older kids in their teens, though, should be able to fully enjoy the worlds of the Abarat without having nightmares about it later.Also, don't forget that this is the second book in the series. Candy's introduction to the Abarat and the chief players in this drama has already taken place in the first book, and what we see in this one are the further adventures as she learns more about this new world and its people, and how it all integrates with her own world -- our world, known to Abaratians as the Hereafter.Physically, \\"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War\\" is a heavy, thick, weighty book, as befits its subject matter. Candy's journey -- like Harry Potter's and Will Stanton's and even young Alice's journey -- is one of discovery. As she discovers this new world and her place in it, she is also discovering things about herself that she never knew existed. It is the depth and courage of Barker's imagination that sets the book apart from others of this kind, giving readers of all ages a banquet of delights. This is no light fantasy fare to be nibbled and sampled, but a feast to be devoured fully, and savored for all the exotic flavors that it has to offer.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"You've probably read all the other reviews, so I won't rehash them. What really is admirable about the Abarat books, aside from the storyline and the paintings and everything else, is that Clive Barker has given kids a landscape in which everyone is acceptable and welcome. Abarat is replete with freaks and outcasts who are all part of the normal culture. This is, I believe, a very important if somewhat occulded message. Whoever you are, even if you are orange and have elephant ears, you are valuable and necessary.Since everything else important has been said about this book, just thought I'd throw that in. There are cultural messages here which lie beneath all the rapturous fantasy, and Mr. Barker has done a wonderful job in delivering them."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Unlike the first ABARAT this book wasn't my favorite. Although, it brings the real Clive Barker out: the darker side of his literature. It was a little bit more intense, and its love elements were a bit too much for me.

More adult in tone than Harry Potter, this second installment seems to have more dark overtones than the first, yet never gets too weighted down by it's darkness. I would say I enjoyed this trip to Abarat even more."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"WOW! Finally, Book Two of the amazing series by Clive Barker has come out! This is the book event of the year! This book, starting off where the first one ends, has everything you wanted to know or see in the Abarat. Not only do you see more of the stronger, more heroic side of Candy, you also see a lot more of Christopher Carrion,Mater Motley, and the rest of there dark comrads. Not to mention the return of Malingo,The Johns's, and the rest of the crew. You meet the 3 sisters of the fantomaya again, and meet a whole bunch of new characters. This book was gripping from the secone you start reading it. You also,something I was personally hoping for, get to see a lot more of the islands of the Abarat.

What really happened between them?Candy also begins to realize her power.The characters, creatures and landscape are all amazing. So beautiful and intricate that I want to be there. I couldn't put this book down until the very end, and now I want more.It's a pleasure to see something truly original and inspired for young adults that can also wholly please an adult. It's also a pleasure to see a female in the lead role instad of the obligitory young boy in the lead with females only for supporting characters.I reccomend this book to anyone who who wants to embark on a voyage into the fantastic and unknown.

Barker's ability to use his own artwork to bring the characters and scenes to life is truely unusual, and the frequent and amazingly good drawings give the reader a chance to fill in the blanks when his descriptions of the quirky characters are sometimes hard to visualize. The plot in this second book of the series seems to slow a bit in places, but gradually the reader learns more about Candy Quackenbush (my favorite character)and is treated to her continuous and humorous interfaces in the strange Alice of Wonderland like world that Barker has created. This is high fantasy stuff, and readers should not expect to find a story grounded in the least bit of reality. Some of the scenes and characters are a bit replusive, cruel, or obnoxious as well, so sensitive readers take note. But all in all, its a thoroughly enjoyable read and recommended for readers above age eleven."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I haven't honestly gotten all that far in the book so far. I'm only on chapter nine. Even though I'm twelve I've read a lot of fantasy books. For, example I read The LOTR series at age eight! But this beats most books I've read and I haven't even finished it yet. In this book I find Candy more interesting than I did in the other book. However, I didn't find an issue as to wheather Clive is gay or not a subject of discussion. I mean it's his own life what right do we have of prying into it. I mean his books are incredible with incredible pictures.

Candy Quackenbush an ordinary girl from a boring place called Chickentown, is not as ordinary as she thinks she is. One day Candy stumbles onto a one way ticket into the Abarat, the mystical sea of the Isabella. Throughout Abarat she is chased by the evil forces of midnight controlled by Christopher Carrion and his grandmother Mater Motley. When running she stumbles across many types of people, animals, and things and begins to realize, she isn't just Candy Quackenbush and in fact she feels as though she has been to the Abarat before.Soon after she starts to realize this Carrion sends his right hand man the Criss - Cross Man to kill her and he dies trying. Forced to move she goes right back to her old town and all is revealed about her past and even some of what she must do in the future.Abarat was a thriller book with many twists and turns that kept me reading until I finished and even after. The book threw up more than I could even take in, in one read! I was hooked until the end and after that too. I loved this book because of its spectacular form and all the pictures with were really enthralling and new. The main thing I thought that kept this book in my head and kept me focused on only it was its newness. Who in the world would ever dream of a place where your wildest fantasies are actually alive? The Abarat was new and fresh and was an entertaining and fascinating book with its characters and its awesome pictures. The author, Clive Barker, brings together the weirdness of Abarat and normal day life and created something better than both in this book. The best book I've ever read I would insist on anyone reading this book and if you don't like fantasy read this and you might start loving it. The first book kept you reading, the second book will leave you craving more of the Abarat and Candy and her friends."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I really enjoyed this second volume. Far more adventure and our hero, Candy, really begins to learn how powerful she truly is. The adventure between worlds was good and I really enjoyed all that happened in this book.

I can't wait for the next!"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Passing the island of Gorgossium, the inhabitants of the Parroto Parroto silently glide across the depths of the Izabella, fearing the acrid creatures that spring from the depths of the isle. Suddenly, these grotesque forms with leathery flaps of skin and bones of their skeleton aglow take refuge on the ship, preparing to befoul the catch of the day. As Candy Quackenbush prepares to fight the group of zethekaratchia, she is defeated with one swipe in her foolhardy attempt. But without warning, a strange word erupts from her throat, \\"Jassassakya-th&uuml;m!\\" All the contents of the ship started to vibrate violently. The zetheks plunged into complete turmoil, two of who were killed and another that escaped. Candy had uttered a Word of Power. Without the knowledge of any Abaratian, how did she ever know a complex magical spell such as that?Geshrats. Sacbroods. 25 Islands, each representing the hours of day and night. You will soon find out that this eccentric piece of the novel is just a fraction of the marvels to expect from Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War by Clive Barker.It was roughly two months ago, in Minnesota, when Candy Quackenbush strolled into the outskirts of Chickentown following a mysterious golden cloud. Esoterically, she discovered shells and bones of fishes in the middle of Minnesota. She continues through the meadow and awakens the sea through a ball in a dilapidated lighthouse. But it seems that when she indeed reaches the Abarat, Christopher Carrion has a keen interest in this girl and seeks her through the Criss-Cross Man. What would he want with a schoolgirl from Minnesota?With Malingo the geshrat, Candy explored the Abarat to the Skein, cave of all threads strung together the existence of all things. Walking along the cave, there was an echo beyond the cave. It sounded exactly like...the Criss-Cross Man. Candy had finally met her demise. With a faint glow from the end of the cave, she could see the scar beaten face of her catcher and the rickety bridge that she was now swinging on. Faced with a dilemma, Candy could approach the Criss-Cross Man, or jump to the running river under the bridge with the risk of getting killed. And with that, she plunged with Malingo into the darkness below.THIS BOOK IS FANTASTIC! As a student, I like to read just for the sake of reading, and this book just caught my attention as soon as I laid eyes on it in the bookstore. Once you begin, it's like you're sucked into this black hole and you can't escape until you've finished the book. Clive Barker's depth and talent that he put into this book is mind-boggling. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who would enjoy an abstract world filled with the wonders beyond your imagination."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I loved this book!

It works upon logic, but a twisted logic that is imbued with elements of the wonderful, terrifying, and humorous. It will literally take your breath away. However, I must warn those who have not yet read the first Abarat not to tread upon these paths until they have done so. :)This new portion of the Abarat saga begins once more with Candy - the novel's quirky heroine. Events quickly spiral out of control, however, and Candy finds herself pursued relentlessly by Otto Houlihan the Criss- Cross Man, one of the Midnight Prince's most potent henchmen. She uses quick wit and a bit of luck to escape him, and each escape only fuels his rage and resentment.Enter Christopher Carrion - the Lord of Midnight. Carrion, a complex villian to be sure, has been nurturing plans of destroying the Abarat and remaking it entirely according to his rules. Although this may seem cliche, (trust me) Barker's twists succeed in throwing this notion out of the window. Anyway, both his and Candy's futures are entwined somehow; yet even he cannot begin to fathom the extent. He constantly feels an undeniable urge, to meet her, to understand her - a pull not even he completely comprehends. Candy, on the other hand, would love nothing more than to free herself from his obsession and riddle out her mysteries for herself.All in all, you will be at the edge of your seat until the final gripping climax, when a revelation will be unleashed among the people that threatens to overturn the tide of war raging between the Night and Day Hours. Even at the end, you are not totally sure of what you have witnessed, and ponder that perhaps the event did not turn out how you perceived!Whew! Now that the plot has been touched upon, I can highlight a few of my favorite, less visible, facets of the novel. There are countless undercurrents that will require a second glance (or third, or fourth ...) to fully grasp. One cannot help but dwell upon how good and evil, love and hatred, irony, eroticism, and other topics are portrayed. Barker successfully blurs the line between good and evil, and depicts a required balance that can easily be disrupted and righted again. Not wishing to bore you my delightful readers, I shall not dawdle any more upon my undecurrents and allow you to buy the book for yourself.Truly, this books is to be appreciated to the highest degree.

Reading prior review, I must disdain in the support of this person as anything new should be realized that it is a borrowing of something that exists in the world already, only manifested as something new. And in that, to read something like this in the days of contempt of our Government, our Nation from other eyes in the world, I see this book as a step into the imagination that makes things happen through the mind and onto paper and finally into this second book of ART. Granted, you either like it or do not, but the first book was loved by myself, my lover, my mother, my brother and my nephew and niece. I find it hard to understand how someone can complain unjust when they themselves falter on anything new. It exists, whether new or not in relation to anything past, it is something that has been born of the artist that is Clive Barker and in that, I am happy to say, this book is wonderful in it's fantastique and story telling to any age alike. Highly recommended and I compare it to nothing else, but wonderful reading."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"On the one hand, I would have given Barker's 'Days of Magic, Nights of War' the 4 and 1/2 or maybe 5 stars it deserved back in 2004, when it emerged in hardcover glory. The second installment in his Abarat \\"series\\" brought greater excitement (as one would hope) to the adventures of Candy Quackenbush & friends in the wild, weird world she entered. In this 2004 segment, Barker regales with a nearly over-burdened plot, but manages to create a compelling world teeming with amazements. His paintings/illustrations are utterly exquisite and make this entire idea a thing that ought to be forever treasured.But it's hard to do so. The first book arrived six years ago in 2002. The second four years ago in 2004...ominously along with hype about a film, a theme-park deal, etc. With the complexity, incoherence, and surrealism of his Abarat plotline, this is a series that Barker needed to keep coming at a viable pace (at *least* one book every other year).But with the sad and apparent neglect given to finishing this extended work, it has been all too easy for initially enthralled readers (and buyers!) to lose complete track of the basics of this story. Moreover, it has been all too easy to lose interest altogether in its outcome. The unfolding of this series has been so ruined by whatever strange delays have taken place, that one is hard-pressed to imagine how Harper Collins is really going to salvage the project in terms of contemporary viability.It's apparent that the film is OUT (and understandably so, after such sloth in Barker publishing the whole thing). I can't help but feel that Barker has really short-changed his audience and his great Abarat (once so full of potential) by failing to complete the installments in a remotely reasonable fashion. Again, one wonders how excited the publisher is going to be to promote the future 3 volumes(3 more?!? I don't see it happening).That's a shame--if Barker had stuck to his work ethic and vision, forgoing the lure of hasty, premature movie-studio deals and theme-park rights, this series could well have been one of the great multi-part sagas of our time for young adults (and those who \\"think\\" young). But as it is, the audience of 13 year-olds he targeted in 2002 is now getting ready for college and interest for the project as a continuum has been fatally lost.I was moved to write this review because I was recently reorganizing my library and happened upon my 2004 hardcover copy of \\"Days of Magic, Nights of War\\" and nearly flipped. \\"Wow! I just about forgot this series existed!\\" I said to myself. \\"The rest of the books must have come out ages ago and I happened to miss them in the bookstore.\\" Wrong. I was very disappointed to learn of the serious discrepancies in the publishing history of this series. Not only because I paid hardcover prices 6 and 4 years ago, expecting to have the whole set in reasonably timely fashion (every other year, perhaps), but also in a bit of sadness for a magnificently complex tale I expected to savor and unravel during my actual *lifetime.*I'm glad to know that these books have a second life in paperback, and may win some new fans in that form, but even the paperback edition of this portion came out 2 years hence, and this only underscores how terribly this once-vibrant project has been derailed. At such a rate, I will indeed be ninety before the last one comes out--which I won't be waiting for.The interest, once-piqued, has dimmed. The reader's faith (once-earned) has been breached. The best we can hope for is that Barker will even finish this tale one day, and that, after we are all long dead or aged, the whole series will be able to be purchased at once by future-folks. But Barker has even jeopardized that hope. Why should publishers be eager to manufacture & market five expensive illustrated volumes in the distant future if the project couldn't even get off the ground properly in its own day(s)? The entire project needed one cohesive decade, at least, to build up its classic status, its legend, and its mystique for posterity. Instead, it has been left in the proverbial lurch. A failure, especially given the greatness of Barker's artwork--which really is as crucial as the narrative, in this case.And, to reiterate, had this series been given its due diligence by the author himself, it would have been a collection worthy of all-time greatness. Now, I'm sure some die-hards may still care, but there can't be enough. After six, seven years, I'm a former die-hard who's not going to go back and read them the first two again, especially with no real guarantee that an ending will ever come! If you happen to read this, Mr. Barker, please know that you have disappointed an admirer of what ~could~ have been something truly, truly monumental."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"For the person who gave this only 2 stars you need to know that this series is not targeted to adults.

Yeah, there is a scene on the pyramid island and one other on the island that the princess was killed on, by the dragon. But, mostly it's just Candy running from diffent characters while narrowly avoiding capture. Many of these scenes are not very well done. The one in which Candy escapes Christopher Carrion is especially dreadful, with the end being telegraphed from a mile away. The book ends with very little solved and hardly anything happening, besides the deaths of a few minor characters. I wanted to know more about the various creatures and peoples living on the islands. I wanted to know more about the monsters of the deep. I wanted more than Clive Barker delivered. If another in the series comes out I'll definately read the reviews and maybe a chaper or two in the book store before I deside to read it. I am not going to bet on it though. jay."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I found the first book in the series charming, and the second will not disappoint the faithful reader. Candy Quackenbush is a likeable and intriguing character and her adventures are beautifully and vividly painted. In this continuing adventure, she continues to run from the Criss-Cross man and must answer the question why the Lord of Midnight is so determined to capture her.Abarat is a really enjoyable series. I don't put it on the same level as Narnia or some of the other children's fantasy classics, but it sure is a lot of good fun. Recommended."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Because I actually like the storyline and the idea as a whole, I went on to the second book, and against my better judgement, the third, hoping the writing would improve. It hasn't. At all. And now I'm trapped because there are so many unanswered questions throughout and at the end of each book that if I don't go on to the next, wondering will drive me crazy.I REALLY don't get it. Barker has a good reputation as a writer, so I hope that is as a result of this just being a terrible example of his writing that runs for an entire series. If that's not it, I worry that all the reviews have been written by people who have never had the pleasure of reading a well written story. There are sentences that go on for the length of a paragraph, where not only do I get confused, but apparently so did Clive because he seemed to forget what he was saying and leave them unfinished. Unfamiliar words appear at random as though we should know what they are, but in checking the text, they have not appeared previously and so we are just left to wonder. You're not suppose to have to do research in the middle of your fiction novel in order to continue. The whole series is an example of terrible writing and gaping holes in the text that annoy and distract the reader."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I love the Abarat Series!

It did not have the elements of some of Barker's previous novels which included over the top fiction. This book was very readable and gripped me until he very end."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"This second installment takes us even further into the Abarat in terms of character, motivation and imagination. Finally we start to learn and care about the characters of the series. Candy at last ceases to be a cardboard cut-out girl and becomes something far more fiesty. Relationships are formed and plot-lines are filled out.Needless to say, the first book left me uncomprehending why Mr Barker had allowed so much of his precious talent to be taken up with something so repetitive of previous works of his (Weaveworld and Imagica)yet watered down for children. But in this volume I really sensed the heart of it, and the heart in it. I think the metaphysical elements are very subtly introduced. I like the way he talks about love in the book and what it can mean in all its forms. I like the way he discusses death and metaphorizes reincarnation. I have always suspected that Mr Barker was a shaman of sorts - a 'world walker', if you will, and this book really suggests to me that even if it is not something he identifies in himself, is most certainly there in his work, as evident as the gentle spiritual lull of the Hawaiian Islands he frequents. It makes me smile to see that he is suggesting quite new-age spiritual concepts in the same way that C.S Lewis suggested Christian ones in his 'Chronicles'.I got a little bit tired of the whole thing being based around a chase to maintain tension. At times, it seemed as if the chase was purely there just to provide tension and nothing more.But, after being hugely dissapointed with the first book, I have to say that this is the only criticism I can make. It won me over. I love the way he paints sky. I lovethe way he paints sea. I'm glad I persevered with it."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I know I'm in the minority, but I've been underwhelmed by this series. Clive Barker clearly has a vivid imagination -- there are more fantastical creatures and settings running around in his brain than he knows what to do with. Some of the creatures are interesting, particularly those like Malingo whom we actually get to know. But too many pages are taken up with inventories of oddities -- some seen by Candy on her travels, others involving the terrible Christopher Carrion and his assorted gruesome hangers-on. Most of these creations are irrelevant or tangential to the plot, so that I wound up skimming through those passages going \\"blah, blah, blah,\\" while waiting for something to happen that would actually advance the story arc. I don't think I'll bother with the next book."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"After falling in love with the first book, I immedeately pre-ordered the second volume of this wonderful series. Now, after I read this volume, I can't wait to revisit Clive Barker's amazing Abarat!Picking up right where the first book left off, our heroine Candy continues her journey in Abarat and in her journey of self-discovery. After finding out that she has been to Abarat before in Book One, this volume reveals to the reader (and to Candy) the answer she has been seeking and introduces us to the begining of the war between the forces of Night and Day. Along the way, we are introduced to several new characters, including the famed Dragon slayer Finnigan Hob and Letheo the beast-boy.Once again, Barker's colorful and lively paintings take center stage. This is no truer than in several chapters that deal with Candy and Malingo as they explore the island of Babilonium (aka The Carnival Island). Taking a cue from such fantasies as Little Nemo in Slumberland and Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials triology, Barker creates paintings that showcase his description about the island, from a gallery of freaks to the crowds of people from just about every corner of the Abarat! This is my favorite part of book; it makes me want to explore the world Barker has created for myself and take in all the sites, sounds, and smells!Once again, if you have not read the Abarat series, what are you waiting for? If you love fantasy series that are orginal and descriptive like The Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, or His Dark Materials, then read this series! Once you've been to Abarat, you'll want to go back for more!"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Let me begin with this caveat: if you did not read or did not like the first book of Abarat, do not bother with this book. You will be either lost or unmoved.If you enjoyed the first book of Abarat, though, this one is well worth the wait (though I admit I could not wait, and spent an outrageous amount to get the advance reading copy). It ups the ante considerably, providing us with the thing most missing from the first book: interaction between our heroine, Candy, and Christopher Carrion, the Lord of Midnight. These are the best chapters of the book; they took my breath away - Carrion is one of the greatest villains I've ever had the pleasure to read about.The rest of the book, while not perfect, still managed to make me bite my nails and hold my breath and gasp at the many sights proferred to us by Clive Barker's pen and paintings. More than anything, this is a visual treat, not just because of the lovely paintings but because of the rich description that makes you see the story as if it is unfolding right in front of you.But - this is definitely part of a story, not the whole. Do not go into Abarat thinking each book is a separate tale. I almost wish Clive Barker had waited to publish the series until it was complete. There are many questions left unresolved, and a variety of characters juggled in different parallel plot threads. Each person will probably have their favorite character and complain they're not in the book enough. I have to admit I rushed through some parts on my first read to get to more Carrion - what can I say, I have a soft spot for the bad guys. All I can say is wait for Abarat 3 & 4 - I'm counting on Clive for an amazing pay-off."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Reading about the journey of Candy Quackenbush within the Abarat is a far more enjoyable experience in book two. The author expands his imagination as he introduces more unusual intelligent mythical creatures. It is a pleasure discovering the eccentricities of each new creature as Candy encounters the cultural differences within this archipelago. The reader is now familiar with the territory and eagerly turns the pages anticipating each new thrill, knowing at any point ... with a twist and turn of events ... there maybe an ambush by Christopher Carrion, Lord of Midnight or one of his subordinates. By now the reader knows he has an obsession with meeting Candy to discover the source of her magic. He is convinced she possesses special powers for having survived the many obstacles placed in her path and having vanquished highly formidable foes sent by him to capture her. The fact she has managed to evade him is an endless source of irritation which goads him further on his mission. One unexpected source of pleasure is reading how his grandmother Mother Motley has insight into his devious plans and even sees within his heart what his true desires are. She sews day and night helping to create an army of fiends to aide him during the anticipated battle to win control of the Abarat. More surprises await the reader as Christopher Carrion and his grandmother clash on personal levels when she hurls insults and hateful epitaphs at him. While one is rooting for Candy to overcome their evil intentions ... the reader can not but laugh at some of the clashes between these two villains. There is truth to the old adage 'divide and conquer'...The friendly and unique creatures from book one, such as John Mischief, the other Johns and Malingo, become old pals as the reader is taken down meandering pathways exploring the islands and experiencing new adventures. New challenges await Candy and one of the most gratifying discoveries within the book is when Candy *finally* meets the dragon slayer ... Finnegan Hob who had been engaged to Princess Boa, who was killed by a dragon. This reader is very pleased the author did not cop out and create a romantic interlude betweeen these characters. Romance would diminish the natural appeal of the books which is reading about imaginary creatures, magical mythical islands where the heroine experiences excitement and adventure.The author does a superb job of weaving together a common thread which ties the Abarat and Chickentown. It is heart warming to read how Candy, at last, communicates with her mom, dad and brothers. The mysterious connection between the three wise ladies from the Abarat who sailed on the Sea of Izabella and Candy Quackenbush of Chickentown Minnesota is revealed. The reader learns how and why Candy Quackenbush came to possess unique powers of magic ... This story is complete in all of its myriad of details and magic. It fully deserves 5 stars. Thanks to Allison for lending me book two.

Candy Quackenbush, originally from the Midwestern town of Chickentown is brought for reasons she doesn't quite understand to this new world where magic works. What she does know is that Christopher Carrion, the Lord of Midnight, wants her brought to his home in Gorgossium, a place where monsters obey their lords' bidding and night never ends. He sends his minion the Criss-Cross man to bring her to him but he dies trying.Carrion and his grandmother Mater Motley plan to bring war to Abarat so that darkness will reign forever over the land and the champions of light will be defeated. They fear that Candy and her allies will stop them but Carrion has another reason to capture Candy, one that he doesn't understand himself until he recognizes who she really is. While evading Carrion's minions, she has plenty of hair raising adventures on the various islands but always she is forced to move on or be caught in her enemy's web.Clive Barker has made his mark as one of the best fantasy writers of young adult tales since C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. This book contains 125 illustrations that raise the bar of excellence even more. Candy Quackenbush's adventures can be compared to a magical version of The Perils of Pauline. Candy doesn't know her purpose for being in Arabat is to avert a war but she does her best to help people who are victimized and manages to find a little time to have some fun. DAYS OF MAGIC, NIGHTS OF WAR is a fantasy worth reading by high school students as well as adults.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Beautifully written, and amazing storyline.

R. Martin fans take note, we Barker devoted have been waiting for eleven years). Candy and Malingo are still on the run from Christopher Carrion, and here have to gather something of a small army, most of whom we met previously in Book One, to combat his various schemes. Those who have not previously read Abarat will likely have a hard time getting around, as Barker spends no time reacquainting us with things to which we'd already been introduced in the first book (and thank heaven for that). Those already familiar with the world, however, will discover exactly the kind of book one expects from Clive Barker-- rich, fast-paced, with well-drawn characters and clever twists in the tale now and again. There are a few things that seem a bit more transparent than one would expect, but we'll have no idea if we're right until the third book comes out.A very worthy successor to Abarat.

I loved the first book, but this one had to be atleast a hundred times better. First off, I enjoyed that Mr. Barker did not take time for a \\"review\\" chapter, that way you didn't have to suffer through rehashed information to get to the new story (For example, J.K. Rowling blandly rehases what happened in the previous novel, and this I find is highly irritating). But on the otherhand when there was a need for details, he subtly put them in, that way you didn't have to reference the first book. The story is very fast and adds a lot of new levels. Mr. Barker is the first novelist I have found recently that can actually create a bad guy that isn't entirely horrid but still evil enough that you can hate them. The protagonists in this story are exactly how you want them to be and increasingly human (though of course being of Abarat are clearly not human). The paintings are far more breathtaking in this novel, and I found myself taking the time to really study them; they fully added to my reading exprerience. I don't know if my sheer excitement over this novel makes a good review... but it was worth a try. Overall, if you liked the first book or thought it was \\"okay\\" then please give the second book a shot. Mr. Barker has perfected everything about this series as far as I can tell-- great new characters and the old favorites (I was quite happy when a few popped up again), great new Islands, and the story takes some very interesting turns! Please read! I can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"This book was so exciting. I just simply loved it.

You don't have to read the first one to understand the second perfectly.\\"Abarat\\" follows the adventures of Candy Quackenbush, a seemingly normal teenage girl who is accidentally swept away from her world, into a magical archipelago known as the Abarat, where time is not time at all, but a place, or rather, places: each island inhabits one of the hours on the clock. For instance, there is Gorgossium, which stands at the hour of midnight; the Nonce, which is three in the afternoon; and Scoriae, which stands at seven in the evening. The first novel chronicles her initial discovery of the Abarat; her first encounter with her best friend, Malingo; her fight against Christopher Carrion, the Lord of Gorgossium, whose dearest ambition is to vanquish all the magic and goodness in the Abarat--already flagging severely--and replace everything with a permanent midnight, over which he will rule supreme.All of this is established in the first novel, yet it is woven seamlessly through this second one. In the second one, Christopher Carrion, intrigued by Candy and hating her for it, sends assassins after her, tracks her, and in the end pursues her himself--all the while preparing for the day of Absolute Midnight.Candy, meanwhile, is discovering that she is NOT an ordinary girl; for one thing, she is a powerful incantatrix (spell-sayer) and, oddly, remembers things from the Abarat, things she has never even seen. While running from Carrion, she darts all over the islands, dodging the Lord of midnight while trying to save the Abarat, and unraveling the mystery of just who she is. If she and her companions are to save the Abarat from Christopher Carrion, she must know who she is, for she is irrevocably tied to the Abarat's fate.The second installment of Barker's saga is beautifully written and imagined. It's not flawless--Barker's writing can drag a little--but it's still beautiful, from style to character to plot and all in between and beyond. Personally, I was disappointed on this score: in the first volume, Barker sets the stage for SOMETHING between Candy and young, slightly sinister entrepeneurial genius Rojo Pixler, but there is no mention of him in this novel. Pixler, even if he's not precisely evil, is dangerous. Carrion wants to plunge the Abarat into absolute midnight; Pixler may not want destruction, but he wants to destroy the heart of the Abarat just the same by plumbing all of its magic and mysteries and putting them up for sale--for his own benefit. Even in their clash or confrontation or whatever it is didn't happen in this book, to exlcude even a mention of him when he's obviously important is a literary misstep.However, that's a relatively minor complaint--in fact, that and the very occasional flatness of Barker's generally incredible writing are the only complaints, certainly nothing that would have kept me from buying the book if I'd known. I'd reccommend it to any fantasy fan, and most people in general. But beware: this book has creepy imagery, both in the form of Barker's drawings, and in the descriptions and actions of characters. The horror of the stitchlings and the sacbrood, and definitely the sadism of Mater Motley, Christophert Carrion, and even Admiral Bloat are above most younger readers. Even Letheo's physical and psychological suffering at the hands of Christopher Carrion are causes for pause, if not censorship. Anyone 12 and older can handle this book without a problem. Most 9-11 year olds will be able to as well, and even younger readers capable of this material should be all right in most cases. Still--just in case, if you have any doubts--review it, because even though it's amazing, it's amazing at least in part because of the contrast between goodness and horror.All in all, this novel was excellent, and I do reccommend it."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Picking up right where the first book left off, Candy Quackenbush continues her travels throughout the wonderfully strange world of Abarat, in search of an explanation of why she arrived there in the first place. Christopher Carrion, the Lord of Midnight, is far from happy with the failing attempts of his henchmen Criss-Cross Man in trying to capture Candy, but decides to give him one final chance. Carrion is convinced that the little girl knows some secret that will destroy his ultimate dream of creating eternal night on the Abarat archipelago. Candy will need the help of Malingo, the geshrat she rescued from the clutches of the evil Wizard Kaspar Wolfswinkel, to fight against the Lord of Midnight's evil freaks.Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War is the long awaited second volume of the Abarat Quintet (originally it was planned to become a quartet, but Clive felt that the story needed some more depth and will add an extra volume). Based upon the speed that Clive Barker has been releasing these books, it will probably take Clive till fall of 2009 to deliver the final volume. And that is really a pity, because the story now really gets up to speed. Compared to the first book, which missed quite some action because it had to introduce the world of Abarat, this episode is a thrilling rollercoaster ride. Quite some colorful characters of the first book do make their reappearance, like the fascinating Wolfswinkel and the three witches Diamanda, Mespa and Jeophi. But this time all the pieces start falling into place. Candy will discover aspects of herself that she would have never have guessed she possessed.

A day away, or unreachable, Abarat of infinite possibility and variety is in the middle of a war between Night and Day, and Candy Quackenbush is so close to the center of the fight that she can't see the scope of it. The old characters are developed far beyond expectations set in the first book, and the new ones compliment the old characters while raising questions and introducing new depths to this story and world.Powerful imagery, quick paced story, and characters who draw you into their world work together to make this book a brilliant achievement from a master of literature.

The Abarat is a world unto itself. It is an archipelago, an island for each hour, with a total of 25 islands. In the first book, a native of Chickentown, Minnesota, Candy Quackenbush accidentally calls upon the Sea of Izabella and is swept into the world of Abarat. In Days of Magic, Nights of War, the second book of the Abarat series, Candy has been in the Abarat for eight weeks as her adventures continue. We find her traveling through the busy streets of Tazgamore, the island of nine o'clock in the morning, to hiding in the sickeningly happy carnival of Babinlonium, the island of six o'clock in the evening, where she is kidnapped and taken to the snow-blanketed landscape of Efreet, a night hour. As Candy and her companions scurry through numerous adventures, she discovers many magical words and places that seem quite familiar. Candy begins to understand the role she may play in the Abarat's future. Christopher Carrion(Lord of Midnight)has a growing fascination with her presence and its effect on the Abarat. While the reader explores deeper into the story,information of the imminent war between the islands of day and night causes characters and places to become more dangerous. The powers of darkness, Christopher Carrion and his malicious grandmother, Mater Motley, advance toward their plans to overtake the islands of Abarat and make them into a world of perpetual midnight. The plot thickens and takes many twists and turns to reveal their conspiracy to take over the islands.Clive Barker lives in California with his partner, David Armstrong, and their daughter Nicole. Clive is a celebrated artist, film producer, and director. He is the author of twenty books, among which are The Thief of Always and Everville.This was one of the finest pieces of literature I have ever had the pleasure to read. I felt that I was truly drawn into the story and was a part of what was going on. Few books can make a person feel really involved but this one is so descriptive and original there is little one can do to prevent them from falling in love with the story and the characters. One never knows just where the story is headed and the suspense of what could happen truly makes this book all the more enjoyable.I would sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys modern day fairytales. This is a must for lovers of books you cannot put down. This book kept me wanting more.

That is because the magic continues undiluted in this volume. This is literally a dream between two covers. So much of what was introduced with promise in Book One is more fully expanded here. I just can't get over the vividness of the images presented in both prose and illustration. This is a book that will literally make you dream in color...._Just in case you aren't familiar with the story so far, this is the tale of Candy Quackenbush from a dysfunctional little family in a dysfunctional little town called Chickentown, Minnesota. Candy is drawn into a fantastic new world of adventure and strangeness called the Abarat. Yet, as strange as this world is, it also seems more and more familiar to her...._By the way, if you think that not too much of importance will happen in the second volume of a four volume series, you would be wrong- dead wrong. As a matter of fact, so many important characters died in this book that I briefly wondered if there would be a volume three. The conclusion is so operatically spectacular that I cannot imagine Barker topping it when he concludes the series._The author also further develops the metaphysics of his vision here. From what I can tell his inspiration is primarily drawn from Plato. Actually, the Abarat comes across as one of the infinite levels of the astral plane- but one that is coming unglued and increasingly under the influence of dark forces. In any case, I found it a satisfying vision._Like the original volume this book is a top quality production in every respect: illustrations, typesetting, paper quality, end papers, covers, dust cover, etc., etc., etc."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"The combination of paintings and beautiful writing was just fantastic in this book. When I read the first Abarat, I liked it, but it seemed rather plotless to me. However, I couldn't stop thinking about it- and later, when I read it again, I really appreciated how many different layers there were to the book. I figured everything would be explained in good time. It was! The second Abarat is about twice as good as the first one, enriching on the characters and the entire world of abarat. I honestly felt like I could read this book a hundred times and not grasp everything. I've heard complaints that the main character (Candy) is boring, and without personality. I saw this in a different manner, as it allows her to reflect off of her surroundings. Her secret at the end of the book, is shocking! Perhaps what I love most about these books, is I am purchasing a work of art in several senses. At first I thought the illustrations would distract from the story, but it was the complete opposite. The best example I can give, is when a character is telling a story about how his house burned down- and when you turn the page, WOW! The spread is alive with red and orange flames. It's powerful. This is simply a lovely fantasy book (along with the first one) that will change your life.

I absolutely loved it, and waited just as impatiently for Book 2 of Abarat as I wait for the Harry Potter books!The world that Clive Barker creates in Abarat is so amazing, it almost requires his fantastic paintings to guide the imagination in the right direction. Candy Quackenbush, the ultimate example of \\"born in the wrong town at the wrong time needing so much more\\" can be related to by any teen pining for adventure. The villains of Abarat are so frightening and despicable that you shake when reading; Candy's companions are so wonderful you wish that they were your friends as well.Journey with Candy as she literally stumbles upon the 25 islands of the Abarat, a welcome change from the monotony of Chickentown, her home. She finds there everything she could've ever wanted--exciting friends in people like John Mischief, terrible villians in Christopher Carrion and Mater Motley, magic, adventure, but above all, danger. She quickly begins to doubt the accidental factor of her arrival, and as the books progress, so do the plot twists.All in all, the adventure-fantasy tale is a must read for all ages, especially the Harry Potter crowd."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"At first glimpse, it might seem that with the Arabat books, Clive Barker has jumped on the Harry Potter bandwagon which has driven several \\"adult\\" writers to pen novels targeted to the young adult market. Since Barker's excursion into this field actually predates the Rowling books with his tale The Thief of Always, the charge is not completely legitimate, but it is also not completely off-base either: while The Thief of Always is a dark, standalone fairy tale, the Arabat books attempt at something more epic, not unlike the Potter series. Regardless of Barker's motives, the series can succeed if it is well-written; and by this measure, it is a mixed success.The second book in the series, Arabat: Days of Magic, Nights of War, continues roughly where the first volume left off. Candy Quackenbush, the teenager from Chickentown, Minnesota, is still in the strange and magical world of Arabat, where the sun doesn't rise and set in a normal fashion. Instead, there is a different island for each hour of the day, and each island is frozen in that time (there is also a 25th island which has its own mysterious properties). The lord of the midnight island, the villainous Christopher Carrion, wants Candy as his prisoner, fearing that she has some unknown power that could usurp his plans to plunge all Arabat in total night.Much of the novel deals with Candy running from place to place, often just half a step behind Carrion's minions. While all this is going on, she will begin to learn something about what makes her special and also get an opportunity to have contact with her old home in the Hereafter (which is what the folk of Arabat call Candy's world). Even as Carrion worries about Candy, he also is busy bringing his plots to fruition and gets entangled with the intrigues of his nasty grandmother.Barker is very imaginative, perhaps too much so for this story. With so much running around and so many weird creatures and bizarre situations, there is little chance to really take all of it in. And though much is resolved, there is also much that is left in the air, as befits the second book in what I've heard will be a four-book set. Of course, it's been almost four years since this book came out, so I have to wonder about Barker's continued commitment to the story (I'd also heard that The Great and Secret Show and Everville were the first two parts of a trilogy, and it's been 14 years since book two in that set).Barker is a very good writer, but Arabat is not Barker at his best. A little more restraint and a little less action is required. This is not to say that these books are bad, but at best they rate a low four stars. Whether you're a fan of Barker or young adult fantasy fiction, this will not be tops on your list, but it won't be at the bottom either."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"i was very very VERY excited when i finally recieved this book, after a wait that seemed to last an eternity for the sequel to Clive Barker's unique and amazing Abarat.I was very cruelly and harshly let down.the first Abarat was an amazing story, full of amazing things and places, so far removed from everyday life that it was a wonder to read. The characters were interesting and very well developed, from heroine Candy Quakenbush to villain Christopher Carrion. It captured the imagination and made me beleive that if i jsut walked out of my life, i could find my way to the Yebba-Dim-Day and the Abarat.but this book...something changed. Candy Quakenbush is no longer a heroine we can respect and care about. in fact, she's become...well...annoying. Malingo, who i utterly loved, became very two-dimensional and alomst as annoying as Candy. John Mischief wasn't funny or loveable, just creepy. almost the worst offence was Christopher Carrion, who was reduced from an interesting, not-quite-anti-hero to a basic run of the mill bad guy who cackles and rubs his hands together often. The sets were boring, the action dissapointing, and the big revelation was not a revelation at all. it was more of a 'well DUH' then an 'oh my GOODNESS!' I honestly didn't care whether Candy drowned, went home, or foudn out her mysterious 'destiny'.so though Abarat was a fantastic book that i love terribly, this book could be part of a completeley different series. and a lesser, boring one at that."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I have loved Clive Barker's unique and interesting stories for many years. I have read Imajica three times over, always returning to it every few years. So, I was incredibly excited when Abarat was released.....fusing Barker's amazing art work with his equally amazing story telling talents.Sadly I found the first volume, and moreso, this second volume of Abarat to be tiresome to read. I understand that it is pitched at a young adult market, but even so, the actual story is just so boring and predictable. I found myself not caring whether Candy discovered her true destiny, or what adventures lay in wait for her and Malingo. My only impetus for finishing the book was to better understand what was being presented in the vivid, awe inspiring illustrations.I have to agree with a previous reviewer, and hope that Barker returns to more interesting stories....I have been eagerly awaiting the Third Book of the Art for a long time....."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Even if you hate to read, buy this book for the outstanding Artwork! Clive is a major talent on fire."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"This is a fantasy about young Candy Quackenbush from Chickentown, Minnesota who accidentally enters into another world known as Abarat. It is a good vs. evil type of story where the villain Christopher Carrion tries to capture Candy and turn Abarat into a world of never-ending midnight. This is the second book in the Abarat series and it was necessary for me to read the first book in order to understand the second. There is some recapping in the second book but not enough to get a real grasp of the situation, and since there are only 2 books in the Abarat series, the author probably intended it that way. Clive Barker is an adult book author who is making the crossover into Young Adult novels and he also painted all of the over 200 paintings in both books. I have to admit that I struggled through both books, although I enjoyed the second one more than the first. I think there would probably be a cult-following of the books by some kids, but I found the characters to be so foreign and the world so different that I couldn't identify with it at all. The characters were of an odd Dr. Seuss-type variety (in an bad way) and the story reminded me of a kind of Alice-in Wonderland. The setting consists of islands each set in a different hour of the day, which I found to be an intriguing idea, but for the world to be as small as it was (based on travel times), I would have expected it to be more populated or for the inhabitants to have visited all of the islands and be more familiar with them than they were. Overall, I give it a rating of \\"extremely strange\\"."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"This book lacks essential pieces of a story.

There's no consistent motivation, nothing interesting about her, she's special for no reason, does stupid things that aggravate and annoy the reader instead of being understood, and she even is the reason for random flashbacks to why she's so special (this happens more than three times).B 3/4 of the story, you barely know what the villain wants, you have no idea why the main character is worth caring about, and no idea why it's about her instead of the more interesting ones."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Clive Barker's personal life freeks me out, but he is a fantastic writer. If you can just overlook the freeky stuff."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Clive Barker's Abarat series continues where the first left off, both in continuing Candy Quackenbush's quest to discover her place in this colorful, highly imaginative world, and in its failure to grip the reader with a compelling and original narrative pulse.First, let it be clearly stated, Days of Magic, Nights of War is a highly imaginative flight of fancy, with beautiful paintings by the author that enhance the text. It is unfortunate that the story never lives up to Barker's art or the mind's eye visuals he creates with his clear prose.Consistently in the Abarat series, Barker's story feels forced; it is obvious that the images preceded the story. Too often does Barker's plot resemble a patchwork of story ideas from his prior novels; story ideas that once felt exhiliratingly fresh but now feel tired and uninspired. Candy seems no more than a child version of John Furie Zacharias' Savior-to-be character from Imajica, the 25th Hour no more than a sanitized, all-age friendly version of Kissoon's Loop from the Books of the Art, the ghost of Henry roaming Chickentown no different than the ghosts that haunted Everville. The Abarat, sadly to say, adds nothing new to Barker's canon of stories. And, ultimately, that is what is most disappointing about The Abarat series: its utter predictability.For the reader there is never a doubt about Candy's place in the Abarat. Yet Barker narrates incessantly about her role, even providing the villain Wolfswinkel with a lengthy monologue late in the book explaining Candy's role to any reader that might still be unclear.Barker's underestimation of his readers results in an overwritten, un-mysterious novel. The Abarat's characters frequently feel heavy-handed (i.e. Candy's father, who is nothing more than a rather annoying caricature of a drunken, abusive father). And the plot zips along without guidance, randomly choosing which scene to focus on (i.e. Finnegan and the gang don't show up until well after page 200).The Abarat is a strange failure; it's almost beguiling how poor it is next to Barker's other books--certainly disappointing, considering the unique visuals and the striking creativity displayed in individual scenes. It makes one long for the days of The Great and Secret Show, Imajica, Everville, Sacrament, Galilee, and Coldheart Canyon. One can only hope Barker's next adult projects, a short novel that pits Pinhead vs. Harry D'amour and the film Tortured Souls, will sway him from finishing the Abarat Quartet and motivate him to finish his mythologies that matter: Galilee 2 and The Third Book of the Art."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I'm not sure how I discovered Clive Barker. Maybe a student told me about The Damnation Game or I stumbled onto Imajica, but when I saw The Abarat, I knew I had to delve into the fine paper, art and writing. The book was hidden away in the basement of a book store on a special rack all its own, but out of the way -- by the bathrooms. I was struck by the cover, struck by the lucidity and waded in like I'd never read a book before (believe me, I've read plenty). When I saw Days of Magic, Nights of War proudly displayed up with the other new releases last month, I was just as eager as I was the first time I saw the artwork of the Abarat. I'd have bought it no matter where it was lurking. Thank you, Mr. Barker, for creating this world of hours and dreams. I am transfixed and moved by your imagination.

(Well, actually, I forgot I had ordered it when I ordered it again, and accidentally ordered it a third time, and then found it at a secondhand shop before the first order came in, and forgot I'd ordered it until after I'd paid for it....or was Candy Quackenbush calling to me from Abarat?) I had been away a long time from the first volume, and the second does NOT contain a \\"Previously in the Abarat Series\\" chapter, so I had something of a hard time remembering where we were and what was happening and who was who, or what was who, as the case may be. But once I had mentally refreshed myself, I thoroughly enjoyed Days of Magic, Nights of War. I do understand the criticisms that there is 'not enough plot', but that's not an accurate description of the book--there's plenty of storytelling, but little that is predictable because our plucky heroine, the amusingly named Candy Quackenbush, is not in charge of events but is rather carried along by them, rather like a ragdoll in a hurricane. When I say ragdoll, I mean a ragdoll with two souls, that knows magic and can travel interdimesionally. And when I say hurricane, I mean, a living hurricane with red dreadlocks and three rows of teeth filed down to knifepoints. Because that's the kind of place Abarat is, sort of the Land of Oz, as seen by Dr. Seuss on acid in a mental hospital. It's not for everyone...in fact I'm a little dubious about the 'young adult' label--sure, maybe the really cool, imaginative young adults, but maybe just as much for the young-adult-at-hearts like myself. My only real quibble is that I have to wait for the next two books--although some big plot points were wound up here, many (including those eponymous Nights of War of the somewhat inaccurate title) remain unresolved."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"This book is fantastic.

The book was in great condition and was just as I remembered it"},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"Abarat felt like an old fashioned travelogue, a book written solely to describe the people and the places that Candy encountered in her travels. Instead of advancing a story, the focus of each new chapter was seemingly to top the one before in terms of magic, weirdness, and the surreal. I found that I could put it down for weeks at a time (something I've never been able to do with a Barker book before), pick it back up, and effortlessly resume mid-paragraph. Not only that, but it felt . . . well, childish. I realise it's meant as a young adult read, but so was The Thief of Always, and that was an all-night, single-setting read for me.Fortunately, it seems Barker got the \`Disney' out of his system with Abarat, and is back to doing what he does best with Days of Magic, Nights of War. It's still a story of magic, weirdness, and the surreal, but it's just that - a real story. Here, we get into the thick of the plot, exploring who Candy really is, what brought her to the Abarat, and what role she has to play in its future. Things actually happen in this second volume, and there are consequences for all of it. What's more, this is a much darker story than the first, allowing Barker's imagination to shine.The first book hinted at the evils of Christopher Carrion, and showed us glimpses of Mater Motley's cruelty, but really restrained them. Here, Barker lets them loose, exposing their plans for the Abarat, and confronting us with the depths of their hatred, their cruelty, and their selfish vindictiveness. There's a very real tension to this volume, a palatable sense of dread and danger that was missing from the first. As a result, I felt an emotional attachment to the characters that I hadn't been able to form in the first, compelling me to read on, to cheer their triumphs, and to mourn their losses.I also liked the fact that we returned to the \`real' world in this book. I think it was the development of events outside the Abarat, and the progression of the stories there added something to the book I didn't realise was lacking. Maybe it's the contrast, or maybe it's the connection, but returning to Chickentown turned this from a good read to a great one. There's still a wonderful fairy tale of fable feel to the Abarat, especially with the developing backstory and the new aspects of the mythology, and I hope Barker never loses that.However, I like this darker turn towards events of significance, and I really hope Absolute Midnight carries that forward. Of course, if you've read the series then you understand that the title alone promises things aren't about to get happy any time soon."},{"Title":"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War (SIGNED + author drawing)","review":"I have been a fan of Clive Barker for a long time.

We, the humans, are evil monkeys, no two ways about it. I often doubt to the extreme that we are created in God's image. No way, Jose ! Murder, torture, rape, kidnapping, theft, insult, lies, bigotry, hatred, destruction---our stock in trade. But now, the question is, does any one group have a monopoly on these things ? I would say no. Even if your \\"group\\" has engaged in a great deal of any of the above activities are you, personally, thereby guilty ? I would say no again. That's why I found Hilden's book pretty irritating.Born a white-looking, urban, mixed-blood Indian, with Anglo-Quaker, Osage, Nez Perce and maybe Mexican roots, the author spent her youth in California passing as white, but secretly (or internally) feeling a strong Indian identity. A person in this position would be torn; a sensitive person all the more so. When Hilden writes of her personal experiences-all the influences, the traumas, and batterings of outrageous fortune that a mixed-blood Indian might face in postwar America---I find her writing clever and interesting, certainly passionate. How else would I know about such a person if not by reading her book ? I've never met any Indians and (pace Ms. Hilden) I have never wanted to be one, though when I used to go to Western movies, I always rooted for the Indians, having knowledge of my own holocaust. If Amazon browsers are interested in such an autobiography, I could strongly recommend this book. However.....The first 90 pages of WHEN NICKELS WERE INDIANS is pretty much of angry blast at whites, at the perpetrators of the genocide, at the continuous theft of Indian land, at the misappropriation of Indian culture, at the collectors of Indian bones and Indian folklore, at anthropologists, at the misrepresentation of everything Indian. Well, it's true. Events in (to choose from such a wide field) Armenia, Jewish history, Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia, and Tasmania show that it was hardly unique. However, do you need to read yet another blast at perfidious, lying, stupid ________s (fill in the blank)? A question. Do you want to read a book that sometimes has as many as 18 usages of ironic quotation marks on a single page ? They signal her anger, her sarcastic turning on everyone and nearly everything. I wondered, as I read, who was good in this world, who did the right thing, how should Indians actually represent themselves then, which authors wrote anything worthwhile, what is the right role for Indians, for minorities in general? I did not learn the answer. I did learn that the author was angry about a lot of things, including past mistreatments, misunderstandings, male sexism, and overly made-up women. She had a right to be, but is that enough ? Should I start my own autobiography with a 90 page blast against Germans, Russians, Poles, and all the anti-Semites of this world ? (now you can buy \\"cute\\" little Jewish \\"puppets\\" in \\"free\\" Prague. Where the \\"Jews\\" have gone is another \\"question\\".) Anger gets me nowhere, I come back to my life unchanged.

However, although the words in this book/booklet may offer a few things to think about on the subject, it's nothing I haven't seen before.I suppose I could comment on how I take some issue with the phrase \\"co-redemptrix,\\" which Bishop Sheen uses in reference to Mary. That's not a true doctrine of the church, and was eventually discarded by Pope Benedict, who said that it departed too far from the traditional language of the church, and gave rise to misunderstandings, and I agree with him. Still, it's a minor point by comparison to my central reason for not really feeling like this book is needed.I just don't see what this book has to offer that previous books haven't offered. Bishop Sheen's wisdom is wonderful, of course, but he's written so much; so many other books, covering the same topics, that you can really make do without this one.Is it a good book overall? Sure.

There were several helpful books in putting together these messages. This text from Fulton Sheen was not one of them.First, before you look at buying this \\"book\\" you need to look carefully at its description. It is more of a pamphlet than a book. Small enough that you can put it in your back pocket, and read each thought as a devotional, if that is what you are after.Secondly, I did not really think that the writing spoke to my heart at all. There was nothing quotable or novel about what was said. There was nothing that I could take out of it to stimulate my thinking on how to teach others in a bible study or sermon. It was a very dull text.Finally, it had a strong emphasis on Mary the mother of Jesus, and pondered her role in passion in several spots. In retrospect, this certainly should have been expected from a Catholic writer. However, on a book highly recommended about the passion of Christ I did not expect it.If you are thinking about purchasing books on the Seven Last Words, there are several out there that are better.Also...the cover advertised w/ the purchase is not the cover I receieved. A book should not be judged by its cover, but in this case it was also a disappointment"},{"Title":"Tender Taming (Candlelight Ecstasy, No. 125)","review":"A fine beginning! It was pitch-dark, raining snakes and alligators, and she was totally lost - stumbling blindly through the treacherous Everglades!PR Director Whitney Latham had been confident she could pave the way for a modern housing development on the disputed Seminole land, convinced that even J.E. Stewart, the Indians' shrewd representative could be \\"handled\\". She hadn't a doubt until she found herself facedown in the Florida swamp....until the formidable White Eagle appeared out of nowhere to sweep her into his arms, carry her to his isolated cabin, and dare her to enter a realm of savage beauty where love was still a passionate, untamed memory."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"Finally, a new book of crochet designs for little ones that uses yarns other than pastel acrylics in baby/sport weight! This book contains patterns for babies to 3-4 yrs that are updated and refreshing in a world where knitting patterns abound and crochet sometimes seems relegated to 20+ years back despite the fact that this craft is alive and well. The directions are clear and concise and there are also patterns for toys, a beautiful christening blanket, and a charming nursery pillow. If you are looking for a new take on crochet for kids, this one won't let you down."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"I just received this pattern book, and I love it! I have been an avid crocheter for over 25 years and have seen lots of books. This one is well worth the price.Multiple pictures of each item helps you get a better idea of the entire project before you begin. I like that they show the project being worn by a cute kid as well as on its own. The materials list, patterns, and graphs are well written. Each pattern includes the stitches shown in symbols, a great way to see what are you going to do before you start work.The only negative (my usual pet peeve) is that they tell you exactly what yarn they used in the project, not a general description what type/weight yarn would work. I would prefer pattern books to first list the weight and type of yarn plus what was used in the picture. I want all the information in case the yarn that was picked doesn't come in a color I'd want to use.All in all, a great book and recommended.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"The designs in this book use many new and wonderful specility yarns which bring an updated look to the traditional outfits. It was great to see cute boys clothes as well as girls clothes. The instructions include the pattern outline and dimensions which I find extremely helpful - these are not usually included in patterns from the US.The only draw back on this book is that it calls for specific yarns by specific manufactures (which are not all available in the US). It does not give equivalent yarn weights, such as sport, worsted, baby, etc. to substitute. You can figure it out with a little math work - it does give stitch gauges.The patterns are clearly written and easy to follow. The photography is wonderful. I recommend this book as inspirational and a must for a pattern library to make clothes for kids."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"Wonderful children's clothes--if only there were more and for slightly older children...I have made 4 items (including the adorable cover dress), and I couldn't be more pleased with them. The patterns are easy to follow and they work up \\"professionally.\\" My grandchildren love the clothing, and much of it can be made with Luster Sheen, an easy care yarn, as well as with cotton. My next project is the little bear on the cover as my granddaughter wants it to \\"go with\\" her dress."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"The book is beautiful, the patterns are great, but...this is a British book. And it was written with only British yarn recommendations. So be prepared to do a little work to substitute the yarns available here with the appropriate ones for each pattern. Other than that, I love it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"This book is another of my favorite books for baby and toddler clothing. I have made the stuffed zebra (in sky blue and white stripes for something a little out of the ordinary) and the girl's floral sweater (in tan with peach flowers).This is one of my favorite books for finding great baby items. I've made many for other people's children, and I am now thrilled to make these patterns up for my 4-month old daughter.A comment to the reviewer who feared placing buttons on baby clothes ... they are everywhere. Carters, Baby Gap, Gerber, and so on ... you'll see buttons on baby clothes of all brands. It is the parents' responsibility to make sure that the buttons are secured safely and that the child cannot rip them off."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"This is a very nice book, with patterns that range from easy, for the beginning crocheter, to the more complicated work. As well as the written instructions there are diagrams for the various stitches used, making this book a bit of a primer for those who might wish to learn to read diagrams.The photography is beautiful - lots of cute babies and the designs are first class. The book has stitch instructions and lots of useful tips for the less experienced crocheter. I particularly liked the christening shawl and am now waiting for anyone of my acquaintance to produce a baby so as to give me a reason for making that one!A lovely book for any doting granny."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"Really am excited about patterns in this book.

It is always hard to get good patterns for jackets for newborns and I love the lacy jacket on page 24. I have crocheted that pattern dozens of time and everyone always admires it. It's quick and easy and can be completed in a weekend. My niece has also loved the kangaroo jumper with the rabbit pouch and asked for another pinafore dress to be made for her when she out grew the first one.This one of my favourite and most used crochet books. The patterns are easy to follow even for a beginner. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"I really love the patterns in this book - they are modern and adorable. Which is a nice change from so many of the crochet books that show layette sets made with pastel acrylic yarn. However, when I read other reviews complaining about the lack of details of the yarn used I didn't think it was a big deal, I thought I could just search the internet and figure it out. It is not that easy - I had a really hard time finding a comparable yarn to Twilleys Lyscordet yarn. It would have been so much easier if yarn weights/size were included, instead of just saying, \\"use comparable yarn\\". Other than that I am very happy with the book."},{"Title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"I'm a beginning crocheter when it comes to clothes and I don't have kids. I bought this book to create some things for my niece (baby due in January). However, every pattern has buttons, something I'm told can be dangerous for infants and toddlers.

BORING"},{"Title":"Money Pitcher: Chief Bender And the Tragedy of Indian Assimilation","review":"Charles Albert Bender, beter known as \\"Chief\\" Bender, was a premier pitcher for the Philadelphia A's in the early 1900s. Possessing a fine fastball, curve, plenty of control, concentration and observation, he won 212 games in the major leagues and earned a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The other half of the story is that he was born on a reservation in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, to a white father and half-Anishinaabe (Chippewa) mother. They later moved to the White Earth Indian reservation in northeast Minnesota, until Charles was sent off to the East to go to school. At this time, the U.S. government's program of assimilation of Native American children into the white world was in full swing, and set off Bender's nearly life-long struggle of an Indian living, working and trying to succeed in a white world. A hundred years ago, those who \\"looked different\\" - were from a different ethnic origin - were subjected to racism, slights and insults as a matter of course in everyday life. But Bender succeeded in the white world, though at a terrible price to his health. The author of this book, William Kashatus, has done an excellent job in researching the life of Charles Bender; there are places where the information is sketchy, but due only to a lack of data, such as Bender's early life. The one area that the author has left me in doubt is in his claim that the 1914 World Series may have been \\"thrown\\" by some members of the A's, among them Bender. His case did not convince me sufficiently that this happened; the information semmed mostly circumstantial and even that doesn't jibe with Bender's nature. In reading this book, one may get a feel of what the times were like then, in America, for the American Indian being assimilated in society and for the heroic Bender, who endured so much during his time and performed with grace, skill and determination to be known for talents as a pitcher, not just as a Native American trying to get along in white American society."},{"Title":"Growing Up Male: The Psychology of Masculinity","review":"This is a book well worth the read. What I liked most about it was that the author refrained from jargon. The information is timely, as useful now as it will be twenty years from now. I suspect parents would find a wealth of background material they can use in helping their children grow into well-adjusted adults. And yes, parents! We have a daughter: no son(s). The information &quot;fits&quot; girls as well as boys. But to be honest, I learned a hell of a lot about myself. (I wish I had read it when I was a teenager!!!!!!!! No kidding.)"},{"Title":"Growing Up Male: The Psychology of Masculinity","review":"What a sensible book. This book tackles a difficult subject and ends up scoring points all over the place. My wife and I were looking for some answers and we were lucky someone recommended it to us. My wife works with troubled youngsters and wonders how she managed before she read it. Schoenberg's insights are a great assist if you've got boys around the house. Not to mention that both my wife and I now understand ME better.In this age of overblown rhetoric, it's great to stumble on a book that states the case impassionately."},{"Title":"Home How-To: Easy-To-Follow Step-By-Step Instructions with More Than 3,000 Color Illustrations and Photographs (Popular Mechanics)","review":"This is the only home repair book I've seen that doesn't treat the reader like an idiot.

Studying both violent and nonviolent political crime including corruption, illegal domestic surveillance, human rights violation, bribery and more, The Dynamics Of Political Crime is an involved and informative account which is especially recommended for Criminology and Political Science reference collections and supplemental reading lists."},{"Title":"Dynamics Of Political Crime","review":"I found Jeffrey's Ian Ross' book very useful for my own research dealing with criminal regimes in Latin America, notably the Fujimori dictatorship of Peru, which I examined in a recent work. I use Ross' book when dealing with state crime in my criminology classes. I also regularly recommend the work to the gradute students from International Development Studies whom I supervise on state crime in developing societies. While Ross' book is ethnocentric his assumptions can easily be modified to analyze political crime beyond the so-called First World. I would therefore strongly disagree with the claim by a previous reviewer that the book is at best useful at the high school level. My major criticism would be that the author does not sufficiently distinguish between administrative and political corruption."},{"Title":"Dynamics Of Political Crime","review":"I had to read this book for a graduate level course and was quite disappointed. I felt that the book was quite elementary and really should not be used at the college level at all. It is very superficial, lacking the analysis needed at higher levels. Additionally, the book is only about 200 pages yet covers a wide variety of issues in political crime, resulting in a vague descriptions and explanations. The book is also ethnocentric. Ross seems to favor Western cultures making false claims such as \\"It is clear that although human rights violations are rare occurrences in the Anglo American democracies, they take place at alarming rates throughout the world in countries that have totalitarian or authoritarian regimes,\\" (Ross 122). I guess he forgot about the treatment of various minority groups in the U.S. Overall, the book is probably good for the high school level or as a supplement to other books at a college level, but this book should not be that primary text for any college student to receive their information in political crime.The paperback copy of this book is only about $15, so don't pay big money for the hard cover!!!"},{"Title":"Osiris The Egyptian Religion of Resurrection 2 Volumes in One","review":"An excellent one volume set of the 2 volume work by E.

Excellent scholarship concerning Egyptian religion of Osiris, the god of the resurrection."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Clearly, my opinion is in the minority, but I didn't care much for this book. I liked The Thief, although I wasn't crazy about the plot twist at the end. However, I found this sequel to be a complete disappointment.I hated the switch from first person to third person, since Gen's wiseacre voice was one of the things I enjoyed in The Thief. I liked the lighter, funnier tone of the first book.I found the relationships to be unbelievable in the extreme, particularly between Gen and the Queen. I won't give away any plot points, but given what happens in the beginning, I found the end of the book particularly hard to swallow. And while I really like characters who are neither completely good nor evil, I found these characters a bit schizophrenic -- acting one way at one moment, then pulling a complete character switch at the next.Finally, I find the author's writing style hard to read and sometimes hard to follow. She has a habit of \\"telling not showing\\" -- that is, describing what the characters are talking about rather than showing the actual conversation. For me, that's a more boring style of writing. It reminds me of a short story rather than a novel.Just my opinion, since other readers apparently loved this book."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I'm sad to say this novel is nothing like book one. I'm only halfway done and I can't drag myself through another page. The plot is so slow with endless recapping of political strategy. Where is the adventure?

Maybe the rest of the series is better, but this one didn't captivate me in the least."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Certainly written well above the 10+ age recommended. Very intricate plot. Well written and very enjoyable. Less humor than \\"The Thief\\" but still as good to read."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I really did. I loved the first one, you know. I thought Gen was hilarious and really someone I'd like to have around with - even if he was annoying.The Queen of Attolia started out really good. I really was not expecting anything like that to happen. It was very surprising and I almost thought it was a dream. Where the first book had twists that had me smiling and gaping, this one had few. It was just ok. Eugenides had grown and changed so much that the only reason he is likable is because everyone else tells you and reminds you. Almost none of his original charm is there. He's quiet and brooding. Granted, he has reason to - but that doesn't mean I have to like it.And just when I thought the action would pick up and that there would be another twist absolutely nothing happens. It just keeps going until the end. I don't want to post spoilers so I can't elaborate, but I really thought that more was going to happen. The story just kind of ended in a ho-hum manner.A great portion of the book is devoted to talking about war and war strategy and where one army is and what this minister or Baron is thinking and it all became quite tiring after a while.Like I said, I really wanted to like this book and had high expectations. Looking back this isn't the first time that I've disliked a four star book and something tells me that it won't be my last."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I enjoyed the Thief but got halfway through Queen of Attolia and just couldn't take it anymore.

He is caught up in the queens battle to distroy one another. I loved this book's charectors and how they seemed so real. I read it more like a movie than a book. I didn't like the ending though, because Eddis was my favorite charector and she should have gotten the thief. I hope in the next book, {cross my fingers that there will be one} Eddis will get back her thief."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"It was a great book! You begin to grow to like Eugenides even more and you get to also know Eddis as well as other characters. The book's political strategy also lets you think and broadens your thoughts. The only fault in the book, i think, is when Eugenides marries Attolia, but he couldn't stay a boy forever.

I enjoyed the \\"Thief\\", but as I read this I kept thinking the book would pick up. It just didn't. I liked Gen, enjoyed a few other characters, but the story line was painful. One country was fighting against another country, then they would change sides, you needed a score card to keep up. I normally keep books I enjoy and reread them at a later date, but books one & two went immediately to Goodwill. I couldn't have disliked this book anymore.

The Queen of Attolia went in a completely different dirction, both stylistically and in the plot. This book was more political than character-based and if I didn't already know the characters from The Thief, it would have been completely forgettable. To be frank, it kind of ruined The Thief a little bit just because the events afterwards are so dreary and Gen's life is so crappy and dark."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The age difference between Eugenides and Attolia reminds me of Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Faulauu.

It ended up being WAY BETTER than I expected when i began reading. The beginning was sort of bland and formulaic but about a third of the way in, things began to get interesting, and the last third was brilliant. Very fully-fleshed, interesting, unique characters. Extremely complex political intrigues and wars and treaties and strategy. My only real complaint was that this book did not contain a map. I found myself often flipping to the beginning in search of the non-existent map. Normally I could care less about such things, but the political and geographical realms were so intricate, I'd have appreciated a visual aid.

Eugenides, formerly Gen of his earlier exploits, has stolen into the Queen of Attolia's palace walls and is caught within it's depths. He is caught and thrown into the deepest, darkest dungeon, where the Queen comes to interrogate and question him. Before she leaves she rewards Eugenides with the traditional punishment for thieves and cuts off his right hand before she sends him back to Eddis in feverish pain. The Queen of Eddis fears for his life and has her best attendants working on him. After the initial fever passes the depression sets in, rendering Eugenides even more useless than he would have been without his hand. The whole point in cutting off his hand would be that he could no longer steal anything, a thief needs all of their limbs to be successful, but the damage is done and it is a greater blow to his ego and mind than anything else. Eugenides suffers from frequent nightmares, partly induced by a drug called lethium (distilled from poppies) which he takes to help him sleep.. And then he begins to develop a dependence on the lethium as well.With all that is going on with Eugenides there is still a lot going on outside of the Eddisian kingdom. War is brewing on all sides, Sounis is encroaching and Attolia, with the aided funds of the Medean Empire, is starting to build up an arsenal as well as an army. Nahuseresh, an ambassador from Medea, is quite clever in his advice to the Attolian Queen (Irene), who takes it with a grain of suspicion. It becomes obvious that Eddis has to do something to defend itself, or perish forever, and the Queen of Eddis (Helen) comes up with a plan that will use Eugenides to his fullest ability. .. After all, just because Eugenides lost his hand doesn't mean his mind is damaged (relatively speaking), and his wits are really all he needs to be a successful thief.Turner has outdone herself with this addition to her already fascinating universe. The atmospheres are so lush and realistic, the dynamics between all the parties are thrilling and gripping. The politics are just unsettling enough that you actually feel as if you are a member of each court and your very peace is at stake... and then there are the characters to talk about. Attolia is very fierce, very commanding, but underneath it all she is a scared little girl trying to eke out a living in a world filled with domineering men who would overthrow her in a heartbeat. She has to be subtle in order to survive, and she plays everyone like a master conductor in an orchestra. Eddis is a more sympathetic queen, one whose soft side gets frequently shown what with all of the intimate moments spent between her and Eugenides, a man whom she has been friends with since childhood. However, Eddis' craftiness and ability to adapt is what keeps her protected in what could be a terrible onslaught.And the there is Gen, Eugenides, the Queen's thief. Eugenides is the character that I wish I would have created were I to write a book. In fact, were I to write a book I wished it could have been the first book in this series. \\"The Thief\\" opened my eyes as to how fantasy should be written just when I was starting to lose faith in the genre. And Eugenides just gets better with time and age. Where \\"The Thief\\" left off as far as character development was nothing short of brilliance. Eugenides was one of the most well rounded characters I have ever read about in all literature, not just the fantasy genre (though for fantasy you could equate him to Steerpike of \\"Gormenghast\\" or Taran of \\"Prydain\\"). He had run all of the gambits of human emotions and encountered his own gods when he needed them. As Attolia says in the end of the book \\"rare the man whose gods answer him\\". This is the best way to describe Eugenides, rare. But whatever happened to him in \\"The Thief\\" was nothing compared to the depths of emotion he encounters in this book. Eugenides goes from being well rounded to being utterly sympathetic with one fell stroke of, well, a knife as it cuts off his hand. It's as if in the first book he's leaping off the page at you whereas in this book you can reach through the pages and caress him as he is sleeping in a lethium induced haze. Eugenides has become the quintessential hero, and the greatest thing about him is that he is profoundly, utterly flawed. He knows he is starting to depend on lethium, and yet he keeps taking it, even making a joke that he should start drinking because it makes a pleasant change at one point. He's a liar, he's a cheat, and yet we love him because he is human to us, and that is precisely what makes Turner's world and characters so real, is how human they all can be, how weak and how strong, and it is this duality that lends credibility to all fiction.As a child's book this is a stretch. Oh sure, I would have read it in my youth, but I am a fan of dark fantasy (as evidenced by my earlier references to \\"Gormenghast\\" and \\"Prydain\\"). However, this book will reach out to kids looking for something thrilling and different, and to be quite honest all of the thematic elements that are not necessarily kid appropriate are buried between the lines. I don't think a child will realize the political intrigue that is occurring here, or the addiction that Eugenides is nursing. It is one of those cases where it might blow completely over a child's head... however, a smart child who likes to read will probably devour these, and be able to pick up all of the nuances of Turner's storytelling. Still, overall, a fantastic add to the Attolian/Eddisian world. I doff my cap to Turner once again and eagerly await reading the next book in the series, which I have an advanced reader copy of thanks to work (yay!). For those of you looking for a tremendous series you should read Turner's work. This book may stand out without the strength of the first, but the first will make Eugenides seem all the more fleshed out, so yeah, I recommend starting with \\"The Thief\\" first. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"What a glorious reread this one for me. I feel like I was reminded what a very good story is like and am amazed to still find it as engaging as I read before. But now, there's a plus, you HAVE to read The Thief first to get the true feeling of this book. I hadn't read that one when I read Attolia the first time and there had been times I felt a bit lost on the comments and thoughts that specially involved Eugenides, Eddis and Attolia. Now that I have, the experience is enriched and I fall in love again with The Queen of Attolia, deeply. It is a total satisfaction to understand the love story behind the big picture.I really enjoyed the interaction between the characters and between character and gods. You could get the message without feeling being preached. The main characters fought, lost and won with you, gave you the anguish, irony, love and joy to your heart. While the politics and war proceedings colored the story more than The Thief's, they didn't bog me down. They even gave you a background that helped you understand the personality of each character. Furthermore, there was a conversation between Eugenides and a goddess which held a truth that we all need to know, if you belief in God or gods, without being too religious about it.Some may say that the story is for much older kids, but I think everybody who enjoys The Thief, can read this one right away. All I can say is this book is as good as The Thief, maybe with a love story, but I say, it's as good! You can not read only one of them!So, reaching the end, I think there is a premise for a third book. I hope it will come out soon because I do care what would happen to the characters in The Thief and Attolia next and their offspring."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"In the annals of Young Adult literature there are few awards greater than the Newbery Award. So what can be better than a Newbery winner? How about it's sequel! In \\"The Queen of Attolia\\" Megan Turner continues the characters first seen in the Newbery winner \\"The Thief.\\" A sequel? Well not really. Same characters different story. There is no requirement to read \\"The Thief\\" before reading Queen of Attolia, although it would be your loss if you didn't read it sometime, Newbery winners are winners for a reason after all.This is one really great story. It is a real shame that Thief won the Newbery. Why? Because now it is impossible for Queen to win. It just doesn't happen, new story or not. The reason I say it's a shame it because Queen is actually better than Thief!Talk about romance! What better than a love struck thief, a cold hearted queen, lose of a hand, kidnapping, blackmail, goddesses, foreign intrigue and even a little love. This is really great stuff! What fun to read! I have read it so many times I had to buy a hardback copy for my library.All I can say after this is I WANT MORE!Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"After years of waiting, Ms. Turner has finally written a sequel to The Thief! You thought Gen was finished with his sneaking around? Think again! This time he's been spying on the Queen of Attolia (you remember how pleasant she was in the first book?) and he's caught in the act. When the unthinkable happens, Gen must learn to draw on new reserves of courage and strength...and he rises admirably to the challenge.Ms. Turner develops her wonderful characters even more, and elaborates on things from the first book. Gen is delightful as always, a sweet and tragic character as well as a smart-alecky dare-devil.I highly recommend this book, and its prequel (The Thief - a Newbery book). I am looking forward to the promised sequel."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"If what you loved about the Thief was that endearing, mouthy brat who couldn't hold his tongue to save his life, you may not like this book; he's growing up. He's not all fun and games anymore. He sometimes thinks before he speaks, and he's no longer channeling John Wayne when injured. I disagree with the reviewer who said he's bitter, but he certainly does react more normally to injury and to quality-of-life issues than he did in the first book.I liked the first book, but this one is a much more complex and interesting read. Yeah, there's politics, and I usually don't care at all for the machinations of kings and countries. I'm more interested in character-driven stories. The politics here, however, are largely character-driven, and they don't get in the way of the story. They further it, in a very human and sometimes amusing way.The Thief and the Queen are interesting, complex humans. For me, the end was evident in the beginning, and I admire the way Turner got us there. Not an easy transition, but she navigated it with skill and panache. The brat from the first book would have been entirely unconvincing here, but I'm looking forward to the third book to see how this fascinating man accommodates himself to the next stage in his life. I suspect his adaptation will be as quirky and entertaining as he is."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I typically give books at least fifty pages to intrigue me. Even then, it's very rare that I stop reading - off the top of my head, I can think of only two books that I have ever just stopped reading and given up on. The Queen of Attolia will be added to the list.I'd just finished The Thief, which didn't begin to really get me excited till 150 pages into it, then I enjoyed the rest. So I gave The Queen of Attolia a little over two hundred pages before I gave it up.The Queen of Attolia opened up into an action scene, which I was pleased to see. There is a bit more excitement, then the war starts. And that is more or less all that you hear about for the next 150 pages or so. You get any number of brief scenes that really, show you almost nothing: there isn't insight into the character, there's only painfully slow progression into the plot. I was very disappointed, especially (***MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!***) when Gen comes for the magus - I was excited thinking that things would really pick up, but no, even that turns out to be very ho-hum, and the magus is promptly shipped off to a summer home, thus taking him out of play.I skimmed a bit through the rest of the book and didn't find anything that piqued my interest enough to go back and pick up where I left off. I'm glad that other people have enjoyed it so much, but I personally found the pacing of the story to be snail-like at best, the story-telling flat and empty, and only the few interesting scenes I read during those 200+ pages made it earn the two-star rating instead of a single star. Clearly, the author has the ability to write some really exciting and intriguing plotlines with fantastic twists, but unfortunately her books seem to turn into repetitious, sluggish tales with just a few teasing samples of her potential thrown in."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"When reading the first book by Ms. Turner, I had no idea what to expect from the second - would it get better? would it be not as good or intriguing? I was completely satisfied on both counts! Another wonderful account of Eugenides, compassion without feeling sorry for oneself and pressing on under almost impossible odds. The world parallels ours, but is fascinatingly different; espionage, battles, friendship, everything for a great read!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Although I liked \\"The Thief\\", and was interested in reading its sequel \\"The Queen of Attolia\\", I started reading the book mostly because I didn't have anything better to do and wanted to kill some time. Little did I expect to be so instantly and thoroughly addicted, I could barely put the book down and lost several hours of sleep because of it (which I don't regret at all!).\\"The Queen of Attolia\\" is very different book than the first, much darker and complex, but also incrediby addictive. Since it's written in third person, I really missed seeing things from Eugenides' point of view at first, but very soon I came to appreciate the change in storytelling, as it gives you the opportunity to really \\"see\\" the characters with your own eyes.The book starts with our lovable protagonist, Eugenides, sneaking once again into Attolia's palace to steal, only this time, things don't go as planned and he is captured and severely punished by the ruthless queen Attolia. I won't go into details, but what happened afterwards took me completely off guard and actually hoped it was some kind of dream sequence. The following chapters were very hard to read, as I really love Eugenides and felt awful seeing him suffering so much. He seemed like a completely different person at times (which was understandable) but I missed his good humor and daring escapades during a good part of the book. Once he recovers, however, the book goes from merely \\"good\\" to \\"simply awesome\\" in my estimation. I am glad I didn't read any spoilers, because this book is a journey you have to discover by yourself, and I felt immensely satisfied at the end.There are a lot of characters (besides Eugenides) that I really like, but my favorite of them is by far queen Attolia. She seemed so cold and ruthless at first, and it is a testament to the author's talent that she was able to make the reader sympathize and understand the hard life she had. I really loved the ending, it was surprisingly sweet and romantic, it actually made me smile. I was glad seeing the Gen finally being happy after everything he went through.In short, this book is not only addictive, but it stays with you long after you finish reading it. I thought about it almost nonstop for days, wondering what would happen in the next chapter and worrying about the fate of Eugenides and queen Attolia. Great plot, characters, plot twists and a satisfying conclusion makes this book a must-read sequel. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I'm 25 and I started reading the first book in this series (The Thief) and after that, I didn't put them down until I had finished the last one (Conspiracy of Kings). My favorite book in the series is the King of Attolia, but this one is a close second. I have to say that Conspiracy of Kings is good too, only it focuses less on Eugenides, which is why I think it lacks a little luster for me. Still, it has all the things I love about Megan's books. Megan Whalen Turner is an excellent writer, with plots that simply suprise you. I reread the books a few months after the initial read and had many ah hah moments, where I saw the author hinting at what was to come. I'd completely missed them the first time through. You can't predict these books and that is what I love about them. Pick up The Thief first, if you don't read that you'll be lost, I promise. But it will be worth your effort! Love these books! Kudos to Megan, who can actually write a series without the reader wishing for 'the end!' I have high hopes for her next books. Conspiracy of Kings came out a while ago, and I'm still waiting anxiously!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"This book can be described as worth wild and simply enticing. When I first pick up the book I wasn't really all that interested in it do to the fact that I had not liked The Thief as much as I had hoped, but because of a persistent friend, I ended up reading The Queen of Attolia and was thrilled with it. I will continue to look for the fifth book until it arrives. Chow"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The characters are engaging and believable, a good mix of heroic and personal, but certainly include the character flaws of any truly interesting adventure characters.The story was exciting and well written, with a number of interesting plot twists that really were a surprise."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"This along with the rest of the series is one of the best books I have ever read. I found the first title \\"The Thief\\" slow, but this and the rest are full of action, twists, intrigue and complete unpredictability on many levels."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The Queen of Attolia is a wonderfully interesting book. Its characters are easy to love (or hate). The detailed description is impressive, and brings you right into the story. The plot in itself is incredible; and even though the main character literally wallows in self pity for several chapters, it never becomes boring. It does become a tad depressing between the main character's cut-off hand and the war his country is fighting, but is always revived by pieces of humor and the good-nature of its characters. If I were to judge, I would have to say that this author's greatest strength is in her endings. They are very surprising but not unrealistic, and when you think about it, you can tell that the author was hinting at the end the whole time.This book would be best for upper middle-school aged kids. Slight language, romance, and general fantasy nonsense is involved, but not enough for over-concerned parents to worry about."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"A great series overall. Wonderful characters and a nice twisting plot that takes the reader on a roller coaster of a ride with a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Eugenides returns to Attolia to continue to harass the queen, yet finds somehow he has been betrayed. He ends up caught and given the punishment of a thief- the loss of his right hand. As war looms on the horizon, Eugenides plays his hand at resuming his role as a thief. (sorry- I couldn't resist the pun)Even though it was darker than the first book, Eugenides proves time and time again, even without his hand, he is still the best thief around. The story changes from the first- which is more of an adventure, to more of a political book focusing around the courts and their power struggles."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I liked this book better than the first one. The story was more complex and I was able to get a better idea of the world. I do wish that the book came with a map. Gen was definitely more likable in this book and was a lot more mature. Attolia was an intriguing and complex character and I enjoyed reading about her. This book had a lot political intrigue which I really liked. I could see some parts coming but there were still a lot of surprises in the story. I am going to go on and read the next book to see how the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Perhaps because I found The Thief so fun and heartfelt, and was enthralled by numerous others' lavish praises on the sequels, that I had extremely high expectations for THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA. It pains me to say that I didn't like THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA as much as I did The Thief, but it's still a good read in fantasy literature that will appeal across age ranges.THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA is altogether different from The Thief. It's told in third-person instead of first. Eugenides seems older; the events and the premise of this book are a lot darker, dipping into the disturbing at times. THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA focuses a lot on the political tensions between the kingdoms, to the point where long sections of the book are dedicated entirely to dry accounts of political and military events. While I go gaga for books that are smart, yet interesting to read, I couldn't help but feel that all that information could have been presented to readers in a more engaging way.Maybe this decision to report war news in such a dry way was a deliberate decision on Turner's part. In any case, it also affected by connections I had with the characters. Which is to say, I felt that the characters saw me, but instead of coming over to chat, decided to head to another room on the other side of the soundproof glass, where they continued to be aloof and secretive and unfriendly. Not quite how I wish to interact with characters.As for the romance...eh. Well. It's not as if there weren't hints as to what would happen, and the turning point was kind of cute in a romantic-movie-swoon kind of way, but the characters' aloofness throughout the story up to that point took away from the impact of that scene, at least for me. I hope they'll be good for one another, even though I can't quite see how that will happen from the rest of the book, but hey, it would go beyond my realm as reviewer to question the decisions of the characters and author, so I'll just leave them to do their thing.THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA didn't sweep me off my feet as The Thief did, but perhaps I was in the wrong mindset when I read this book (ten years too late, perhaps?). I'll still continue with the series, though, since it's gotten so many rave reviews from every reviewer I respect. Perhaps, however, by toning down my expectations, I will get more out of my reading experiences."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"&quot;The Thief&quot; was notable for the wry humor of its narrator, Gen, who revealed so much about himself while still keeping his story's twist ending in store for the reader. In &quot;The Queen of Attolia,&quot; Gen (who prefers to be addressed by his full name, Eugenides, as befits his position as Queen's Thief of Eddis) finds his humor under severe strain as the uneasy political balance between the three countries of Sounis, Eddis, and Attolia finally explodes under the pressure of the encroaching Mede Empire. An ill-fated foray into Attolia's palace loses Eugenides his hand and Eddis' reprisal-war-seems to be the response the Mede Ambassador and his Emperor have been waiting for. Three small countries will either ally or fall, and at the moment none of them are at all concerned with alliance. &quot;What can a one-handed man steal?&quot; If he's very, very clever, he just might be able to steal peace.It has to be hard, being the sequel to a Newberry Award-winning book, but &quot;The Queen of Attolia&quot; manages admirably, in part by being different from its predecessor without losing the familiar context of characters and setting. A third-person narrative allows the reader to view the situation from the perspectives of various characters-mostly Eugenides and the Queen of Attolia-but also distances the characters; fortunately, Megan Whalen Turner maintains such detail in her descriptions that many third-person passages feel like first-person narratives. There are changes to deal with in familiar characters as well. The war tests everyone, Eugenides the most: formerly quick-tongued and irrepressible, he responds to his loss by withdrawing into himself, often bitter at what he sees as his failure and the gods that have abandoned him; you miss the adolescent Gen of &quot;The Thief.&quot; The magus of Sounis betrays one alliance in hopes of salvaging another. Even the queen of Eddis, as beloved as she is unbeautiful, is not even sure whether or not her actions are as honorable as she first thought them. It's a sure sign that the author is doing a good job when you hurt in sympathy with the characters! But all is not lost: while there's much to endure before peaces comes to Eddis and Eugenides both, there is also a very good story. Turner keeps the tension high and never lets the political intrigue outweigh the interactions between the characters, and there's even a tale of the old gods which serves as a kind of mirror to the action in the latter part of the story. (Also a twist halfway through which changes everything you thought about Eugenides' motives; it works, too.) All in all, like &quot;The Thief,&quot; &quot;The Queen of Attolia&quot; is one very good story of a convincing place that never was and people who, fictional or not, truly matter."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"&quot;The Queen of Attolia&quot; is a great book. It is true, however that this story is slightly darker/less pleasant than &quot;The Thief,&quot; but it is still one of the better books that I have ever read. I find it difficult to write a review on &quot;The Queen of Attolia&quot; because it has so many little twits and such a clever plot that if I am not careful I'll give the story away! However, I strongly urge you to read &quot;The Thief&quot; (the first book in this two-book sequel) before you read this story or else &quot;The Thief's&quot; plot will be totally given away - and after all, the plot IS the story. And, if you liked &quot;The Thief&quot; you will not be let down by this book.&quot;The Queen of Attolia&quot; continues the drama of Eugenides - Gen - as he steals one thing after another, engages in a war, and makes his usual snide remarks and complaints, which somehow make you like him more than ever. Eugenides struggles with his emotions, fear, love, hate, pain; and he is faced with many decisions and dangers, and involves himself in risky plans and strategies during a war between the countries of Sounis, Eddis, the Mede, and Attolia that keep you gripping the book and wondering what will happen next. A spellbinding tale that has charm, adventure, action, a good plot, and (don't let this put you off!) a little bit of love. Do read this sequel, it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Don't read the editorial review of this book at the top of the page! It contains major spoilers.You definitely need to read &quot;The Thief&quot; before you dive into this book, or it won't make much sense.This book is darker and more mature than its predecessor. It's still categorized as a young adult novel, but if you had a hard time handling some of the situations or vocabulary in &quot;The Thief&quot;, you might want to let this one sit on your shelf for a year or two.Ms. Turner does an excellent job of fleshing out the characters and the political situations she introduced in the first book. Although it has a satisfying conclusion, things are definitely left open for a third book, which I will certainly be waiting in line to buy."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I read this book (and its prequel, The Thief) to my children as bedtime stories. They are a highly critical audience, but found this book both exciting and intellectually interesting. It is exquisitely well-written. Ms. Turner never makes a false step with her characterizations, or with the plot, and her use of language is far above the quality of that usually found in children's literature. We found ourselves discussing the book during the day, thinking about the motives of one character or another, and picking apart the politics of the four kingdoms involved in her story. I highly recommend this as a book to read to children, as it provides a perfect vehicle for teaching them how to understand literature, not to mention a little psychology! My kids were crestfallen the day we finished the book, and we all hope Ms. Turner will write another!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Though sequel to the best book in the world, The Thief, this book has a much different tone. War, rule, treachery, diplomacy, despair, and hope.Two kingdoms, Sounis and Attolia, stand on the sides of the mountain kingdom of Eddis. Across the sea lie the ambitious Medes, wanting to end up with those three kingdoms with as little effort as possible.Sounis no longer has a hold over Eddis (read 'The Thief') to entice the queen to marry him, and the king is anxious to control her kingdom by other means if necessary. Attolia is a tiger ready to pounce, waiting for her chance.All events are set in motion when Eddis sends her Thief, Eugenides, to spy on Attolia in her own capital. One time too many, and Attolia finally gets her hands on the thief who has eluded her grasp so many times before. She doesn't hang him, but sends him back to Eddis maimed for life.A one-handed thief isn't use to anyone; that is the way Eugenides feels. Locking himself in his room, he shuns the world around him and ignores the clues to the trouble his kingdom faces that would eventually pull him out of his stupor:Eddis is furious at what Attolia has done to her cousin, and as retaliation the two kingdoms go to war. Sounis seizes his chance and allies himself with Attolia, Attolia brings in the aid of the Mede and their crafty (and charming) ambassador, and Eddis's only hope lies in the Thief.Quote: \\"Steal peace, Eugenides. Steal me some time.\\"Eugenides is growing from a boy to a man, but his wit still remains. The twists and turns and smooth curves will delight you, and you will cry and laugh with the clever Thief.The political intrigue will keep you on your toes, the characters will engross you: it will be hard to put the book down, and once you do you are anxious to pick it back up.A delightful story in whole, but even once you know the ending you will be able to read the book again (and again) for the beauty of each individual part."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I really liked \\"The Thief,\\" but was totally unprepared for the depth, cleverness and utterly unsentimental romance of this book. I read it in one night, and through the last half had to keep stopping to yell out \\"This is SUCH a GREAT book!\\" (I couldn't help myself!). The best description I can give of it is that it's somewhat like Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy (because of its tone and the excellence of its characterizations) and somewhat like Mary Renault's Alexander books (particularly \\"The Persian Boy,\\" because of its vivid depictions of both beauty and savagery) -- but it's also unlike anything I've ever read. At heart it's a great romance, one that's not even remotely sappy or flowery, but something hard-won through pain and loss, and saved through one character's capacity for forgiveness and hope. It really isn't a kids' book (well, not suitable for most of the kids I know), being much too subtle and complex, and there are very oblique/implied sexual situations (which would go over most kids' heads anyway). It's a terrific story, totally unexpected, and I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"At first I thought Eugenides's charm would be lost in this sequel because the narrator's voice switches from first to third person, but after a while, I found that fortunately this is not true. Eugenides's smart remarks are still there, and the author retains her humor throughout the book. (The voice change, by the way, is necessary because this time there are actually two main leads--one of whom is supposed to be feelingless--in the book.)Like has been said, this is a whole different story from The Thief. There are, however, references to the first book which can be ignored, I guess.Although this is an awesome book, it is not without faults. First, I find it somewhat unsatisfying that characters are left disappearing throughout the story. This is probably because the focus of the book really is the relationship between Eugenides and Attolia. Events then happen that involve certain people we don't really care about. Next, the explanations/facts in this book don't quite match with the first book's. In the first book, for example, it is pretty clear Eugenides is not interested in Attolia romantically, while in this book he claims to have been in love with her since circa a decade ago. In addition, in the first book Attolia doesn't seem to know Eugenides and Eddis too well while this book says that in fact she and Eddis had been close.But again, this is still an awesome book that I couldn't put down. I'm looking forward for the author's next book. :D"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"One of the nice things about being a teacher is that I get to read many of the &quot;young adult&quot; books most grown-ups miss.

The first book in the series, The Thief, was entertaining and adventuresome. I must warn you (and this is not a spoiler -- the warning is on the back of the paperback book, and on the flap of the dustjacket of the hardback) that the boy thief Gen gets his hand cut off right at the beginning of the book. I read the review and didn't believe it -- surely something would intervene. But nothing intervened, and we are made to read through Gen's terror, pain, misery, deep sorrow and depression.This is a youth book. Why is the pain and cruelty so sharp? Cut off a child's hand? Leave him amputated and alone in a dungeon to cry for weeks? I just couldn't bear the agony -- and I'm an adult and have seen my share of pain, cruelty, and even amputations.I stuck with it because I thought maybe we would see a story of courage in adversity, and rising above our handicaps, or something like that. By the time two main characters make abrupt, totally unbelievable changes in their point of view and loyalties, I was ready to throw the book in the trash. I stuck with it because I thought perhaps those people were just acting -- pretending to have those opinions/feelings only until they achieved a certain purpose.They didn't, and I didn't change my opinion.

Eugenides is stuck in a web made from political and personal problems and the cleverly-crafted plot makes The Queen of Attolia an amazing read. Who says sequels can't be as good as the original? This is one novel that could easily stand alone. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Almost may only count in horseshoes and hand grenades, but being able to write a sequel almost as good as the original is not small accomplishment, at least not in this case.THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA, by Megan Whalen Turner, continues the story of Eugenides, thief of the Queen of Eddis, this time using a third person narrative, and a much darker plot. After getting caught in the palace of Attolia, Eugenides loses his right hand, and, seemingly, his ability to thieve. He returns home lost, and holes up in his room for many months, not knowing that a war has been started between the three small countries of Eddis, Attolia, and Sounis, and overshadowed by the threat of the powerful Medes.However, once Eugenides comes out of his dejection, he immediately goes back into action, hoping to be able to save his small country from certain destruction by stealing nothing short of peace. How he does this makes for quite an interesting book, and once again Turner manages to put a surprising little twist towards the end, one which should surprise you at least a little bit. Certainly not one to rival that found in THE THIEF, but still a good one.I read THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA in one sitting, not being able to put it down, and as a result I didn't go to sleep until at least 1:30AM. I highly recommend this book, but be warned: it is much darker than is predecessor, and Eugenides is not nearly as entertaining. That was my biggest disappointment, for I had been hoping for more of his excellent sense of humor. Also, many don't like that there are no stories told within the book, and that some of the main characters from THE THIEF are barely even mentioned. Be that as is may, this is still a good book in it's own light, and well worth reading.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I started reading this book at the same time I started Harry Potter. I was so engrossed by the story of Eugenides, that Harry got put aside until I finished this edge-of-the-seat tale. I have not felt for a character in a novel so deeply since Frodo in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Vanyel in the Mage series. Eugenides, a thief, is finally caught by the Queen of Attolia, and pays a heavy price for his crime. As he recuperates, his queen asks him to do the seemingly impossible - steal peace - as his land is brought closer to the brink of war with neighboring countries.I hope there is a sequel - are you listening Ms. Turner?"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"&quot;The Queen of Attolia&quot; is a great book! It's got a fantastic plot, and everything, the characters are seriously realistic, and the ending is (okay, I admit it) fantastic. You should read this. Maybe Megan Whalen Turner could write a sequel?"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"This is the second book in the series about Gen, the Queen's Thief. It's a great, action-packed story. The book was difficult to put down. I really enjoyed it. I recommend reading the first book as well, The Thief. Wonderful character development. I would recommend it for both older children as well as adults. Anxiously awaiting the third book (I sincerely hope there's a third book!)."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I've recommended the first book about Gen, &quot;The Thief,&quot; to countless students, and I loved it myself. I'm not going to recommend the sequel! The plotting is certainly ingenious, and Gen's twisty imagination and clever talk are equally pleasing, but there are many minuses. One of the characters introduced in the first book is merely dismissed as &quot;away studying&quot; or some such, and is mentioned no more. A more serious objection is a psychological one. The end of the book is totally unbelievable, given what we know about Gen's opinions from the first book, and also from the tense and suspenseful beginning chapters of this book. Also, in the first book, the author chose to show us the people of her imaginary countries through the stories they tell. She attempts only half-heartedly to continue in her second story; only one &quot;tale&quot; is told.I wish I hadn't read it; I won't enjoy re-reading the first one as much, knowing what lies in store for the characters!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I loved The Thief-- we were completely inside his point of view, and he was funny and clever. I couldn't wait to read this sequel.But in the sequel, the author goes on for pages and pages about the politics of the countries involved. She tells us about wars and stuff... it's like reading a history book and I frankly had trouble following it. Scenes that actually have Gen in them are rare, and when we do see him a lot of the time he's just acting whiny and other characters are concerned about him. It goes on for pages and pages and it gets old.There are rare moments when Gen actually pops into the story and does something, and those are delightful-- the only reason I'm giving the book two stars instead of one."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The amazing sequel to The Thief, The Queen of Attolia continues the adventurous story of Eugenides, the sardonic and clever royal thief. The story begins with Eugenides falling into the hands of the Queen of Attolia. The tables turn for Eugenides as the Queen punishes him for his trespassing by taking from him the most valuable tool of his trade-and his pride. The Queen stands by with a cold, blank mask of callousness on her face. As Eugenides returns home and comes to terms with his loss, the Queen soon regrets her decision when war breaks out with her country and his. As she is conflicted with fear of his revenge and regret of torturing him, the Queen rages at herself for not killing Eugenides while she had him. Meanwhile, the The Thief is making plans of his own...This book is my FAVORITE of the four. I love, love, love this book! Why? Oh what is there not to love? Again, Turner keeps us on our toes as the plots twists and turns in ways we never imagined. She has a talent for writing exactly what she means while making you think something entirely different until she brings everything in full-circle revelation. I am always surprised, shocked and deeply satisfied when reading these books. I could not put this book down! Oh, and I read it again immediately after reading it once because I loved it so much.I love all the characters in this book, especially Gen, of course (and he reminds me of my husband :-)) Eddis (Helen) and Attolia (Irene) are both strong women characters in very different ways. The character development is strong and believable and Turner eloquently brings us inside their worlds and heads. The secondary characters are endearing also.The Queen of Attolia is full of humor, adventure, and life. The characters show strong characteristics of friendship, loyalty, love, and integrity.But the cherry on top-and the reason this book is one of my favorites-is because the themes of redemption and unconditional love are beautifully played out in this novel. There is something about this story that reaches deep into the heart and pulls hard. It symbolizes a deep, unconditional, supernatural love for which we all deeply long; not a superficial, sexually-driven love found in novels such as Twilight. Ah, the power of the written word!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"It was a dark smokey passageway. Then to a street bellow a parapet with quarrels clattering as they produce echoes that sound down the alleys. The beginning of the Queen of Attolia is mystifying, thrilling, and amazing. I enjoyed this book tremendously particularly because of its astounding ability to capture the reader and hold them in the manacles of suspense. Whether in the beautiful countryside or in a dank prison cell the Queen of Attolia is a marvelous book that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"contrary to the title, i am definitely not 'severely annoyed' with the book. the book is fantastic, and i get chills just thinking about it. that's why i've been blackmailing my friends to get it as a birthday present for me.i'm just annoyed that people are saying it is unsuitable for YA. it is perfectly alright, i read it when i was 11/12, and i did not get creeped out or anything. the plotlines were a bit complicated, but i survived. gen's getting a hand lopped off is not scary. it is central to the plot, and the excruciating pain of it is like the 'propellor' of the characterisation. to be honest, i am pretty sadistic, and i was going 'oooh' rather than 'nooo' when his hand got cut. i was wincing, though. maybe it's because i didn't read the first book (i still haven't-i know i'm missing a lot), so i didn't really have any feelings for gen.the most disappointing part was the beginning. first page. gen crawling around. second page. gen still crawling around. third page. i was getting bored. the beginning is not engrossing. of course i was wondering what was going on, but it wasn't the i'm so excited wondering. it was the when's the story going to start?! frustration. but it got so much better after the beginning, and i truly enjoyed reading it. i would definitely read it again...when i get the book =)there's hardly a perfect book in the world, but this one comes real close."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Megan Whalen Turner's trilogy is not just for young adults. It's so far beyond most of what I read, YA or adult, that I struggle to compare it to anyone else. L'Engle? Tolkien? Read all three books. Just brilliant."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The Queen of Attolia has been fuming, harboring a slowly building hatred for a thief who not only succeeded in stealing Hamiathe's Gift from her lands, but has been taunting her within her own palace for months. She knows he has been spying for his queen, he could pass unnoticed, but instead Eugenides chooses to leave her evidence informing of his presence. Attolia has finally found a way to capture Eugenides, and when she does, he will be at her mercy. Little does she consider the consequences of her judgement upon the thief...I sometimes find it easier to write reviews for books that I hated, or just liked, than those that I've loved. With those books that I fall absolutely head over heals for, I'm afraid that I could not possibly formulate words that would do my feelings about the book justice. Hence, my reviews for this series may be somewhat shallow or short, but it's not because I don't have strong feelings for this books, it's because I love them too much.I really feel that I have grown up with Eugenides after reading the short story, Thief!, and the first in the series, The Thief. Megan Whalen Turner has a unique talent for writing for the age of her characters perfectly, and it has been lovely to see the development of Eugenides as a 10 year old scallywag to a young man. The Queen of Attolia is far more complex than The Thief in a way that enriches the story and draws one in even further than before. While The Thief highlighted the mythology of the old gods, The Queen of Attolia focuses on the current political situation. It is unfortunately rare that an author is able to convey the intricacies of complex politics without either info-dumping or causing intense boredom. Turner does this beautifully, presenting the situation naturally. I adore stories where you get to see all sides of a conflict, understand that there is no true \`bad guy', and see the strategic motivations of all involved.Of course, the character of Eugenides, as well as the other characters in the cast, gain much more depth in this second book. I love Eddis, she reminds me so much of Mercedes Lackey's Selenay that I just want to hug her and be best friends forever. Eugenides balks against all stereotypes of thieves created by other works--he doesn't come from a broken home, he's not riff-raff or street trash, he is nobility in his own right and holds a very respected position among his countrymen. Unlike The Thief, which was told entirely from Eugenides's point of view, The Queen of Attolia offers us an array of perspectives, including that of (surprise!) the Queen of Attolia, who must deal with the consequences of Eugenides's capture and punishment while balancing the snakes lurking within her own court.Alas, much like The Thief I am reticent to say too much about the story lest I give anything away."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The Queen of Attolia by Megan Whalen Turner is the sequel to the Newbery-Honor winner, The Thief (read my review). I was impressed by the intricate writing Turner managed in The Thief, and was very eager to continue with this series. Although the writing in each book is very similar, this tone is different between the two. The Thief is rather lighthearted and fun. It has its depth and importance, but the overall tone is fairly light. The Queen of Attolia is... not so much. The mood and feel of this book is considerably darker and heavier.But really, that's okay, because I loved this book just as much, if not a little more than The Thief. Turner's writing is as compelling in this book as it was while reading The Thief, although the focus is also a little different. Where, to me, The Thief is primarily about the characters, with Gen (Eugenides) being our obvious focus, The Queen of Attolia is more about the story and the intrigues rampant in court life. The Thief was a story, but the characters are the most important part. In Queen, the characters are still very important and are well developed and complete, but we already saw the beginnings of their development in Thief, and can now focus on the importance of their individual and connecting stories.Before, Gen was our narrator in The Thief, and unless I'm remembering wrong, he tells the whole story. In Queen, we are given other narrators to help Eugenides tell this story. Although I do love Eugenides, he has become one of my most favorite fictional characters, my favorite narrator in this book was the Queen, Attolia herself. I loved the way her mind worked, and trying to guess ahead of time what plots and tricks she was working through. The face she presents to the world is ruthless and hard. She doesn't appear to be overly conniving, but as we listen in on her thoughts, it is clear that she has a very keen mind, one that is constantly assessing and reassessing the situation and all it's possible implications.The plot to the story holds a very tight, intricate weave, one I was anxious to watch pull together. Each character has their own motivators, and their own interests to promote. At some point, each character believes that they hold the advantage and it's not until the end, when everything begins to wrap up and come together that we really are able to understand what has been going on this whole time anyway.Once again, I must also point out Turner's fantastic world building. She set up the mythology and the guidelines for her world in The Thief and continued to build upon them here. I love spending time in this world that Turner has created because it is vividly real and the characters are written so much like real people that I wonder why we can't be friends."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I'm nervous about writing this review, but I don't know if I can adequately express in words how much I loved this book. If I were able to give this book 10 stars, I would.The Thief, the first book in this series, was so fun, interesting, and engrossing, and I think The Queen of Attolia was an excellent sequel. Readers fell in love with Gen in The Thief. He was witty, charming, and full of surprises. In The Queen of Attolia, Gen has grown up. He's gone through some things and it affects his personality. I think this adds to the series. Gen was certainly young in the first book, and like everyone, he had to grown up. I relished the glimpses of the old Gen throughout Queen.The story in Queen was fascinating. I thought there were plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader interested and on his or her toes. I find that every time I finish this book (yes, I'm read it many times), I spend days and days thinking about it. That, for me, is a sign of a great book.Again, I can't say enough about this book. It is different from The Thief and it is important to remember that going it. But, although it is different, The Queen of Attolia is an amazingly interesting and gripping book."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"It is not easy to be the queen of a country anxious to have a king, especially when sovereignty is not enough to ensure obedience let alone loyalty. It is no secret that the queen of Attolia is more beautiful, by far, than the queen of Eddis. Beauty is a useful weapon in Attolia's limited arsenal; one that leaves little room for kindness.Eddis is no great beauty but, as everyone knows but would not dare say, she is more kind. After stealing repeatedly from her kingdom and abandoning discretion to speak truth, Eugenides has angered Attolia beyond all reason. The queen is desperate for revenge at any price.What draws Eugenides back to Attolia is anyone's guess, but return he does. When the two come face to face, the sacrifice will be great on both sides. Attolia is a ruthless ruler hardened, through her hard-won and harder-kept reign, almost to stone. Eugenides is the Thief of Eddis and he can steal anything. But as both sides seek justice, the fate of Eddis, Attolia, and even Sounis will hang in the balance as Eugenides tries to steal peace and also, perhaps, salvation for Attolia and himself in The Queen of Attolia (2000) by Megan Whalen Turner.The Queen of Attolia is the sequel to Turner's Newbery honor book The Thief which first introduced readers to Eugenides and his world.When Eugenides is caught one too many times stealing from Attolia, he pays the ultimate price. Finding himself caught in the middle of a war he wants no part of, Eugenides does what he always does: he steals what he needs to remedy the situation. What follows is a compelling story of political intrigue, old gods, and cunning. At the same time, The Queen of Attolia is a haunting tale of broken people trying to understand what it means to be whole when the damage has already been done and, no matter what else might follow, completely irreparable.Like later books in the series, The Queen of Attolia is written with shifting perspectives. Turner follows Eugenides and Attolia, of course, but also other characters who play minor and major roles in the plot. It's rare to see a complete shift in narrative style for a series, but like most of Turner's writing decisions it makes perfect sense. After the disastrous events at the beginning of this book it's unlikely anyone, even Eugenides, would want to spend too much time in his head. The ability to shift between characters also gives the story more liberty in how events unfold for the reader and the characters.I hate having to say books need to be read in order, but these really do. Years ago my mom snagged an ARC of this book which I read before The Thief. I later read the first book and the two worked fine, but only in rereading them in the correct order did I see how much I missed. The Queen of Attolia completely blew my mind when I first read it and continues to dazzle me as do the rest of Turner's books about Gen. Hopefully this review will pique your interest but the book is so much more than anything I can say here that it is impossible to understand how brilliant it (and the series in general) is without reading it. So, go and read it. Right away.Eugenides' adventures continue in The King of Attolia.Possible Pairings: Dreamhunter by Elizabeth Knox, Abhorsen by Garth Nix, Tamar by Mal Peet, The New Policeman by Kate Thompson"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"This is a sequel to the THE THIEF, which is an excellent story--so a reader should start with that book.Eugenides once again dares the wrath of the Queen of Attolia, but it seems the fortune of his gods has deserted him and he is captured. He's punished cruelly by the heartless Queen, which starts a war between his Queen of Eddis and Attolia. And both kingdoms have an equally uneasy relationship with Sounis, to the south. Worse yet, there is the Medean Empire beginning to make its move, wishing to take over any and all of the three small quarrelsome kingdoms. Will Eugenides be able to recover from his injuries and use his cunning abilities to save Eddis and the unwilling Sounis and Attolia from each other AND the Medes?While this story doesn't have the big twist of THE THIEF, it is even more dramatic since there is so much at stake... so much that is lost and won. We learn more about some of the characters from the first book--about Eugenides, the Queen's Thief, and his dangerous missions, the lovable but unlovely Queen of Eddis, and the ruthless Queen of Attolia. There is even appearances by the Magus of Sounis.The characters are all unique and interesting. The plot contains lots of suspense and action and excitement with the drama of the Thief and his daring, and the political machinations, as well as battles and plots. This is an excellent sequel and a solidly good read."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The Queen of Attolia takes place in the imagined kingdoms of Eddis, Attolia, and Sounis, set in an area similar to our world's Mediterranean. The action takes place not long after the events of The Thief. Although there is relative quiet between the three kingdoms at the novel's start, there isn't real peace, and a more powerful neighbor, Mede, is trying to form an alliance with Attolia. The rulers of the kingdoms are unchanged, and once again, Eugenides, the thief, is somewhere that he isn't supposed to be.I loved loved loved this book. Unlike The Thief, The Queen of Attolia is action-packed from page one. In fact, one of the biggest events of the story takes place within the first thirty pages, and the consequences of that event play out over this book and the next one.This book fits a lot of locations and characters into 360 pages. Many favorite characters from The Thief return, and characters that were only briefly seen in that book have much larger roles. We learn more about Gen and how he came to be the Thief, and about the queen of Attolia. The focus in this book is on events between Eddis and Attolia, both the countries and the queens, and, of course, our hero Eugenides.Megan Whalen Turner does a hard thing in these books, and it's part of what makes them so great. Eugenides is a trickster, a thief, and part of the charm in these stories is that the reader, even a very careful reader, never quite knows what is going on. Often this can leave a character unknowable emotionally, but that's not the case with Gen. He might continue to be three steps ahead of everyone, and he might tell a lot of lies, but that never keeps the reader apart from him; it is Gen who is at the emotional heart of these novels.I could rave about this book endlessly, but that would reveal too many of Gen's secrets, and I wouldn't want to spoil them for anyone. This series should be on everyone's must-read list. It really is one of the best."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I only read this one because I enjoyed The Thief so much, and wondered what would happen to Eugenides next. I'm not a \\"fantasy\\" or \\"medieval\\" genre-junkie, so The Thief was stretching it for me. However, Whalen Turner nailed it again, plus some. She orchestrated a fantastic plot that had me go from despising the Queen to respecting her. Builds a beautiful foundation for the next in the series, The King of Attolia, while still functioning as a stand-alone novel that all ages should enjoy. Whalen Turner has a way of making me care about Eugenides in the same way that I care about Harry Potter. They aren't similar characters, but I love them both."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Eugenides, the Queen's Thief, is not just a thief, he's a spy, and he's been spying on the queen of the neighboring kingdom of Attolia since they were both children. He fell in love with her the first time he saw her, but she's become cruel and ruthless under the strain of ruling her realm, and when she catches him in her palace, spying, she turns all her cruelty on him in a way that nearly breaks both of them.Despite her unforvigable act, Eugenides can't help but understand the pressures on this queen, can't help understanding her, and despite his fear and fury, can't help loving her."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Of the other books in this series, the Queen of Attolia has the least humor in it, but its interesting and heart-wrenching plot makes up for that. It is my favorite in the series. Favorite book of all time. To appreciate it though, you do have to read the Thief first and already have a love for Eugenides."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The Queen of Attolia is the second book in Megan Whalen Turner's Queen's Thief. Taking a different, and darker turn than The Thief, The Queen of Attolia is a more enjoyable book that takes the series to a completely new level with greater depth that will appeal to older readers.The thief of Eddis, the Queen's thief, is one the move again. This time, he's watching the Queen of Attolia's every move and gathering intelligence for his queen. When Eugenides is discovered, Attolia decides to take something more precious than his life -his right hand, making it nearly impossible to be a thief. After returning to Eddis, war breaks out, and in a move to defeat her enemies, the queen decides to give Eugenides a new task: to steal the queen of Attolia. The task isn't as easy at it seems, as Eugenides gets closer to completing his task, he gets pulled into the political intrigue of the court and the perils of war.Turner's writing style has noticeably matured since The Thief, and The Queen of Attolia has much more substance to it than The Thief did, making it more of a YA book than a children's novel. A thrilling and enjoyable read, Turner builds a fascinating, lush world that draws readers in and keep them until the last page. I blazed through The Queen of Attolia and can't wait to get my hands on The King of Attolia."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I greatly enjoyed \\"Queen of Attolia.\\" 2nd in the \\"Thief\\" series by Margaret Whalen Turner, this one features the thief trying to get over some major setbacks in his career during a recent visit to Attolia. Meanwhile Attolia and Eddis are at war, with Sounis (the southern nation we visited in book 1) eager to get in on the slicing and dicing. I can't say much more without giving away major plot points, but Eugenides is still awesome. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I don't think Queen of Attolia was as good as the first book in the series but I still enjoyed it. Right away you get sucked into the book as Eugenides is trying to run away from the queens guard. I was pulling for Eugenides to escape the entire time, because Eugenides always escapes! But this time he wasn't as lucky and he is capture by the Queen's guards. The Queen, angry by Eugenides always sneaking into her castle, takes matters into her own hands and cuts off Eugenides right hand so that he would never steal again.When Eugenides is sent back to his queen, the plot began to slow down for me. I began to get disinterested as there were many long paragraphs describing what was going on with Eugenides and not enough dialogue. I began to be disappointed by the book. But the ending of the book began to pick up again and got my full attention once again.I liked the ending, and of course, like the previous book in the series, it caught me off guard once again with a twist in the storyline. I enjoy the way the author writes and I am already off reading the third book of the story."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"A riveting story of the completely unexpected (by the protagonists and everyone who knows them) love story of two brilliant, proud, courageous people who must use all their abundant abilities--and learn to see everything in a new, understanding light--to triumph over their dangerous enemies and themselves.Turner doesn't write sequels; she writes original, exciting stories never pall and always ring true."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The writer does a fantastic job of creating a real page turner. Her locations and pseudo-histories and mythologies make the book both highly engaging and extremely believable."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The Queen of Attolia is an interesting read. The character of Ged is developed well as you see not only the side of the Thief from the previous book, but also the more cunning devious side of him as well. Ged really grows up in this book."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"This series of books is one of my favorites. My only caveat for parents is that The Queen of Attolia has a bit more mature content than The Thief. It is just as well-written and intriguing. I recommend these books!"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"The Queen is a fantastic rainy-day read; intruiging plot twists & the fresh, well-developed story-line cause you to want to read the entire book in one sitting! From the moment you are first introduced to Eugenides in the midst of his trials to the very satisfying end, you are captivated by Turner's unique book & fresh dialogue.Absolutely one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"This book is considerably darker than the first, giving us stronger glimpses into our characters hearts and minds. When Queen Attolia, the cold, unfeeling woman whom Gen secretly loves, has his hand cut off as punishment for his thievery, Gen's hand, heart, and pride are all hurt. After sulking about the castle, as we always remember our lovable thief to do, Gen indirectly tries to stop the war that is evident to soon come. Readers hearts will sulk for the battles (and hands) that are lost. But they will see how much the characters grow both emotionally and intellectually. Gen, although still his sacastic, whiney, lovable, and funny self, grows a little more mature. Attolia learns to soften her stone-hard heart and to add a little glow to her face. You'll want another sequel. I did."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"A challenging, rich fantasy for lovers of the genre, this story continues the exploits of Gen, hero of The Thief. He is captured, imprisoned, and his hand is severed by the cruel Queen whom he secretly loves. Gen recovers to be the clever and bold royal thief who can still manipulate the dicey relations among neighboring states always posed for war. Great characters, great adventure."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"If I were ever to write a book, this is the one I would want to see my name on. I am not very good at writing positive reviews, so this will probably sound cheesy, but I totally loved every word, every sentence of this story!\\"The Queen of Attolia\\" is a second book in Megan Whalen Turner's series about the Thief of Eddis Eugenides. I moderately liked the first book, especially for its conciseness and intricate world-building rooted in Greek history and mythology, but this second book exceeded any kind of expectations I had had. It is just so much better than \\"The Thief\\" written in Eugenide's 1st person POV. \\"The Queen of Attolia\\" is written in 3rd person which allows us to understand the workings of minds of all major players - King of Sounis, Queens of Attolia and Eddis, magus, etc.The story starts when Eugenides is caught by Attolian guard. The Queen of Attolia executes her revenge on the Thief, and in a way that almost breaks Gen. Queen of Eddis, enraged by her Thief's plight, embarks on a war with Attolia, and Sounis starts his attack on both neighboring countries in an attempt to unite the territory against the outside threat of Mede. What follows is a complex story of politics, diplomacy, military strategies and intrigue.I am not lying when I say I loved every word of this book. Because every word of it is important, there is no fluff or filler, every sentence matters. That is probably why it took me 3 days to finish this 300-page book, I simply didn't want to miss anything!But there is more. I really loved the character developments in this book. Just like in \\"The Thief,\\" we never fully know the narrators. In many ways, they remain anonymous to us, but whatever is revealed, is layered and complex. I enjoyed following Eugenides' transformation from a snarky selfish boy into a strong man. And let me tell you, the romance in this book totally catches you off-guard and certainly pushes boundaries.I can't wait to read the next book - \\"The King of Attolia\\" and see where Turner takes her characters next. Why, of why does it take her on average 5 years to write each book?"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I bought The Thief 7 years ago, and The Queen of Attolia 6 years ago, and they still rank among some of my favorite reads.This is one of those books that you can read over and over again and discover new things every time. Turner's writing is sure and vivid, and although some parts may seem slower than others, all of the different threads tie together in the end.To those who read The Thief and enjoyed it, a slight warning: This book is darker, and slightly less humorous, but it is perfect for slightly older readers.I highly reccomend this book, and for those who've read it, the sequel The King is coming out in 2006. :-)"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Wow. I just...wow. Talk about a sequel. In fact, I'm pretty sure that as sequels go THE QUEEN OF ATTOLIA should be the standard textbook in a class entirely devoted to how to write a killer sequel. The kind of sequel that will leave your readers completely unable to contain their glee at how it was just as good as they weren't daring to hope it would be. The kind that makes them keep their husbands up at night expounding upon the splendor that is such a sequel.A note on the cover: I truly love the \\"new\\" covers. I do. But this one kind of makes me want to run and hide under the covers. And I'm glad I didn't see it until after I read the book. Rather, I went in blissfully unaware of what awaited me.The Thief of Eddis is on a secret mission for his queen in the heart of enemy territory. As he slips away into the night, something goes massively, horribly wrong and he is run down and captured by Attolian guards. For his audacity, Attolia takes his right hand and sends him back to his queen broken and on the brink of death. While Eugenides struggles to comes to terms with his drastically altered life, Eddis declares war on Attolia for his sake and the three countries are quickly at each other's throats. As their losses mount, Eugenides realizes there is one more thing he can steal from Attolia that will save his country from destruction. But, given their last encounter, does he have the courage to venture into Attolia again and face her one more time?Truth? I spent a a fair bit of time holding back sobs while reading this book. You see I fell in love with Eugenides. And he does not have an easy time of it here. The thing is he is so very awesome that you know he'll be okay. He has to be okay. But, still, his anguish and rage are so palpable it's hard to watch. And at the same time, my favorite scenes are the beautifully alternating passages in which Gen tries and fails and tries to piece his life together while, a world away, Attolia sits on her throne, staring blankly out the window, agonizing over what she did. It's so unexpected and had me glued to the page. And Turner's not kidding around with the love story. When it comes it takes your breath away. On top of it all this book's got a perfect ending. It'll make you smile through your tears."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I believe that the Queen of Attolia is even more exciting then The Thief. Gen is back and stronger than ever. Well, until he becomes maimed. You might think, \\"Oh he will make it through, he always does.\\" He does make it through, but it effects him physically and especially mentally. He has trouble making it through. He still is the Thief of Eddis, but he has gone dormant.I love this book the best out of all three: The Thief, The Queen of Attolia, and The King of Attolia. You are able to see Gen recover from the injury. He strikes back and is pulled between two countries. It reminds me of my life when I've got to make big decisions. Will Eddis have a good enough plan to beat Attolia this time? Does Gen care for Attolia, even after what she did to him?I would recommend this book for young adults, around the ages 10-14. The book is a bit gruesome, but all wars do become gross. From this book, I have learned about tact with wars and how they can effect countries. This book has romance, war, and everything else books can have. It is well worth your time.-Katelyn Ragland"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"This book is dark but it's a fantastic, effective read. The first book I literally couldn't put down.The first sequel to The Thief, the tone of this story was a bit of a surprise at first, but I was so drawn in I didn't mind. In fact I think the darkness of the plotline was perfect as a follow-up to the first of the trilogy and as a precursor to The King of Attolia.I recommend this book as a purchase because I know from my own experience that one reading is not enough. You'll want to read it again. It's that good."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"I found this book a long time ago and all I can say is that I'm so glad the library came of some use. I absolutely love The Queen of Attolia; the plot and the characters are masterfully concocted and original. I read tons of books from many genres and this has got to be one of, if not my most, favorite books. Darker, deeper, and more complex than most teen fantasy novels, The Q of A is far from cliched and mundane. Most of all, I adore the main characters because they're so distinct in personality and utterly entertaining. And, the dialogue is witty and subtlely hilarious. Read this book if you haven't because it's worth owning multiple copies of. I already ordered its rerelease with a lovely new cover although I wish Attolia's face was depicted. Read it - that's the best I can advise."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"What an amazing sequel to 'The Theif! Although this one stands just as well on it's own you might need a little backstory. 'The Queen of Attolia' takes the characters in the first book deeper than in the first one, particularly Gen who has to deal with a deep loss right at the start of the book and has to find some way to retake his place as Queen's Theif of Eddis. His character changes and we see him grow up from the ingeniously cocky young man we met in 'The Theif' into a more serious, determined and singularly stubborn Theif with his own clever schemes and plans. Just as clever and witty, but a little darker and more serious than the first book, which, in case you haven't guessed, I am in awe of, this is another one that you absolutely HAVE to read, if only to see what happens to Eugenides. As I said, it is a darker book and the particularly squeamish may be a bit put off by what the Queen of Attolia does to poor Gen and a few of the not-so-poite terms she calls people but these only pop up a few times and if you can handle them, this is a marvellous book that I picked up and did not put down until I reached the end."},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","review":"Hi! I consider myself a veteran of fantasy books and this is one of my favourites! I can reread this a thousand times: you always discover things you missed out before every time. It's basically about the thief's further adventures and more of his private life. I loved the description of how he got the whole palace coming for his blood and all. The Queen of Attolia was a flawless character in this book, how she was so fearless and scared of the world at once...a priceless jewel!"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Saul Bellow is a good writer, but the character he writes about is boring, self centered and prone to long rants of \\"word salad\\" tangents.

I am already enjoying reading my new (to me) book."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I am a Saul Bellow fan, and whilst I enjoyed Henderson the Rain King, it seemed to lack something. The story is about Gene Henderson a loud and obnoxious American millionaire who one day decides to go to Africa to satisfy some inner need. The first third of the book is very amusing culminating in his extermination of the frog plague and unfortunately also tribes water supply. However when Henderson gets to the second tribe what starts out as an interesting story gets bogged down in metaphysical discussions with the king, Dahfu. Ultimately Henderson returns home, no longer the cynical person he was at the beginning, but rather a person who rejoices and celebrates life. However the connection between his experiences and his transformation are not very clear, leaving us to ask what brought about the change in his outlook."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This book will keep you interested from start to finish. It is written in a style that anyone can appreciate. I truely enjoyed the main character Henderson and his frank thinking and ideas throughout the book."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I lasted about 70% through this book thanks to Bellow's ability as a writer, therefore 3 stars. Basically Henderson is a whiner, but a funny whiner initially (Surely we're not supposed to take this juvenile garbage seriously). He ends up in a ludicrous African fantasy which carries the plot for a while. I'm sure there is meaning or whatever you want to call it. There is certainly some sparkle but eventually it is like digging for diamonds in a mountain of crap. Maybe I missed a great ending here.Now I'm afraid to reread Herzog, which may be just as bad and I didn't even realize it back then (As I think back it may have been)."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"First of all who am I to review a Pulitzer prize winner? This book was very highly recommended to me by my friend, a college English professor. He knew I had lived for two years in Africa and enjoyed good writing.The verdict: Bellow is well known as great writer. This book is an unusual vehicle to showcase his talent. I had a hard time liking Henderson, the main character, too much of an ugly American but with a subtle charitable side that helped win me over as I read on.The Africa described here is too far fetched, a tribal fantasy but it is a clever way to bring the adverturer Henderson into contact with King Dahfu, the leader of the fictional African country. King Dahfu is the highly educated African caught between an experience in the west and a western education and the traditional home.Some of the best writing in the book comes in the dialogue between Henderson and Dahfu as they encounter Dahfu's captured deadly lioness in the dungeon below the King's palace (yes it is a bit fantastic). Somehow they wage wits over man's stuggle for meaning while dodging the circling lioness. There were additional predicaments that had me laughing out loud as I read about Henderson.There are brilliant lines in this book, lines that make you pause to savor them, scenes vividly painted and strong emotion, enough here that makes me want to read more from Bellow even if it isn't about Africa."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Henderson the Rain King is so inspiring, the Counting Crows based a song on the 20th century classic. The song is called &quot;Rain King&quot;. Must Read - Must Hear"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"While this book is obviously well written, to me its a long ride to nowhere. Not much actually happens in the book, and the senseless ramblings between the King and Henderson are all rehashes of the same old 'meaning of life' sayings.The book was a bit of a chore to get through, with little payoff at the end."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This is the first book I read by Saul Bellow and it intrigued me enough to read two more books by this author. However, despite some interesting dialogue and a few paragraphs that are poetic and poignant this book is lacking. I find two major problems in all of Bellow's work.1. Pacing. Bellows has a poor sense of pacing. There are sections that rapidly progress the plot interspersed with long winded boring sections that drag on for pages and pages with nothing happening. At times the plot can be quite entertaining, such as when Henderson finally gets to Africa and interacts with the villagers. I wanted Bellow to go into more detail between the villagers and Henderson rather than spend pages reading about Henderson's inner angst.2. A lack of focus makes the book too long and seriously detracts from the moments of brilliance scattered throughout. In a word, Bellows likes to preach through his main character, and the voice you hear is very distinctly Bellows, not Hendersons. I didn't realize this until I read Humboldts Gift and I waded through pages of Charlie Citrines thoughts and ideas, which were very similiar to the thoughts and ideas of Bellow as Chick in Ravelstein. These thoughts and conversations, (In all three books) are amazingly convoluted, and sometimes I wonder if Bellow writes with stacks of textbooks near him so he can reference the theories of John Stuart Mills, Pope, Nietzsche, Davarr, Eriksen, Freud, Kierkegaard etc...and this is just a small sample. You can be rest assured that Bellow talks about every major and minor philosopher, psychologist, painter, writer, and poet at some point in time in all of his works, and most if it is pure psychobabble that has nothing to do with the plot. In short, if I wanted to read a textbook I would buy one. This is unfortunate because in Henderson the Rain King there was a good story and idea but Bellow lost the thread. Also, out of the three books I read by Bellow this one is the best. Needless to say I won't read another word by this author. Obviously he has connections to the people who hand out Pulitzer Prizes and Nobel Prizes, not to mention book reviewers.In closing, if you want a taste of Bellow read this book, if you enjoy it maybe you should pursue him more but be warned it doesn't get better."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"The grade reflects my enjoyment rather than the underlying value of this book, which is reputedly a major work by a Nobelist that may well say important things about nineteen-fifties America naively throwing its weight around in the developing world. But I find the title character, a fiftyish millionaire, to be a boor and a blowhard, despite his odd scraps of knowledge and unexpected areas of competence. Yes, he could be a fine comic character if you happen to like him (and you should know after a chapter or so), but I personally resent spending that amount of time with his discursive reflections. And the African country to which he journeys (taking half the book to get there) is as artificial a construct as the locale of Rider Haggard'sSHE, so that the improbably eloquent English-speaking King Dahfu who engages Henderson in long philosophical discussions emerges as little more than the author's surrogate."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This book proves that great writing can be readable. I read this novel for the first time over twenty years ago, several times in between, and it was just as wonderful last week. You laugh, you cry, you empathize. If you're tired of beach books, but also weary of pseudointellectual book snobs who tell you that prose must be labyrinthine to be literature, and that laughable isn't laudable, take this book on vacation and share it with a friend."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I decided to read this book because I had heard that Joni Mitchell, one of my musical idols, had copped the title of her song &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; from one of the lines in this book. I'm so glad that I decided to give this novel a try. It has so many heartfelt and honest observations about life in it that you find yourself rereading and rerereading sections just for their truth and beauty. This is the first book by Bellow that I'd ever tried, and now I certainly want to read more by him. Henderson's adventures in Africa are exciting and humorous in themselves, but it is Henderson's observations about life, and how he grows and matures over the course of the novel, that make the book for me. By all means, give this wonderful book a read..."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Middle-aged and mammoth-sized protagonist Henderson is the 1950's version of American Renaissance man whose insights are both abrasive and totally American: \\"I have made some clear observations. \\" First of all, few people are sane. . . Next, slavery has never really been abolished. \\"When confronted by midlife ennui to a woman whose allegiance to he is about identical to his to her, and all contrasted to the birth of twins who have yet to commence elementary school education, he does what wealthy people in those days could do when all things are not rosy at home: take a trip to the far edge of the world to see the man on the mountain and maybe come back with imprimatur or actual learned knowledge from the Swahili or whoever caught his attention.In this novel, the trip is to Africa, where he soon hires a local man to translate and lead to villages which never have known white men, never known the concept of tourism and which are devoid of modern day elements. He sees two. In each, his greatest moments are not the villages or villagers - but instead he relies upon their leaders whose educations in Europe have made each a cross cultural icon to whom the large white man must gape at in amazement and awe. They are wise as the Oxford's finest - full of old world concepts sprinkled with modernism's sciences. One king tells Henderson, \\"Man is a creature who cannot stand still under blows. Now take the horse - he never needs a revenge. Nor the ox. But man is a creature of revenges. . . He cannot get rid of the punishment, his heart is apt to rot from it.\\"As the story unfolds, Henderson receives some physical, but mostly emotional blows. And, as his wisdom increases, he learns not to seek revenge -a reflex action he held when living in America as a northeastern socialite - but instead learns to deal with the bruises as medals of knowledge. He grows. As he tells his wife in a letter, he matured 20 years in 20 days with these kings.But, he learns the elders of one village are as painstakingly evil as Cain. They deliver blows to their leader to capture his kingdom, and lead Henderson to conclude that, \\". . . inside, my heart ran with human feeling, but externally, in the rind if you like, I showed all the strange abuses and malformations of a lifetime.\\" He is broken hearted.In the end, we learn the maturation and trip are both real and well received by the character who divulges many inner and private issues with the reader. We are happy for him as he is a better person because of the wisdom of the leaders of what white men refer to as savages.LikeThe Adventures of Augie March, Bellow takes us on a journey all over parts of the globe ordinarily not known or seen - especially to Americans at the time of the author's publications. To date, the trips in each are still unique and romantic to the 21st century reader and make such ventures great topic for literature, which combined with Bellow's prose, make complete and excellent fiction."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I picked this book up from my local library after spotting it on Modern Library's list of the 100 greatest novels, and because of all the critical praise regarding it, I expected a story with obvious weight and drama; something like Huck Finn or Slaughterhouse Five. In my experience the books generally agreed upon as \\"great American novels\\" ride on serious moralistic and social themes, wearing a certain message clearly on their respective sleeves. However, when i cracked open Henderson, nothing about it immediately stood out to me. I put it down and in fact neglected long enough that I had to return it without truly getting into the story.Some five months later I found myself looking for something to read again, with nothing specific in mind. So on a whim I checked Henderson out again, feeling that I hadn't given it a fair shot. This time i read it in its entirety, and was honestly blown away. Unlike other novels with the same level of notoriety, the moral themes are highly ambiguous, mostly centering around the eccentric mind of Eugene Henderson. He is a complicated man with no apparent control over his own desires. You may see elements of yourself in Eugene, and if not, you will certainly recognize the attributes of others in him. I know personally that in certain ways I resonated strongly with his character.This is what i loved about Henderson the Rain King. Everything about it was real, down to earth, believable... it is not a stream of pointless philosophical babbling, but rather a collection of subtle insights woven into the absolutely hilarious adventures that tie it all together. It is an exploration of real life through the eyes of a very real, very complicated man. One of the most cathartic and pleasing novels I've read in a long time, Henderson the Rain King deserves every ounce of praise it gets."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Through parody and satire, Henderson the Rain King (1959) offers Bellow's most trenchant and comic analysis of literary modernism.The title character is a direct parody of literary giant Ernest Hemingway, a narcissistic stoic who is introspective, solipsistic, bumbling and egocentric. Despite wealth, physical prowess and social standing, Henderson feels restless and unfulfilled. He is Bellow's answer to a generation of modern writers who reacted with exaggerated disappointment to the failures of Romantic phenomenology.After alienating his wife, children and friends, and literally shouting his housekeeper to death, Henderson uses his wealth to finance a spiritual pilgrimage through remote Africa. His guide, Romilayu, leads him to the village of the Arnewi, where he befriends the leaders of the village. When he learns that the cistern from which the Arnewi draw their drinking water is plagued by frogs, he attempts to save their precious water supply. But his enthusiastic scheme ends in disaster.Henderson and Romilayu then travel to the village of the Wariri, where an impulsive feat of strength unwittingly deifies Henderson as the Rain King. His troubles, however, are far from over, and even his new friend, the Wariri chief, King Dahfu, may not be able to protect him from the tribal elders who are convinced that a lion is the reincarnation of the late king, Dahfu's father.Henderson's trek through the wilds of Africa is a journey to the heart of American spiritual darkness. It's a commentary on the utter failure of nihilistic existentialism to teach anything humanizing about the nature and meaning of death. Nevertheless, beneath all the mockery and intellectual sifting, develops the story of a modern sensibility wounded by the world, yet ultimately rehabilitated by a restored sense of mystery.Henderson the Rain King ranks #21 on the Modern Library's list of the 100 Best Novels and is said to have been Bellow's favorite amongst his own works.In 1976, Bellow became the seventh American to receive a Noble Prize in literature."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"There's an Early Bellow, a Somewhat Later Bellow, and an Older Bellow, each of which is more or less independent of the others so far as the reader is concerned. Early Bellow may only consist of Dangling Man. I didn't especially like Dangling Man, though I've seen it referred to in other novels of the time as pathbreaking, heralding a new beginning of some sort. To me it just seemed kind of bland: a guy's trapped back at home while all his buddies are off at the war ... and that's about it. Somewhat Later Bellow is the era of Augie March and the work under examination here. Augie is a Quintessential American, off trying to discover himself and letting others tell him who he is, until he decides to control his own life and decide his own fate. It is a vast, sweeping book, or tries to be. I just found it tiresome.Which brings us to Henderson the Rain King. I figured it was from the Augie March era even before I read the copyright date. It has an Augie-like character, though it's quite a bit tauter than Augie. Our hero heads off into the wilds of Africa to find himself and fill in a gnawing void in his soul; it keeps crying out to him \\"I want, I want!\\" Much craziness happens to him in the wild, but that's not really the point. Nothing very much ever happens to Bellow heroes; any action that does happen to them is purely accidental, and I'm sure Bellow apologizes profusely for it. The real action is in the characters' own minds. They're all trying to figure out who they are, what they want, what they think, or what the world around them is all about. They're confused, stuck in the world as it's given to them, and lost.Gene Henderson comes from a wealthy family and may have emptied large portions of his inheritance on travel, girls, food ... whatever. He's lived in Paris and London, probably because his spirit continued to cry \\"I want, I want!\\" and he thought he could give it what it wanted in Europe. By the time we run into him, he's in his sixties and desperate to know what he wants before he dies. He's gone through a few wives, children who hardly play any role in the story (or, we imagine, in his life), and a few million dollars.Henderson is a fascinating, repulsive character. He's continually surging forth into a monologue about his internal travails; one African after another who can't understand a word he's saying just keeps telling him \\"Yes, suh.\\" He finally meets a tribal king who can corral all that internal violence into something productive; their friendship is the center of the whole story, and Bellow delivers it beautifully. It would be very easy to turn this into some schlock about Wise Africans or Man Finding Himself or whatnot, but that would be impossible in a Bellow novel: protagonists go wherever they may but can't escape their own characters. They never really Find Themselves; quite often they're Self-Consciously Trying To Find Themselves, and doing a more or less good job of it.Older Bellow dispenses with most of the outer garb of Early Bellow: why bother sending your guy off into Africa or the deserts of the Western United States if all the action is inside his own head? Herzog and Mr. Sammler's Planet don't (if memory serves) leave the immediate vicinity of the protagonists' homes. They're books about nebbishes, and at times they're almost a parody of Allan Bloom (one of Bellow's closest friends): Moses Herzog and Artur Sammler have lived lives of horror, and their posture toward the world is reflective cowering.Oddly enough, I think Older Bellow is more readable; all the world traveling was kind of needless, as Bellow came to realize. You will take Herzog and Sammler from me when you pry them from my cold, dead hands."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"There are two things that I think virtually any reader of HENDERSON THE RAIN KING will agree upon: that Saul Bellow is a master storyteller and he is a gifted prose stylist. More than anything else, Bellow in this novel is attempting to tell a great story, and in this he succeeds magnificently. The success lies as much in the way he tells it as in what he relates, for at the hands of another writer this could easily have been a dreadful book. The plot borders on hackneyed, and could easily have become another civilized white man engages in self-realization through his encounters with the primitive kind of story. But Bellow is far too skillful to ever let it come close to that. The narrative throughout is energized by Bellow's marvelously comic prose. Whether the protagonist is wondering if a mass of frog's realize that he is their doom or relating detailing his close encounter with a lioness, Bellow constantly delights the reader with unexpected descriptions or improbable yet highly successful combinations of words customarily not used in conjunction with one another.Structurally, the novel possesses what amounts to two prefaces, the first introducing us to the main character and the various foibles to which he is prone and the second the first of his two encounters with African tribes. It is only when Henderson reaches the second of the two tribes and becomes the tribe's Rain King that the book really gets to the heart of the story.If one reads the biographical description of Bellow in the Penguin edition of the novel, one learns that Bellow earned a B. Sc. in Anthropology, and this background serves him well in the novel. His depiction of the tribes is both respectful and convincing, but what is more striking to me is how admiringly he writes of Africans at a time (it was published in 1959) when America was struggling desperately with race issues. Bellow later in life became well known for his intensely conservative political opinions (one of his closest friends was the gay arch-conservative disciple of Leo Strauss Allan Bloom, and the two of them were good friends with many well known Neocons), but none of that is apparent in his attitudes towards the Africans he encounters. In fact, there is a sense in which HENDERSON THE RAIN KING is an anti-colonial novel. The traditional colonial novel (such as Kipling's KIM) explores to some extent the superior white European or American encountering primitive cultures. But in no way does Bellow present Henderson as the superior of the Africans, and Henderson himself is acutely conscious of how much he has to learn from them. After he becomes the Rain King, he subjugates himself to the king as a disciple of sorts, definitely as a student. He is conscious of the king as someone who might be able to help him find himself, and at a time when tempers where running high in America, Bellow unflinchingly portrays their relationship as one of deep friendship, with the older Henderson the junior partner and more dependent of the two.My lone complaint with the book is with the book's \\"message.\\" Henderson is afflicted with a profound lack of self-knowledge. He is often possessed by an inner voice that proclaims, \\"I want, I want, I want.\\" Yet for Henderson \\"to want\\" is an intransitive, not a transitive verb. He never knows what it is he wants, what he yearns for. What is not compelling is either Bellow's understanding of the precise nature of Henderson's condition solution, or the nature of its ultimate solution. No question he takes a stab at it with his low interludes about \\"being\\" and \\"becoming,\\" though I didn't find this terribly compelling. Whatever the nature of Henderson's problems, by the end of the novel his encounter and friendship with the king has played a transformative role, and he is very much a new man, with new aspirations. To put it bluntly, I didn't sense that Bellow's understanding of human nature is terribly deep. Despite his enormous gifts as a storyteller, he simply isn't capacitated as a philosopher or moralist to go to any great depths in depicting or analyzing Henderson's needs. But the story he tells is so entertaining, his prose so satisfying, and his characters so engaging that I can easily overlook his analytical shortcomings."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Eugene Henderson is a very wealthy, middle aged pig farmer who believes that he has led a very uneventful and, by his own lights, wasted life. Henderson regrets that he has always been in the process of \\"becoming,\\" never arriving at a permanent state of \\"being.\\" To turn his life around, Henderson decides to travel to Africa without his younger, attractive second wife, Lily accompanying him. He hopes to quell his insatiable restlessness and his obsessive thoughts of \\"I want, I want.\\"The reader learns that Henderson is an arrogant, stubborn, and often foolish man, given to fits of rage and self-pity. He threatens to shoot a tenant's cat that is constantly going astray. While in Africa, Henderson's attempts to ameliorate a village's \\"frog problem\\" ends in disaster. He travels to another village where in a feat of strength he achieves a miracle and becomes the king's friend and right hand man. King Dahfu, who Henderson greatly admires, grants Henderson the special title of Sungo. Through King Dahfu's encouragement Henderson learns a great deal about himself and his untapped potential.If I had a problem with the book it was that I was never sure whether the king and especially the women around him were not poking fun at Henderson. He often appeared to be \\"Henderson the Clown\\" rather than \\"Henderson the Rain King.\\" The author had Henderson dress in a baffoonish-like costume, with a silly pith helmet on top of his head. What is certain is that the Eugene Henderson at the end of the book is a far different person than at the beginning."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"'I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be.' - A. EinsteinHenderson The Rain King certainly provides food for thought. Eugene Henderson's macho character was modeled after another famous E. H. This E. H. was a boozer, went to Africa and carried his macho weight around like a club as does Eugene Henderson, and at times, wanted to blow his brains out. As many people of the day went off to Africa - however, notes Henderson, 'man goes into the external world, and all he can do with it is to shoot it?' Eugene just wants to set the record straight, with himself, because he's grown too fat and feels disgusted, with everything.It's not that Eugene doesn't have everything, because he does. He's inherited a lot of money from his father's estate, he has a wonderful old family home where he raises pigs. He has a wife (second) and lots of children who he rarely bats an eye to. He also strives to play the violin, the same one his father played. He is also the only surviving sibling out of three and feels his father hated him because he was all that was left. Henderson is a blustering, miserable, drunken sod who yells and carries on - owing to the craving that he is constantly in want.Eugene Henderson decides finally that he has to go to Africa or die in bed. Those are his options. Africa is a wake up call as travel is to live and experience things that one is not accustomed to. He of coarse blunders his way around and is always searching for a foothold. He wants answers and he wants someone to see him for who and what he truly is. And he wants his life to have meaning and purpose. The second African tribe he settles in with (after botching the visit to the first tribe), he makes a good friend in King Dahfu. The king is also in transition trying to abolish some of the old, superstitous ways of his tribe as he is educated and does not rely on superstition alone as the tribe tends to-however, he walks a very fine line.I found this book to be full of little gems such as the allusion to Walt Whitman (Enough to merely be! Enough to breathe!) -\\"Being. Others were taken up with becoming. Being people have all the breaks. Becoming people are very unlucky, always in a tizzy. The Becoming people are always having to make explanations or offer justifications to the Being people. While Being people provoke these explanations...Enough, enough. Time to have become. Time to be. Burst the spirit's sleep...\\" I like this sort of thing.Eugene's character grows, he tries to get passed becoming and he realizes the importance of things he took for granted and he also comes to terms with the past and with his own imperfections as a human being. This is a funny book at times, but it wasn't hilarious to me because I realized that much of Eugene's blunders come from his good intentions and from pain itself, but of coarse much of it all is self inflicted and comes from an over inflated ego. At times, Eugene reminded me of Ignatius Reilly with his blowhard, blustery ways of blundering. But throughout the book, I liked him. He does have a good sense of humor.I really enjoyed this book, might not be for all, but if you enjoy a work that speaks for the ages, this is one. Saul Bellow seeks to answer the spirit's call and awaken the soul in the midst of mediocrity, boredom, and uncertainty in an age of material possesions and he does a fine job of it throughout his entire oeuvre. Any one of his books can turn into a soul searching adventure and he does have a magical, rhythmic way with words."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"From web sources I picked up some conflicting views on 'Henderson the Rain King'. One site says that it is thought to have been one of Bellow's own favorites. Another site indicates that a New York Times critic thought it was an interesting book that just didn't work. And the general impression I got was that it is one of the author's lesser works.I've just read it, and all I can say is please send more flawed novels such as this my way. I also perceived weaknesses in the novel, but have no hesitation in voting it 5 stars, for it is a richly suggestive and original tale that worked for me quite powerfully for most of it's pages.The biggest weakness was that the first 40 pages or so seemed quite unpromising. Henderson as he was presented in the early going seemed to be nothing more than a rude slob who indulged himself in obnoxious behavior at other people's expense. Even the first-person narration by Henderson didn't arouse any empathy. I was beginning to think this was one of those post-modern affairs which aim to show the pointlessness and emptiness of life.But the story really began to vividly come alive after Henderson decided to go to Africa on a vague quest, prompted by an inner voice which compulsively cried, \\"I want! I want!\\" It was an unexpected and delightful surprise to find how authentic was the impression Bellow created of Africa. Mentally I was seeing the shapes and colors and smelling the scent of the land as he described them. Whether or not this was an accurate description of the real Africa, it was a very piquant one. I also wondered whether this trip to Africa might symbolize Henderson's quest for self-revelation by contacting a more primitive and uninhibited source of meaning within his own subconscious.As the exotic depiction of Africa unfolded, it became gradually evident there was a deeper, metaphysical side to Henderson. He was certainly capable of expressing his conflicted inner life in terms much more culturally complex than \\"I want! I want!\\" References to biblical verses, Handel's Messiah, and Mozart's requiem(and probably more that I missed)come into play in his inner dialogues, along with a sometimes brutally self-deprecating humor.We come to know the real Henderson as a confused, tormented human being beset by painful feelings of guilt and inferiority, and seeking some undefined fulfillment. The fact that his impetuous nature leads him into droll and even hilarious predicaments does not negate the seriousness of the disaster of his life.In one of his paroxysms of impetuosity he is seized by the compulsion to lift a seemingly immovable statue of the cloud-goddess, Mummah, thus inadvertently becoming the rain-king,or Sungo, of an African tribe. He soon discovers a downside to this honor, as he is expected to remain a permanent resident.But a happy compensation for this incarceration with honors is that he becomes friends with the head of the tribe, King Dhafu, who in his own way, is as much a prisoner of the tribe as Henderson. This association between King Dhafu and Henderson was the heart of the book. Have you ever wished for a wise mentor who could teach you to see the real truth about yourself and the world? This is what Henderson found in Dhafu, and a caring friend, besides.Henderson loved Dhafu much as the disciples loved Jesus, but there was more than a little ambiguity about this messiah. There was just the tiniest chance that Dhafu was seriously insane. As a guru, he required of Henderson feats which seemed unthinkable to perform, all the while maintaining his wise, noble and caring demeanor.Henderson's disciple-ship to Dhafu touched on the fundamental metaphysical questions of the human condition. It ignited my imagination in many directions and suggested so strongly the possibility of a higher plane of existence, that while I was reading of their exploits, for a short time I felt a fervent conviction of this higher domain. A book that can lift me up like that is magical by my definition.This was a vastly entertaining book, which I found to be witty, complex, symbolic, sometimes tragic, and sometimes very funny. I think most writers who create such a multi-faceted work of fiction probably have a hard time making a neat ending, and accordingly, the ending of this book seemed a trifle weak and ambiguous to me. However, it's merits greatly outweigh any flaws. This was the first novel of Bellow's I've read, and I now have great expectations for 'Herzog' and the rest."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Henderson is brutally honest with himself throughout the narrative. He is unable to convince himself that he is worthy to be a human bieng. Distance, time and home bring this book into a personal perspective that is applicable to most adventurous males. The ideas about life and purpose, however, touch everyone right in the unknown area barely reached by most humans. Nothing bad can be said about Bellow here, he is in true form. The prose will keep you up all night"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Uninteresting...written haphazzardly with an annoying, rambling style. Main character is completely unlikeable and the story is told from his whining, pathetic perspective. I found nothing humorous in the book."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"There's one aspect of this book that I found delightful: Bellow apparently did zero research -- ZERO! -- before setting his novel in Africa. He didn't bother to find out the names of tribes, languages, features of the geography, etc., before sitting down to write. Not that this is a fantastic Africa; it's just that it's an Africa as Saul Bellow thought it could have been.I found this to be a wonderful and inspiring approach. I find it a bit sad that our age is so caught up with historical accuracy. The pressure to provide it can frequently stifle an artist's creativity.So Bellow here is unapologetically a novelist, not a cultural anthropologist, almost in a passive-agressive way.However, I didn't think there was much else of interest to the book."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This is such an entertaining novel. Henderson is a colorful and honest narrator and his story becomes surprising real to the reader. It has been over a week since I finished Henderson the Rain King and it is still vivid in my memory.

Henderson is a very flawed man, but is touching in his struggles.This book is a brilliant reminder of the powers of friendship."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Not a recent novel certainly, but just as rich and compelling a tale as it was when it was originally published. This is a real leap-of-faith book - a classic suspension of disbelief. But once you have made that leap, the beautiful, hypnotic writing will pull you into the tale of a very human man confronting all the forces of the human world including power, belief, attachment, identity, growth and a larger-than-one man's-life view of existence.

It is the story of Henderson, a rich, upper middle-aged man, married for the second time (or third-i can't remember) and with kids, who decides he needs to go to Africa. He adventures through the desert with a loyal and patient african escort, Ramilayu, who translates for him and acts as a voice of reason, though henderson seldom listens. henderson finally comes across a tribe he can really love, only to discover they are not quite what he believed. a charming and extremely funny book-the ending stays with you (or with me, anyway) and gives you hope. you will want to read it again! buy this book!"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Had this book been written by someone less well-regarded than Saul Bellow, I would have said that it was pretty good, enjoyable and ambitious if occasionally flat-footed. But, knowing Bellow's reputation, I was disappointed by it.I had expected something subtle and finely crafted. Instead I found the character of Henderson uninteresting and underdeveloped --- Bellow asserts Henderson's need for something more in life rather stridently but never really shows it; the prose very good but nothing to write home about; and the novel's treatment of its theme pedestrian. And for reasons I can't quite put my finger on, I felt the novel to be dated --- very much a book of 40 years ago and not one that can speak clearly to today's readers.I haven't read anything else by Bellow. I'm still curious about what Herzog and the Adventures of Augie March are like; that is, I'm still curious about the basis of Bellow's reputation. But after Henderson the Rain King I'm not enthusiastic about investing time in them."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Henderson is a &quot;noble&quot; by birth in that he's rich, but he lives like a pig and with pigs and going to africa brings out his virtues in the most ugly ways to exalt him to the highest pinnacle of his abilities. The experience which wakes his sleeping soul, allows him to return to the west a new man with new ambitions. In the meantime, the book can be quite silly, but Henderson is an interesting character, something like a Gulliver or Oddysseus (more like Leopold Bloom, though). He's adventurous to a strong pain. Bellow is a great writer at times his prose just turns the most silly situations into interesting points of reflection. I like the way the book is not about symbolism or metaphor unless it is overt and almost mocking. Occasionally the book gets tedious. Although I liked the book, I don't know where it got it's classic status. It doesn't seem to be anything groundbreaking, just a humourous, well-written novel."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"The best book I have read in years!!"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Although I did not loathe this book, neither did I love it. The prose is fair, even brilliant at times, but the main character is ...well, a jerk. It is very hard to watch a jerk go through what is supposed to be a spiritual awakening, when, in the end, he just seems like... a sentimental jerk.There is alot of talk from Bellows about Henderson's capacity for deep feelings: great joy, great sorrow...a capacity in his soul for greatness. But where is it? True, we can't get into Henderson's mind, but Henderson seems more a sentimental fool than a lost romantic...sort of a strange mixture of King Lear and his fool. The intriguing people in the book and the secondary characters who surround Henderson. Henderson himself is capricious, overbearing, and well...stupid. I'm hesitant to read more of Bellow's books after this one. Great ideas...slightly pathetic execution."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Not only does Eugene Henderson's journey of discovery touch and teach the reader, but he is an unbelievable buffoon. This is one of the funniest books -- period. Bellow makes Henderson so self-centered, he can't be bothered by details... such as which of his children are in the custody of his ex-wife. She's got one of them, well fine, she can have it, God bless the both of them (or something like that)! Really, Henderson is capable of something great (including great suffering) because he's human, only honest -- plus a few pounds and nose-size. The Counting Crows' _August and Everything After_ includes songs based on this book."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Six-foot-four, 230-pound Eugene Henderson is anything but a pleasant fellow, as he makes clear early in Bellow's vigorous 1958 novel. Henderson is the millionaire scion of a long line of prominent Americans, including a US Secretary of State, but he's also a ne'er do well alcoholic bully who raises pigs on his family's estate just to tell the neighbors (and the world at large) what he thinks of them. He is no one that you'd want to meet, and he knows it. He is also a seeker: all his life tormented by an inner voice crying \\"I want, I want\\" that his money, his women, his pigs, even surviving stepping on a land mine in WWII can't fulfill. Because he is tormented, he torments others. A trip into the least mapped areas of central Africa, he hopes, will offer him something worth living for, something to overcome his death wish.If you are put off by Henderson's unlikableness early on, or if you tend to have no sympathy with the problems of wealthy characters (even if they are physically strong, don't shirk manual labor and never lose a bar fight) you could miss something special in this novel of a 50-year-old's adolescent yearning. Henderson's journey is a bare-knuckled crawl from \\"becoming\\" to \\"being.\\" \\"Being people have all the breaks,\\" notes Henderson, and becomers are \\"always in a tizzy.\\" Most of literature concerns itself with the balance between these themes, and Bellow adds an original voice to the mix in Henderson, a becomer if there ever was one. The native tribes have their good souls and bad souls, just like every society; Henderson is fortunate to meet more of the former. While his bull-in-china-shop manner continues to cause him trouble, he at least desires to expand his capacity to learn new tricks at a relatively old age. And isn't it learning that keeps us living?\\"Henderson the Rain King\\" marks my first encounter with Saul Bellow, but certainly not my last. He writes fearlessly and vividly, the reader feels the heat of Africa, smells the lions, tastes the slimy water with Henderson, and grows up a little with him, too, even as he grows up a lot."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I love this book although I always have trouble finishing it. The older I get, and I am still quite young, the more I find my life parallels the plot of the book. The language usage is amazing and roughly poetic. I am most impressed though, with Henderson himself, because he seems strangely more real then anyone I've met. I believe this is the most curious book to read but perhaps not of interest to readers not so curious themselves."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This is an interesting piece of expatriate literature. The &quot;Lost Generation&quot;--represented by the likes of Hemingway and Fitzgerald--churned out a host of literature that dealt with an America that was recovering from two world wars, and that was just beginning to realize its significance as a world power. This book belongs to the next generation of Americans, one who may not be able to find all of the answers in America but who nevertheless has a sense of national identity. It is a tale of a man named Henderson, an eccentric American millionaire who realizes he is searching for something and has to go to Africa to find it. Henderson, a man who never seems to do anything right, finds himself on the African continent, and learns enough about life to give him the direction he needs.This book is very entertaining. Bellow's prose is intriguing and his dialogue interesting. At times, this book is so absurd it is downright funny, and Henderson is the perfect sort of unlikely and hapless hero that most of us can relate to. All in all, this is a great book for anyone interested in twentieth-century literature, particularly expatriate literature."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I read this book at 13 for pleasure. I was enthralled from day one and have loved reading the 19 years since.

Dealing with the darkest deepest sort of journey into the interior -- the journey to face oneself -- the book manages to reverberate with too much truth, forcing the reader to find their own reconciliation of the persistent 'I want I want I want'. If you don't find a large chunk of yourself in the tormented and touchingly credulous Eugene Henderson, you're not be entirely honest. A valuable novel moving the reader that much closer to a true look at what we're really made of."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"For those who want to get into the work of Saul Bellow, this is perhaps one of his most accessible novels. It's about a rich and eccentric man who travels to Africa and encounters a tribal chief who own lions. The tribal chief is brilliant and teaches Henderson some valuable lessons. The encounters with the lion were real and vivid and moving. Henderson is vintage Bellow and is relatively easy to read: it has less of a scholarly bent than several of Bellow's other novels like Ravelstein, Herzog and Humboldt's Gift, all of which take the reader into a very high intellectual plane. This novel is existential: it's Bellow not so much him versus the intellectual premises of ancient scholars but is rather Bellow versus the raw power of the forces of life itself. I admire greatly this literary work which displays all of Bellow's virtuosity with the power that the reality of his experience brings into this story. I highly recommend this novel for anyone wanting to gain access into Bellow without having first to take a course in the philosophy of ancient scholars. This is Bellow at his most accessible and most powerful. I strongly encourage you to savor this great and highly original novel."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"One of my personal favorites. An inspiring novel that will strike a chord in the heart of anyone who has felt in need of something greater in their lives than themselves, Henderson the Rain King is a hectic journey of one man through not only the world, but life and, perhaps most importantly, his own soul. Henderson is constantly in a process of becoming in his own mind, and in his fervor to try and metamorphasize into a type of finished being, he fails to notice that through his evolution he is achieving his goal of simply existing. He is lovably egocentric; existing as the sun of his own universe while striving to gain an orbit of his own. He uses his wives to try to fill some empty spot in his existance, professing over and over again his love for his current wife, with little notice or mention of any real depth or desire that she may possess, speaking only of her beauty and creating a view of the female gender that smacks of Hemingway. Henderson's deficiency is one of the soul, and enlightenment is the only path which will bring him peace. He possesses a jaded love of life, in so much as he has experienced enough horror in the world that he cannot look upon it in wide-eyed wonder, but is struck profoundly by the sights and moments in life which are filled with rough hewn and genuine beauty which do inspire in him a sense of awe. It is these moments and spaces of depth within his soul which make his dark optimism for life so endearing. He is, as he himself says, a creature constantly becoming, yet it is through this constant evolution that he reaches his goal, finds peace, and fulfills the &quot;I want&quot;s. He is a man not of thought but of action, and it is only from within himself that he may realize that it is only through perpetual becoming that Henderson the Rain King may exist"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Gene Henderson, a 50-something millionaire living in 1950s America, decides to take a trip to Africa to try to quiet the voice inside him that keeps saying, \\"I want, I want.\\" Since Henderson already has everything material he could want, he can't find any way to satisfy that voice, and as he has already tried several other things prior to his African trip, he doesn't hold out much hope. But it becomes a very strange trip - for only in a very strange place could he find what he actually needs.I can't read Bellow's mind, of course, but as I read his book, Henderson represents America - huge, crude, often well-meaning but sometimes causing unintentional destruction. Bellow's imaginary Africa would then be the entire developing world - or even the whole world outside America. It's hard to like Henderson at first; even his own first-person narration casts him in a bad light despite his high opinion of himself. As his attempts to help the people in the first tribe he meets end in catastrophe, he definitely seems to represent the American ignorance and arrogance that led to so many disastrous overseas projects in the 1950s and 1960s. Subdued by his first failure, Henderson allows himself to learn from the second tribe, and although he ultimately barely escapes with his life, he comes away with the inner peace he had sought, with a new wisdom, and with a determination to become a healer. The message seems pretty obvious - a call for a wiser America dedicating itself to higher goals.An alternative way to read it makes Henderson representative of anyone who no longer has to work for a living and who searches for something to give life meaning. This should resonate with any young dot com millionaire as much as with any healthy retired person. In that interpretation, Henderson learns that just because you don't have to work doesn't mean that you shouldn't work and that to be ennobling, work must be helpful to someone else - not all activity suffices - and not meant to glorify yourself either.Either way, the book reads smoothly and moves along briskly. Read it long enough to get past your initial dislike of Henderson, and it will reward your efforts."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This is the BEST book I've read in ages. I found it so thoroughly engaging, I couldn't put it down! Eugene Henderson, a great (often) drunken oaf of a man--rich, somewhat crass, a man who does not suffer fools gladly and makes life for his wives and children difficult--chafes at the restraints of a sophisticated, civilized existence in New York and makes his way into Africa. Once there, all his innate qualities--sheer strength, his instincts, rashness,while drawbacks in an artificial social world--serve him well in the natural world. He encounters princes, kings and hired guides, who he treats with equal respect. Africa gives him an arena to test himself, quench his thirst for an answer to the internal (and for him, eternal) question that eludes him throughout his life: I want, I want, I want. Through his journey, he finds out what he really wants to do with the rest of his life and comes out of this adventure with a greater sense of who he really is. Saul Bellow makes Henderson and his experiences so real, the reader feels as though he or she is there, seeing it all through Henderson's eyes.

The irony of the title alone struck me as synonymous with T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock&quot;; and on some level, there is a similarity. Both men desire to want, both feel they are inept in the world, and both hold a fascination with the depths of the ocean. But what makes &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; stand on its own is the sheer joy with which you are taken onto his journey. Henderson is ludicrous, yet enchanting. His reality is depicted through the inner workings of his mind when faced with the despair and lack of meaning in his world. (We clearly perceive that world to be far more fascinating than he does.) But through his bold attempt at answering the &quot;I want...&quot;, he sets off to Africa, and through his stays with two tribes, he experiences a series of disasters, which are as hysterical as they are tragic. His bond with the king of the Wariri tribe, Dahfu, is a particularly poignant exploration into the nature of identity, and the power of losing one's self in order to find one's true nature. Henderson flies through the air at the novel's end, gazing down at his depths in the form of the ocean, upon returning from Africa. Once he's landed,we witness him &quot;leaping, leaping, pounding and tingling&quot;, and we sense that he's finally learned how to be a lion; how to transcend the &quot;I want&quot;; how to become. He's finally internalized the lost idea that &quot;The forgiveness of sins is perpetual and righteousness first is not required.&quot;"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"In this book, Saul Bellow creates one of the most colorful and interesting characters in American Literature.

Mainly because I had nothing else to do, I decided to familiarize myself with all the books on the list that I had not read or attempted to read. Henderson The Rain King checked in at #21.Now I certainly know Saul Bellow by his reputation, but I can't say that I am all that familiar with his other work. He's always been a bit too wordy for me to really get into his stories. Since this was the only one of his novels to crack the top 100, I thought maybe there was some additional merit to this one that I was not aware of and so I picked up a copy.I'm not suggesting by any means that it is a bad thing to be overly descriptive. In fact, one of the great things about this book is that we come to know Henderson as an extremely real person by the various acts he performs and by the first-person narration. He is a living, breathing person by the time the main thrust of the story begins, but unfortunately we've already expended so much of ourselves investing in this character that when the introduction is over, we're left with 75% of the book remaining and nowhere left to really go.Bellow tries to compensate for this by weaving an exotic tale about Africa and the people who inhabit some of the more unspoiled regions of it, but the story turns on what is basically a midlife crisis and I thought, so what? Maybe I'm too young to fully appreciate that aspect of the story, and Bellow does come up with an interesting ways for his character to deal with the onset of age, but I couldn't help thinking about how this would be much better served if it was clearer exactly what Henderson is after. Don't get me wrong, there are innumerable passages about his search for...something. But since he isn't sure what it is, neither are we. There's a general idea, but nothing specific.The story does wind up with some intriguing plot devices that hold the imagination, but really nothing so earth-moving that it causes us to take stock of ourselves. I almost got the sense that this was supposed to be a kind of snipe at the Hemingway tough guy image by having a main character who is, by all accounts and actions, a tough guy who shows an introspective side.The ending just sort of happens, in that the narrative comes to its conclusion without resolving a key part of the story. I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that the whole impetus for the plot's big leap forward doesn't get any time in terms of how Henderson responds to his pre-crisis world.On the plus side, there are some great lyrical passages and there's no doubt that Bellow has a command of the language that few have. If you can avoid being intimidated by his reputation, I think you have a decent chance of enjoying this book."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Its strange what leads us to read books.

Is that helpful to you? I doubt it, but a good book it is and that can't be a bad thing.."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This book is both profoundly meaningful and intensely funny - a rare combination in literature. The character of Henderson is big, loud, jovial, and full of passion. He performs a constant high-wire act, tiptoeing between extremely loveable and just plain annoying, and always manages to fall in the direction of the former. He is educated and experienced in life, but at the same time ignorant and nave in many ways as well. He is a lover of adventure and challenge and yet has managed to coast through most of his life until he comes face to face with his African adventure. It is the dueling forces at work inside him that make him such a fascinating character.Saul Bellow creates a highly entertaining, though also highly stereotypical, African world as the setting for Henderson's life awakening. At times I felt guilty for laughing at the way he characterizes the African tribes, with their silly superstitions and bizarre traditions. In a way it seemed a bit racist, but in the end I concluded that Bellow was simply exaggerating the Western stereotypes of black Africa, so really he was poking fun at us, not at them. I found the dialog between Henderson and King Dahfu superbly written. The educated, intellectual voice of Dahfu gradually became more and more natural, but was a constant reminder of the preconceived notions that most white people have about other races.So what was this book about? I think it was about the human urge to explore both the far edges of the earth and the far edges of the human spirit. Henderson seeks adventure, but he also seeks to find something within himself, something that he knows is there but that he can't find at home. He challenges himself, and through this challenge he grows as a person. And it is because of this growth that he is able to return to where he began, and truly appreciate that place.I think there is also a strong message about the commonalities that exist between all humans, regardless of where they come from. Henderson travels thousands of miles to places where white men have never gone before, and yet he finds there a king to whom he can relate quite easily. Though this is a highly fictionalized account, there is a good bit of truth to the underlying message."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Not allow me to clarify: This is the fifth book I have read by Mr. Bellow,following his career in some twisted, obsessively patterned quest to read his published work in order of publication. Luckily, this is his fifth book. Each novel, from Dangling Man up here to Henderson, are great. It is difficult being so blunt in praise, being unable to relate the details and intricacies of this varying character study. It is a funny, exciting adventure story of the profound, philosophical type. It details the bumbling, absurd adventures of a man nearly unable to care for himself, and using an crazy sense of logic to piece the shattered aspects of his life together.Saul Bellow, at least from the start of his career, was a consistant and far-reaching genius who studied human nature to a pinnicle extent, understanding much and offering interesting ideas in answer to the questions he raises."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"\\"wow! great book. it started really slow and i nearly gave up, but it ended with touching style and a great big dose of the bizarre. in the end, i think it finds redemption, or at least hope. wow...\\""},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I was diappointed that this audio book would not work inside my car DVD player.I had to play it on my computer.

However, it was thought provoking, and very intense. (if it can be intense and drawn out at the same time) It is true that dialogue is so simple it is unbelievable. But word usage and sentance structure were also simple. I think Bellow did this on purpose to draw attention to the big picture, instead of eloquently written individual thoughts. I recomend it if you have time to be patient with it."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"What was Bellows seeking in this novel? As his character Henderson seeks to find fulfillment on any level in his life, Bellows left me feeling the same about this read.Eugene Henderson is basiclly a wealthy looser. Born within a family of acheivers, he breaks the tradition. With a silver spoon in his mouth, he comes off as the lazy unconcerned with anything type. He fails through college, marriage, and life. With an internal voice that keeps telling him to seek, but he has no idea what he's seeking for. The only goal that's ever come to him was the desire to become a doctor, and when he's presented with the books, which should have sparked passion and inspiration, he finds himself overwhelmed and unable to comprehend as well as commit. He sets out in search of ... well, Bellows never truly reveals this to us.Henderson, after seeing an old childhood friend, decides to take off to Africa with he and his new bride. He grows tired with boredom after a few weeks with them, and hires one of the men from the team to take him deep into the unknown bush. Where he comes upon a small tribe that is dealing with drought problems. Their animals are dying, and Henderson wonders if this was his calling, to help these people. But with little thought, he concocts a plan that leaves these people worse off than when he arrived. As usual, his blunder causes him to bail out in the middle of the night leaving these people in despair. He travels until he comes to a second tribe, who at this time are preparing for a festival to create rain. Unbeknownst to Henderson, he's going to be set up to become the next rain king. Which indeed he does become, and discovers that it means only that he will fall to his own death eventually due to the title. The story ends with Hendersons escape, along with a lion cub, making his way back home.Bellows writes with good detail, thought provoking conversation and happenings, and a bit of humor, but never answers the question that is posed throughout this book. I was disappointed in my first read of Bellows work. It seems he lost track of the quest somewhere along the way. A major flaw in my opinion."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Yes, there is always something compelling about the intersection between modern man and the mystery of the exotic/primitive, but Bellow does a great job covering it up with a contrived plot and an unlikeable character. The force of Mr. Henderson's personality -- which features most prominently his awareness of the force of his own personality -- obscurces any genuine rumination on the clash of cultures or the process of self-discovery that purport to be the novel's underlying themes. Henderson is swaddled in stiltled, pretentious dialog, and he shares company with charicatures of native African tribespeople. Worst of all, Henderson is forced by his author to cope with lame allegories (a botched explosion of irritating frogs haunts Hendreson above all else), and he appears as a fool with no underlying moral to share. Characters do not, of course, need to be pleasant to be worth reading about, but neither Henderson nor his adventures offer any clear redeeming qualities -- he is just a collection of unexplained ideosyncracies and sarcastic remarks that are at once self-depricating and self-aggrandizing. Finally, Bellow's prose rarely rises above servicable, an unforgivable fault even if it is a first-person narrative."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I read this book with an open mind as it has been suggested by many to be worthy.

Can I get a refund?"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I really didn't like this book. It's very long and wordy, and it describes things of no importants. Henderson goes off in long stories that mean nothing, and then expects people to remember what he was talking about in the first place. I guess if you like books that have first person narratives and long stories, you'd like it. But if you want action and suspense, this is NOT the book for you."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Basically, the book is a contradiction of itself. It is padded by lengths and lengths of discussions on the meaning of life, yet never comes to a conclusion. Unless you view Henderson's dancing in an arctic wasteland as his recognition of simplicity as the cure-all. If simplicity is indeed the way to go, why all the time-wasting and fluff? The first sentence asks \\"why did i go to africa?\\" Henderson spends four chapters pondering how best to answer that question, and yet never answers it completely.I don't know how to put it other than to say that the book didn't intrigue me. In fact, i was bored out of my mind, to say the least. Sadly, I was assigned to write a research paper on Bellow's philosophy. At the moment, I am struggling over the evidence for my central claim, trying to make relevant that which clearly has no relevance in my mind.Bellow is a great writer, don't misunderstand me.

Saul Bellow is a Southern American writer who writes a novel which sweeps across the continent of Africa with a main black character who remains a man-servant throughout. A strong-willed white rich American and an African tribesman who carries his water and is somewhat mystical, may be a mysterious tribe's answer to their religious belief in a 'rain king'. In travelling to Africa to create a black right hand man during civil rights era 1950s, Bellow may have written a bigoted book of epic proportions. The story, which veers little farther than what you get when you have an aboriginal African tribe expecting a 'rain king', becomes riveting in a one-dimensional action-like way and the last handfull of pages are masterful strokes of writing which hopefully depict the weakness of racism."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"The first page of this Penguin edition states that Saul Bellow won three National Book Awards and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976. Bellow, the author of thirteen books and numerous articles, also won the National Book Award Foundation Medal in 1990. This book, \\"Henderson the Rain King,\\" written in 1958, made the list of the top 100 fiction novels of the 20th century. Some of his other works include \\"Seize the Day,\\" \\"Herzog,\\" \\"Ravelstein,\\" and \\"The Adventures of Augie March.\\"Why \\"Henderson the Rain King\\" made that top 100 list, I'll never know. I like classic literature and I have read a large number of classic works over the last several months, but \\"Henderson the Rain King\\" falls at the bottom of the list. Maybe I am not used to Saul Bellow's prose style, or the way he thinks, but I just don't like this book. Turning a page in this book felt like moving a mountain. I groaned and fretted my way through every nightmarish paragraph, every miserable word. When I start a book, I want to finish that book, no matter what. Every minute I held this book in my hands I wanted to stop reading it. Believe me, this albatross is one heavy bugger.\\"Henderson the Rain King\\" tells the story of Eugene Henderson, scion of a wealthy American family. His father wrote French history and his grandfather served as a Secretary of State. Gene doesn't quite live up to expectations, however. Frankly, he's a cad and a colossal idiot. He's an alcoholic, ignores his kids, starts fights with authority figures, and is working on his second marriage. His idea of a good time is raising pigs on the family estate and shooting bottles with a slingshot. Eugene's life is slowly falling apart when one day he decides to go with a friend and his new bride to Africa. Henderson bails out on them with a guide named Romilayu, and sets off for the desolate interior of Africa. Henderson first hooks up with the Arnewi tribe where he feels impelled to help them clear a pond of some troublesome frogs. The second tribe Eugene encounters is the Wariri. Henderson befriends the king of the tribe and becomes the \\"Rain King\\" when he lifts a statue no one else can move. His friendship with the king helps Henderson come to terms with his rampant insecurities until the twist ending reveals that Henderson might be in over his head.Along the way we get an awful lot of navel gazing from Henderson, and some gobbledygook science from the king of the Wariri. Even the twist ending, which did help speed up the plodding pace of the book, can't save this novel from the clutches of banality. The back cover of the book says this novel is a comedy full of \\"rollicking prose, offbeat inventiveness, and impulsive creation.\\" In other words, the publishers don't understand this mess anymore than you will (impulsive creation is a code word for \\"huh?\\"). Sure, the prose occasionally rises to the level of a classic, but most of the time it is pretty plain. As for the comedy aspect, I'll grant that some of Henderson's blathering can be amusing, especially when he reveals himself to be a liar and hypocrite within the space of a few pages. But if you are expecting to bust a gut over this book, you can just forget it.If I were forced to give an answer as to why this book made that infernal list, I would say that this is the classic liberal/leftist novel that makes so many people feel warm and fuzzy inside. A rich, unhappy jerk abandons America and goes to primitive Africa in order to learn life lessons. When Henderson tries to help the Arnewi with the frogs, his Western learning causes more trouble than it is worth. Only when he relies on brute strength and turns his life over to a primitive does he learn his lesson. Yawn.Save yourself the pain and avoid this book. If you do have to read it for some reason or another, at least take comfort in the fact that it is only 341 pages long. Occasionally, some good prose and some nice set pieces will help propel you along, but not nearly fast enough. Maybe some of Bellow's other novels are better, and if they are, I'd like to know. Maybe I would read another one of his books, but I sure don't want to if it resembles \\"Henderson the Rain King\\" in any way, shape, or form. The best thing about this book is the cover."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"The wealthy Eugene Henderson carries immense emotional pain, which makes him a difficult and childish man. To cope with this pain, Henderson flees his life in Connecticut and travels to Africa, where he hopes to experience a new emotional dynamic, liberating him from his craziness and torment. In Africa, Henderson associates with two remote tribes, each headed by a chief who Henderson finds wise and charismatic. From each, Henderson receives fatherly validation; each views him as a person with pain but also remarkable vitality. Meanwhile, Henderson finds in their tribal rituals and ceremonies a turbulent energy and purpose that resonates with his own emotional world. By inhabiting this tribal world and coping with its challenges, Henderson gradually addresses his own problems and gets better. Surely, HENDERSON THE RAIN KING is among the strangest novels about emotional growth that I have ever read.My favorite Saul Bellow novels feature slightly passive mid-life males that inhabit difficult family situations but have wry views of their plights. Moses Herzog, Charlie Citrine, and even Tommy Wilhelm all exhibit a self-aware detachment, which enables them to make funny observations about their bad judgment and how it has wrecked their lives. Eugene Henderson, in contrast, is without humor. Instead, he usually sounds like a ranting child with no insight. Further, he invests men in authority with brilliance that they actually never demonstrate in the story. Loud, complaining, grabbing, lurching... this Eugene Henderson is not an easy character to enjoy. Oddly but highly ambitious, Henderson is also Bellow's contribution to bipolar literature, where he joins other characters, such as the unnamed protagonist inHunger: A Novelor Arturo Bandini inAsk the Dust (P.S.), who are as aggravating as they are interesting.HENDERSON THE RAIN KING is ranked 21st on the Modern Library's list of the 100 Best Novels of the twentieth century.

I found it so thoroughly engaging, I couldn't put it down! Eugene Henderson, a great (often) drunken oaf of a man--rich, somewhat crass, a man who does not suffer fools gladly and makes life for his wives and children difficult--chafes at the restraints of a sophisticated, civilized existence in New York and makes his way into Africa. Once there, all his innate qualities--sheer strength, his instincts, rashness,while drawbacks in an artifical social world--serve him well in the natural world. He encounters princes, kings and hired guides, who he treats with equal respect. Africa gives him an arena to test himself, quench his thirst for an answer to the internal (and for him, eternal) question that eludes him throughout his life: I want, I want, I want. Through his journey, he finds out what he really wants to do with the rest of his life and comes out of this adventure with a greater sense of who he really is. Saul Bellow makes Henderson and his experiences so real, the reader feels as though he or she is there, seeing it all through Henderson's eyes. I think this book is a gem, a completely entertaining read."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Gene Henderson, a 50-something millionaire living in 1950s America, decides to take a trip to Africa to try to quiet the voice inside him that keeps saying \\"I want, I want.\\" Since Henderson already has everything material he could want, he can't find any way to satisfy that voice, and he has already tried several other things prior to his African trip. I'm not sure what Bellow intended, but as I read it, Henderson represents America - huge, crude, often well-meaning but causing destruction nevertheless. Bellow's imaginary Africa would then be the entire developing world - or even the whole world outside America. It's hard to like Henderson at first; even his own first-person narration casts him in a bad light. As his attempts to help the people in the first tribe he meets end in catastrophe, he seems to represent the American ignorance and arrogance that led to so many disastrous overseas projects in the 1950s and 1960s. Subdued by his first failure, Henderson allows himself to learn from the second tribe, and although he ultimately barely escapes with his life, he comes away with the inner peace he had sought, with a new wisdom, and with a determination to become a healer. The message seems pretty obvious.An alternative way to read it makes Henderson representative of anyone who no longer has to work for a living and who searches for something to give life meaning. This should resonate with any young dot com millionaire as much as with any healthy retired person. Either way, the book reads smoothly and moves along briskly. Read it long enough to get past your initial dislike of Henderson, and it will reward your efforts."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"A few days ago I finished reading Saul Bellow's Henderson the Rain King, which was a great and entertaining read. The basic premise is comedic: a grumpy, spoiled, acerbic, rich American in his 50's seeks to discover meaning and wisdom and fulfillment by leaving New York and traveling to Africa to live and commune with a primitive African tribe. If this induces at least a subtle chuckle, then it is safe to say that you'd be laughing frequently through this hilarious and sometimes ribald romp. Not enough? Then consider that it has been named as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century by the well-respected Modern Library.Henderson is an independently wealthy man in his 50's who is unhappily married to his second wife, and when he gets to the point where he can stand his meager existence no longer and the trivial aimlessness of it all, he hires a guide to take him to the remote, African sahara, to the most primitive tribe they can find. They first end up with the Arnewi tribe, where Henderson becomes obsessed with the tribe's superstitious obsession with the frogs in the cistern, which keeps them from watering their cattle, and so in his attempt to rid them of this malady he ends up blowing up the whole thing while fending off the advances of a large women who is considered a beauty due to her &quot;bittahness.&quot; After destroying the cistern, Henderson and his guide escape and try again with the Wariri tribe where he impresses the natives with his unparalleled feats of strength (Festivus, anyone?), which then propels him unwittingly into the position of sungo (rain king) when rain immediately follows. There he befriends the king of the tribe, Dahfu, and the tale of Henderson carries us on a humorous journey where we come face to face with lions, tall amazonian women, and scheming uncles.Henderson is an interesting counter figure to someone like, say, Roth's Swede Levov (American Pastoral), where both men have a privileged adulthood but yet both are incapable of settling down into it. Levov gets tragically ripped away while Henderson is comically tied to it even in the far reaches of Africa. Henderson's pretentiousness and bombastic response to everything (his attempt to kill his little house cat still makes me laugh) makes him the perfect target for Dahfu's psychological experiment, for even in his gregariousness, Henderson's goal is to existentially discover the importance of being an intricate, vital element of some grand venture, which Dahfu supplies.One might fall into the temptation of reading this book as a generic critique of the dangers of &quot;civilization&quot; within a sort of Rousseauian framework, although the &quot;savages&quot; in Bellow's book are something less than entirely &quot;noble.&quot; Nevertheless, I decline to read it this way, for I think the book speaks to psychology, to the inner man, to the aspirations and &quot;life-force&quot; in a discontented soul, rather than to politics or history or the delimitating ways in which cultural norms interact with those on other continents. Or, one could just sit back and have a grand old time laughing at Henderson, and the fact that he laughs at himself, even in his gargantuan seriousness, makes us love him all the more. He's like that grouchy, eccentric grandfather we can't help but love, even in his most obnoxious cantankerousness.The bottom line, though, is that this book is terribly funny and clever, and Bellow has a way of avoiding the negative qualities of stream-of-consciousness prose while at the same time distilling from it its funnier aspects. This was the first Saul Bellow book that I had ever read, but immediately afterwards I put several more on my reading list."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"The title character of Saul Bellow's &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; is one of the most remarkable personalities in modern literature. Most first-person narrators just kind of lay on the page, passively hoping the reader will sympathize with or care about them; but Eugene Henderson is a three-dimensional creation, arrogant, energetic, restless, engaging the reader with his lively banter and gleeful impudence.55-year-old Henderson is a millionaire by inheritance, aimlessly sleepwalking through life, married to a ditzy wife, and channeling ancestral spirits by playing his dead father's violin. Needing a vacation from his family and his dreary normal existence, and feeling that &quot;...it's the destiny of [his] generation of Americans to go out in the world and try to find the wisdom of life,&quot; he travels to Africa and impulsively decides to go off into the wild.A hired guide named Romilayu leads him to two remote villages. The first is inhabited by a tribe called the Arnewi. He observes with delight that the Arnewi village must be older than the city of Ur -- this is what he was looking for, the cradle of civilization, unblemished by the advances of modern society. Here he finds the natives in a crisis: their precious cattle are dying of thirst because the water in the village cistern is undrinkable. On his own initiative, he tries to solve their problem; but his plan fails disastrously, and he and Romilayu leave the village in shame.They go to a second village, inhabited by a larger tribe called the Wariri, ruled by a king named Dahfu. The Wariri are suffering from a drought and go through elaborate rituals in order to conjure rain. When Henderson unexpectedly helps them bring a deluge, Dahfu proclaims him the &quot;Rain King&quot; and the two become close, almost brotherly, friends. Henderson learns that Dahfu cannot have complete sovereignty over the tribe until he captures the lion containing the soul of his dead father, the former king, and Dahfu asks Henderson to help him in the hunt. But human corruption knows no geographical boundaries, and Henderson and Romilayu soon find themselves in a dangerous situation from which it will require all their physical and mental capacities to save themselves.More refined and terser than &quot;The Adventures of Augie March,&quot; &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; offers a wonderfully balanced mixture of philosophy, suspense, and humor. While Augie wandered through life looking for a purpose, a goal, Henderson seems to find his, affirming it through his own adventures and taking the reader along for the exhilarating ride. You'll be cheering for the guy, not because he's the hero, but because he's more human than most of the people you know."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Saul Bellow seems to me to be one of those writers who is only fully appreciated by readers who have reached a certain age and thus have a certain amount of life experience under their belts. Before &quot;Henderson the Rain King,&quot; the only other Bellow I'd read was &quot;Seize the Day,&quot; and I read that one in high school. The two books are similar in that they both have middle-aged male protagonists who are at some point of crisis in their lives. &quot;Seize the Day&quot; was completely lost on me, but I wonder if I read it now whether I might find more meaning in it.I've still got a ways to go before I become middle-aged myself, but nevertheless, there's a lot I related to in the character of Eugene Henderson. Affluent, arrogant and pig-headed, Henderson seems like the kind of man who should want for nothing, since he's rich enough to buy what he doesn't have and aggressive enough to bully his way into getting anything he can't buy. But he still finds himself haunted by an internal voice that chants &quot;I want, I want,&quot; and because he doesn't know himself what it is that he wants, he takes an impulsive trip to Africa to see if he can find it in the desert wilds.&quot;Henderson&quot; the novel is actually very funny, and Henderson the character is himself quite charming. Bellow is careful to only fill you in on Henderson's belligerent (and sometimes abusive) behavior as something that has happened in the past. The Henderson we come to know over the course of the novel is one who is open and respectful to new cultures and is eager to learn that which can only be taught by others. He strikes up a close friendship with Dahfu, King of the Wairiri, an African tribe, and it's their relationship--and primarily what Henderson learns about himself from Dahfu--that comprises the majority of the novel's plot.&quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; should appeal to anyone with politically left leanings and especially those who are frustrated by the materialist obsessions that plagues our culture. As others have said before this, the plot is actually quite simple, and one drawback to the book is that its story does not warrant its length. I didn't find Bellow's prose dense as some others have, but you do have to exhibit some patience with him as a writer, as he's prone to tangents and ruminative wanderings.All in all, however, this was a very enjoyable book and led me to believe that I might enjoy Saul Bellow after all."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"HENDERSON THE RAIN KING holds a special place in my heart: It is the first novel that was assigned to me in an English class that I didn't think was boring as hell. Not to put down English, it's a valuable course, but sometimes you can't help but wish for a book that's not only 'important', but also 'fun to read'.HENDERSON follows the titular character through a few months of his life, as he decides to drop everything to travel through Africa. That sums up the plot, but it doesn't do justice to either Saul Bellow's prose, or the character of Henderson himself.Henderson is an original, a huge mountain of a man who is so full of himself, and yet so full of zeal for life, that you can't help but admire him. Henderson does not go at things half-heartedly. He goes full-bore through life, often leaving innocent bystanders in his wake.The thing is, Henderson is SO overblown, SO pompous, SO egotistical, that you cannot believe, by the end, that you actually like the guy. This is where Bellow's talent really shines through. He has taken an individual who would tire you out within two minutes in real life, and has somehow made him endearing. It is a terrific feat of writing, on par with John Kennedy Toole's hero Ignatius Reilly in A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES. Although to be fair, Henderson is not nearly as unlikeable (in theory) as Ignatius is.HENDERSON is not a saint. Thank God. He'd never let good sense stand in the way of a good time. But he's not an idiot. He does care for others, in his way (unlike Ignatius). He's destructive, but intensely well-meaning. He's one of the most remarkable characters in modern literary fiction, keeping company with Ignatius, Garp, and Quoyle. Those true readers out there know who these guys are."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"I am a Bellow fan and have read most of his novels. After a while his books become like old friends. This is an excellent novel, and if Bellow's name was not on the cover you would have a hard time telling that he wrote it. This was written in the 1950s, before his famous and brilliant book \\"Herzog,\\" and Bellow seems to be experimenting with his writing. This is an excellent read but very different for Bellow. There are no mentions of Jewish roots, and it involves a slightly farfetched story of a macho man, Henderson, wandering around the African wilderness with a gun and camping gear. He manages to integrate himself into two tribes and become friends with one king and his lion. Hence the picture of the lion on the cover. Unlike other Bellow characters, Henderson prizes personal experiences and self confidence above reading and philosophy, but Henderson has a strong emotional side as well. He spars verbally with various African characters in an exchange of values and life experiences. Bellow draws on his study of Africa for the background material and uses a landlord to model the character Henderson.In case you are new to Bellow, his novels reflect his intellectual life, his writings, and his five marriages during his six active decades of writing. He hit his peak as a writer around the time of \\"Augie March\\" in 1953 and continued through to the Pulitzer novel \\"Humbolt's Gift\\" in 1973. He wrote from the early 1940s through to 2000. His novels are written in a narrative form, and the main character is a Jewish male, usually a writer but not always, and he is living in either in New York or Chicago. The novels are mostly about urban life and involves his life, the wives, lawyers, judges, accountants, criminals, book publishers, and other peopel. Bellow wrote approximately 13 novels and plus other works.Bellow's style progressed a long way as a writer over the five decades. Some compare his style in \\"Dangling Man\\" - the first novel - with Dostoevsky's \\"Notes from the Underground.\\" Having read both I would say that \\"Notes\\" is brilliant while \\"Dangling Man\\" is at best average and sometimes a bit boring. His novels became more colourful such as \\"Augie March,\\" or brilliant in \\"Herzog\\" or expansive and entertaining such as in \\"Humbolt's Gift.\\" Some of these novels have a warmth and charm, and have a certain tongue in cheek approach in describing the trials and tribulations of the narrator. The humour is mixed in with the meaning of life and the future of our souls. Along the way there are a few diversions such as \\"Mr. Sammler's Planet\\" or \\"The Dean's December\\" where we see a much more serious individual, but again there is a bit of humour with the character Sammler.That bring us to the present book, which breaks the form of most of his other novels. This is an early novel. The style is a fast paced and almost light read - compared to the earlier novels. It lacks most of Bellow's trademark features found in the later books. Rather than describing the life of a writer or editor in Chicago or New York, we have the story of a war veteran and pig farmer, who becomes restless and decides on a whim to go to Africa. We still have a divorce and a new wife as in some other books, but the new wife is not the \\"fashion statement\\" that we see in later works. What is even more astonishing for Bellow fans is that the character Henderson accomplishes his feats with courage and brute strength, not writing abilities or similar. Henderson is a man of action, who manages to integrate himself into a remote African tribe by wrestling the leader, and then - by the native's standards - doing heroic acts of magic to help different tribes. Perhaps at some distant future date, some Bellow scholar will speculate that Bellow did not even write this novel. It is that different.This is an entertaining and colourful novel just over 300 pages in length. Unlike some Bellow novels, it is engaging after just a page or two. It completely lacks the urban intellectual sophistication of some of Bellow's other works, but it has its own charm. It is Bellow's only action story. It is a different approach by Bellow in his quest to discover man's soul the through art of writing, to entertain, and to create resonances with the reader.5 stars."},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"Just throw logic out the window. That is what you must do before reading Bellow's over the top and zany, Henderson the Rain King. This is a pure exercise of originality and wit, which in this case, takes precedent over believability, credibility, or consistency. Hold on tight for a wild and bumpy ride through the expanse of Africa and an even wilder ride through Henderson's mind, which is so relentlessly cluttered and wish-washy, that when the story is completed, it felt like more of a dream than a real life event.The story opens with Henderson ranting on and skipping mercilessly from one event to another to try and explain why he went to Africa in the first place. He tells us everything from how he raises pigs, to how he got his fortune, his marriage, divorce, love life, etc. (and that is all in the first chapter!) I felt a headache coming on, and I feared the book was going to assault my senses by leaping to and fro and a dizzying pace. But don't worry, things do calm down a bit as the story rolls on.Henderson eventually ends up telling his marvelous and unbelievable story of his journey through Africa. At first, he is a third wheel to a honeymooning couple, but he ends up ditching them with the tour guide, Romilayu. They begin their crazy journey from that point on. First, he visits a tribe called the Arnewi. He ends up wresting their leader in a match of strength. Henderson wins and they become instant friends. The Arnewi worship cattle and many of them are dying off due to lack of water. Henderson, in his attempt to help out, actually causes a delightfully chaotic scene among this tribe that you will have to read to believe. Ashamed from the disaster he has caused, he escapes with Romilayu again into the desert.After that, Henderson wanders into an even stranger African tribe called the Wariri. At first, they are not treated kindly. Henderson quickly makes friends with their king Dahfu, and things begin to change drastically. Soon, he is a favorite of the tribe with his goofy antics, and even becomes their \\"Rain king\\", which is a leader next to the king that somehow controls the weather. (He is initiated in a wildly bizarre ceremony that is unlike anything you have ever read). Together, Henderson and Dahfu begin a quest to capture a mysterious lion named Gmilo, who is actually Dahfu's reincarnated father!!There is more too it all, but it wouldn't be fair to ruin all of the extremity and silliness that abounds here.I guess the main reason why I liked Henderson the Rain King so much was for how creative and original the story is. You have everything to reincarnated lions to frog explosions. Everything from weird, exotic rain dances to deep friendships and everything in between.Henderson the Rain King is not a perfect book, of course. It is told in first person, and at times, Henderson can get on our nerves and under our skin, but overall, he comes off as a truly original and complex character. Sometimes the book meanders a bit too much, too often, but who can complain with such an interesting story full of liveliness.Also, the description is remarkable. I love the way words are formed together to give the reader memorable images about certain events and background that illuminate the entire reading experience. The language is hypnotic and rolls off like an addictive hallucinogen. What a strange, wacky experience this was.Just don't read too deep into it all. If you don't, you will enjoy the experience. It will definitely give you that inalienable rush that our most peculiar dreams tend to give us. This one is just as peculiar as any of those dreams, I suppose. And I mean that in a good way.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"This is one of the most comic of Bellow's novels, and one of the few that has an apparently non- Jewish hero. The internal cry of his hero Henderson , the 'I want, I want\\" that drives him to escape himself and search for another kind of world in Africa is the restlessness of the rich American who has everything materially but who seeks something more. Yet there is something likeable as well as comic in the huge and hugely appetited Henderson that gives the book a lighter spirit than Bellow's best works , \\" Herzog \\" and \\"Seize the Day\\". And it is a wonderfully enjoyable read.s"},{"Title":"Henderson, the Rain King; a Novel","review":"\\"I was not the lion, but it fell to me to give the lion's roar.\\" ~Winston ChurchillHenderson the Rain King is the story of Henderson, a middle-aged man, who despite his wealth is unsatisfied with his life. He feels unfulfilled and continues to hear a voice in his head that says, \\"I want, I want, I want.\\" In his quest for meaning he travels to remote African villages for spiritual and emotional enlightenment.Henderson is a pretty unlikeable character at first as he is is selfish and uncaring. He has a lot of faults as Bellow lets us into his personal thoughts. He becomes more and more likable as the book progresses. He has a real desire to help people; the problem is he is like a bull in a china shop and is in such a rush to help he tends to make things worse. Along the way Henderson unknowingly does something that makes him the Rain King in one remote village. He becomes fast friends with the native king and they spend hours discussing philosophy and the meaning of life. The king spends hours with him and a tame lion teaching him how to become like a lion and to cast off his former self.This book was ranked #21 on Modern Library's list of the 100 Best Novels. It was written in 1959 and is considered by many a modern-day classic. I enjoyed many aspects of the book, especially the story and the excellent writing; however, I had a difficult time with the pages upon pages of philosophical reflections. It got pretty mind numbing to me. That's a possible reflection on my somewhat short-attention span but I found myself falling to sleep over and over in the middle of these ongoing ramblings. It took me a long time to read but I think it worthy of a recommendation if only for the powerful and imaginative writing."},{"Title":"The Works of Epictetus, Consisting of His Discourses in Four Books, the Enchiridion, and Fragments. 2 Volumes.","review":"Unfortunately, Amazon has no review of this product so I am taking it into my hands to elaborate on what it is. It is all the works attributed to Epictetus, translate by a woman names Elizabeth Carter and published in the 1700's.The bad points are that this is a scanned version of an already existing work, not a reprint. Some of the letters, or even whole sentences, are blurred and illegible. Also, the original book was printed during a time period when the letter 's' was sometimes represented by a character that looks more like a lower case 'f', so you're reading the word \\"success\\" but it looks like 'fucceff'.One good point of this book is that Carter did provided an introduction to the book which is a very good overview of Stoic Philosophy. She was obviously very well versed in Classical Philosophy, as she quickly analyzed the most important aspects of the Stoic belief system, delved into the difference between the Stoic and Socratic beliefs, and did quick comparisons between Stoicism and Christianity.I think though that the one major flaw of this product is the price. If the book were hard cover and a complete reprinting I could see where it would be worth $30.00 or even $40.00, as it is all the works attributed to Epictetus. However, since it is a soft cover scanned text I think the price should be much lower.All in all, I would say this book gets three stars for being the collected works attributed to Epictetus and for Carter's introduction, but it lost two stars for being a scanned text and for being over priced/soft cover."},{"Title":"Year of the Monkey","review":"This book captures much of the atmosphere and culture of the US Army in Vietnam, especially Long Binh Post during the war.

She paints a beautiful illustration of Ruth and Boaz as the basis for a healthy love relationship.I commend the author for being able to share so openly her hurt and pain and embarrassment. One of the big things I got out of the book was that I may never fully understand why things happened in the relationship but if I accept it I have a much better chance of healing and moving forward.I would recommend this book to anyone who believes in God and is going through a painful breakup.

Godwin's first concern, as always, is the way that the operations of government affect the individual. Godwin complicates the scenario of persecution, pursuit, and paranoia he worked with in \\"Caleb Williams\\" by giving his hero, Reginald St. Leon, a wife and children. Godwin goes deep into human psychology to explore how the vicissitudes of human fortune affect not only one man, but how his responses to the world affect everyone around him.The novel begins in the early 1520's, at the very beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. The anti-hero is Reginald St. Leon, a landed aristocrat, building his name in war and society. As a youth, he develops an unfortunate penchant for gambling which places his family's fortune and his legacy in severe straits. His friend and advisor, a gentleman by the name of de Damville, offers his daughter to St. Leon. De Damville trusts that by settling down with a prudent young lady like Marguerite, he will abandon his wanton lifestyle and become the man that his noble house expects. ...One day, St. Leon is approached by an old man who takes him into confidence, promising St. Leon a way to recuperate his fortune, on the condition that he tells no one what passes between them. Offered the ultimate prizes of alchemy, the philosopher's stone and the elixir of immortality, St. Leon is sworn to silence, alienating him further from his wife and family. The next three volumes of the novel show the catastrophic aftermath of St. Leon's new gifts. St. Leon wanders all over Europe, abandoning his family, trying to use his unlimited wealth to benefit mankind. His experiments are ill-conceived, though, and he ends up, like his predecessor Caleb Williams, a complete outcast to humanity, hated by his family, pursued by the Spanish Inquisition, and imprisoned by the Hungarian Turks.More psychologically complex than \\"Caleb Williams,\\" \\"St. Leon\\" gives us a broad range of characters, male and female, who are each affected by their contact with St. Leon. We are exposed by Godwin, in a time when nations measured themselves as good by the supposed evil of other nations, to a kind of social relativism. In France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Hungary, Godwin gives us, not only St. Leon's perspective, but forces us to consider 16th (and by reflection 18th) century international relations from the vantage point of each.However, this diffusion and variety that contributes to the complexity of the novel, socially, politically, and psychologically, also detracts from the overall effect of the novel upon the reader. Where \\"Caleb Williams\\" drives straight through in a constant state of panic and terror, \\"St. Leon\\" has a looser structure, and as a result, moves much slower, and does not captivate or enthrall as the earlier novel does. Overall, \\"St. Leon\\" is an extremely interesting novel, and should appeal to fans of psychological gothic and historical novels."},{"Title":"St. Leon (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Loved this Gothic tale of an alchemist who invents a way to live for ever, then later realizes it is a curse.

The term &quot;short story&quot; would be a better description. In all its less-than-eighty-paged glory, the absurdly gigantic type size was, to me, immediately off-putting. With only eight lines (yes, you read that correctly,&quot;8&quot; lines) of text per page, and barely thirty characters per line, it takes about 15 minutes to read it cover-to-cover, and that is if you take a leisurely pace.This book has left me puzzled. Is it an adult's version of how a 15-yr-old girl would write? Or are we to believe this is what a 15-yr-old girl DID write? If the former, the author should check her &quot;sources&quot;. I challenge you to find a 15-yr-old who speaks, or writes, in such a repetitive, pointless and generally chaotic manner. I am guessing, then, that the instantly and entirely annoying practice of capitalizing nearly every other word was to drive home the idea that the narrator is barely literate. All I can say to that is this: the only reason I'm glad the book was so short is that it lessens the amount of time the reader is bashed over the head with what I suppose are to be clues of the narrator's navet&eacute;. I, however, found such practices to be condescending and trite.If, on the other hand, this is truly the work of a 15-yr-old, my first reaction is, where are the editors? I'm wondering whether this book was meant to be endearing through its quagmire of errors. If that was your intent, I'm sorry, but you were not successful with me. And if this is the writing of said young girl, I do not see how she could be considered &quot;an excellent student&quot;, unless the whole thing has been translated from another language. If so, then not only did it lose something in the translation, but what it lost was its sincerity."},{"Title":"Life Strategies: The Struggle Between Anorexia and Depression","review":"I was appalled at this book. First of all, it is NOT worth the paper it is printed on. I can't believe a tree was wasted for this.If this chick really suffered through an eating disorder, then I, myself, can relate to where she is coming from and how she feels. But it sounds to me as if she READ a few ED books and tried to make up one of her own.Everything is just wrong with this book. From the title to the text - nothing seems to fit. There is no true sense of her living through the nightmare of disordered eating. The terminology, run on sentences and print of the book is just absured. There is no stragety involved whatsoever toward recovery.She got depressed and down on herself by being in a wheelchair from some sort of undisclosed surgery. That is a state of mind, not an eating disorder. She eludes to bulima and self injury. She says she knows it was wrong but did it anyways. That is not a true disordered way of thinking. A true anorexic, bulimic or self injurer does not CARE that it is wrong - does not truly FEEL that it is wrong. It is a way to cope and they certainly do not do it just because.Don't waste your time or money on this appalling, poorly written essay. I would hardly call it a book."},{"Title":"Oranges","review":"Upon finding this book in the multi-cultural/lingual classroom that I work in, I was horrified to see a small caucasian girl tasting the fruit of the labor of those different people that brought the orange to her. The limits of those of a certain race to certain jobs is extraordinarily offensive, and I cannot see the benefit of reading this wordy and prejudiced story. A child wants to imagine themselves in each part of a story, and only too early are we saying that those who speak Spanish will only be planters, and those who are speaking Creole will be migrant fruit pickers. Sad."},{"Title":"Oranges","review":"Although I see the author's point of showing how everyone of different culturals all work together for one established goal, this book comes out more stereotipical than multicultural."},{"Title":"Oranges","review":"\\"Is in this ripe orange that I pry apart,\\" so states Oranges by Zack Rogow and that is just what an orange represents. Rogow takes us through the journey it takes to grow an orange from the very beginnings of clearing the fields needed to plant the trees.We discover seedlings being planted, irrigation ditches being dug, shiny oranges being picked, oranges being trucked and sorted and finally arriving at a vegetable stand.This book provides a lesson for children not just on what it takes to grow an orange but in the many people who work to bring an orange to market. We meet people along the oranges journey who speak Spanish, Creole, Korean and English.Illustrations done by Mary Szilagyi are works in pastels. They are attractive and work in conjuction with the dialogue to tell the story of the orange.This is a book that does much to value the work done by people of the many diverse cultures of our nation.

I literally could not put it down, as each page revealed a progressive, sinking horror more intense and seemingly hopeless than anything Stephen King could ever imagine!

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"This is a tale of human endeavour and tragedy so great that an oil painting of the survivors from the wreck of the Medusa on board their raft actually hangs in the Louvre Art Gallery in Paris. It is a story of a shipwreck in the early part of the 19th Century where a few of those who survived the original wrecking set out on a raft seeking rescue. Many of them made it - but many did not.It is a harrowing tale of survival against everything that both life and death can throw at a group of people when they are at extreme disadvantage.Once again Alexander McKee provides the reader with a well researched and equally well presented book based on a factual story from the sea. It is also an excellent read - which is exactly what I have come to expect from this author.NM."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"The Wreck of the Medusa is a well-told tale of the crew and passengers of the ill-fated french frigate. McKee has done an incredible job of assembling the facts of this story into a coherent tale. Anybody who enjoys stories of disaster at sea will enjoy this book.The criticism: near the end of the book, McKee launches into a psuedo-psychological analysis of the Medusa tragedy as compared to several other modern-day tragedies. While the other stories made for interesting reading, I wasn't too impressed with the self-evident parallels he drew from the comparisons. These portions of the book should have been edited out."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"I have to admit that for years I thought Gericault's painting, &quot;The Wreck of the Medusa&quot; was based on some portion of the mythological exploits of the snake-headed goddess. Obviously the author of this book, Alexander McKee gives the true account of the tragedy that inspired the painting. Though similar to another shipwreck story; &quot;In the Heart of the Sea,&quot; which deals with the wreck of the whaleship Essex &quot;The Wreck of the Medusa&quot; differs because the tragedy of the Medusa is entirely manmade. Through the actions of the cowardly captain and the obnoxiously snobbish Gov. Schmaltz hundreds of innocents are abandoned on a overcrowded, rickety raft with next to no provisions while Schmaltz and Capt. de Chaumareys row off in large well provisioned lifeboats....echoes of Titanic here. But even more disgusting is how these two sorry excuses for human beings continue to harrass the few destitute survivors long after the ordeal at sea ends. This story shows humanity at it's best and far beyond it's worst."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"In 1816, the French frigate Medusa became stranded off the west coast of Africa, and a harrowing tale of desperate survival began. British author Alexander McKee writes his account in straightforward, journalistic style, avoiding any temptation to sensationalize the dramatic story.As one might expect, the extreme situation brought out the best in some persons, the worst in others. Men on a barely seaworthy raft, in water up to their waists, eventually had to resort to cannibalism to remain alive.McKee presents the full story to us, replete with human error, arrogance, cowardice, and heroism, endurance, and faith. In the final chapters of the book he relates other stories of shipwrecks and plane wrecks, such as the famous crash of the rugby team high in the Andes in 1972. He compares these disasters with the Medusa situation.Although his style seems rather pedestrian at times, I suspect he deliberately wrote this way to present the story factually and completely. \\"Death Raft\\" belongs on the list of any reader who enjoys true-life sea stories."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"This is a good story, well told, that grips the reader & draws a lot of emotion from him. One feels anger at the incompetance of the pompous, lily-livered captain who cruelly & swiftly abandons the ships complement, saving only himself & a few \\"favoured\\" high-ranking passengers & crew. The terrible sufferings of the poor wretches on the raft are shocking & one wonders to what lengths the human species will endure to survive. Yes, it is certainly a moving story. Unfortunately, the \\"meat\\" of this immensely exciting survival tale finishes half way through the book. There follows a series of tedious & dreary accounts of the events ocurring as a consequence of the tragedy. The dreadful French bureaucracy that pillories the raft survivors who try to bring relate their struggles & completely fails to adequately punish the craven captain. There is a rambling account of the manner in which the famous painting of the Death Raft is finally completed & recognised. Finally, comparisons are made between the Death Raft survivors & survivors of other events, including another ship-wreck, the famous Uruguayan Andes plane crash & even modern day hi-jacks. These are mostly irrelevant. The conclusions are nebulous & stretch the imagination. In conclusion, 50% of the book is great, but spoiled by the final 50%, which is pure padding. Shame!"},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought this book wasn't well-written.

Of course, different people like different styles of writing.Another, even more amazing true-story book by Alexander McKee is &quot;Ice Crash.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"The Wreck of the Medusa (The Tragic Story of the Death Raft), by Alexander McKee, has been reissued to benefit from the recent interest in survival stories, whether in the Artic regions, high atop a mountain, or on the high seas. This addition to the genre may not be as well written and researched as some (In the Heart of the Sea sets a high standard for going beyond simply the events of the tragedy and taking the reader into the context) but this book makes up for any faults by telling one of the most horrific stories imaginable. It begins with gross incompetence by the leaders of the expedition and then becomes a story of murder, mutiny, suicide, cannibalism and the very occasional act of heroism. It is stunning to see a raft (appropriately referred to as a death raft) go from one hundred and fifty to fifteen people in a couple of weeks. It is a gripping tale for those readers who have developed a taste for these rather gruesomely riveting survival tales."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"This book does a wonderful job of documenting a tragic event that captured nearly everyone's attention in the early part of the 19th Century. Alexander McKee shows the role that French politics played in putting incompetent and self-serving military officers in charge of an operation that ended with a grisly outcome. After running their vessel aground off the coast of West Africa they discover that they have insufficient boats so a 65x25 foot raft is constructed for 150 folks so they might be towed to shore. But when it is discovered that the raft is a couple of feet below water when loaded it slows the other boats and is therefore set adrift. Of the 150 only 15 survive and those by eating human flesh.The first half of the book involves the events surrounding the wreck while the second half is devoted to a comparison and contrast of several other similar stories of challenge where depends on the competent leadership and the consumption of human flesh.As a result of this tragedy a French painter named Theodore Gericault painted \\"The Wreck of the Medusa\\" which now hangs in the Louvre. McKee does an excellent job of sharing the events surrounding the creation of that painting and the book has several sketches of the work prior to completion.My disappointment was in knowing how the author knew so much about this tragedy until half way through the book. Then you learn that there was a number of books written by the survivors and also written court proceedings available.When you start it you'll have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"The Wreck of the Medusa is the amazing story of the so-called death raft off the coast of Africa nearly two hundred years ago. It is thoroughly engrossing, with lessons completely applicable to the modern world. It would make a terrific film, an interwoven tale of flower meadows in France, the grounding of the ship on the dangerous bank off West Africa, the death raft, storms, the march through the desert, the shameful conduct of the Medusa's leadership, the courtroom aftermath, the great work of art inspired by the experience of those on the raft that so emotionally and physically exhausted the young artist (who died three years later), and more modern events with similar human behavior. Images of scores of people crammed on a makeshift raft up to their chests in seawater, so close together that they could not move, and the events that reduced their number to under 20, are indelible for me and should be brought to others through film. The only surprise for me is that the author did not mention the survival story from the sinking of the Essex, just a couple years after the grounding of the Medusa."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"This is a gripping story of human drama very well written by Alexander McKee. The pace is lively. The facts are accurate and frequently drawn from first person survivor and news accounts. McKee doesn't simply report the facts, however, he weaves them together and draws fair assumptions when conflicts occur from sources with reasons to shade the truth. It is an amazing tale that is almost unbelievable. If you have any interest in sea or survival stories with real people facing extraordinary circumstances, then you will not be disappointed in this work."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"Like Gericault's painting--for wich the tragedy is most known, Mckee's book leaves the reader with mixed emotions. The book is interesting for the detail narrative of gruesome tragedy. We are almost put in front the raft to contemplate the fate of the castaways. Yet one cannot too put the book down even when describing the hideous spectacle of the wreckage of the Medusa and the and the tragedy of the drifting raft.I must confess, however, that after 11 chapters describing that fateful voyage I was ready for a change. Perhaps for the reason, I found the second part, the one dedicated to the legal and political impact of the incident, as the most fascinating and best written part of the book. This section for example, contains Mckee's review to Gericault's The Raft of the Medusa. His review is a good introduction to appreciate Gericault's master piece.That from a historical perspective the book should have ended with the daily survey of the voyage and the subsequent legal and political drama is a matter of opinion. I found the last chapters as interesting as the previous two sections of the book. It was the author's purpose to make us see that the story is not a event of the past. McKee finds parallels in several other wreckages. Although his interest seems to lay in finding the psychological factors involved in those extreme situations, I found that the most relevant lesson of the story was the need for competent leadership. This is a lesson that was as relevant then as it is now in differents levels of our human drama."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"Truly amazing story of abandonment, death and survival. This was a fair read but far from being a book I just couldn't put down. There were areas where I wished for more detail and information and there were items of information that were completely uneeded. Overall I gave it a three. It's a good book if you can't find anything else to read. A chronicle of true stupidy at work on the ocean, with over three dozen different names of people to keep track of. Don't spend too much for a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"If you have ever read about Shackleton's ill-fated Antarctic expedition and surmised that his leadership abilities played a role in the survival of all involved, then this book is a must-read. The examples of poor leadership, nepotism and corruption and the consequences to survival in the Wreck of the Medusa are striking and contrast sharply with the story of Shackleton and the wreck of the Endurance."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"The Medusa story is one that is most likely unfamiliar to many Anglo Americans. A French vessel loaded with passengers runs aground off the African coast, just miles from shore. The occupants head for shore in boats, intending to find rescue. A large group of soldiers and men are set adrift on a raft, without much food or supplies. When rescue finally comes, only a handful are still alive.The disaster story here is told well enough for sure. Readers will not be bored as they follow the action from France down to the African coast, where a litany of horrors await, including the horrors of incompetence. The captain and crew botch the job to a degree that is near hard to believe, almost being responsible for wholesale murder.But the second half is not so good. The author distances himself from the scene, and the writing loses a certain magic. At the end we learn of other strandings at sea and how individuals behaved. The Medusa, it is said, may not be that unique.I was also hoping to learn more about the ultimate fate of the ship and crew. We learn that the stranded Medusa is sighted nine months after the disaster. What ever became of the wreck? Do we know where it is now? Is anyone searching for it? Whatever happened to the survivors of the death raft? A better book would have explored these issues."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"The advent of Arabella Edge's,'The God of Spring' bespeaks the ongoing fascination with the shipwreck of the French frigate,'Medusa' off the west coast of Africa in 1816. Books abound on the subject, and had not Gericault made his pivotal painting of 'The Raft of the Medusa' in 1819, this gruesome chapter of naval history, replete with official neglect, attempted cover-up and cannabalism(nowhere near as rare an event at sea as subsequent reading has revealed) may well have drifted from reach. But the painting is undeniably awesome in every respect. It was Julian Barne's,'History of the World in 10 and a half Chapters' that alerted me to the painting's potential to be refigured as an articulation of the contemporary tragedy of indigineous desert Australia, its cultural despoilation and alcoholism. I'm unaware of any connexion between Barnses' perception and The Pogue's similarily timed,'Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash'. But that album's cover art, skewering the Gericault, was wonderfully appropriate to its desperate themes.So Gericault's,'Raft' proved an apt vehicle for me to hitch my painting to. Art books like Albert Alhadeff's, will tell you about Gericault's labour, his interviewing the survivors, his variations and final triumph. I pared the thing back and poached the high horizon, the Pieta pose of the old man nursing his dead son, and the brilliant figure slipping from the craft into the viewer's space, which strikes me now as, in turn, having derived from Bellini's,'Drunkeness of Noah'. This rant leads to Alexander McKee, whose,'Death Raft' remains the supreme place to commence fathoming 'The Medusa's' twisted tale. McKee's recounting has all the data you need and an immediacy of tone free from impeding rhetoric. It's as vivid as the Gericault. Its evocation of hardship at sea has only been equalled by Nat Philbrick's,'In The Heart of The Sea'."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"This is a very quick, yet compelling read! It is a first rate historical account of a tragedy you won't believe."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death RaftA fascinating book which is about an infamous tragedy caused by fools in charge of ships they have no experience in running. The Captain of this vessel half loaded a life ship and took himself and the upper crust away, leaving others in leaky, overcrowded boasts, and worst of all, hundreds in a makeshift raft half submurged all the time. Like the Titanic, another totally avoidable disaster which cost the lives of the innocent while most of the guilty survived. I'm not at the end yet, but I pray the Captain, his con man friend who set the course for death, and the (mostly, cowardly) officers pay with massive sufferings, richly deserved. A few heroes emerge to show that treating others as oneself isn't just religious impulse, but basic human decency, a quality lacking entirely in the \\"leadership\\" of the Medusa."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Medusa: The Tragic Story of the Death Raft","review":"Overall I liked the book and found the subject matter very interesting.

The plot unfolds at roughly the speed of light. The Trade Mission examines what happens when civilized (although emotionally damaged) people are thrown into an unfamiliar survival situation.Great book!!"},{"Title":"The Trade Mission: A Novel of Psychological Terror","review":"You may wish they didn't exist, but the main characters (heroes? anti-heroes?) of The Trade Mission are representative of their age and time and place -- more than that, damn if I didn't recognize myself in the way they thought, what was important to them, the way they saw their harsh \\"reality\\" at a remove, as though a movie or \\"interactive\\" game. Yes, the novel is exciting and brooding and suspenseful and gruesome at times, but it's also a fantastically spot-on characterization of a generation...MY generation. Who would have guessed that a book that nails twentysomething, 21st century North American psyche takes place in Brazil?"},{"Title":"The Trade Mission: A Novel of Psychological Terror","review":"What I loved most about THE TRADE MISSION is the way it tellsa compelling, thrilling, thoughtful story, while at the same time tackling some of the most important questions that accompany living in the contemporary world: the negotiations between individual identity, technology, morality in an age when traditional moral guidance has all but disappeared. Pyper is a fine and original writer, to boot. This novel takes risks and succeeds, both at the level of its ideas and its language. It kept me up late with its narrative revelations and its insights. A huge -- albeit grisly -- pleasure!"},{"Title":"The Trade Mission: A Novel of Psychological Terror","review":"In Pyper's second book, all of the flaws of \\"Lost Girls\\" fail to exist. The plot is simpler, but just as suspenseful. There are no loose ends this time around. No mini-plots that were never finished. His social commentary and character development are just amazing.

I cannot wait for more from Pyper.- Delaney"},{"Title":"The Trade Mission: A Novel of Psychological Terror","review":"Just when I thought Lost Girls was a fluke from a first-time novelist, along came The Trade Mission.Pure story from beginning to end, The Trade Mission shows what happens when you put normally civilized (although emotionally crippled) individuals into an unknown survival situation.The story grabs you from the first moments in the frozen wilderness, drags you along for the ride in the jungles of Brazil, and doesn't let go until it has wrung out every emotion from the reader.Can't wait for number 3 from this incredibly talented young writer!"},{"Title":"The Trade Mission: A Novel of Psychological Terror","review":"Well, this is a different novel from Lost Girls, but in my view, an even better one over-all (and I loved Pyper's first book, too). It's a more straightforward narrative, but the suspense is all the greater for that. I really believed in the characters (even if I'm glad I don't have to count them among my best friends!) and they felt real to me. And man, can this author write an original, thrilling, feel it in your bones action sequence!I was a fan before, and remain a fan. Here is a case of an author who not only deserved the hype the first time round, but has managed to live it down on the second effort. Can't wait for the next one....."},{"Title":"The Trade Mission: A Novel of Psychological Terror","review":"Considering how good Lost Girls was, I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, it was extremely disappointing. First, Pyper should *not* have tried to write a book with a female main character. It took me about 15 pages to even realize it was a woman. Almost everything she said or did seemed unrealistic and/or forced to me. Also, there was no &quot;eeriness&quot; in this book like there was in Lost Girls. There were a few attempts at &quot;creepy&quot; scenes, but they just ended up being cheesy. The whole premise of the book was bland and unoriginal: rich North American execs are kidnapped in a foreign country and terrible things ensue. Try as they might, they can't figure out why they've been targeted. Then, in the last few pages, all is revealed! Surprise! Too bad it wasn't at all surprising.Andrew Pyper is capable of much better writing than this. I hope that his next book is better."},{"Title":"The Black Robin: Saving the World's Most Endangered Bird","review":"This is a wonderful book.

Don had the idea that if he took the young chicks to be fostered by another species, she might lay more eggs. It worked and now there are over 100 Black Robins. I know Don personally, but even if I didn't, he would be a hero to me. Don also saved the Kakapo, the world's largest parrot by weight, and one of the most endangered.

Now worn and dog-eared, I recently picked it up again and was once more mesmerized by the adventure tale and the character development. &quot;Classic Adventure&quot; are the only terms I can think of to describe Moonfleet.

The ending is such a beautiful joining of the circle that it leaves you breathless with admiration for the writer's genius while it moves you to the point of tears with the strength of the writer's story.Though written for children, this book can be enjoyed by anyone over the age of eight and perhaps read to children even younger."},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"When I began reading this book, a friend of mine took one look at the cover and started naming off what he thought the aspects of the plot were. He named all of the traditional pirate story cliches (sometimes platitudes): orphaned boy, evil pirate, hidden treasure, etc. By looking at the cover, I thought that was what it would be too, and I looked forward to the classic adventure story (I've always loved swashbucklers). As it was, Moonfleet is a very original novel that doesn't follow of the conventions. Surely, some of those elements are there--the orphaned boy and treasure--but they are twisted in different ways. Moonfleet is somewhat darker than other swashbucklers such as Treasure Island, and there are actually no pirates at all. There is also a little bit more depth of characterization as John Trenchard and Elziver Block have a long and meaningful friendship. Moonfleet is certainly a superior adventure novel, complete with exciting escapes (a lot of them), lost treasure, and some actual characterization. It's well worth reading."},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"I recently purchased this book from Amazon because it reminds me of fond childhood memories. When I was young, my mother read this book to me when I was ill. It's still the best memory I have of my youth.

The imagery is wonderful, and it is a book you can share with anyone. It's a classic.The ending will make you cry ... very touching. Take a chance on this book, it's worth every penny.P.S.

It was read to us by my mother when i was 11 or 12; i remembered the story vaguely and the title wrongly. I had tried desultorily to find it over the years, unsuccessfully. Now, having reread it, aloud, to my children, i affirm that this is one of the finest children's adventure stories ever written. It out-treasures &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and any other of the same genre. The sad sacrifice at the end had all three of us in tears as i read it ~ i scarce could make out the words on the page. Elzevir Block is one of children's literature's finest heroes; a most honourable, strong, wise, loveable, faithful, and ~ despite some of his actions ~ good man. John Trenchard, the young protagonist, grows up, learns of life most awfully, and is rewarded with the love of a true woman ~ the daughter of his enemy, the book's first villain.

The sea is always at the back of the story as we follow our young hero, John, through his various scrapes. His two goals in life are his girl and the treasure. As he searches for the way to both, John spends many a memorable episode in such places as the church's crypt, is defeated at almost every turn and goes through an adventure tinged with fear and horror that will exhilirate the hardiest reader.Although this is a children's book, its themes and scenarios involve the most serious of readers.

The book over all was like this it seemd to go on for a while but then start to get molre interesting.......it took a long time for the story line to pick up. Like the escape from the prison and the boat ride which climaxed at the storm where the ship they were travelling was nearly wrecked.

The novel has all of Falkner's characteristics: his gorgeous mellifluous prose, his predilection for Gothic settings, his obsession with aristocratic ancestry and heraldry, a healthy dose of homoeroticism, and above all his ability to evoke striking visual scenes. The plot moves slowly at first and then becomes quite exciting, as John and his mentor search for a lost fabulous diamond and attempt to avoid the price put on their head by revenuers who accuse them of murder; things get a bit awkward at the end, as ten years of forced hard labor are glossed over in a few paragraphs, but then they pick up once again. The influences of Wilkie Collins and, particularly, Robert Louis Stevenson, weigh heavily on the text, but Falkner's gift for evoking a haunting visual picture is something all his own."},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"Like many, I loved old adventures such as Treasure Island and Kidnapped when I first read them as a child. Several years ago, Washington Post book critic Michael Dirda named this as being of the same caliber, so I finally sought out a copy to fall into. Written at the turn of the 20th century, the story is set in a small village on the Dorset coast (allegedly based on East Fleet), circa the 1750s. There lives John Trenchard, a classic adventure hero: age 15, orphaned and living with a nasty (though not cruel) aunt, and pining for the beautiful daughter of the local lord. The village of Moonfleet has two intriguing aspects to it. One is a legend relating to a massive -- and possibly cursed -- diamond purportedly owned by the former lord of the manor and possibly hidden somewhere in the vicinity. The other is the village's long history of illicit trade with smugglers bringing in untaxed spirits from France and other contraband. Their main contact in town is the tavern-owner, Elsevir, who is the true hero of the story.As in Treasure Island, things really start rolling when John gets entangled with Elsevir and the smugglers and more or less joins their gang. When the local lord tries to ambush them one dawn, blood is drawn and Elsevir and John are forced to flee and take to ground for some months. The fugitives then embark on a quest to locate the missing diamond and so make their fortune. John is especially keen on being able to return to Moonfleet a wealthy man, so that he may secure the hand of his fair lady. Of course, events don't transpire so easily, and further adventures take them to Holland, where events take a turn for the worse before a semi-triumphal homecoming.All of this is fine -- but not that great. The story and characters definitely feel somewhat derivative, and some of the elements feel quite clumsy. For example, the lord of the manor is a nasty, mean character, but there's no indication as to why this is so. Similarly, the prim stern aunt is a stereotype of the type, and a jewel dealer who plays a key role is instinctively venal without reason. Near the end, the heroes face calamity due to circumstances of their own exceedingly unlikely making. The cagey smuggler Elsevir exhibits naivitee that beggars belief. Which is not to suggest that the book is terrible, merely that it's not that amazing. Finally, I should point out that despite the words of many reviewers the story does not involve pirates at all. (Inexplicably, the cover of one edition even goes so far as to reproduce a painting of a boarding scene, complete with cutlasses, pistols, and scurvy seadogs.) The book was made into a rather forgettable 1955 film directed by the great Fritz Lang."},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"MOONFLEET IS A FAIRLY INTERESTING BOOK IT IS A UNIQUE BOOK WITH ORIGINAL STYLE AND A ONE-OF -A- KIND -STORY.the story is about a 15 year old boy called john trenchard who goes on extraordinary adventures on his quest to find blackbeards treasure he soon becomes trapped in avault and finds out a bit more than he bargained for a little bit startled he soon gets locked in and becomes hungry and thirsty he drinks the smuggled alchole he finaly gets rescued but his life changes forever an exeptionally fantastic story with laughter,sadness,romance,pain,rejection and a family classic........"},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"Moonfleet is a good book once you get into it, but it takes quite a long time to do that.

One day he finds a locket that once belonged to the legendary pirate Blackbeard, and his life becomes very different.

Start reading it when you have nowhere to go, because you may just read it cover to cover without putting it down!"},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"John Meade Falkner is one of my favorite novelists. I have read all three of his novels, namely The Lost Stradivarius, The Nebuly Coat and Moonfleet. I consider him to be a perfect stylist with a vivid imagination who created convincing characters and gripping plots. It is too bad he isn't better known. Moonfleet is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Treasure Island or Kidnapped by Stevenson. I don't want to give away the plot, so I won't. One almost gets the impression that this book was first published as a serial in a magazine, since each chapter ends with a cliff-hanging situation, once even literally on a cliff. The old-fashioned language and the nautical terms will annoy many readers, but please try to get past this, even if you don't know your larboard from your starboard. It is well worth the effort. I admit that it was somewhat awkward to gloss over ten years on a chain-gang in a few pages, and the coincidence of the shipwreck happening exactly at Moonfleet stretches credibility to its limits, but one really must forgive Falkner for everything. A movie based on this novel was made in 1955, but it is very different from the book, to say the least."},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"A great book to read. Main character John Trenchard who is 15 years old is very heroic. I'd really recommend this book to any age because its very adventurous. If you like secrets, nasty people and betrayal then this is the right book for you. Full of description, it puts an image into your head and you can't put it down.It is set in Moonfleet.Some archaic words that may not be understandable since the book is old but the plot is fantastic.The only thing you'll have to realise is that it takes along time to get into the main story. Basically, John finds his true friends who he trusts to be PRIVATE PIRATES. Also John tries to discover the secret behind Blackbeard who is dead and was a pirate. Blackbeard hides a diamond before he dies which still belongs to him today........"},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"I thought this book was thoroughly enjoyable, although in parts the language was difficult to understand, as the story was actually written in 1858. The story is about a fifteen year old orphan, (called John Trenchard,)who lives in the smuggler-infested town of Moonfleet. After a series of terrifying events, which keep the reader glued to the book for hours, he discovers a group of smugglers, who he had once trusted and considered as true friends. The story goes on to reveal the tale of hidden treasure, once owned by the murderous Blackbeard, (whose ghost is said to wander among the graves at night). This tantalising novel, filled wuth trust and betrayal is guaranteed to keep you occupied for hours on end, entranced by the cleverly put together plot. I would definitely recommend this book to older readers, though I would warn that the novel takes a while to really get started."},{"Title":"Moonfleet","review":"Moonfleet is an ace book. Even though chapters became monotonous, the storyline has that extra punch to it that would make you want to read it non-stop without taking your eyes off. The story backround is about our 15 year old hero John Trenchard who lives with his Aunt Jane because he was an orphan. The story is jam packed with bandits, smugglers and the beautiful young lady Grace Maskew, daughter of the miserly Magistrate Maskew. John has eyes for Grace and Blackbeards diamond which he vows to take. A fabulous book recommended for all."},{"Title":"Faith promise giving: God's plan for missionary stewardship","review":"This book helps to thouroughly explain Faith Promise Giving.

The records of the meetings are interspersed with accounts of the historical events taking place. Gurdjieff's oft-given instruction to the student to \\"outwardly play a role and inwardly not to identify\\" takes on a new importance during these times. Yet the problems of a student of the Fourth Way seem the same as always from the perspective taken in the meetings: work with attention, struggling with self-love and vanity. The timelessness of the teaching brought by Gurdjieff, a work in life, is brilliantly illustrated in this book."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"Voices in the Dark is a rich collection of notes from Gurdjieff's meetings in Paris during the WWII Nazi occupation. This is essential material for anyone who studies Fourth Way literature and a good introduction for those would like to start.As with his earlier book, Struggle of the Magicians, Mr. Patterson carefully weaves the meetings in a historical context. But unlike the former book, he adds an additional element that consists of \`voices' from prominent leaders (from both sides), writers, and philosophers of the day. I would have thought that, given the dangers and rapid changes people lived with on a day-to-day basis, many of the questions in the meetings would have focused on how to live and survive during those dangerous times. However, it seems that, because of the difficult and life-threatening times, students were doubly serious about their inner work. The context - the dangerous situation - makes what was spoken of during the wartime meetings that much more rich, important, and insightful.This book made me ponder what is truly important in life. And I recognized that it's not the \`outer' things that are important (which we tend to give so much value to), but all the seemingly \`little' inner things that we take so much for granted in ordinary life.One of the things that Mr. Gurdjieff said in a wartime meeting - which has stayed with me for a long time after reading this book - is that God does not exist for a person while his or her parents are still alive. I don't know why, but this statement, in particular, really struck me. After a long period of contemplation and the recent event of a family member becoming ill - perhaps terminally - I have come to a far deeper understanding of what this means and its implications in terms of my own spiritual study and growth. Given this recent insight (some months after having read the book), I'm now certain that a first reading has only scratched the surface of the book's potential value for me. The material provided here really warrants further, serious study."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"With the possible exception of Mr. Patterson's autobiographical Eating the \`I', Voices in the Dark is his best book to-date. A strong opening immediately takes the reader into the Paris of World War II, and into the emotional and psychic turmoil that characterized that time. A turmoil that is all the more striking with its relevance to our current \\"age of terrorism.\\" This topic alone would be worth the price of admission, but Mr. Patterson deftly interweaves this with two others. One is a seemingly minor theme - the role of the occult in Nazi Germany - though this takes a surprising turn as its impact on western occultism in general is exposed. The third stream consists of previously unprinted transcripts of G. I. Gurdjieff meetings with students in the midst of the Nazi occupation. Interestingly, there is little commentary connecting these streams; the relationships are built by juxtaposition.The story of occupied Paris is based on the experiences of such luminaries as Charles De Gaulle, Jean Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus. Mr. Patterson allows these protagonists to speak for themselves, quoting from diaries, transcripts and letters. Personally, I was most struck by the words of Jacques Lusseyran, a blind resistance fighter, who rose to become leader of an entire network.Interspersed through the storm of events impacting Paris is the quiet nexus of meetings conducted in the face of curfews, privations, and Nazi checkpoints. Despite the incredible barriers each person faced in simply attending meetings, there is no mention of these external events. Yet these same events lend the context in which real questions arise.Mr. Patterson presents us with authentic voices, which reflect both a particular moment of history and the recurrence of experiences throughout time."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"A Review of Voices in the Dark by William Patrick PattersonHooray! Another book by author William Patrick Patterson! That was my reaction when I first saw this book while browsing through the new releases on Amazon. The Hooray! was fully justified, as that was still my reaction when I finished it.Another rousing story of the search for what we are and can be in this world, this time with good guys and bad guys who amazingly turn out to be no different from one another. You have to read the book to find out why.Just as Patterson did in \`Ladies of the Rope' he combines descriptions of the events of the times with actual accounts of the meetings held by G. I. Gurdjieff in Paris during the Nazi occupation. The enjoyment, and in some way, enlightenment, are due in no small part to the usual meticulous research and documentation I find in Patterson's books.So once again this author raises questions more interesting than the answers given. The underground agents flitting through the dark of occupied Paris risking torture or death are starkly contrasted with Gurdjieff's students risking the same hazards, not against anything but for the search for truth. This isn't an exaggeration for the Gestapo regularly dealt out such consequences, especially after the communists began ambushing German officers in the nighttime streets of Paris.The whole thing kind of gave me pause, would I risk torture and death for the chance of coming to the truth?Well, would I?"},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"Have we ever asked ourselves a question about the nature of that ever present voice, or, rather, voices that always crowd our heads with inner talking, imagining, commenting, judging, worrying, and making decisions? By habit we call them thinking and consider them to be our normal and inseparable part. Actually, we say &#8220;I&#8221; to all of them, believing that it is us who think, comment, judge, and make decisions. But is it really so?Patterson&#8217;s Voices in the Dark is a good overall analysis of how these voices played themselves out on a large historical scale through the lives of some key figures of World War II. Unlike any other book on war Voices in the Dark provides the reader with something that is so easily missed, so quickly discounted as of being boring, empty, dead, and not worth of attention. In the form of transcripts of 32 very unusual Paris meetings with the seminal spiritual figure, G.I. Gurdjieff, the reader is given a doorway to the true mystery of life, to the dark space behind the scenes, to the background in which these voices appear and disappear.One may ask himself: what was so unique about meetings with this man? Why his students&#8212;who weren&#8217;t driven by the chaotic times of war, patriotism or the desire for self-preservation at any cost&#8212;were willing to take the risks of getting through Nazi posts, breaking curfews and meeting with Gurdjieff, when at the slightest suspicion one would be killed on the spot without any investigation?Through these meeting transcripts, taken by G&#8217;s personal secretary Solita Solano, the reader feels what it was that these people valued higher than their own lives. And, one can hear a different, impersonal voice of the man who lived in life and yet was free from it, who was full of compassion and understanding of the world&#8217;s imminent self-destruction and the urgent need of genuine salvation."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"Imagine standing in a dark auditorium and listening to different voices express their own individual ideas about living in France, especially Paris, during the German approach and occupation of WWII. With the still lingering impact of 9/11 we might feel a small portion of what it was like living in a social milieu of being subjugated to another's might, of neighbor fearing neighbor, of resistance and retaliation, of collaboration, of being in a constant potential danger and of being a possible object of violence.Patterson shows the eddies and currents within the historical background as G. I. Gurdjieff was meeting with students during this period and included are 32 actual meetings that he held with them. The author's notes augment the transcripts of the meetings so that, for those who are either beginning or continuing their exploration of the Fourth Way, this writing is both fascinating and indispensable. There is real understanding of the ideas, psychology and occult influences that were active at that time -- from Hitler's own intellectual and emotional proclivities to other world leaders at center stage.In a strange and telling feature, by it's absence, there is no indication during the meetings that Gurdjieff or his students were indulging in worries about their own immediate safety, as ever present as that must have been. This is a powerful and wonderful illumination on this period of Gurdjieff's life just four years prior to his death.In an admonition that applies to the time of this writing, the contemporary world, as well as any moment in history, the author invokes us: \\"To not be seduced, we need to learn how to listen.\\""},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"Voices in the Dark is a unique combination of the factual history of World War II, the power possessing beings of that time, and George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff who was living in Paris during the Nazi occupation. He held meetings in his apartment and created a spiritual shelter for his students. Thirty-two meetings that were held during this time are written in this book and interwoven between the historical facts and shocks of the war. In reading Voices in the Dark one gets a feeling for the personal relationships and different levels Mr. Gurdjieff taught on. The meetings are written, as they happened and evoke a connection to with Gurdjieff and his students which is beyond time."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"It was very exciting to read the actual transcripts from Gurdjieff's meetings with his students in Paris during WW II. My thanks to Mr. Patterson for unearthing these. The transcripts alone would have made a very enthralling book, but by interspersing them with accounts of the war - and what it was like to live in Nazi-occupied Paris - Patterson gives the context in which these meetings took place. It gave me an appreciation for the incredible efforts that these people made to work on themselves in spite of all that was going on around them.Although these people lived in a time and society that is very different from mine, what I saw was that as students of the Fourth Way we share the same questions. For example, \\"I am not able to sense myself. What can I do to get a sense of myself?\\" For readers who are not familiar with the teaching of the Fourth Way, Patterson includes footnotes to explain some of the words or expressions that Gurdjieff uses in his answers to his students.I appreciated the tremendous amount of research behind this book because it covers this period in history on so many different levels. This book is very alive not just with Gurdjieff and his students, but with the military, political, social and literary figures of the time. Actual quotes&#8212;the voices&#8212;of people from that time, give the book its structure for as Patterson says in the opening paragraph of the Prologue, \\"Only those who have lived through their country's sudden and complete military defeat, who have witnessed their government's fall, feared for their lives and those of their loved ones, who have known the constant pangs of hunger, of never having enough food, electricity and fuel, who have had their country cut in two and been told by a national hero to collaborate with an age-old enemy, who have been informed on or informed, been imprisoned and tortured - only those can speak of what it was really like to have lived in Paris during the Nazi Occupation of 1940-44.\\"The closing sentences of the Prologue succinctly state why this book is important reading in light of the United States' current foreign policy, \\"In times of collective uncertainty, voices will always rise up legitimizing violence in the interest of the common good. To not be seduced, we need to learn how to listen.\\""},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"What makes this book interesting is that it includes heretofore unpublished transcripts of meetings between Gurdjieff and his pupils in Paris between 1940 and 1944. The voice and language of Mr. G. here is very different from anything else written by about him, such as Views from The Real World, Fragments of An Unknown Teaching, All and Everything, Meetings with Remarkable Men. The voice is somewhat similar to accounts of conversations with him in the memoirs of various pupils who knew him at the end of his life, such as J.G. Bennett, Rina Hands and A.L. Stavely. He language is strange, obscure, rough. One gets the feeling that what he is saying is important, but no more important than HOW he is saying it and WHO he is saying it too, and this is not information that we are privy to some seven decades later. Thus, it hard to be certain exactly what he is driving at in many instances, and hard to know if what he is saying to particular individauls in his Paris apartment during the middle of World War II is applicable to others.These meetings were transcribed by Solita Solano, a member of G. women's group known as \\"The Rope.\\" Upon her death, they were given to the Library of Congress, where they are accessible to individuals who make arrangements to see them. The transcripts were NOT copyrighted. Patterson evidently made copies of these transcripts and decided to publish them under his name. In order to have some justification in asserting \\"authorship,\\" he surrounded these transcripts with an extremely generic account of what life was like in Nazi-occupied Paris and some historical contexts such as news-like accounts of major events taking place during those years. This part is very boring. Patterson HIMSELF has almost nothing interesting to say about Hitler, Vichy France, Nazis, other Germans, Jews, French people, life during wartime, and anything else that he decides to write about. It is like reading an undergraduate thesis on the topic -- very basic and unimaginative.In short...the material here actually written by the author is boring and not useful at all, while the interesting captivating parts were the ideas of another man, a most remarkable man, and then transcribed by one of his more remarkable pupils and made freely available by her to anyone interested through the Library of Congress. Patterson seems to be dishonest in trying to pass the contents of this book off as \\"his,\\" and is obviously making money anytime a reader interested in GURDJIEFF's IDEAS (not Pattersons) purchases a copy. In fact Patterson's parts of the book are the part that can be safely skipped or just skimmed over.Recommended for Gurdjieff completists, and those more interested in his personality and demeanor rather than his actual teaching or method."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"It is useful to compare the fate of Heidegger, the philosopher of Being, with that of the shadowy Gurdjieff, with his mysticism of Being, during the era of Nazism and the Holocaust. As much as one might detest the reactionary nature of his thinking, and the abuse of the mystic tradition for occult purposes, every man is innocent until proven guilty, notwithstanding the incontestable rumours, indeed outright Gurdjieff fascists one meets. As this work shows (though hardly in any conclusive fashion) these years are probably accounted for.In fact his critics have perhaps missed the point in their undeground whispers, which is that a man like Gurdjieff was much too smart to make the mistakes of Heidegger or get caught at anything. The point can be seen in a Spengler, whose own reactionary works such as Prussianism and Socialism certainly influenced the catastrophe, although their author was himself taken by surprise. And this different criticism is and remains the point, for the impulse is of such extreme cultural anti-modernism and the implaccable emnity to liberal societies dressed up in spirituality.Mr. Patterson's account is useful, interesting, but too doggedly devoted to a teaching he seems incapable of grasping in its full set of omens, which include the powers of occultists in these dark times, and low and behold a quite innocent case who gave sweets to children, an occultist in sufi trappings. Cleared of all charges. Case dismissed. Great spiritual sage. Tremendously inspiring force for the great spiritual restoration.In any case Patterson's work is quite incomplete, but a useful addition to the documentation of this dangerous man. You wish the author would wake up a bit."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"I had just begun Voices in the Dark when the September 11th attacks occurred, and this book began to speak to me in a way that few other books could have. Living with fear daily is so new to me as an American, and here were people, ordinary people as well as resistance fighters, living for years with fear. Although I'd read some history of World War II and what it was like for the French living under the Nazi occupation, this book made these people and the times really come alive. The people that went to the meetings that Gurdjieff held during those dangerous times were heroic in a very deep way. They risked death just to be out on the streets after curfew, and once in the meetings what they talked about were their personal struggles with spiritual transformation. I was very moved by Gurdjieff staying in Paris with his students when he could have easily gone to a safe country while the war lasted.Voices in the Dark is an inspiring book. I found its depth and insights very invigorating, and saw how a true teaching goes beyond individual self-growth. I've learned a lot about what fear and the uncertainty of life are about, and they've receded in importance for me. I found in this book new ways to think and perceive life, and it points to much more."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"This book has as its axis, the transcripts of wartime meetings with Gurdjieff in Paris. These meetings are characterized by warmth, humor, copious work-reports, and personalized advice for questioners.The book interleaves the transcripts with descriptions of the war that was raging outside. In contrast to that frenzy, the meetings themselves stand out as a quiet sanctuary. The overall impression is of two very different momentums, one driving Paris, the other 6 rue-de Colonels Renard.Similar to 'The Struggle of the Magicians', this book has an innovative structure at heart. In the 'Struggle..', the Work was stretched out on linear time, as though drawing an arrow on a bow. In 'Voices..', there is an 'alternation', time as a circle, day and night.I have avidly read all of Mr. Patterson's books. Honesty, an attention to detail, and a deep feeling for the Work, animate all his books. His relentless focus on reminding the primacy of Gurdjieff is much needed in these fragmented times.My gratitude for the taste, the vision, the constant note."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"Amazing never before published transcripts of Gurdjieff's meetings. Excellent book. There are few books that one reads that stay with you for a lifetime---this is such a book. And, its timeliness couldn't be more appropriate given the current world condition."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"We have here an engaging chronicle of the last years of G. I. Gurdjieff's life set against the tragic backdrop of war, its madness, shame and deprivation. Paris was under Nazi occupation for over four years during the Second World War, beginning in June 1940. All during this period, Gurdjieff continued to live in his small apartment at 6 rue des Colonels-Renard, where he met regularly with his students.There are thirty-two transcripts of these meetings, which were attended at great hazard, with spies and checkpoints everywhere. The discussion is focused on the spiritual work of self-remembering and self-observation which Mr. Gurdjieff is teaching. He is not interested in \\"who wins war . . . all have ideals, all have peaceful purpose, all kill.\\" He has seen enough of war and revolution, what he calls man's \\"chief particularity. . . the periodic arising in them of. . .the urgent need to destroy everything outside themselves\\". For him, war is the result of the slavery that men have accepted and embraced as their lot. There can be just one solution to war and that is to teach men and women how to free themselves from the hypnotism of contemporary life.Alongside Gurdjieff's quiet discussions with his pupils, we hear Hitler's historical justifications, the fumbling and surprise of politicians and military men as France's defenses fail and she is overrun, the rationalizations for collaboration and the calls for resistance from her intellectuals on the right and the left. The author has faithfully drawn a picture of the crisis Hitler represented for the West. He points to the passive support Hitler received from the elites of many countries. They admired the new \\"barbarians\\" and hoped the Germans would deal a blow to communism. We also hear brave accounts of the resistance, and the challenge to action facing writers like Albert Camus, Andre Malraux, and Francois Mauriac. We see Charles de Gaulle, with his difficult personality which isolated him from the rest of the French military before the invasion, and how well it suited him for the historical role he would eventually play, pressuring Churchill and Eisenhower on behalf of the Free French Forces.With these two perspectives, author Patterson has given us a new point from which to see those conflicted times. He casts new light on the often puzzling mystic and teacher, Gurdjieff. This is a remarkable meditation on war and I recommend it highly. It was nominated for the National Book Awards in 2001. Well researched and documented, it is an extremely interesting read and it will be welcomed by serious students of the Gurdjieff work as well as general readers."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"&quot;Voices in the Dark&quot; gave me a greater appreciation of the Work. The people who were in the Work continued their self-exploration even though they were in the midst of WWII. It must have been very difficult under these conditions of war to keep to one's spiritual aim, but it showed what Gurdjieff's students valued. For most people, however, the war became the focus of their lives. This juxtaposition was beautifully illustrated by the interweaving of what was happening in the war through the writings of people of that time and the transcripts of meetings that Gurdjieff held with his students. Reading this book reminded me that hope needs to be placed in consciousness and Being and not on the external conditions. For that reminder I am grateful."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"I found Voices In The dark an engrossing book to read. For starters, the context in which the voices speak is unique. We hear many disparate voices in this book brought to extremes by the \\"terror of the situation\\" along with the voice of Gurdjieff addressing the questions that his students struggle to understand and work with. The contrast is very sharp and makes for a force of opposites that propels this book through. I realized while reading it that my own life is so simple compared to those living in Paris in 1940-44. True, we now have the aftermath of September 11th but somehow that threat and future threats seem different-we don't see an enemy at every turn during our daily lives. The Nazi presence in Paris from 1940-1944 was very visible and one's life and safety could never be taken for granted. These are the circumstances under which Gurdjieff and his students lived while he continued to teach and they struggled with themselves. Gurdjieff's voice comes across as kinder and more sensitive than had been imagined. To hear his student's attempts to be sincere in their questions without indulging in personal fears for safety was humbling. I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"This work gives a sense of how G. I. Gurdjieff taught during the last years of his life through the transcipts of the meetings that took place in Nazi-occupied Paris. Juxtaposed with these meetings is a concise, mostly biographical history of the German war with and the occupation of France. The main characters of this drama from all sides are introduced. Some we know well like Hitler, others like Camus and Sartre we know mostly as writers. It is through their eyes that the story of the war is told.The transcripts themselves show Gurdjieff working with students and give a sense of the seriousness and intention of the students to work for self-transformation despite the outer conditions of their lives. They show Gurdjieff giving exercises and bringing the students to a sense of their nothingness. There is an emphasis on working with centers, balancing them, having them work together at the same time. They also show him trying to get students to sense themselves as a whole.This book is a must-read for anyone interested in seeing a deeper aspect of Gurdjieff and his teaching."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"Voices in the Dark gives a historical perspective on the Gurdjieff work, placing authentic transcripts of meetings with his students in the context of the extremely difficult and traumatic experience of living in Nazi-occupied Paris. Patterson adds additional dimensions to this time through the reactions, feelings, and thoughts of some of the most important writers, philosophers, and power-players of the day. This book gives excellent insights into a situation in which the search for meaning was not just important, but urgent and critical. The bravery and the commitment to their aim that Gurdjieff and his students showed in the face of constant danger and uncertainty is inspiring and Patterson's presentation of their story honors them."},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"There are few books that one reads that stay with you for a lifetime---this is such a book. And, its timeliness couldn&#65533;t be more appropriate given the current world condition. Not only does Voices in the Dark give a startling inside view to Nazi-occupied France but it also contains meeting notes held by George Gurdjieff with his students during that time. I had never read these notes anywhere before---what a gift Mr. Patterson has given us by unearthing these notes and bringing them to light for all to read.For me, this book is masterful and one of its powers lies in its architecture. Mr. Patterson interweaved the events of the period with the transcripts of Mr. Gurdjieff&#65533;s meetings. This had the effect of evoking a palpable taste of the outer war and metaphorically, at a deeper level, the inner struggle as well. In reading the meetings it was as if time had stopped&#65533;or better yet, it was like entering a world out of time, bathed in Reason and Conscience. That the contents of the meetings lacked talk of concern for one&#65533;s safety, or a discussion of the day&#65533;s outer events, or the lack of food, etc, really shot deep with me. It showed what can be possible---a level of seriousness in the search for true Being even amidst the horrific circumstances of the times.In the book, the quote below of Mr. Gurdjieff continues to resonate the living Wisdom he brought:&#65533;I not interested in who wins war. Not have patriotism or big ideals about peace. Americans, with ideals, kill millions of Germans, Germans kill---with own ideals---English, French, Russian, Belgian---all have ideals, all have peaceful purpose, all kill.&#65533;"},{"Title":"Voices in the Dark: Esoteric, Occult & Secular Voices in Nazi-Occupied Paris, 1940-44","review":"William Patterson's Voices In The Dark provides a very different focus on Nazi-occupied Paris from 1940-44: it explores the influence of the pseudo-occult in the idealogy of the new order, including the transcripts of the wartime meetings of Gurdjieff in Paris and considering both philosophical, social and spiritual conflicts under occupation. Voices in the Dark offers a different, involving guide which is unique in its approach."},{"Title":"Ziglar on Selling: The Ultimate Handbook for the Complete Sales Professional","review":"A must read!!

It being a novel, there is also a love story. Mary Barton, daughter of a soured mill-hand, attracts the attention of two men: Henry Carson, son of one of the mill owners, and Jem Wilson, a worker. She chooses Carson (a big mistake, of course). Later Carson is killed and Wilson is suspected of the crime with jealousy as his motive. But Mary learns that her father, John, is actually the murderer, and she spends a good portion of the second half of the book trying to prove Wilson's innocence (she now realizes her mistake in picking Carson over her true feelings of love for Wilson) without implicating her father. John Barton is wracked with guilt, however, and makes a deathbed confession to Carson's father that redeems him. It's an energetic book, and the story moves forward swiftly. The trial scenes are especially stirring. MARY BARTON was one of the first novels set exclusively among the working classes, and the book was highly regarded by the public and critics alike (though the Manchester mill owners protested against it)."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"This book is a true classic along with all the books of the early to mid-1800's.

I have to admit that I began to feel like every character in this book was going to die before it was over. But it was compelling. I ached for the people who had really lived such lives, for though I knew I was reading fiction, I also knew I was reading of life as it was for many in Gaskell's time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone struggling with depression or anxiety. I have loved the screen adaptations of Elisabeth Gaskell's works, but I did think to myself, as I read this one, that it would be a very hard movie to watch.I \\"couldn't put the book down,\\" but sometimes I had to go find something happy to do for a while before I could read again."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"This novel combines realism, social compassion, 19th century middle class limitations and melodrama. The number of harrowing deaths, though probably realistic, is artistically excessive. There are powerful descriptions of the squalor and poverty of mid-19th century working class families, as well as of the modest comfort of better-off workers, such as John Barton once was. The squalor of the town is occasionally contrasted with the idyllic countryside, as in the opening pages and in the memory of Alice. Scenes in the thronged harbour of Liverpool and in the factory where Jem works convey the dynamic power of the Industrial Revolution.The attitude of the classes is well contrasted. John Barton refuses to believe that in bad time the masters suffer, too. He believes in organization; in the end he accepts violence against the masters rather than against blacklegs. The masters on their side accept the laws of competition. While there are occasions of casual charity, in general they have no comprehension of the situation of the poor. They show contempt for the working class and ruthlessness when they feel challenged.But the only solution Mrs Gaskell offers is more understanding from the masters; more willingness to explain the economic reasons why they cannot increase wages, both in their own and, in the long run, in their men's interest; and a lot of Christian spirit which obliges the strong to help the weak. There is no glimmering of an idea that the State should be involved in this at all; and although John Barton is a Chartist, there is only one scant reference to what the Charter was about (i.e. to get working men into Parliament in the hope that Parliament - i.e. the State - could do something to help the poor. In fact the local delegation of \`Chartists' going up to London in 1839 are not, according to her, thinking of the six points of the Charter, but of laws against machines, for shorter hours, for permission to let under-age children work for their living [!], for free trade etc.)Mrs Gaskell herself accepts middle class ideas that the workers are generally improvident and that they are worked up by outside agitators. She does not understand why strikers should not act against blacklegs; she feels that combinations for striking are evil; she makes Job Legh complain about being forced to be a member of a union. John Barton is said not to be such a fool as to have Owenite ideas of equality.So, for all her undoubted sympathy for the lot of the workers, Mrs Gaskell is trapped in the well-meaning but condescending bourgeois thinking of her time. Of possible political solutions she has no idea."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"Two men love the Mary Barton- one she has known her entire life being from the same poor neighborhood as her while the other is from a wealthy family. What should she do?Mary Barton's life doesn't go according to plan and her life is changed forever! Set in the 1840's during the industrial upheaval in England, Glaskell takes the reader on a journey through love, loss, social restrictions, death, murder, and redemption. Great cast of characters that come together to create a well written and moving story- the beautiful Mary, faithful Margret, devoted Jem, simple Job, doting John, and meddling Esther, to name a few.As a fan of Austen as well as Glaskell's 'North and South' and 'Wives and Daughters', it did not disappoint- could not put it down! I really enjoyed this book - a real page turner!!"},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"I read each word and absorbed it as though my mind were a sponge because Gaskell's viewpoint was so sensible and thought provoking. In light of our current economic and political situation, national and global, I've been thinking a lot about class struggle and more importantly the issues of workers and business owners. So much of our hostility in the political arena is related to this issue particularly now since all groups are suffering.Gaskell addresses this issue beautifully and from the reader's viewpoint seems to be in favor of the workers with the objective of evoking sympathy towards them. In reality, her portrayal probably WAS the workers' viewpoint. It provided phenomenal insight into the mindset of the social group, specifically union factory workers within the human interest context of their daily lives and suffering with the added bonus of a bittersweet love story. It made me more aware and better able to understand the importance of sound economic practices and the government's responsibility towards keeping their largest population afloat."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"We live in a word where poverty is no longer something we see everyday. Many of us live cushy lives where we hear about people living on the streets, and don't think twice about them. This book brings home the horrors of mass poverty, and the cruelty and neglect of those who live in comparative comfort off the labor of those who suffer. We are more and more seeing these times coming back to life here in America as well as many other places. Class distinctions are once again increasing. We live in a world where people describe real life events as being \\"just like the movies\\" when shouldn't it be the other way around? Do any of us truly see what our neighbor suffers, and take the time to do something about it? This book serves as a warning to us on how to care for our neighbor, and love one another, live according to a moral code without rashly judging others for what they must do. It is a lesson as valuable today as it was then. Hard to put down, gripping narrative. Truly a heart wrenching read!"},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"Although this is not Gaskell's best novel, it is still well done and contains quite a bit of drama and romance. Much of the book concentrates on life in a manufacturing town, however, the love story has a prominent place. The characters in this book are lovable and fallable, as usual in Gaskell's work, and overall very realistic. This novel is set up much like \\"North and South\\" yet not as well put together, and with quite different characters. There is the struggle between masters and men and a love affair unrequitted on the female end with family and friends dropping like flies on account of mental or physical anxiety. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes Gaskell, Dickens, and the time period of early industrialization in England.As to the edition, Everyman's Library always makes a nice hard copy. It includes a biography and timeline of work as well as the author's preface and an introduction by Jenny Uglow."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"Mary Barton is the first novel of Elizabeth Gaskell, a female writer who left her influence upon other English writers of the 19th century, like, for instance, Charles Dickens. The book is only an average view about Manchester life in the 19th century, focusing its attentions over the extreme poverty of the working class, the first labor conflicts in the pre-dawn of the Industrial Revolution, all this connected with a tender love story between the young Mary Barton and his old time friend Jem Wilson.In fact, the murder of the young mill owner, Mr. Henry Carson - he too an admirer of Miss Barton - is not well developed and is not the central point of the novel because the reader knows all the time who is the real murderer. So, it's not a surprise at all the ending of the trial and the revelation of the real murderer in the last chapters.Miss Gaskell has a simple and an almost n&auml;ive vision of the social problems that harassed the working class in England when the Industrial Revolution started. Even though, we must recognize that she made a good work trying to denounce the insensibility of the English government about the problems of the workers and their families and the inflexibility of the mill owners and other high economic classes to negociate with their subordinates.Mary Barton is a book that will hold the attencion of the readers, men or women, because Miss Gaskell has an elegant style and really knows how to tell a good story. Another great vintage of this novel are some great characters portrayed with flavour and undeniable charm, like the old and friendly Mr. Job Legh and the hard and anger John Barton, Mary's father."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"Very good condition.

We see the struggles on the middle class in London in the 19th century and we also see the heart racing chase and trial. I found the book to be very engaging and romantic."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"Like I said yesterday, the mass market makes all Modern Art possible, it is what they call \\"sine qua non\\" in the legal profession. There is no better example of this phenomenon then the example of the so-called Rise of the Novel. The Rise of the Novel led to the hey-day of the Novel as an autonomous art form, Richardson and De Foe, a printer and hack writer respectively, gave way to The Bronte Sisters, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens: Self-conscious stylists who were both aware of the novel as a form of art AND the tastes and needs of the mass market. This is a period that lasted until the \\"Modern\\" Literature revolution of 1922, a year in which T.S. Eliot published The Wasteland and James Joyce published Ulysses. The modernist revolution carried with it a rejection of the mass market and the accompanying idea of the autonomous, independent artist/creator typically in the guise of some kind of authenticity/purity requirement.I would argue that this beginning of audience-less art was a wrong turn. To give an example of how the rejection of mass market appeal began to pollute the form of the Novel, you can look at Elizabeth Gaskell's first novel, Mary Barton. Mary Barton was published in 1848, but set in the 1830s, in Manchester during a national recession/depression. Mary Barton is at least partially written in dialect, and it concerns the murder of a Factory owner's son and the ensuing investigation. Mary Barton herself is a Manchester Dress Shop girl (not a factory girl) who is the shared object of attraction between the murdered and the accused.Mary Barton is kind of like the smash-hit book/movie The Help because Barton herself lived in Manchester and was part of the factory-owning social class in Manchester when this book was published. Awkward talk at parties, for sure. At the time it was published, Mary Barton was hailed for what critics call it's \\"realism\\" but that's probably because the vocabulary for expressing concerns over class disparity was in it's infancy- Marxism hadn't even \\"happened\\" when Mary Barton was published. Realistic depiction of the living conditions of the industrial working class was definitively a \\"trend\\" when Mary Barton was written, and the similar factual depictions of these conditions- in Government and reformers reports, had been available for ten years.But the introduction of the labor union stuff certainly diminishes the style of the Novel. Her third person Narrator hovers awkwardly over the proceedings, and the essential tie between the underlying economic conditions and the behavior of the characters seems forced. At the same time, there is sheer joy in the depictions themselves, as well as the dialect of the characters. One interesting point along this line is that the word \\"ask\\" is repeatedly written as \\"ax\\" a linguistic phenomenon that exists up until today.Already though in 1848 you can foresee the perilous rocks of social concern and grand artistic purpose beginning to creep into a previously joyous art form. Critics are beginning to fence off the territory of \\"realism\\" from sloppy description and social consciousness is beginning rear its style-wrecking head. At the end of the process, in about 1922, the novel will take it's leave from the concerns of the audience and depart on a journey into the heart of self-awareness, but in 1848 no one was there yet."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"This is possibly the most devastating, yet uplifting novels I've ever read. The book explores the lives of the working class poor in Manchester, England, during the 1840s, a period of strife and hunger. The pretty, young, naive Mary Barton persues a romance with handsome, dashing Harry Carson, son the mill owner, while spurning the attentions of her childhood friend, Jem Wilson, who loves her passionately. Mary's intentions, however, are less than noble; while certainly attracted to Harry, she wishes to improve the lot of herself and her father, John, who, disconsolate over the loss of his wife and only son and the attendant poverty after the loss of his job, has slipped into a daze of opium and seeks vengeance against the Carsons for putting him into this position. This eventually leads to tragedy and redemption. Gaskell writes as if her life depended on it; she describes the horrible conditions of the Manchester poor with searing vision, and makes the influence of radicalism completely understandable, even if she doesn't always agree with it. The delineation of character is quite remarkable; one's heart beats faster as Mary realises who it is she really loves and particularly when she is forced to protect, against incredible odds, both of the men that truly love her. Admittedly, the second half of the book, detailing the murder and subsequent trial, is quite melodramatic, but it's grippingly told. A magnificent work that should be required reading."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"Actually I read this book in three days' time (it can be even faster if I don't have to go to school). Anyway, Mrs. Gaskell's depiction of the working class people in Manchester during the 19th century was so vivid that you can just *see* and *feel* how the rich and the poor's lives were like back then by turning the pages. I believe no one who had read this book will not to some extent feel pity for the tragic hero, John Barton, in the story. But aside from this formal social theme being presented in the novel, there is also a very strong sense of religious/moral theme in it (espeically near the end of the story), as well as some drama and romance in it. Definitely worth a read, especially to those who are interested in Victorian Literature."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"Gaskell wrote one of the most vivid descriptions of the gap between rich and poor in this novel of the Manchester 'hungry forties'.The romantic plot centers around the murder of the son of a factory owner. While well written, the plot romance and mystery are almost cursory in comparison to the loving detail that Gaskell lavishes on Alice Wilson, the temptation of Esther, and all the little points of life in deep poverty. Gaskell is compassionate and clear-sighted in her writing, making this a very nice read.Mary Barton appeals to readers of all ages, and works at the level of both plot and social history. Recommended for fans of the period, historians, and general readers."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"This is a fine book, full of beautifully rendered characters. I love the painful and powerful picture Gaskell paints of life among the English working classes-- the struggles for physical and spiritual survival against horrific odds is rendered with compassion and depth. Her writing is emotionally rich and I found myself truly moved by the all the characters. The friendship between Mary and Margaret, the gentle, but rock solid faith of Alice, the passion of Jem, etc. This book is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"After watching the 2005 BBC TV-adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel \\"North and South\\", I was intrigued to go back and read the novel. I liked it so much, that I wanted to read more, and so found \\"Mary Barton\\". In both novels, I was impressed with Elizabeth Gaskell's keen insight into the human spirit - despair, doubt, kindness, love, compassion, hopelessness, loyalty, frivolity, and most of everything in between. She has a rare talent to create believable male and female characters (with their inherent differences in perception and interpretation) at all walks of life, and to inspire compassion and understanding for all her characters' actions. The plot is largely divided between mystery and romance, both of which are done well. This is definitely a book I would recommend to fellow Austen fans!Compared to the majority of modern novels, her writing has more of a leisurely pace to it and she takes the time to describe the emotional inner workings of her characters as much as she devotes to outward plot development. The frequent historical or literary references not immediately at a current-day reader's fingertips are explained well in this edition's notes at the end for those who want to know (like me).Historically, this book is a fascinating treatise of the working class toil, life, and death in the mid-1800s in Manchester, England, the rise of trade unions, and the trouble attendant therewith. Gaskell's astute observations about the living conditions of the poor in that day and age make for a compelling and thought-provoking read. It is hard to leave her books not feeling that the two opposite points of view of masters and men can be true, and that compassion might go a long way to bridge the gap."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"A tale of Manchester working life set in the 1830s, Mary Barton begins as bucolically as any gritty urban novel can. The Bartons, who are expecting an addition to the family, meet the Wilsons, who are carrying their infant twins, at Green Heys Fields. The charm of these low, flat, treeless tracts lies in their rural contrast to \\"the busy, bustling manufacturing town [he] left but half an hour ago.\\" The couples adjourn to the Barton home for tea, where Gaskell lovingly describes every modest luxury such working folk can manage--the bright green japanned tea tray with its scarlet lovers, the cupboard of crockery and glass of which Mrs. Barton is so proud, and the hodgepodge of furniture (\\"sure sign of good times among the mills\\"). In honor of their guests, the Bartons send young Mary out for fresh eggs (\\"one a-piece, that will be five pence\\"), milk, bread, and Cumberland ham.Thus Mary Barton commences with a self-conscious air of cautious prosperity, but underneath the pleasure of the occasion are hints of despair to come--Mrs. Barton's distress over the disappearance of her sister, and the Wilsons' \\"little, feeble twins, inheriting the frail appearance of their mother.\\" In chapters I and II, Gaskell sets up the end of abundance and joy for the Bartons and the beginning of misery for their entire class in the mill city of Manchester.Mary Barton is a novel of contrasts. While the Bartons take homely pride in their furniture and wares, the Carsons live in a \\"good house . . . furnished with disregard to expense . . . [with] much taste shown, and many articles chosen for their beauty and elegance.\\" As Carson's former employee, Ben Davenport, lies dying in a filthy basement in the company of his wife and children, who are \\"too young to work, but not too young to be cold and hungry,\\" Carson's youngest daughter Amy tells her brother and father that she \\"can't live without flowers and scents\\" and that \\"life was not worth having without flowers.\\" They can't live without food and shelter, and she thinks she can't live without luxuries. Perhaps the most terrible contrast is between the \\"listless, sleepy\\" Carson sisters and the tragedy that interrupts their idle chatter.The contrast and conflict between the rich and the poor, the men and the masters, is not conventionally based on envy or even class; Carson was once no better and no richer than anyone else. The men don't aspire to wealth, at least for now. They want to feed their families and perhaps to enjoy the simple comforts the Bartons once shared with the Wilsons. What keeps masters and men apart is not class or money, but a more fundamental unwillingness to acknowledge the other's humanity. Mr. Carson can't be bothered to recall who Ben Davenport is, other than one of the many faceless men who worked for him for many years, or to give Wilson more than a useless outpatient order. Instead of approaching the masters, the men, who are powerless as individuals, join groups and send delegates like John Barton to London and Glasgow to try to gain government support for their cause. On their own, they fail.Neither side is willing to break the communication barrier. Ignoring one of their number who wisely notes, \\"I don't see how our interests can be separated,\\" the masters choose to hide the conundrum they face from the men, who are described as \\"cruel brutes . . . more like wild beasts than human beings.\\" Even as the omniscient narrator shows the just causes for both groups' anger toward one another and tries to avoid demonstrating a preference, she can't resist retorting parenthetically, \\"Well, who might have made them [the men] different?\\" It takes a murder and a near miscarriage of justice merely to open the door to redemption for the man in each side's leading role.Mary becomes the fulcrum of the characters and plot, connecting the Bartons to the Carsons, the unforgiving John to the repentant Esther, the worldly men and the more spiritually minded women. Through positive and negative models like Alice, Job, Margaret, Esther, Mrs. Wilson, and Sally, and through her true and patient if frustrated lover, Mary avoids Esther's fate and is transformed from a heedless young girl into a courageous woman who is able to withstand the pull of her divided loyalties.Confronted with the undeniable humanity of John Barton and the relentlessness of his unfamiliar poverty, Mr. Carson finally recognizes the need for change. As guardian of the old institutions, however, he struggles with his ambivalence toward taking action. Meanwhile, Mary Barton simply leaves the dead and the past behind to embrace an entirely different kind of future in a new country.Mary Barton lacks some of the psychological depth and nuances that make Gaskell's Wives and Daughters more interesting and engaging; here, the characters behave consistently and predictably. Despite the ease of its characterizations and assumptions, though, Mary Barton is a surprisingly stark, unvarnished look at the poorer, seamier side of urban industrial life. Gaskell accomplishes what the masters and men have failed to do--she recognizes the humanity in each of them and hints at its potential if only it is discovered and embraced.Copyright 2009 by Diane L.

I think I was scared off by the summary of the book which made it sound a bit depressing. But this is such a wonderful book! Gaskell writes with such apt descriptions as to make you really feel like you become part of that Manchester world. The chapter detailing the mill fire and rescue had me sitting on the edge of my seat. She manages to convey suspense in a way that's not overdone or cute-sy.I loved this Oxford edition that had an appendix. It really increased my understanding of the original meaning of words not common to us now. You get the sense that Gaskell picked every word with so much care, and with the intention of providing the deepest understanding. Knowing her personal history with regard to why she wrote this book (the death of her child) made the book more meaningful to me, too, because there is a lot of strife and suffering in this book amid the hope that Mary has.The characters are rich and unforgettable. Anyone that is a Gaskell or Austin fan should give Mary Barton a try. I'm so glad I did."},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"If you are like me, you probably picked up Mary Barton after reading the literary classic, North and South. Mary Barton and North and South have many similarities. Both novels deal with the oppression of the working class and the effect of machinery on those who once earned their bread by performing the same task by hand.Mary Barton is no Margaret Hale. Instead, Mary is the daughter of a union striker, who places her sights on a wealthy mill owners son named Henry Carson. Mary has lived a life so full of privations that her one goal in life is never to suffer the poverty her mother had to endure.Like North and South, this novel is full of illness and death due to extreme poverty. It is written in the introduction that Gaskell wrote this novel shortly after losing a child. Her terrible lose echoes through the characters who lose child after child throughout the novel.Mary Barton was an ambitious first novel. The romantic triangle between Mary, Henry, and Jem Wilson was a little abrupt, but once her choice is made, her sentiments towards her beloved reminded me of John Thornton's love for Margaret Hale. If you loved North and South, this is an excellent novel to indulge in!"},{"Title":"Mary Barton: A tale of Manchester life","review":"The Norton Critical Edition contains not only the original footnotes, but also much critical commentary from early reviewers.

Day-Lewis) onto the Great Gladys, as Philip Larkin described her, the book combines pure farce, two murders, and a large amount of satire on Agatha Christie's &quot;Murder at the Vicarage&quot;, with several of the characters (the vicar, curate, etc.,'s importance to the tale, and their reversal by Mitchell), and the sheer amount of secrets and shameful past every character is concealing. The detection is done in a workman-like fashion by the greatest female detective of all time, Mrs Beatrice Adela Lestrange Bradley, later being made a Dame, and the ending is ingenious. All in all, one of the true classics of the genre (though her previous novels, &quot;Speedy Death&quot;, and &quot;The Longer Bodies&quot;, come close)."},{"Title":"The Saltmarsh murders","review":"When Beatrice Adela Lestrange Bradley accepted an invitation to visit the quiet village of Saltmarsh neither she, nor her hosts expected that her short visit would be so long or so eventful. The village fair was supposed to be the high point of the visit, but when the murder of an unwed mother, and the disappearance of the baby took place things began to get lively in the usually quiet little town. The persistent Mrs Bradley enlists the assistance of the local curate (who narrates the tale) to ferret out the answers to this and other matters, including a second missing young woman, a smuggling ring, a case of incest and illicit romances. In her own unique manner Mrs Bradley manages to solve these and other intriguing mysteries before bringing the culprit to justice.This is the third in the Mrs Bradley series of mysteries featuring the outspoken, eccentric Beatrice Adela Bradley, a twice married trained psychologist sleuth - a particularly unusual background in the late 1920's when these stories began. When these novels were first published they were as popular as the other series from the 'Golden Age of Mysteries' that are perhaps better known today, Agatha Christie's 'Hercule Poirot' and Dorothy Sayers' 'Lord Peter Wimsey'. Mitchell's works had been largely forgotten until a series of Mrs Bradley mysteries starring Diana Rigg appeared on PBS. The tv series took liberties with Mrs Bradley's depiction, making her younger, taller and more personable. The original stories though are excellent. The tone of the stories are a cross between Agatha Christie and P G Wodehouse, the mysteries are puzzling enough to keep the readers guessing while the situations and witty dialog while keep them laughing.Fans of Christie, Sayers or others from the 'Golden Age of Mysteries' (the 20's and 30's) will want to read whatever of this series they can locate whether they have seen Diana Rigg's portrayal of the character or not."},{"Title":"The Saltmarsh murders","review":"I love the classic detectives of the Golden Age of British cozies: Miss Jane Marple, Miss Maud Silver, and Lord Roderick Alleyn. But I have a new favorite: Mrs. Beatrice Bradley. She's considerably less likable than any of the aforementioned, what with her yellowed, shriveled looks, her cackling laugh, her domineering personality, and her malicious wit. Yet, she's so sly, and the satire of early 20th century refined society is so delicious, that I think she may well dethrone Miss Marple in my heart. (Forgive me, Dame Agatha!)In this novel, Mrs. Bradley sleuths out the murderer of a \\"ruined\\" housemaid who had been keeping the father of her illegitimate baby a secret. Needless to say, police officials leap at the obvious, only to be shown up by \\"the Bradley,\\" as curate Noel Wells calls her. The curate narrates the tale, and his timidity and conformity to the conventional thinking of his day only add to the fun. So does his lack of self-awareness, which lead Reverend Wells to make some unintentionally funny remarks.Of course, I love the television version of Mrs. Bradley [The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries - Series 1 (Speedy Death / The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries)begins the television series]; however, that production, featuring a more chic and less quirky Mrs. Bradley, is quite, quite different from the books. You can view the television programs without ruining in the least the enjoyment of the novels."},{"Title":"Philosophy Beside Itself: On Deconstruction and Modernism (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"In PHILOSOPHY BESIDE ITSELF, Stephen Melville begins innocently enough by noting the inner significance of Jacques Derrida's speech at Johns Hopkins in 1967 in which Derrida had seen an \\"event\\" that signaled a rupturing between the ages old certainty in the full meaning of commonly accepted truisms like God, love, and man and the post-structuralist opposition to that belief. This event was not a thin line demarcating the two; rather Derrida envisioned a gradual blending of the Enlightenment's criticizing of literature \\"from the outside\\" with the twentieth century's Modernism criticizing \\"from the inside.\\" Now, if one simply reads the remainder of this book as the working out of this thesis, then one would be left with judging it on two levels. The first level is the superficial analysis of who gets included in Melville's tracing of the evolution of post World War One Modernism to mid century deconstruction. The second level relates to who and what does not get mentioned in the same span. Both levels, alas, succeed only too well in showing that Modernism, as transmitted by and through Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and ultimately through Derrida and de Man, is little more than the prettied up underside of the grotesqueness that we today call the post-Auschwitz era.The problem with the first level of reading Melville's book lies in who gets the most ink. There is little doubt that Derrida and later de Man have collectively had an immense impact on the evolution of literary theory, however, for a book that includes \\"modernism\\" in the title, there is precious little that relates to anyone not named Derrida or de Man. The fragmentary insights garnered by the Imagist poets of the 20s are strikingly absent. The stream of consciousness prose of Joyce and Faulkner is similarly omitted. What Melville has written is a paean to the pantheonic duo of deconstruction with no regard for a contrary view.The issues with the second level are far more troubling than who gets to pass through the rope raised by Melville at a deconstruction nightclub. These issues strike at the very core of what deconstruction so deftly hides under a torrent of abstruse and arcane prose. Essentially, what Derrida and other deconstructionists have done was to banish humanity from the cosmic consciousness that used to be called a soul. All texts--and by implication--all life could be divided between a pair of polar binaries. A \\"man\\" in the past would have occupied the privileged left slot with a \\"woman\\" relegated to the subordinate right. Derrida convincingly proved that if even a smidgeon of the one could be transposed to the other, the result was a destabilization of both such that certainty was now replaced by indeterminacy. From this, he concluded, that there was literally nothing that man could count on as a potential clamp on his baser instincts. By the time that Melville published this book, Paul de Man's anti-Semitic writings from 1941 and 1942 had been in the public eye for nearly four years. One might think that Melville would have at least mentioned de Man's writings from then. One unfortunately would be wrong. One might also think that Melville might have similarly mentioned Heidegger's admitted Nazi past. He did not. What Melville does do is to discuss deconstruction solely in the context of a literary text with no need to see what its non-deconstructive uses might be. And right there is the main problem with deconstruction."},{"Title":"Behind Closed Doors: Women's Oral Narratives in Tunis","review":"Fun and easy reading.

By the telling stories -often &quot;dissed&quot; as old wives tales - of women in non-traditional roles, or sometimes ordinary roles, these tales validated and placed a value on the lives of many women in a society which tended to devalue their existence.

It cost $15 then when purchased directly from Westinghouse T&D sales. After more than 40 years in the industry and a technical library of over 2000 volumns, the T&D book is still the most used in my collection. When I returned to graduate school in the '70's for advanced degrees, I had a professor that used to teach at the General Electric Power University tell me the Westinghouse T&D book was the only thing Westinghouse ever did that was better than what General Electric did. If you are an electrical engineer working in generation/transmission and your employer will only buy you one book, it should be the T&D book. The name is really a misnomer. Westinghouse has another classic book on Distribution. The T&D book would be better titled the Transmission and Generation book. It has plenty on Distribution for a Transmission engineer to get a good understanding, but Transmission is where it shines. The examples and photographs are dated of course, but the physics are just as valid today as they were the day they were published. There are estimating tables and computational tricks that I have never seen in another reference work. As the book gets more scarce, the difficulty of locating a copy in good condition is going to increase. I would hope that some entreprneur would acquire the rights and make this classiv more available to the next generation of power engineers."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"Wolfram takes on a difficult subject, the history of a people whose origins are crusted over with legends and generations of archaeological interpretations. Some of his conclusions have been challenged but Wolfram makes a solid case for many of his interpretations. His survey of Gothic history and culture is a landmark in Gothic research.The book is intended for academics and therefore includes numerous citations and end-notes and footnotes. If the reader can ignore all the note references, the narrative flows well enough. Wolfram's detailed analysis does dispell a few nationalistic myths, but he replaces them with a thorough retelling of Gothic history. Most reference works about ancient Germanic peoples tend to speak of the Goths in an offhand manner. But they left a lasting imprint on several parts of Europe and Asia, even if we can no longer feel their presence today. Wolfram does a good job of removing the Goths from legend and putting them back into history."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"Understanding the Goths and their role in history used to be simple. On the one hand, you could go along with Alexander Pope in his \\"Essay on Criticism,\\" and declare of the fall of Rome, \\"A second deluge learning thus o'errun, / And the monks finished what the Goths begun\\" (which is particularly pointed, given that Pope himself was a Catholic).On the other hand, you could praise them. The reasons for favoring the Goths were somewhat diverse. For example, the Victorian socialist and poet (and designer and fantasy novelist, etc.) William Morris portrayed them as wonderful examples of folk-solidarity against the corruption and imperialism of Rome.In Germany, at the same time, historians announced that they were convinced that the Goths demonstrated how the Germanic Race brought Freedom back into the world -- just like the Kaiser! (Leading Nietzsche to ask the difference between such a Conviction and an ordinary Lie. He also expressed relief that the ancient Germans, whose inferior blood had helped destroy the Roman Empire through intermarriage, were NOT ancestors of the modern Germans.)In America, broad-minded scholars, brought up on the doctrine of Anglo-Saxon Liberty (and the Norman Yoke), rushed to recognize the continental Goths as honorary Anglo-Saxons, extending a privileged status to at least some Europeans.All of these views (including Nietzsche's) depended on the assumption that the name Goth (and its variants) in ancient and early medieval texts always meant the same thing, and that the Ostrogoths and Visigoths were simply branches of the same original tribe -- \\"tribe\\" too being a term taken for granted (along with translating *gens* as *race*). This made things simple for archeologists; dig up something of about the right age in a place where \\"Goths\\" were supposed to have been living, and you know it was \\"Gothic.\\" Find something similar someplace else, and you had discovered Goths.Herwig Wolfram, reviewing another century of scholarship, shows that there are problems with every one of these assumptions (including Pope's). Even leaving aside the problem of the whole idea of a \\"tribe\\" as a recognizable entity (whether social or biological), ancient sources on the Goths and their divisions are not easy to understand. Entirely different population groups sometimes seem to have acquired the label, only to shed it again. Efforts to find a principle of continuity in royal dynasties follow the propaganda of self-promoted kings. And, of course, a whole body of writing from the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth is interwoven with theories of racial superiority.None of this makes for easy reading, or straightforward narrative. Instead, we get the clearing away of misconceptions, and an effort to evaluate competing modern theories. This is a really valuable book for anyone seriously interested in the problems associated with the later Roman Empire and the emergence of Barbarian Kingdoms in Italy and Spain. If you want a simple story, you will have to take your chances elsewhere."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"Herwig Wolfram's HISTORY OF THE GOTHS is probably the best one-volume survey volume, perhaps the only, available on the Gothic tribes. These tribes, the quintessential &quot;barbarians&quot; who sacked and then succeeded the Western Roman Empire, were an amalgam of Germanic and Slavic bloodlines, who ultimately ruled large sections of the former Empire, and most notably Iberia.As Wolfram admits, &quot;A Goth was anyone who said he was,&quot; and the book suffers from the same lack of focus. Although attempts are made to discuss the social structure, culture, and history, military and otherwise, of the Goths, the discussions are superficial, rambling, and without point, and leave the reader feeling inconclusive. Wolfram seems fearful of drawing conclusions in this book, as if hypothesis or informed opinion might make him seem an irresponsible historian.Who, after all, were these people, and why did they ravage Europe, and why were they so, finally, inestimably incapable of sustaining their identity? The book begs answers.In part, the fault may be the writing style, which is textbook dry and lacks any sense (or attempt) at vividness. Wolfram's Goths are museum pieces, not a living, breathing community of people.The scholarship of this work is exhaustive and astounding. Over half the book is comprised of Author's Notes and Bibliography. Certainly, if the reader has an abiding interest in Gothic history, this is a wonderful sourcebook for other, primary, materials.Reading much more like a dissertation than a popular work of history, HISTORY OF THE GOTHS is a tedious and boring read, unless, like the author, you find these vanished people compellingly fascinating."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"Wolfram's &quot;The History of the Goths&quot; is a work deserving of high praise. If you want a book to give you an insightful, well-researched, &amp; thoughtful glance at the Goths, then this is the one you'd want. It explores popular &quot;myths&quot; about the Goths from the Romantic era until the early- to mid-twentieth century. From there, we dive into a deep Ocean of ancient &amp; medieval history, the written sources, language, archaeology, &amp; many intriguing theories about the Goths - such as the question of their origins &amp; their homelands, traces of their oral literature found among written sources from Antiquity until the Middle Ages... &amp; thoughtful interpretations of &quot;conventional&quot; history, before &amp; after the &quot;fall&quot; of the Roman Empire.The Goths are one of those peoples from whom legends were made; sadly through a process of historical fate, &amp; grave misrepresentation, the Goths are all but forgotten to contemporary popular knowledge. This book tries successfully to understand the world &amp; culture of an ancient people so important to European history. If one has an inquiring mind, this book is no difficult read at all, - &amp; for this motivation, it's a worthwhile investment."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"What makes this book such tough sledding for the amateur historian? Is it because the book was translated from German to English? Whatever the cause, reading the book is as captivating as reading a similar account from an encyclopedia. It is more like reading a technical report than a book. Now the good news; the book is logically constructed, flows well, and has a dauntingly thorough bibliography. If you muster the self discipline to stay with the author, you will be rewarded with a deep knowledge of the Goths. It is a book by a historian for other academics. Frankly, there are more readable books on the subject available from other authors."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"When I first started to read this book I was sure I would not get beyond a few pages as it was extremely difficult reading. But because the Goths held an important position in European history I stuck with it even though it was difficult. The biggest help I got in understanding Wolfram's approach though was through other reviews on the Amazon website as I, like many other people who read history for fun rather than for more serious endeavors, thought of the Goths as just one group of people or at best two (Ostrogoth and Visigoth). Wolfram's portrayal of them as being of many (and possibly unknown) origins while difficult to comprehend makes sense once the reader understands his approach. I am now re-reading the book with my eye on dissecting each point rather than trying to read the book as a whole. It is making it much easier reading."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"This is by far the worst book on the Goths I have found to date. While I will happily grant that this is a difficult subject about which to write, given the dearth of written history from the era and region, Wolfram takes wild stabs at the truth using etymological evidence that no linguist would ever consider legitimate. Wolfram's considerable bibliography has a number of questionable sources and his critiques of competing scholars (hidden in the footnotes) are laughable. Most of his cultural details are pure guesswork based on shady linguistics and archaeology which has never really been identified as Gothic. Even the maps in the back are low quality (like a bad photocopy) and lack keys to explain what the various shadings are supposed to be.Insofar as my research has gone, the only book on the Goths that I can recommend is Peter Heather's &quot;Goths in the Fourth Century&quot; on Liverpool University Press, now sadly out of print. Interestingly, it points out a number of misreadings of contemporary texts that lead Wolfram to the wrong conclusions. Get this man an editor!"},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"I really have to wonder if previous reviewers have actually read this.Wolfram does not base his argument on linguistics (though his are fine - I checked) or on archaeology (which he clearly states is an unreliable guide). What he does do is make an incredibly exhaustive, cross-referenced study of all of the available sources and use that to write an ethnographic history of the ever-shifting and recombining peoples, Germanic and non-Germanic, who were called the \\"Goths.\\" That history he then uses to illuminate and make sense of the historical record. As he does this, Wolfram also effectively silences the old \\"racialist\\" histories that have made this subject so hard to deal with for so long.This is very tough going because of the dense writing (translated academic German can be a horror to wade though) and the extreme detail. And, yes, the reproduction of the maps is pretty terrible. It is still, however, one of the best histories I have read, period, and will likely be a source for study and a springboard for my own research for years to come. I'd recommend not dismissing it, especially when that dismissal is itself neither thoughtful nor accurate."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"This book illuminates and traces the history of the Goths from their time outside the Roman Empire in the third century A.D. until the Roman war against the Ostrogoths, which divided them into ultimate extinction. The reader gains an understanding about the Goth's formidable military power, which included quick flanking maneuvers, and large contingents of cavalry. To make the book more interesting, the author notes that religious differences added to the animosity between the Romans and Goths. Additionally, the writer recognizes the Gothic barbarian invasions against the Romans, a contributing factor to the fall of the Roman Empire. While usually a fragmented people, the Gothic lifestyle tended to revolve around wine and women. Especially, an enjoyable part of the book pertained to the way the author integrated the Goths with the Hunnish and Frankish peoples. Although a readable book, the prose does get monotonous after awhile. Overall, the author provides an excellent book for someone interested in Gothic or Roman history."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"Over 50% of this book is bibliography. Despite the title, it is not written in a history book format. The books exams in deep detail many facits of the Goths i.e. the first chapter exams the meaning of the word &quot;gens.&quot; Reading this book is hard work and a challenge. It is difficult to put the facts, as layed out by the author, in a historical time-line."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"Translated from the German, and in some ways almost a stereotype of German scholarship: big, heavy, dense (c. 620 pages), scrupulously annotated and documented (appendices, notes, bibliography, index, etc., make up exactly half of that length), and obsessed with the question of ethnogenesis. Dedicated almost entirely to political/institutional/constitutional history, with no coverage of art, literature, material culture, or the situations of ordinary people--exacerbated when the one throwaway reference to women (the women of Rome) sticks out as almost tasteless.Having said all that, it is definitely a good, serious book. Much better than Burns, for instance, who makes attempts at covering cultural matters but awkwardly; and on historical events, where Burns just makes a passing reference, Wolfram will actually tell you what happened. To make more cross-references, Wolfram totally accepts Goffart's interpretation of 'hospitalitas' as referring to land TAX, not to the actual land itself. Heather makes a lot of the same points but in a more popular vein - more superficial, less well documented.So, the scholarship is strong, it fits in well with other reading on the period, and the writing is better organized than a lot of books I complain about. And yet the text is dense and hard to read, the maps are downright painful to look at, and it's generally hard to get excited about, which all go to limit its rating."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"Herwig Wolfram's History of the Goths is very worth reading due to the fact that there is so much information in it. I have compared this book to Peter Heather's book on the Goths and found each book fairly easy to read if start at the beginning. I like the lineage charts included in Wolfram's book and as well the vast notes and references used. Wolfram has a very good knowledge of his subject, the Goths through the final days. I suggest watching the History Channel's videos called \\"Barbarians\\" first, to give you an overview. There's one episode called, \\"The Goths\\".I am normally not attracted to violence, but I needed to read this book on the Goth's history to write my own series of historical fiction based on many sources. This is one of the best resources, with commentary on how accurate ancient writers were in their accounts of the Goths.Ermentrude's Knot."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"For people studying European history, this is a good overview of the Goths, with particular emphasis on their expansion into Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries. If you are tracking back your ancient European origins, this becomes a necessary part of it. The book provides an overview of the people and events, and includes some genealogy charts, an extensive set of notes, a bibliography and an index. There are also a few maps illustrating the Goths expansion into Europe. Those of us with European origins have Goth ancestors way back when. They were barbarians who at some point became civilized Christians. Along the way they fought battles, sacked Rome, etc. They pretty much finished off the Roman Empire, and distracted the Romans while the the Saxons invaded what is now England (seeThe Saxon Chronicle A.D. 1 to A.D. 1154)"},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"In the first chapter Wolfram/Dunlap concentrate on the Gothic name which was first mentioned between 16 &18 A.D. by Latin and Greek authors who speak of \`Gutones' which is a weak derivative of Goths. The Gutones are mentioned until about 150 A.D. and then not again until 262 A.D., when Shapur I had a tri-lingual inscription made that mentioned Germanic, Gothic, & Roman troops he had defeated in 245 A.D. Several years later Claudius II assumed the name Gothicus, also the Greeks & Persians mention the Goths in text as well. In 300 A.D. the spelling Goth replaced the weak derivative Gutones almost altogether. The name Goths included a diverse Germanic & Non-Germanic peoples; in Italy- the Vandals, in Spain- the Gepids, Rugians, Sciri, Alans, & Burgundians. They were lumped together because of common faiths, laws, & languages. For the purpose of classification modern scholars created the term \`Eastern Germanic Peoples' that is commonly used today. The term Visigoth was also created, not by modern scholars but by Cassiodorus. As he understood them the Ostrogoths were the eastern Goths or Goths of the rising sun. So to make a geographical distinction Cassiodorus called the second group of Goths, also called the Tervingi-Vesi, the Visigoths for western Goths. The formation of the Gothic tribes before the invasion of the Huns is the topic of the second chapter. \\"As late as the sixth century Theodoric the Great insisted that his family had originated in Scandinavia and had made the long trek from there by way of Eastern Pomerania and the Vistula to the Black Sea, thence to Pannonia and Moesia, and finally to Italy.\\" (P.36) Wolfram/Dunlap goes on to say that instead of trying to prove/disprove this origin perhaps we should accept it, not as fact but as a motif in a saga. Based on old songs the tribe was overpopulated, so on the orders of King Filimer an army of Goths with their women & children left their homeland. While crossing a river the bridge collapsed forever separating them. Some stayed behind and others that had crossed moved on. The emigration of an entire tribe as well as the idea of overpopulation is a common traditional theme. The strength of the Goths was in there kingship, whose authority surpassed that usually found among Germanic tribes. The king, as the central authority figure of a wandering tribe, could employ the resources of his smaller tribe faster & more effectively than that of a larger kingless tribe. \\"From the early summer of 291 the ancient world had been aware of the existence of two Gothic tribes. At the same time the main tribal element was still made up of \`Eastern Goths'. (P.85) But by the 4th century the eastern Goths disappeared from the Roman view, replaced by the western Goths. In chapter three, Wolfram/Dunlap discuss the 40 year migration and the formation of the Visigoths. In 376 A.D. the Tervingi, Goths, were admitted to the empire to settle parts of Thrace. The Goths led by Alaviv and Fritigern were seen as supplicants to the mercy of the Emperor. They would be supervised by Roman authorities and were to survive by farming the land with no other subsidies from the empire, & in exchange the large numbers of Goths would be expected to serve in the Roman army. The Goths were not especially serious about their promise and had already set their sights on Thrace before even negotiating with the Emperor. Also the Emperor's order probably included disarmament as a pre-condition for admission but Roman officials failed to enforce it. The admission of an entire people caused problems. There was not enough transportation to ferry them across the Danube, and the way the Romans went about it threatened the family & clan structures. Also a shortage of food did not calm a hungry tribe. And as always there was exploitation by dishonest officials & generals. Initially they followed orders and they marched slowly to the Thracian troops headquarters. Lupicinus invited Alaviv & Fritigern to a reconciliatory feast, a quarrel broke out & Lupicinus ordered the Gothic leaders killed, Fritigern escaped but Alaviv did not, this is in early 377 A.D.. Fritigern assumes full control of the Goths & began to sweep across the land pillaging & burning everything in his path. On August 9th 378 A.D. at the battle of Adrianople the Romans were soundly defeated and the Emperor Vallens was killed. This battle has been considered the turning point in the history of western warfare, and in its wake the Visigoths, as horsemen, emerged from out of the Danubian Tervingi. Skipping ahead to around the middle of September 415 A.D., Valia is chosen as King of the Goths. He was supposed to continue the war with Rome, but to do that he had to solve the hunger of his people. He marched the Goths through the Iberian Peninsula towards Africa, but they were not seafarers & their 1st attempt across the Straits of Gibraltar was fatal. So in the spring of 416 A.D. Valia surrendered to Constantius, commander-in-chief of the west, in exchange they were given food & the task of clearing Spain of enemies. This was known as the foedus of 416 & was followed by a settlement of the Goths that was contractually guaranteed & carried out according to Roman law in 418, although Valia did not live long enough to see it implemented. In chapter four Wolfram/Dunlap write about the kingdom of Toulouse 418-507. The kingdom of Toulouse was settled in 418 A.D. & became the center of the Goth dominion. After Valia's death Thoederid becomes the next king, not much is known about his early life because the Roman observer wanted to know if he would honor the foedus of 416 & 418. In the year 523 the Emperor Honorius died & two years later the Goths begin a regular march to the gates of the Gallo-roman capital of Arles. The city is never taken & the clashes are not considered to breaking the foedus, they are simply to gain the Goths some attention. 451 A.D. Attila attacks and the Goths are pressed into service. Theoderid & his two eldest sons, Thorismund & Theodoric II, marched to the fields between Troyes & Chalon-Sur-Marne. The battle is seen as both a loss for the Huns & a draw for Atius, Theoderid is killed and Thorismund is king 451-453. Theodoric II then becomes king 454-466 & is killed by his brother Euric; this ended the foedus of 50 years & also ended the marches to Arles. By 475 Euric had made all land between the Atlantic, the Loire, & the Rhone Gothic territory. Euric died in 484 of natural causes, & on Dec. 28 484 Alaric II becomes king and is then killed in 507 at the battle of Vouille. Alaric II was regarded as an ineffectual leader, with his death & the destruction of the army the end of the kingdom of Toulouse was brought about. Chapter five discusses the \\"new\\" Ostrogoths. Amazingly the Ostrogoth people only lasted five generations. Precisely 451 to 552 A.D., the Ostrogoth century is marked by two major defeats and the kings associated with them. King Valamir, who commanded the tribal contingent in Attila's army which was defeated on the Catalonian fields in 451, And King Teja who was killed at the Mons Lactarius in 552.The history and origin of these people is poorly recorded, prior to 451 there is no certain date where & when they appeared. As well there is no Kingship or administration after 552. The lineage of the kings of the Ostrogoths is rather short so I can list them here. Valamir is king until his death in 469, who is then succeeded by his brother Thiudimir who rules until his death in 474. His son Theodoric \\"the Great\\" is next & by 493 had become the unchallenged master of Italy and lived to 526 A.D., next his grandson Amalaric, who held no real power, was king until 531. Theudis, a former governor of Theodoric, becomes King until 548, when his nephew Totila who was already a gothic king takes over until his death in battle in 552. Lastly there is King Teja who ruled for not even three months before his death. After Teja's death, the Goths held out kingless until 555 A.D. when they surrendered in exchange for becoming faithful servants of the Emperor, thus ending 500 years of Gothic history."},{"Title":"History of the Goths","review":"H. Wolfram and T. Dunlap deserve highest marks for the comprehensive most detailed account of Eastern European - East Germanic tribal history. I found many details of my Aesti-East Prussia West-Baltic history. With the Iron Curtain and earlier take-over of East Germanic lands we had many years where none of the history was made public in the English language. The genocide, sancioned by the Allied Control Council abolishion of Prussia in 1947 and the previous and ongoing ethnic cleansing by Stalin communists seems to have been in connection with the silence of the press on matters of any true East Germanic History. Not even the fact that the legitimate Prussian government under Otto Braun was ousted by Military Coup by Hitler July 20, 1932 is being published. Herwig Wolfram went to a lot of searching and trouble to have the ancient history recorded by Jordanis and earlier writers once again made known.

[One of the more human G's commissioned Mantegna to do one of the great frescos of all time, still on view in Mantova today.] If you think we are living in a lousy world, you have only to be reminded by Howell of what so-called humanity did to one another once upon a time. The great paintings and frescoes, we travel to see, were only a fringe benefit of a terrible turbulent time in the history of Italia.

I find this book as compelling, captivating, and yes even mesmerizing, now as when I first read it many years ago. It is one of very, very few which I can always re-read with unwavering pleasure and delight. Richard Maury has crafted a volume as close to perfect in terms of making the essential -nesses of cruising in small sail boats clear to the reader as any I have ever found. It's facinating to me that right through to the last page he never tells of himself, and only word sketches his alternating sailing companions very briefly.

I find many of these books both entertaining and informative, even if the writer has a different style of travel than I'm interested in or sails a type of vessel I'll probably never own. Most of the books of this type that I read were written in recent years, as cruising has become much more popular due to the availability of fiberglass boats, both new and used, and new equipment such as GPS receivers to take the hard work out of navigation.Before this new wave of modern cruisers appeared, the pioneers of modern singlehanded or family-style voyaging under sail had to either build their boats themselves or convert existing vessels, mostly built of wood, to their needs. Most sailors these days would stay ashore if this was still the case, but thanks to those who did it the hard way and wrote about it, the way has been made much easier for those of us with an abundance of boat choices at our disposal. Their successes and failures, described in the great books many of them wrote, have saved many of us from coming to grief through lack of knowledge. Most people who sail today and even think just a little about long-distance voyaging and cruising are familiar with the works of at least some of these writers like: Joshua Slocum, Hal Roth, Bernard Moitessier, the Smeetens, and John Guzzwell. But there are other, lesser known sailors from this era as well, and some of the best writings are easy to overlook.The Saga of Cimba: A Journey from Nova Scotia to the South Seasby Richard Maury is one such sailing classic that I myself passed up for years, even though I had noticed it from time to time among the more contempary narratives in the sailing section of various bookstores. It was only a few months ago, when I was lacking something inspiring to read, that I decided to pick up this book that was first published in 1939 and remains in print. Upon reading the first chapter, I found myself immediately hooked. This is one of those rare narratives that not only recounts a fascinating adventure, but does so with a captivating writing style that takes you right along and makes you want to find an old fishing schooner and follow in the author's footsteps.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the voyage recounted in this book is the time period in which it took place - in the 1930s - before World War II brought the remote South Pacific islands into mainstream consciousness and when practically no one set out to voyage half way around the world for pleasure on a small, short-handed sailing vessel. This was a time of almost limitless freedom for those few who could pull off such a voyage. The world was wide open to them and the rules and regulations and fees that we have to pay for docking and even anchoring in many places were unheard of then.One of the most difficult hurdles in the 1930s was simply finding an affordable vessel of suitable size and adequate seaworthieness for such a voyage. Maury and his partner in the adventure at last found their ship among a fishing fleet on the Nova Scotia coast. \\"We first saw her from the top of the cliff. She turned at her chains to every attack of wind, swaying, airy, buoyant, as though cut of fragile porcelain on the sea below. She was a two-masted schooner, almost as small as they go, almost as stalwart....\\"The schooner, which they subsequently purchased and christened Cimba, was 35-feet overall with a 26-foot waterline and 9 1/2-foot beam. She carried a fisherman's working rig - gaff mainsail and foresail, and one jib. Maury and Carrol Huddleston sailed her down the coast to Stamford Harbor where they planned to fit out and equip the vessel for the voyage ahead.From this point on, two ocean passages lay ahead: New York to Bermuda, and Bermuda to the Caribbean Islands. To prepare they made some modifications to the schooner, such as adding a deck hatch to ventilate the cabin, painting the hull and cabin and rebuilding the engine. The also took on the necessary stores and supplies, including everything needed to maintain the hull, rigging and sails. In light of the time period and the remoteness of their ultimate destination, it's not surprising that ship's equipment included a 30.30 Winchester rifle with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and a .38 revolver and 12-gauge shotgun. Despite the preparations and large equipment list, the schooner \\"retained an air of almost puritanical simplicity on deck and down below\\" according to Maury.Maury's first setback occured when his friend Carrol was swept overboard and lost his life in the harbor while tending the schooner in a storm. This event is mentioned only in a short paragraph. Maury sailed for Bermuda shortly after with a new crew - \\"Dombey\\" Dickinson. The schooner proved her seaworthieness in a winter storm enroute that caused a rollover and set fire to the cabin with coals scattered throughout the interior. From Bermuda, the pair sailed Cimba on to Grand Turk and then through the Windward Passage past Haiti to Kingston, Jamaica. From Jamaica they ran down to Panama's San Blas Archipelago and explored some of the jungle rivers of the coast. On the Pacific side of the Canal, they explored the Perlas Islands and then set sail for the Galapagos.Among the remote Galapagos, so little visited at the time, they came upon a wrecked boat on a deserted beach, with two skeletonsin the sand nearby. They also found fresh footprints and heard a rifle shot from somewhere in the interior. Maury's account of the unraveling of these mysteries again illustrates how different the world was back in 1935 for a couple of adventurers willing to sail to such far-flung islands.Onward into the Pacific, on the 3,000-mile downhill run to the South Seas, Cimba, working west and south averaged 6.4 knots or 150 miles per day. Maury writes: \\"The testing of a craft goes on forever - but a point is reached where finally the spirits of ship and men to some degree reflect each other, where often the weakness of one becomes the weakness of the other, the strength of one the other's strength.\\"Cimba made landfall off Ua Hiva in the Marquesas 19 days out from the Galapagos. Beginning in the Marquesas, Maury and his partner found the South Pacific they were looking for, and their adventures continued through the French territories and then westward to Fiji, where the voyage sadly ended on a reef. Although the schooner was with great difficulty salvaged and rebuilt on the beach, Maury never managed to sail on to New Guinea as planned due to various complications, and ended up leaving her in Fiji.If you've every dreamed of sailing to the South Seas, or if you simply like good adventure narratives, you will love The Saga of Cimba. If you have an ounce of interest in boats or sailing this book will make you long for a sturdy old fishing schooner that you can fix up and point south. Richard Maury may have written only one book, but the The Saga of Simba deserves to be an enduring classic in the literature of the sea. It's definately worth checking out, but watch out, or you may find it inflicts a bad case of sea fever."},{"Title":"The saga of \\"Cimba.\\"","review":"I have no idea why this book is so highly rated, it was a terrible disappointment to me after reading about a dozen books in the genre. There are adventurers, and then there are adventurers who can write, and the fact that I had to go back several times to believe what was so casually mentioned in a paragraph--the death of two of the original three crew members--should have been a sign that I could have put the book down without missing out on anything.

Therefore, at the grand age of 72, I claim the title, Child of The Cimba! How so? Well, my father was Russell \\"Dombey\\" Dickinson, who was recruited to fill the navigator role after Dick's first partner, Carrol Huddleston, fell overboard. Father sailed on the Cimba until Pago-Pago, Samoa, where he decided to sail home and marry the sweetheart he'd found in Bermuda, while Cimba was being outfitted for the Pacific. That sweetheart was my mother, Kathleen Caffee, an American of Bermudian ancestry. I was born nine months after Russ returned to New York.That's not really the end of the story, though it is the end of the Cimba portion. I'll just throw in this unknown information to round it out for you. Someday, I may find a way to publish The Saga of The Seth Parker, using Father's manuscript about his arduous voyage home from the South Pacific. It's a wild tale alright.In Samoa, he signed on as Second Mate for a lumbering, four-masted schooner on its last legs, which had earlier been outfitted for an around the world broadcast venture for Phillips Lord, a popular radio character of the 1930's, who went by the stage name of Seth Parker. That venture ended with a hurricane, scaring the land-lubbers and severely damaging the ship. Russ set sail to deliver this derelict to new owners in Hawaii and kept a well-written account of events which seemed orchestrated to guarantee a watery grave for the Samoan crew and officers; as well as a nice, fat check from Lloyd's of London for the Hawaiian ship buyers. Mutiny against a drug-addicted, unqualified captain was finally necessary in order to call for a Coast Guard tow, so that this bedraggled prize could be laid at the feet of the angry owners. This is one of those \\"truth is so much stranger than fiction\\" stories, which I hope will one day be told.

DALLOWAY or A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN or BETWEEN THE ACTS or maybe, in a funny mood, THE WAVES. THE MOMENT must be pretty low down on anybody;s, wouldn;t you think? She didn't even mean for it to be a book, instead after she died Leonard Woolf just kept finding things and editing them up so that the Hogarth Press could keep churning out new volume after new volume of Virginia Woolf's. Well, i can understand that. And it's not necessarily the case that the very furst posthumous collection of essays, THE DEATH OF THE MOTH, had a higher percentage of hits than THE MOMENT, it's only that nearly everything in THE MOMENT feels a little soapy and watery, as though the suds had gone out of the dishwasher a long time ago. I was never crazy about Virginia Woolf's fascination with her own family. Maybe that appeals to some old school Bloomsbury fans, but a piece like \\"The Enchanted Organ: Anne Thackeray,\\" is hard to read now with a straight face, and not only because of the double entendre, which I'm sure slyboots Virginia Woolf intended, of \\"The Enchanted Organ,\\" but really because she's trying so hard to make us think that Anne Thackeray was indeed an important writer.How about two different essays called, \\"Royalty.\\" It isn;'t very helpful that the only way Leonard chose to distinguish them it to have a footnote appended to each, not when both footnotes say the exact same thing, \\"Written in 1939.\\" Huh? Maybe I'll write an essay called, \\"Royalty,\\" and add a footnote that says, \\"Written in 1939.\\" That would serve me right, royalty too. It isn't that she, Woolf, was worshipful of royalty, although one recalls the godlike presence of the limo at the beginning of MRS. DALLOWAY, traversing the square slowly very much like the progress of a god's chariot, everyone standing around wondering and whispering who coukld be inside, which member of the royal family.\\"On Being Ill\\" has attained classic status, and well deserved too, for it contains one of her most interesting discoveries, that illness has not its own literature and it should because it takes up so much space in our lives, particularly in the upper middle class. And yet the essay sort of peters out, as though she'd had rhis apercu and yet couldn't deide how to develop it. You get the feeling she wants to describe and than analyze her own symptoms, but then she wants to universalize them as a metaphor for being alive, enlarge the context of Russell Square, and yet the essay itself winds up eulogizing the bygone members of the British aristocracy, who lived such big lives. It has zero to do with being ill and heaps to do with having status. She's great, but let us turn to another book by her, one she wanted to have printed."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the Coin","review":"The Other Side of the Coin is a joy to read because of several reasons. First, Mr. Kunert's style is conversational and fluid; it feels as though he is speaking to us over beers, relating at one moment what is terrible and then finding joy and humor in other remembrances. Second, his candor about how the German people were treated by their own military and by other nations is valuable to those of us who have only read about this period from history books. This is a story that only someone who was there could have told with any credibility, yet it is also rendered with compassion and humor."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the Coin","review":"You hear a lot of people talking about hard times these days. Hans Kunert's story makes today's situation seem like paradise in comparison with life in Germany half a century ago. The story does live up to its name, telling us what it was really like as a German during the war years. Let me tell you, it was a lot harder than being an American! This is the history that they don't teach in schools. I couldn't believe some of the stories. I won't give away the details, but Kunert was incredibly resourceful in dealing with his problems (everything from berzerk Russian soldiers to holes in his only pair of shoes). If you can think up some of the survival gimmicks that Kunert does - you have a good imagination! Kunert has lived through hell and gone on to prosper in the USA. This story will give anyone hope for better days ahead. Through persistence, survival skills and just plain luck, Hans Kunert made it. Several times he nearly gave up. But he made it."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the Coin","review":"Reading this book provides the reader with a first-hand account of what life was like during WWII, in a country upon whose soil the battles were being fought.

The author provides a wonderful alternative perspective that every American should be exposed to.

He is forced to go out and find Daphne Monet for various reasons who likes to spend time in black jazz clubs, but is not quite a detective....yet. As Rawlings searches, he encounters people who don't want to talk about Daphne or are looking for her themselves.The reason I enjoyed reading this book was that the writer depicts life in the 20's for young and old black trying to live a normal life. Through hardships and crossing into white barriers life in the 20's was not exactly easy for blacks because of racism and discrimination."},{"Title":"El Siglo de las luces","review":"Carpentier's Siglo de las luces (The century of light) is the novel that can truly be called the key representative of magic realism. In the story of three brothers wandering all around the world the author crammed every little detail of the wonders of the eighteen century America (and of some parts of Europe). Thus he gave a sweeping portrait of the atmosphere of the age of the Enlightenment (hence the title), how the elevated ideals gradually drowned into blood and destruction. Carpentier originally studied music theory and we can say that in this book he found the closest equivalent in prose to a Beethoven symphony. In his literary essays he also talked about the existence of the eternal baroque, which roughly means that during literary history there are always periods when the rules of content and form are subverted. The finest example to the existence of the baroque in the twentieth century is precisely not only because of the luxuriant action but because of its carefully planned, winding sentences. Because of its difficult syntax and vocabulary, the lengthy sentences crammed with every possible little detail of the described scene, this book is not an easy read, especially originally in Spanish. Partly because the story is not set in our time, reading this book can be compared to the reading of a great Baroque classic, it conveys a strange eternal feel, similar to watching a flamboyant gilded altar of a XVII century church."},{"Title":"El Siglo de las luces","review":"This book is an absolute masterpiece. I started reading it a few years ago when I was a lot younger and got throwed back by the long sentences and immense vocabulary Carpentier uses. However, now that I am a little older and have more patience, I can say that this is one of the most impressive novels ever written in Spanish. This book deserves more than five stars."},{"Title":"El Siglo de las luces","review":"\\"Through Victor Hughes we follow the impact of the French Revolution in the Antilles, where the inhabitants dreamed of freedom while the guillotine casts its deadly shadow.

I purchased the book on Friday, read it over the weekend and was ready to present my first lesson to my retained third graders (most reluctant writers!) on Monday. My students were motivated by the imaginative (yet specific enough for them)ideas. A sixth grade colleague implemented Sandra's &quot;Helping Circle&quot;--her technique for revision--one day, and by the next all students were busy making their own revisions before coming to the &quot;Helping Circle&quot;. Experienced teachers will certainly be inspired by the lessons, and new teachers will find a terrific model for creating a safe writing atmosphere while teaching the complete writing process. You will find actual student writing samples that are helpful in explaining key points. Sandra also shares her Southern Hospitality with her readers through Mama's recipes. The brownies are terrific! This is an important addition to an educator's professional library."},{"Title":"Essential Ingredients: Recipes for Teaching Writing","review":"I found this book to be a fabulous resource with many fantastic ideas for teachers to incorporate into their writing programs.

I got this out of the library to see if this will be one I purchase from Amazon. As you thumb through the pages and read what is written it seems to be pretty accurate but there are some flaws. What I find difficult to take are the hand drawing. the drawing are beautiful but lack realism. I looked at a few drawings of plants that I am very aware of and find them not to be extremely accurate. If I had relied on drawings I may have gotten confused with ground cherry. The pictures are not that bad but this author doesn't explain that there are look alike plants that may be poisonous if ingested.o me that is a very important thing to leave out of a book teaching what is edible. I would also like to know what is not and if it looks like the plant that is.So for that reason, and that is a big reason, I will pass on this book."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"I am very pleased with this book. It is very thorough, and very easy to get the information needed. Includes alternate names, how each was used in history (natives, pilgrims, etc.), as well as how to prepare and use. Some even warn against including too much of an item in your diet! Can't say enough about this book. Terrific!"},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"The Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants is a good book to have on your shelf if you are interested in if you want to know what wild plants are edible. The book does discuss many different types of plants that grow out in the wild. The Field Guide does a good job of discussing where to find the plants, how and when to harvest, and a general guide of preparing the food. Where I find this book lacking is that there are no actual pictures of the plants in question. Before I chose to eat something out in the wild I want to be doubley sure I am picking the right plant. So I do feel it is a good guide and filled with information, I wished some time could have been spent on photography for my personal piece of mind."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"When I was stranded with my dog in the Alaska Wilderness for a week and a half, this book saved my life.

I agree, but I'd guess that's true of any such reference."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"I have long owned the earlier edition and excitedly bought this new one. This book is a good idea but poorly executed. (Let me say right away that I am the author of an edible plant book, so you can accuse me of bashing the competition if you want.) The older edition was one of the books that helped get me interested in this topic, and it is sentimental to me, so I keep trying to like this book but find it difficult.While it does contain a lot of good information and covers an excellent selection of species, it is also full of inaccuracies - and how can a reader know what to trust? Out of the dozens of edible plant books I have, this is one of the least accurate and I believe is based on comparatively little first-hand experience. The misinformation and omissions are too numerous to list, but here are a few examples:Jack-in-the-pulpit and skunk cabbage cannot be simply dried to eliminate their calcium oxalate. Believing this would be potentially dangerous, and painful at best. They require prolonged extreme dessication under hot conditions (I have some of both kinds that have been drying for 8 years and still have calcium oxalate a-plenty), or prolonged baking (days or weeks). Also, the book does not even mention that eastern and western skunk cabbage are completely different plants, nor does it specify which one it is talking about. The documentation of their food uses differs.The drawing of arrowhead tubers looks so dramatically unlike the real thing that you would never know if you found them. The jerusalem artichoke tubers depicted are a cultivated form, which looks and tastes quite different from the typical wild type.This book is not very good for identification and doesn't even use the scientific names of the plants. The preparation sections are typically 1-3 sentences - not much at all. Much of the text seems like space filler, although it is a good read.All of the info in this book is easy to find in other books - the author doesn't seem to contribute anything to this field. If you have this book, keep it and refer to it. If you are considering getting into foraging, don't make it a priority. Depending on your location, check out Edible Wild Plants of the Prairie, Steve Brill's wild food book, Abundantly Wild (Midwest), The Euell Gibbons books, or Nancy Turner's books for the Pacific NW. These are all much better. Get a tree, shrub, and wildflower guide to your specific region for ID."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"And still ok if you're clueless. The book's small size, a convenience in the field, limits the amount of illustrations it can contain. For example, the entire gooseberry/currant family is represented by three pictures, all fitting on one page. The text, on the other hand, can't be matched. My suggestion would be to pair this book with a field guide to wild plants until you can recognise them by sight."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"This book is very interesting with nice pictures but should not be used as a primary source in the field. In my opinion, it gives a false sense of security by failing to mention poisonous plants that appear similar to those highlighted. Also, it does not pay particular attention to precise plant identification and therefore should not be used for this purpose. Overall, I have enjoyed this book immensely, but would recommend it with caution."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"This book is a catalog of mostly uncultivated plants that are edible or have medicinal purposes. The entries are arranged alphabetically by common name, so there is no key system- -if you're looking at a plant and you don't already know it's name, you'll have to leaf through every page of the book to see if it's there. For each entry, there is a short article that provides other names for the plant, and description, distribution, and information about uses. There is also an idealized color illustration of the plant to aid identification. The description sections are not consistent in the types of information that they provide- -some descriptions cover the plant, the fruit, or the flowers, while others cover history, varieties, and more distribution information. The uses section tells us which parts of the plant can be consumed, and how they must be prepared to eliminate any toxins that might be present.I was quite excited after reading the introduction to this book- -wow! So many plants are out there in the forest just waiting for those in the know to come by and eat them. Why plant a garden? But as I read the entries for each individual plant, I began to recognize that it would be hard to get your sole nutrition from the wild plants mentioned here. A great many of the plants are leafy greens, that are too bitter or too toxic to eat without at least soaking and often boiling, possibly several times. That got me wondering about how much nutrition could be left in a plate of well boiled wild greens, if we are cautioned not to cook cultivated greens in a similar manner because all the vitamins will be washed away. If you have to boil the heck out of these things to make them edible, wouldn't you be better off with greens that have been cultivated for thousands of years to be tender enough to consume them raw, straight out of the garden? In addition to the leafy greens, Angier includes a few fruits like blueberries and cranberries (the illustration for blueberry leaves is like none I've ever seen in the wild before), some trees like maples and others where you can eat the inner bark lining (hopefully without killing too many trees), and some edible tubers. The descriptions of the edible tubers seem the most promising, nutritionally. Overall, I found this book an interesting read as well as somewhat informative, but I think I will keep on gardening after all."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"I find this one useful. Drawings are not &quot;natural&quot; but compensate by revealing all major parts clearly: root, leaf, flower, stems. Anyway, I find one needs at least two books for reliable identity and often for any ID at all. Variations among species make identity of individual plants a lot harder than it might seem, excepting for a few easy plants like cat tails, purslane, etc. I agree with a prior reviewer that absence of poisonous plants is unfortunate. Also, absence of scientific names is not good, since common names aren't reliable."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"This is an interesting guide with lots of good illustrations and detailed descriptions of the plants. But I would never dare to eat any of the plants because the book does not explain whether the edible plants could easily be confused with possibly toxic plants, it does not explain clearly enough how the edible plants should be cooked, and in some places I even question the given advice. For example, we always grew our own elderberries and were taught that the berries should never be eaten raw. They must be cooked. Anger says that the raw berries may not taste good but can be eaten raw. Is he right? I would rather trust my grandmother who grew up poor and often depended on wild plants.Then I checked another plant I knew well, namely arrowhead. It grows wild in the wetland area of my garden. I had never checked the tubers before but now I did. They grow deep down in oxygen-deprived soil that smells horrible when disturbed. I am not sure I want to eat this plant raw, as the author suggests. In fact, the Peterson Field Guide on edible plants says that the tubers have an unpleasant taste when eaten raw, but taste delicious when cooked.If you are just interested in knowing which plants can be eaten, this book is quite good. If you actually want to eat some of the plants, also buy the Peterson Field Guide \\"Edible Wild PLants.\\" While Angier has better illustrations, Peterson has better cooking descriptions."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"I owned this before and I remember it seeming more durable but it is well written."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants","review":"This book first caught my attention in the 70s but over the years I had lost my original copy so I repurchased one.

Maybe if I had gotten the xtra small it would have fit better, but it wasn't worth shelling out additional money to find out. I went and bought the Moby Wrap from my local retailer and, after watching a video on YouTube on how to put it on, it fit so much better! Whenever my newborn would scream and cry I would put him in the Moby and he was instantly soothed. My advice...buy the Moby and skip the K'Tan. Once you get the hang of the Moby it is so much better because it is adjustable which is key!!!"},{"Title":"The Chancellor","review":"it is a little ackward getting it to fit to the right size of your baby it is a t-shirt material so when child is in it , it will strech and need to be adjusted basically it is a 12 foot long piece of material that you can buy at a fabric store than go on youtube and learn how to wrap it around you."},{"Title":"The Chancellor","review":"I purchased a Moby Wrap in 2009 for my 3rd child and I loved it. Since my son was born in the fall season, I bought an olive green color, but it became too hot when the weather was hot. The lady at a local baby boutique suggested that I should go for a lighter color. Now pregnant again and due this summer, I purchased another Moby Wrap in the Bliss print/color - which is beautiful. Immediately, I realized that this Moby Wrap's weight was way lighter than my 1st Moby Wrap. I guess they changed the type of cotton being used. I love how much softer this one is and I know that I will love using this wrap. I will keep using my 1st Moby Wrap for around the house and as a back up in the cooler months. I love wearing my Moby Wrap and it is easy to put on. If you need help learning the different ways to wear your baby, check out youtube videos for Moby Wrap. That is what helped me and now I'm a pro at it!"},{"Title":"The Chancellor","review":"I was very skeptical of this product at first but now I love my moby! True you could just get a long piece of fabric and wrap it (which I tried) but the moby has just the right amount of stretch, feels much more secure and is so soft! If I could give it 6 stars I would!!! My baby is now 3 months old weighs 16lbs he is in the carrier all day; he is comfortable and happy. I don't worry at all about him falling out. unlike other carriers I have used I have no back ache at the end of the day. Recently I flew from TX to WA, I was able to keep baby in the moby through security (they did have to pat me down, but very worth it not to wake up my son!) Also works great on the plane. According to the FAA baby can't be in for takeoff or landing but it's fine the rest of the flight, making it easier to do something besides hold the baby on long trips. The wrap is long and takes a little bit to get used to wrapping correctly, but I can now wrap it in less than a minute. I have also used this to carry my 3 year old wrapped on my back she loves it!"},{"Title":"The Chancellor","review":"This wrap works for us... its cute and my baby seems to like the print and colors too! It takes a little practice to get it right but once you've worn it a few times, its really easy and fast to put on. If you don't want to bother with a do-it-your-self wrap, get a baby carrier like BabyBjorn... my husband likes to wear that a lot!"},{"Title":"Astrology & the cards,","review":"I had always heard that one could divinate from a regular pack of playing cards but usually it is in the context of a truncated Tarot without the major arcana. This system is unique in the sense that it is astrologically based not Tarot based and you can spend less than $10 on a decent pack of playing cards, take them anywhere with you, divinate in public without getting the evil eye from born again Christians, and just generally have an alternate way to sharpen your intuition. I liked the astrological concept in this system and it has already helped me with my regular Tarot readings. I say, good show!"},{"Title":"America's Japan: The First Year, 1945-1946 (World War II: The Global, Human, and Ethical Dimension)","review":"America's Japan was first published in Japanese in Japan in 1986. Although Grant Goodman is American, he wrote the book in Japanese for a Japanese audience. Now that the Bush administration has compared the attempt to democratize Iraq with the post-World War II efforts to democratize Germany and Japan, America's Japan has a new relevance and has been translated into English for an American audience.The language in America's Japan is deceptively simple. Goodman describes his life in Cleveland. He is in high school when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. He is still seventeen when he begins his studies at Princeton, then volunteers to participate in an intensive Japanese language training course for Army officers. He does well, joins the Army, gets his lieutenant's bars, and is on the way to the Philippines in June, 1945.As an interrogator, he doesn't see combat. There aren't many prisoners to question, because \\"the American soldiers usually preferred to shoot Japanese soldiers rather than take them prisoners. And really, it was probably unreasonable to ask the U.S. soldiers to take live prisoners under the extremely harsh conditions of jungle warfare.\\"The few prisoners they do see are pretty beaten down and don't put up much resistance. The interrogation room was \\"a dark room with almost no windows. The Japanese prisoners were brought into this dark room stark naked, then they would suddenly have a spotlight shone on them and interrogation would begin from a place high above them. The interrogation desk must have been elevated some ten feet above the floor.\\"Goodman arrives in Tokyo in October, 1945, after the surrender. One of his first assignments is to procure a desk chair for General MacArthur. He finds one in the office of the president of a Japanese company. The president is still sitting in the chair, so Goodman requisitions it from the astonished businessman by order of General MacArthur. Goodman explains that under the terms of the Occupation, the Japanese were obliged to supply the Army with whatever it needed.Goodmans views of MacArthur, the Japanese Constitution, and the occupied Japanese are straightforward and honest. He was barely twenty-one when this took place, and there is an odd air of innocence in the narrative. But every so often, the older Goodman surfaces with an observation made with the perspective of time. He says that the American-style constitution was vital for the Japanese government to re-emerge on the world stage. He also mentions that the Japanese were not convinced of the importance of a constitution at the time, and that the Americans, who felt that time was of the essence, wrote the first draft on their own, although the Americans insisted that the Japanese had done most of the work.America's Japan is a very short book, 147 pages, but Goodman touches on a number of subjects, serious and not so serious. On the lighter side, he talks about how the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Mikado was received in Japan. More serious is his description of translating the diary of a Japanese civilian who participated in beheading the pilots of an American bomber that was shot down over their village.It's interesting that America's Japan is finally available for Americans to read. It will be even more interesting to see if it is translated into Arabic for Iraqis to read."},{"Title":"America's Japan: The First Year, 1945-1946 (World War II: The Global, Human, and Ethical Dimension)","review":"Well written and very interesting look at Japan at the close of WWII by someone who experienced it first hand."},{"Title":"Kipper's Snacktime: [Press Out and Play]","review":"I spend my days with my son watching Nick Jr. When they started showing the Kipper series, I was estatic!

Knowing it was written in 1981 it depicts what is actually happenning in the world today, of course always keeping in mind it is a work of fiction. I had read before (when originally published) most of the works of Morris West (even this one) but maybe in the 80's I was too young to appreciate it.

One of Morris West's finest books: a triumph of realism amidst recovery."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"Hold it! The Church may hear! Ssshhh... Okay... Well, this book reveals the politics inside the Church and I really like West's explicit account of which. It shows that he once really worked in the Vatican.

Is his vision a symptom of insanity, or is he a new prophet, proclaiming the End of Creation? If his vision is true, how does he disseminate his message, and how will the world react to it?Written during a period of escalating tensions during the Cold War, the impending doom of the world, as described here, no longer seems to be such a threat. However, this book explores themes of faith that are relevant, even if the End isn't imminent. Morris West clearly is a proponent of compassionate Christianity, where the fallibility of man is acknowledged, and forgiveness is the defining characteristic. As world tensions escalate towards the ultimate conflict, the characters struggle to spread a message of hope and faith in a environment that is bereft of both. The final pages provide a surprising climax that touches at the very core of faith."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"I have not received this book. Though I already read Portuguese version, hence, can say it is great reading. I just wish I had received as I placed the order.Fatima"},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"The interesting thing about this book is its comment on the 80s - a time of increasing almost frenzied worry that a nuclear war was about to break out. Indeed, I remember the 80s, growing up as a schook kid, very much in the shadows of movies such as \\"The Day after\\". This book captures the spirit of the time and it is valuable in that respect. However, the plot did not do much for me. What is interesting is how we have moved on from the fear of nuclear holocaust to the feat of environment catastrophe - are we not a litte obssessed with Armaggedon scenarios?"},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"For those inspired by the more predictable of apocolyptic tales, this book may come as somewhat of a disappointment. For me, this was the most enjoyable of West's works. The story showed deep insight and knowledge into the workings/neuroses of the Vatican, (and yes, I am a practicing, believing Catholic) and the ending, which some have labeled &quot;far fetched&quot;, is indeed about as far fetched as the Messiah himself was in his own lifetime. For many who know that person of Christ, West's powerful ending will inspire beyond words. For those more concerned with literary believability, it may leave one unsatisfied."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"I read this book in the mid-80's and want to read it again, but I cannot find my old copy.

That impression may change, when I re-read, but I want to record it:Over the years and up to the very present, this book has come to mind at the oddest moments. Often, I've just seen a person who, in some measure, shares my faith, but whom I initially view as unimpressive. This book comes to memory and I think about the maimed, the lame, the halt in West's book--the \\"clowns\\" of God that proved to be faithful servants. In those moments, I feel as if I've been caught in unworthy thoughts. Indeed, I have been.The bottom line, for me, is that we are all, in some way, to someone, \\"clowns.\\" And it's best that I remember that and just continue to serve as I am able to understand my mission."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"Quite simply the best book I have ever read.

So be it. Thisis a nasty, pretentious, and near-blasphemous book, rich in theCalvinist and Jansenist heresies, lacking utterly in anything I would call compassion, and having nothing in common with genuine Catholic teaching.Not convinced? You could read it, as I did, but it's as likely to make you furious as inspired. We are a schizophrenic species in some ways, and this book shines kleig lights on the main faultline: Whether one views humanity as halfway home on the upward road to God, or halfway down on the inevitable freefall into Hell.Basically, if you hate humanity, you'll love this book. If you love humanity, you'll hate it.If you're a genuine Catholic, you'll shake your head and be glad that fewer and fewer people seem to think this way as time goes on."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"Now and then, I come across a book that moves me. Not just with its story or language but with the emotions it can generate in me. Clowns of God is one such. Perhaps the setting is somewhat dated now, with geopolitical alliances totally re-arranged. However, when I first read it back in the 1980s, the kind of doomsday scenario it pointed to was not all that far-fetched. Many who lived through the Cold War will remember the impotent fear caused by the insanity of \\"Mutual Assured Destruction - MAD\\" theories.Set in the heart of the Catholic Church, the book unfortunately loses some of its strength when read by those of other faiths. Sad but inevitable as the theological underpinnings are key to the story. In brief, as the Western World (NATO) and the Communist World (Warsaw Pact) contend for supremacy, a grain famine in the (then) Soviet Union gives the West a trump card that can be used to befriend or to destroy. And the temptation in the minds of the zealots (yes, they are there in every country and of every persuasion) towards destructive use is strong indeed. Into this precariously balanced trapeze act comes a wild card in the form of the reigning Pope. Firm in the belief that he has been granted a vision from God of the end of the world and commanded to preach accordingly, he faces the resistance of vested interests. Stripped of his papacy by the frightened hierarchy, he wanders into the world, searching for a sign that he is right and learning lessons from friends and acquaintances.Odd as it may seem, the story, for all its sobering possibility is ultimately secondary. Morris is a master not only at prose but at creating characters that are fundamentally and recognizably human, with faults and frailties that accent their greatness. The picture he paints of big power games as the world hurtles towards a precipice is scary indeed. What remains in the mind however (and in my opinion form the best part of this book) are the letters written to God, age old questions that we all want to ask and whose answers we have a tough time finding. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Even a reader who is unfamiliar with Christian theology and who professes another faith will appreciate the questions that this book raises."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"I only bought this book by accident, after seeing a cheap second-hand copy in a charity store. It gripped me from virtually the first page right through to the last and unlike some of the other reviewers, the ending didn't disappoint me.The essential theme of the novel is this - a Pope (a Frenchman, Jean Marie Barette) is forced out of the papacy when he sees a divine vision that the world will end soon in war. The Vatican hierarchy fear that he is mentally ill, so he is coerced into resigning his position and retiring to a monastery.The setting of the novel is the late twentieth century - the US and the USSR are perilously close to all-out nuclear war after a crop-failure in Russia, and international terrorist groups are wreaking havoc. Western European governments are tightening their security and preparing repressive measures. Barette's vision seems accurate, even if it isn't divinely inspired.Barette begins using his network of friends and powerful acquaintances around the world to try to stop the coming nuclear Armageddon, but this places him in personal danger...I'm not a religious expert- I'm an atheist - and I can't judge the theology here ,but the book still moved me. As a thriller it was a real page-turner, the plot sizzles, the dialogue is good and the characters convincing.I haven't read a better book this year - strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"Contrary to the reviewer from Scottsdale, Arizona, I don't see The Clowns of God as an attack on Catholicism. In fact, in many ways I sensed a respect and honor for the institution and the various positions of office. I saw it as an affirmation of God but also an honest look at the possiblity of human corruption. West did an excellent job of dealing with the religious aspect of the book. I think the book was written in such away that anyone with religious beliefs could comfortably read it.The point was not to slam Catholicism, but to use it as a vehicle to tell a story. A similar novel could have been written from a Protestant viewpoint and context, but Morris chose to write about what he was familiar with and therein lies his strength. His books are researched and developed to the point of making the characters and situations believable. It was a worth-while read, especially for anyone interested in spiritual and philosophical ideas."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"Whenever I need a spiritual uplift or a re-affirmation of my Christian faith, I read this book. Nearly 20 years after its first publication it is still one of the most powerful and truthful stories ever written, but that should not be surprising given the fact that the Truth it tells is eternal. One of the things I enjoyed most about this book was how it made the Pope a real-life human being, sort of like the current one, not a cold, regal icon not to be seen, touched or felt. The deep scholarly approach to the literature of the Church was also very appealing. An excellent work in any event, thoughtful and with a good, well-paced action line, this is more importantly a tender story of how easily and unknowingly we can lose our sight in the face of overwhelming truth. The answer is usually right in front of us if we will only open our eyes, our minds and our hearts to it."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"What would happen, if the members of the Roman Curia discovered that the Pope was about to publically state that he had received a private revelation that the world was about to end? This is the fundamental premise of this exciting novel by the author of &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot;. This book has as many &quot;twists and turns&quot; as a spy novel, with the additional interest of having the Pope as the main character. The ending will shock and surprise most readers. Considering the popularity of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, this book is one which should generate real interest (and is better written and far more believable) among believers and non-believers alike."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"As a raised Catholic with at least 18 years of Roman Catholic schooling in my past, and even now as an agnostic with 2 MA's in religion who teaches religion, philosophy, & humanities courses p/t at local colleges, I need to chime in my thorough support for this novel. Since I've taught more than 40 classes in World Religions, I'm pretty sensitively attuned to the slightest of slurs against religions and religious denominations. In this book, I found nothing at all either attacking or demeaning or ridiculing the Roman Catholic Church, as suggested by at least one reviewer on this site. On the contrary: West honors the RC Church in this novel which pits the necessity of preserving tradition against the requisite openness of any religion/church to new revelation.It asks: can a pope (leader-in-general of anything) play both roles: that of \\"protector of the faith\\" as well as recipient of new prophecy? The book's theme explores this very same tension which the early Christian Church (150-500 C.E.) also faced in attempts to safeguard a growing \\"orthodoxy\\" against groups such as the Montanists, that claimed new prophecy in the name of the Holy Spirit.Sub-themes arising from this are also well probed. As a New Testament semi-scholar, I feel a real affinity with the novel's similar character, a friend of the pope in question. The issues are real and compelling for both pope and his scholarly friend. Below is the larger \\"plot.\\"It seems that an \\"end of the world\\" nightmare is about to become reality, The reigning pope has a personal vision of this. The time is ripe for it. But he's forced to resign or be declared incompetent. His friend, the scholar, becomes reluctantly involved. Then we have the story of the scholar's approach to this issue, then of the former pope's undertaking of the actual mission. Enough said ... read it for yourselves. It's truly an engrossing tale.Is the ending weak? Yes, sort of intriguing, but definitely disappointing. But don't let that opinion discourage you from reading this book, 90% of which is so satisfying and stimulating. The other 10% ending is also \\"interesting\\" but in a way defying description. While it annoyed me in many ways, it perhaps offered the only \\"successful\\" conclusion Morris West COULD write, after all of the prior story. That's why I can't judge the ending harshly ... for having written the front story, West might have found it impossible to invent an ending that could be plausible, satisfying, helpful, and parenthetically conclusive all at the same time.In order to understand why no possible ending to this tale might be scriptable, you'll need to read the book. Please do so ... I've re-read it at least 5-6 times, and will do so again soon. It touches something deep within me and others who advocate it so strongly...."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"I have enjoyed Morris West since high school...I just recently embarked on &quot;Clowns&quot; and was highly impressed with the high level of prophetic understanding that West possesses. It ranks with &quot;The Jesuit&quot; in it's impact to uncover the the first layer of the onion regarding the vatican beaurocracy and the provedential intervention of the Almighty into the affairs of men. I have often thought that if Jesus were to walk into twentieth century life....no one would recoginize him. I am not surprised at the reviews about this book...a prophet is without honor in his own country. Bless you Mr. West for being first rate."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"THE CLOWNS OF GOD (1981) by that Catholic adventurer Morris West (who also gave us what has been weirdly retitled \\"The Vatican Trilogy\\",The Shoes of the Fisherman Volumes One and Two,The Shoes of the Fishermannovel and film, see my review) is a story I was never quite sure I liked or disliked. It is a tough nut to crack, but the meat is sweet and worth some effort. The trouble with West's writing is that the nut grows tough once again, again and again - is it worth re-cracking this nut?Well, it is for me. I'm a born sucker for Vatican/papal/Catholic/theological adventures and fiction.It is based on the FISHERMAN timeline, set circa 1991 - it is the story of Pope Gregory XVII, Jean-Marie Barette, who two days before his 65th birthday signs his instrument of abdication. As we read we learn that he has had a personal revelation from God about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (which I always called \\"The Inevitable Return\\").This novel is a richly detailed, adventurous and sometimes hilarious blow-by-blow account of the life of Monsieur Barette (based on the late Cardinal Aron Jean-Marie Lustiger of France, I'm told). It is a life lived on the run and in misery - but it is the life of a man who was called by the Holy Spirit to serve as pope courtesy of the College of Cardinals' votes. It is no ordinary life, but Jean-Marie is no ordinary ex-pope. He's a saint too, albeit an explosive, emotional one. A bit over-the-top for a Frenchman if you ask me.Along the way he meets fascinating people, encounters his relatives, dines in a bistro where the waitress immediately recognizes him yet treats him like any old customer. The novel descends into the absurd, as Jean-Marie works with a funny group of Euro-media people in an effort to get out his message of salvation to the world before it ends. He even meets with - and banishes - the devil. What I dislike about this book is the initial concentration on a character called Carl Mendelius, an ex-priest and professor. It's a weak and silly character; I still don't understand his purpose.This book is somehow a perennial favorite of mine, a kind of 'theological dessert' to be enjoyed with a cup of English Breakfast tea, and not so much a heavy four-course meal of a tome like FISHERMAN is (though West is merely copying himself, or rather, copying FISHERMAN, at this point). I feel I am living the life with Jean-Marie, in France and enjoying the atmosphere of this savory world West has woven around this tall, aristocratic ex-pope.The novel really is generally a treat for me, in spite of the horrid padding West likes to use, in spite of confusing descriptive narration and in spite of the run-on random thoughts. More than anything, it is the foregoing that I dislike about it. The other big problem West always had was the silly, junior-high-level theology he heaves at the reader, paragraph after heavy paragraph. He needs to lay off the Theology Energy Drinks.If you buy this - and I think you should - don't pass up THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN in both novel and film. THE CLOWNS OF GOD always struck me as impossible to make into a film and make well, because West is gone from the scene and I do not think any production company is up to the task.But oh, how I would love to see them try anyway!West was fond of making people find the clues of his stories' timelines. This book was thought to take place around 1999, but the same was true of FISHERMAN when it came out (it takes place in the mid-1980s, CLOWNS takes place in 1991). Familiar and out-of-date Westian expressions (\\"back in the jungle\\", \\"head on the chopping block\\", \\"wolves at the door\\", \\"black theater\\") are all here in force. West seems to have gained nothing in his decades of writing - but he's lost nothing.It is wise and frankly fun to direct the reader to the fact that West was a real prophet, at least in the area of papal matters. In his excellent SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN, he predicts a pope from a Soviet country, a hardscrabble existence during wartime, a man who is stunned when he discovers he is to be created cardinal, equally stunned when he is elected pope - and his name is Kyril. In Polish, \\"Kyril\\" is \\"Karol\\" Sound familiar?Here in CLOWNS, West addresses another non-Italian pope, who clearly the successor of Pope Kyril I thus making this story a sequel to FISHERMAN, only this guy comes from a smoothly conservative country, takes a commonly used name (hence he is the XVIIth), is a master theologian/teacher, and suddenly abdicates - in this case because he has had a vision of the Second Coming but also because he knows the poop will hit the air purifier very soon. Sound familiar?I tell you, West is a prophet and it would behoove us all to study him more closely. In CLOWNS, West gets away from the pope-centric world he created in FISHERMAN and concentrates on the world the pope finds himself exploring. In FISHERMAN, West concentrates on the pope-as-man, propping everything on his experience as a humble non-Italian from a Soviet state. In CLOWNS, it is riddled with war and rumors of war, starvation, shortage of supplies, odd weather, creepy public and private eminences, an active United States making cold war where it ought not and using drones. And it promises Jesus is returning very soon.If all that does not scare you, I don't know that some stupid movie about possession would make a dent in your consciousness.Whatever you do, read it with care. West still has a lot to teach us about tyrannies, dictatorships, global economy, and politics. Even today after so many decades, his musings can be frightening in their accuracy."},{"Title":"The Clowns Of Gods","review":"The \\"Editorial Review\\" above is, I believe, one of the most arrogant and insulting I have yet read.

Considering that this was written by a 23 year old it is amazing. The middle third or so of the book is written as play, where the main character Amory gets involved with a girl. The main character was very irritating. His time as Princeton was described in brilliant detail though. The plot seems disjointed, but somehow it makes sense. If you are a fan of Fitzgerald this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Part of the problem with Fitzgerald's being affiliated with a prized novel, The Great Gatsby, is that the author's other novels must be compared to it. I use this as an opening because, while the instances of early talent in the writer are here in his debut novel, the story, even though richly autobiographical, fell a little flat. Maybe this is part due to the fact that for a good deal of the book the protagonist, Amory Blaine, is pretty much synonymous with the shallow, aimless generation that Fitzgerald and other Lost Generation authors tried to depict. With the exception of minor moments of insight late in the novel, Amory is as superficial as the world seems around him.Some have a problem with the experimental format of This Side of Paradise. It is written as a narrative, poem, drama, letter and journal. I didn't feel that way, and thought it gave a unique aspect to the novel. Fitzgerald's technique seems to coincide with the modern novel of experimenting with narrative. However, the story's subject itself clearly comes across as an author working into his craft, rather than having perfected it.Within the story, Amory Blaine searches for identity and meaning of life amid outside influences--his mother, the world, the war, his acquaintances at school, his friendships, and his loves. While there were some moments of insight, the story comes across as a bit flat and meandering. In the final estimation, the characters were a bit too artificial.Fitzgerald's movement towards perfecting his skill is evidenced, however. There are some valid insightful moments for the protagonist in the book's concluding pages, and Fitzgerald's style is evidenced in these brief snapshots. Fitzgerald's style would be perfected later in The Great Gatsby.This pretty much takes me back to my original argument. The Great Gatsby is vastly superior in terms of depth, narrative and likability of main protagonist than This Side of Paradise. Not to say that there isn't a glimpse of talent here, and future higher achievements, but I'd rather be reading The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I have to say that I found this book to be quite boring. i've been laid up for a few weeks. I have a Kindle so have been able to read and enjoy many of the classics. This was a book i had to stop reading several times and always wondered why i returned to it. I will try something else by Fitzgerald from his later years. I won't give up on someone others consider a brilliant writer."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Published in 1920, F. Scott Fitzgerald's first novel was wildly controversial, critically lauded, and an instant bestseller. Read today, it may be difficult to understand why; the story is a highly episodic \\"bildungroman\\" of a pampered, arrogant young man as he drifts with noticeable lack of appreciation through corridors of power and pleasure without absorbing much in the way of insight. But it is precisely because of that THIS SIDE OF PARADISE was felt to be such a shocker in its era: the very notion that any one would write a novel about such a slacker was controversial and new. Amory Blaine is among the first \\"anti-heroes\\" of the 20th Century, the opening salvo in a literary tradition that would eventually encompass everything from CATCHER IN THE RYE to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST to CATCH-22.In addition to its unexpected apathy, PARADISE was also considered shocking for its portrait of women. Certainly many writers, including numerous female authors, had written about women intelligently--but Fitzgerald stands astride the shift between what was and what is. A society belle of earlier generations would never admit to having been kissed before marriage; the \\"popular daughter\\" of the 1910s was not only kissed, she actively connived at it, and she didn't mind talking about it afterward. Fitzgerald's portraits of these seemingly new creatures, who had money and social background, who stayed out late and necked in strange apartments, and who didn't seem to give a damn about what people of thought of them, is at once tender and icy cold. To say that the portrait horrified the parents of teenage girls from New York to California would be a significant understatement.At the time of its publication, THIS SIDE OF PARADISE was considered \\"an experimental novel,\\" largely because Fitzgerald shifts between several different narrative styles as the book progresses. At the time it seemed very fresh and new, but in truth the effect was not so much designed as accidental: the novel was cobbled together from Fitzgerald's earlier, unpublished writings, and the contrasts and shifts that seemed fresh and new in 1920 quickly came to feel uneven afterward. Fitzgerald never made the same mistake. His later works would be planned, written and re-written, and polished to an almost superhuman degree. But in spite of the book's uneven narrative, it is very much what we think of when we think of Fitzgerald as a writer: sparks of poetry illuminating the psychology of slightly uncertain, often dubious characters, all interwoven with the hazards of careless wealth and incautious romance. Critics of the day hailed him as a major new talent, and his major works continue to stand the test of time.Like most of Fitzgerald's novels, PARADISE is distinctly autobiographical in nature. The novel begins with a portrait Amory as a child, son of a non-descript father and the fabulously wealthy, wildly pretentious, and ridiculously eccentric Beatrice--whose influence is one of self-indulgent ennui. In a fit of social ambition, Amory decides to depart from his mother's pseudo-intellectualism and European pretensions and \\"go to school,\\" enduring an unpleasant stint at an eastern prep school before entering Princeton. But although he rejects his mother's way of life, he is still very much her child; he is a superficial student at best, and he drifts through everything from superficial romances to philosophy class to The Great War without seeming to profit from the experience. An arrogant slacker, he arrives at the end of the novel to find himself without any personal resources, either tangible or internal. What is the point? In forcing the reader to that question, Fitzgerald effectively summed up the attitude of an entire generation. What was it all for? Why do we bother? Perhaps the best any of us can hope is a little comfort here and there and a good time along the way. It was an attitude that marked the beginning of the 1920s roar.The novel is particularly distinguished by a sense of irony. Amory may not be a likeable person, but the follies of youth--most particularly its pretensions--have not changed significantly over years, and Fitzgerald plays them out with a dry sense of humor that makes the careful reader wince time and again. Amory is indeed insufferable, but so have most of us been at one time or another, and the effect is comic, embarrasing, ridiculous, and at times down right painful. It is also particularly memorable, as many have pointed out, for its brilliant portrait of Princeton during the 1910s; indeed, the school becomes a major character in the novel, and while Amory develops a romantic appreciation of it, his great failure is that he never bothers to scratch the romantic surface in search of the core values that support it. It is, as Fitzgerald himself might have said, the curse of the mother visited on the son, a wallow in luxury without an appreciation for the hard work that supports it.THIS SIDE OF PARADISE is not really much read these days, and on the occasions that is read, it is usually read by those who are already fans of later Fitzgerald works such as THE GREAT GATSBY and TENDER IS THE NIGHT. It may well be that it is best left to such; I find it hard to believe that the typical reader, if there is such a thing, will be able to grasp what made it so unexpected in 1920. I do recommend it, flawed though it is, but this is really a novel that for all its beauties is probably best left to hardcore fans.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise is Fitzgerald's first novel and compared to most first novels, it is one of high quality. It is primarily a character study of Amory Blaine ,a young man of romantic temperament who lives off the inheritance form his wealthy mother. Blaine and his relationships with his male friends at Princeton both during and after college are one part of the book.His sense of purposelessness and his relationships with women are the other major themes of the book.Blaine is not a likable protagonist but Fitzgerald makes him compelling and his strong ear for dialogue and wonderful writing style plus some interesting secondary characters make the novel a winner"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"i received the book within a reasonable time and it was in as promised shape. very happy with the product."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Written at an earlier stage of Fitzs career this book is far from the slick , lean, more \\"commercial\\" output of his later work, especialy The Great Gatsby. (Also a fine novel in its own ways!) Written semi autobiographicaly, it provides a glimpse into the turbulent self discovery of a brilliant, young and idealistic writer."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is one of my favorite fitzgerald books and its so unbelievably like princeton today with much more glamour"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Francis Scott Fitzgerald gives here a masterpiece. The building of the conscience of a young American man is explored in the finest and most intricate details through his training in a prep school and at Princeton. His influences from all kinds of writers and poets are also examined in the way they interlace one another into a very subtle and complex whole.This leads that young man to the experience of the First World War and what follows and he moves from what could be considered as a pose to a more conscious state of mind in which the social reality of his time becomes pregnant with meaning.That leads him to a socialist stand coming from his dissatisfaction with the establishment that does not propose reforms and change but is self-satisfied in its achievements.The second level of the novel is the sentimental pilgrimage that the hero follows from the sheer discovery of love play to the deepest passion that leads nowhere and is finally identified by him as nothing but a negation of his self in the titillation of his egotism.Love is nothing but a mirror of himself and there is none of the two-way altruism that builds real love as a dual-carriageway of emotions and personal involvement.Hence he moves from a pure egotistic personality to something that is identified as a personage that is able to take into account the outside world as a living being of itself.The final element of interest in this book is the way Catholicism is an inspiration on that road and that his final starting point as an altruistic socialist is nothing but the development of Christian love that does not exist if the other is not one's equal, no matter where this other stands in the social order.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise is a novel for the young at heart, as it follows the life of Amory Blaine, a young man who is of the elite class.

This work shows the true meaning of a man's spirit."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I was a little disappointed after just having read The Beautiful and the Damned, but hey, it was his first book. Still worth a read, but Fitzgerald hasn't fully developed his talent yet. I'm still giving it four stars because it is better than 90% of the drivel out there, and is certainly thought-provoking."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's first novel is a profound and insightful coming of age story that reads like my deepest thoughts. Amory Blaine, who was raised by an eccentric mother and a sensible aunt, attends boarding school and eventually enters Princeton in 1913. He goes to the war for a bit and returns to a fairly aimless life in NYC.Amory is an eccentric. He is clever in almost all ways and knows that he is in some ways a genius - but the type that has no channel for his potential. Amory is at times brutally honest with himself and painfully self-aware. He knows he is vain and knows that - like a superman - he id detached from morality. He wonders if he is a \\"good man\\" and admits he is not. He wonders if any \\"great man\\" can be \\"good.\\" He also lacks self-awareness at times - or at least the discipline or motivation to change his self-defeating attitude. The book ends with Amory's iconic lament \\"I know myself, but that is all-\\"He sees things too clearly to ignore the baseness of life, and just short of clear enough to know how to live and how to be happy. He is for one day or one week or one month overwhelmed by the beauty and possibility of life and by the way in which 2 people can connect with each other. He knows that he is special for fully appreciating these times. . . . Then, he is struck by the way in which \\"life\\" and \\"society\\" distanace and disconnect individuals from this beauty and from their ability to feel this beauty. The young Amory Blaine is in touch with and cultivates his ability to feel the grandeur of life; his life at Princeton allows him free time and few worries. As Amory ages, he cannot figure out how to live in the real world - with all of its boringness and convention, and his own desire to impress others (the latter of which also features big at Princeton). Amory flip-flops between a conviction that he must stay true to his youthful state of mind and a conviction that he must recognize the inescapability of responsibility and the limitations of society. He searches endlessly for a book which offers the answer. The irony is that Amory's magnificent mind and heart which see so clearly the beauty of life also see the tragedy that society as a whole operates outside this fold. Knowing that society is so flawed, Ammory doesn't know how to participate in it and he fears he will lose himself if he does. Amory's gift is his downfall.On a completely different note, the life of young privileged men in early 20th century society is interesting. Princeton is a \\"right\\" of these men. There is such a sense of entitlement and empowerment, as well as a separation from the constricts of responsibility. Princeton boys do what they want. They have crazy outings to NYC and Boston. They miss class and don't blink an eye. In fact, class matters little although reading, cleverness, and talents matter a lot. There are a dozen clubs and even more posts to which students belong and prestige is everything.Finally, the prose is at times so gorgeous - so melodic - that I've consciously slowed down my reading speed to fully appreciate the beauty of Fitzgerald's song. Fitzgerals is also an amazing poet - \\"Amory\\" and his friends pen many beautiful pieces. I would absolutely read this book again - perhaps even slower. There is so much insight and philosophy to chew on, and so much beauty in the prose, that one could never tire of this superb novel."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"There was a time when if I used the name of the 20th century American writer Ernest Hemingway it also almost always meant that name of the author under review, F. Scott Fitzgerald, would follow in the next breathe (and then John Dos Passos). At that time I placed Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and Fitzgerald \\"The Great Gatsby\\" pretty closely together as exemplars of strong, non-nonsense writing styles and sparse but meaningful dialogue, along with a great narrative. \\"Gatsby\\" still certainly holds up. I find though , especially after re-reading this Fitzgerald first effort that put his name high up on the post-World War I literary scene, \\"This Side of Paradise\\", that Hemingway has won the literary \\"battle\\" for the number one spot as the premier writer of that period. Strangely that period, \\"The Jazz Age\\" of the 1920s, is known as such in great part due to this book and is forever associated with Fitzgerald's name.As is to be expected from a first novel this book is very great indebted to the bits and pieces of autobiographical sketches that hold it together. And, moreover, is driven by the college exploits of the main and most developed character, Amory Blaine, at Fitzgerald's alma mater, Princeton. The long and short of the story line is a very self-conscious attempt by Blaine , including plenty of now seemingly obscure literary references, to find out the mysteries of the meaning of life as a writer. That premise does not work so well in the college milieu that dominates the first part of the book. After all, many college students from time immemorial, from elite colleges and public universities alike, has thrashed over those questions, some successfully, some not.What really made this book important (aside from a glimpse of \\"Jazz Age\\" manners, mores, styles and ennui) is the second part, after college and after Blaine had done military service during World War I in France (although the details of this service are only sketchily drawn). World War I acted a great divide for many of the men, and it was mainly men in those days, who suffered through it. The straight line, as the story line here details, from college to one's proper place in the upper echelons of society got derailed, and not solely in Blaine's case. This dislocation is mainly drawn out here as a spiritual crisis for Blaine but it also evoked class, sexual relations (almost all turning sour, for one reason or another), and life style. This is the heart of the book and the heart of Blaine's (and Fitzgerald's) dilemma: how to resolve the moral crisis within oneself without upsetting the social applecart that allows the wherewithal for such introspection.What does not work here and what in the end makes this an unsatisfying work is Blaine's rather vague and sudden attachment to some form of socialism near the end of the book. Although revolution was in the air and the great revolutionary efforts in Europe, including the seminal Bolshevik revolution in Russia, were in full blast for most of the book one would not know that things like the American government-driven Palmer Raids \\"red scare\\", the split in the left-wing socialist movement in reaction to the American entry into the war and support of the Russian revolution, and the establishment of the American Communist Party were taking place. Blaine's socialism is of a rather diluted sort, one suspects. Still this is a great first effort and if for no other reason that the display of Fitzgerald's' skill with language is worth reading, and re-reading."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I always like to do a little research on books I read as well as their authors, particularly the classics. The first thing I discovered was that F. Scott Fitzgerald's full name is Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald and in fact, he was a distant relative of the author of the poem that became America's national anthem. Maybe that's well known but that particular piece of knowledge had somehow escaped me all these years. This book itself, was Fitzgerald's first published novel, and in fact, became a best seller and put him on the map. It is largely biographical. The story goes that he began writing the novel in Army training camp during WWI, but afterwards had to beg his lady friend, Zelda to come back to him. She agreed only on the condition that he finish the novel, publish it and become successful. This he did and the rest is history.The novel itself is a coming of age novel wherein the protagonist, Amory Blaine never really does come of age. He is a child of privilege and thus has a condescending attitude toward most others, particularly women. He suffers from low self esteem but covers it up with glibness and sometimes arrogance but depite all of that, he is still a likeable character. He is very introspective and Fitzgerald spends a lot of time having Amory try to meld together the idealistic concepts of a Princeton student with the realities of early 20th century American life. Amory has several girlfriends during the course of the novel and it is through these foils that we see what makes Amory tick and how he grows. The story is written in several different forms, through prose, poetry, letters, and stage direction. That can be somewhat confusing when done in the audio format as I experienced this novel but I don't suspect it would be a problem in normal book form.In many ways this could be considered a romantic tragedy. There are numerous similarities with the characterizations and style of The Great Gatsby and most people agree the later work is superior. It has been so long between experiencing the two novels that I can't say which I prefer. Both are classics and worthy novels to read."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This classic was needed by my daughter for her summer reading assignment for freshmen year. Even though I ordered the book mid July I didn't receive it until almost the end of August. That is my only complaint. Thank goodness she is a good reader and got it done before school."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Other reviewers and critiques have pointed to Fitzgerald&#65533;s criticism of the Catholic church and his frustration with capitalism in &#65533;This Side of Paradise&#65533;. Yet there is another poignant theme&#65533;Fitzgerald&#65533;s frustration with women&#65533;that will resonate deeply with men who are currently dating.Amory, the main character in the novel who is, of course, Fitzgerald himself, complains that women are quick to jettison real love for a man with real money. Moreover, he complains of those glittering beauties, their callousness toward men, and the heartbreak they cause.Of one character he writes &#65533;She is one of those girls who never make the slightest effort to have men fall in love with them. Two types seldom do: dull men are usually afraid of her cleverness&#65533;intellectual men are usually afraid of her beauty.&#65533;The same character is said to &#65533;&#65533;[she] treats men terribly. She abuses them and cuts them and breaks dates with them and yawns in their faces---and they come back for more&#65533;. Of course, as a male reader we know both of these ideas to be absolutely true of so many girls and men&#65533;s behavior too.Writing of his broken relationships and his failure to find a proper muse, Fitzgerland writes &#65533;Women&#65533;of whom he had expected so much; whose beauty he had hoped to transmute into modes of art; whose unfathomable instincts...were all removed by their very beauty, around which men swarmed, from the possibility of contributing anything but a sick heart and a page of puzzled words to write.&#65533; The emotional upheaval from broken relations could be the cause of much writer&#65533;s block.The careful reader need not walk away from this lyric prose a misogynist. Rather Fitzgerald&#65533;s first novel can be considered a primer on dating for the college-aged man or the divorcee recently reentering the dating market."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This book is somewhat immature in structure and language in comparison to later books, but it is also Fitzgerald's most honest and autobiographical work. It was done before his infatuation with society and success, and his alcoholism, diverted his intense ability to look at character and its manifestations in sharp relief-- into portrayals of more maudlin sentiment. Its a great 'young mans' book, an art form in itself, and always an important read of an author who achieved fame later in life."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"The writer of the most poetical prose in American literature delivers his first and most nakedly autobiographical novel. Amory Blain, Fitzgerald's stand-in, is a likable lad, and we trace his early years in Minnesota to his career at Princeton, to WWI and his marriage to a temperamental beauty from the deep south. A hallmark of Fitzgerald is that he recreates and preserves his era's mores and values, its class distinctions and its peculiarities so deftly, one feels a part of them within a very few pages."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I never knew much about Fitzgerald or his work until I read This Side of Paradise. The beginning at first consisted of boring details; however, it did help for later in the story as Amory Blaine grew. The book centers around Amory Blaine, a smart, handsome, and egotistical young teen who thinks too highly of himself. I read with much enthusiasm and an idea of where the book might lead. As I predicted, Amory Blaine headed in the wrong direction in life and education. This substantiates the fact that Amory, from an early age, focused more on petty things than on the important things. He never had much guidance during his childhood until he met Monisgnor Darcy who turned out to be the most influential person on his life. Amory traveled through life with neither much guidance nor any love. He was exposed to the high class of American society which only clouded his mind, impeding on his development and realization of who he is and where he belongs. This, unfortunately, carried over into his college and adult years which eventually brought him to his demise. This turnout of events came to be what described the very stereotypical teen in America today. The lesson from this book is that one must focus on what is more important and live for the self, not impress or transcend others. In the end, it doesn't matter what parties you have attended or what social group you belonged to. This Side of Paradise came to be one of the most influential and provocative books I've read in the last year and has broaden my views on life and its' problems. This book will come to be very helpful for teens approaching their adulthood."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side is just as much of a page-turner as Fitzgerald's (more popular) The Great Gatsby.

Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise to the top of my reading list. A strange selling point, perhaps, but it intrigued me nonetheless. He was right.Fitzgerald, a member of the Lost Generation (a 1920s group of writers including Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein) and best known for his novel The Great Gatsby, writes the despair of disillusionment like no other. This Side of Paradise, his first novel, was published in 1920 and tells the story of a Princeton student, Amory Blaine, whose dreams are clouded by his own intellect. Semi-autobiographical, Fitzgerald wrote the first version of the novel (originally called The Romantic Egotist) while at Princeton and, like Amory, faced rejection from the woman he loved because she refused marry into poverty (although in Fitzgerald's case, eventually achieving publication of his novel secured Zelda's hand in marriage). Like Gatsby, Paradise deals with the conventions of the American dream and the often-delusional chase to achieve these dreams that so many Americans fell and continue to fall prey to.I was most struck by how relatable Paradise is to my own life. Don't get me wrong--I'm not Princeton material. But I noticed as I read that so many of the things Amory struggles with throughout the book are things that I have struggled with in the past year. Who am I supposed to be? What organizations should I join? With whom should I associate? What should I read? What should I not read? What should I think about what I read?Maybe the qualifications vary slightly, but we've all got our running list that separates everyone we know (including ourselves) into different categories. Am I a \\"Big Man,\\" and if so, how do I get to be a \\"Slicker\\"? But I think what hit closest to home as I reached the end of the book was Amory's inability to understand the point of it all. \\"Do the next thing,\\" Monsignor says, but for what?I would have enjoyed more poetic imagery. Gatsby left me breathless, gave me chills, and Paradise just didn't have the same effect. However, Fitzgerald's sense of humor in Paradise made up for it, and not in the stuffy high humor way that so often saturates the classics.The only thing I didn't understand was Fitzgerald's occasional abrupt shift from novel to play within the book. It chopped up the flow of the story and slowed me down. In the end, though, it's a tiny blot on what is otherwise an easy read, a beautiful story, and a genius work of art.This Side of Paradise reminded me of why we read the classics. What made Paradise a success in 1920 is what makes it worthwhile now. That is to say, it reminds us that we are not alone, that somewhere out there, someone has dreamt the same dreams, felt the same fears, and survived. Thus, while it crushed my dreams, it didn't leave me in complete frustration like it did Amory. For while Amory didn't have me, I have Amory, and that is one less person who doesn't understand the hard world in which we live."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I was about to pass this book up in order to buy The Great Gatsby, but someone reccomended me to read this one first before I got to read the other books by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I have to say it was a excellent introduction to the author; I've also been told that this book is one of Fitzgerald's less accomplished works, and I did find it a bit lacking on something, I don't know what, but I enjoyed it anyway. Amory Blaine, although richly described, is not a particularly likable character, but he is certainly bright and his capacity for self analysis is amazing, though his little why-is-everyone-but-me-an-idiot attitude can grate in your nerves sometimes. Oh well, I guess that can be forgiven, considering his age; I also believe (sometimes) that at my ripe old age of nineteen I already know all I'll ever need to know about pretty much everything. Speaking of which, I loved that line, &quot;I know myself, but that is all&quot;, I think it about sums up the whole story. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book by F. Scott Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's first novel deserves attention for two reasons: first, it is the first novel by the author of a future masterpiece, The Great Gatsby; second, it is a faithful first hashing out of Fitzgerald's major themes: American class structure, the flaws of capitalism, and the American Dream as beautiful, unattainble woman. Compared to Fitzgerald's masterpiece, however, it is an artistic failure. Unlike Gatsy's vigorous narrative, This Side of Paradise is more egotistical philosophy than riveting drama. Like his protagonist Armory Blaine, Fitzgerald indulges too much in his own precocious posturings as intellectual and social commentator. No forward moving action propels the plot; instead, the reader must endure bland, inconsequential poetry, pompous dialogue among collegiate males who think they are Princeton gods, and silly, vapid romances that lead to no meaningful destination. Nothing is more pretentious than Armory's final comment--that he knows himself, since there is no real substance to know. Readers will get to know him, too, and find very little in him to admire. Throughout most of the book he is peevish, carping, and morally spongy. In spite of its many flaws, This Side of Paradise does possess some hints of Fitzgerald's future greatness. Some of his descriptions, always on the verge of utter melancholy, anticipate the September somberness of Gatsby. The book deserves two stars only because of its place in literary history. It shows the development of a master writer capable later of transcending his own weaknesses and over-indulgences."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"There is so much talk about Gatsby being Fitzgerald's only great work, so I was surprised when I read this novel by the author. It's been about 90 years since this book was written, but it still stands up well. There are fun bits for the historian of the era, but there are also many issues that still resonate today. Like what people will do for love, money, etc.If you like Gatsby I think you'll enjoy this book too. I did."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I'm not going to write a book review here - that's what the New York Times is for - but I will say that if you're in your 20s-30s and you have not read this book yet, make time for it. It's got something for everyone: failed expectations, lost love, drinking, depression, crime, and Fitzgerald's notorious forays into the life of the overprivelaged. You'll learn something useful and profound from this book, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald isn't known as a great writer because he had a powerful imagination, but because he lived an interesting life during interesting times and had a gift for describing with beautiful prose his insights and experiences. His fiction is heavily autobiographical.This story follows Amory Blaine (i.e., Fitzgerald) through his youth, years at Princeton, and beyond as he learns, experiences, and philosophizes about life. The novel is important for many reasons. It has deep and powerful themes: there was an innocence in American culture before the First World War, a loss of individuality and heroics after the war, a growing focus on materialism, and a loosening of morals in society from the perspective of the period. There's also the journey of Amory, from an egotist to something more reflective. This is a novel about change in more ways than one. There are countless \\"party\\" scenes of the type Fitzgerald is so known for - whether lavish festivities before the war or secretive underground benders in New York City at the birth of prohibition - which provide entertaining visualizations of those times. And the experiences Amory has with the vastly diverse women in this novel during his pursuit of love gives the story a timeless quality.Any problems with the novel could be attributed to Fitzgerald's youth when he wrote it (he was about 23). Sometimes the dialogue seems to go on too long and there can be a lot of it, which some readers today may find boring. Fitzgerald had a lot he wanted to say. And his experimentation with completely different writing styles within the novel seemed bizarre; it's as if he was trying to display his various writing talents as a first time novelist, but the occasionally uneven style will annoy some readers.But it's hard to be critical of this novel. It was widely popular when first published in 1920 and is still a relevant, interesting work nearly a century later. While some parts may seem slow, there are still countless memorable scenes and a strong literary exploration of one man's search for the meaning of life at a time of a changing American culture. This is a young Fitzgerald: pre-Jazz Age and pre-Zelda. It is also his first steps toward his eventual masterpiece."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"First things first....IF YOU HAVE NEVER READ THIS BOOK--DO NOT READ THE PREFACE!!!!!! IT GIVES AWAY THE FINAL LINE OF THE ENDING !!!I am a Fitzgerald addict. I remember being forced to read 'Gatsby' at some point in school and grabbing the cliff notes and throwing a worthy paper together somehow (still getting an excellent grade because at that time before college-before I realized the value in education- I had a superb knack for maneuvering words around to make my papers look authentic) . Years later I decided to pick it up again, tired of reading all the bubble gum crap written by my contemporaries I decided to revisit the classics. I have always loved to read but thought I mainly preferred 'light reading' . But I was at the end of my rope with predictable crap that lacked any sort of substance. I actually stopped reading altogether for a long time because I thought I was just simply bored with it. After being out of college for a few years, and living a life with virtually no mental stimulation, I felt a desperate need to feed my starving mind. I looked up lists of the classics and ordered several and dug in. I began by reading Catcher in the Rye, which I actually did love as a child; and loved and appreciated it even more this second time around. I think 'Catcher' is such a special an unique gem because it is such a 'light' and 'easy' read and at the same time still profoundly brilliant. I then picked up 'Gatsby', and again I stumbled on the first few pages, not that they were challenging, but I didn't feel \\"hooked\\". I felt bored with the detailed descriptions of East Egg and West Egg, but I pushed onward. And then around the beginning of the 2nd chapter it happened...I was hooked. The words seemed to jump up off the pages and suck me in, the images were crystal clear. I felt chills of enchantment the first time Jay Gatsby made his appearance, I felt Nick Carraway's excitement and awe in that magical summer. I could feel the tension and loving adoration between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, and watched his character visibly weaken in her presence...'The Great Gatsby' is the masterpiece of all masterpieces'..it's perfect.But 'This Side of Paradise' IS F. Scott Fitzgerald. There is something so special about this book, Amory Blaine is as tragically flawed as any character could possibly be, but I instantly adored him from the very first page. Literally watching Amory grow from boyhood to a manhood, I felt I was reliving my own life. And mine was nothing at all like his, but Fitzgerald perfectly and poetically captures the pains of growth and experience that shape us all; and the existential crisis that many of us face in our lives as we search for meaning and purpose. I have more underlining in this book then anything I have ever read on paper. Every word, every sentiment evoked some primal emotion inside me. I think the reason that F.Scott Fitzgerald's books are so magical, is that he is an artist in the truest sense, he gives parts of himself away to his work. You can really feel him, especially in 'This Side'..Amory is largely in part made up of Fitzgerald. They always say an author's first novel is autobiographical, but it seems like 'This Side' almost IS autobiographical. Of course I must admit that knowing the story behind the writing of the novel, how desperately Fitzgerald was trying to finish it in order to become a success and win Zelda back,also played a part in the romance of \\"This Side of Paradise\\" for me.I just can't rave enough about this book. I started on a journey to read the classics and nourish my post-collegiate mind. I read 'Catcher' , then 'Gatsby' , and then the 'Beautiful and Damned' , which is fantastic in it's own right, but for another review... 'This Side' was my 3rd Fitzgerald read, and next I will read 'Tender is the Night' . So my 'classic lit. journey' has turned into a 'Fitzgerald journey'. While the novels are still essentially 'light reads' [ex. I began an attempt to struggle through Dante's Inferno - now that is not easy reading ! ], I am captivated by the soul of FSF's stories, and any contemporary author (that I have read at least) has failed in giving their story any actual soul. I plan on reading his final novel 'The Love of the Last Tycoon ', published posthumously , after I finish reading 'Tender is the Night '. And if by then I have not grown tired of Mr. Fitzgerald { unimaginable! }, I plan to read his short stories. I know this review trailed way off the subject of 'This Side of Paradise', but I have never loved an author's ENTIRE body of work before, never had a \\"favorite author\\", nothing that I have ever read has come close to the brilliance of F. Scott Fitzgerald. . 'This Side' was written almost a century ago but the story and the journey is timeless.*** As I mentioned in the first line, if you have not read this book, do NOT read the preface. I was SO disappointed and shocked that they would give away the ending before the story. I enjoy reading anything that has to do with F.Scott Fitzgerald's life and history of his stories and novels, so naturally I read the preface [ written by James L West III ], and in it he tells you the final line of the book! I was hoping that it wasn't the last line, because he discusses how there were several versions of the book throughout the publication of each edition, but it is and he GIVES AWAY THE FINAL LINE!! I was extremely irritated by this and it doesn't make sense because at the very back of the book- AFTER the ending and final line--there are Notes, further reading and a section about FSF's life and career so they could have also have put this SPOILER in the back of the book."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"My thoughts on this first, autobiographical novel of Fitzgerald's are a little mixed. On the one hand, I strangely loved the gimmicky and unusual narrative format, with its headlined asides to the audience and occasional screenplay-style dialogue. The writing style is fast and easy to read. But, in the end, the cons far outweighed the pros for me. Plot is nonexistent, a flaw which works when the characterization is strong and compelling, but Amory Blaine failed utterly to connect with me, and the minor characters were ciphers to the point that I had a hard time even remembering who was who. The inevitably formative war years were glossed over, and all the reader is left with are meta ramblings on literature and socialism. Certainly not the worst book I've ever read, but not very redemptive either."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"When first published in 1920 This Side of Paradise rapidly became a bestseller and launched the career of its 24 year old author, F. Scott Fitzgerald. The novel's protagonist, Amory Blaine, is clearly a stand-in for Fitzgerald himself.The book traces Amory's life from early childhood to young adulthood and describes in great detail his challenges and conflicts as he reaches maturity in the very turbulent second decade of the 20th century. Amory, like the author, becomes a Princeton man. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of This Side of Paradise is that Fitzgerald's unbridled nostalgia for his time spent at Princeton comes through loud and clear. (The fact that he never managed to graduate does not seem to have diminished his fond memories one iota.)By his own admission, Amory is an egotistical elitist who has little or no empathy for the less fortunate lower classes. Much of the novel consists of Amory's introspection on the true nature of love, personal fulfillment, the relevance of religion and other equally obtuse subjects. This Side of Paradise is also a bit odd from a structural standpoint in that there is an overabundance of poetry interspersed with the prose and one of the more important chapters is written largely in the form of a play complete with lines of dialogue and stage direction.Those inclined to criticize this book will see it as a hodgepodge of self-indulgence. But to the generation who came of age circa. 1920, it contained much that rang true."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This story is about Amory Blaine, a young man whose story we follow from his early childhood of great privilege through his college graduation to see him develop a great skepticism. It may have been his life's great economic downturn, maybe it was his poor luck at love, or maybe a mix of these and more led Amory to his new perspective. As readers we feel sorry for what has been forced to endure, but the silver lining comes as Amory and his mates discuss love, politics and growing up. The opinions they share are substantial, eye-opening, and they still ring true generations later.This book was recommended to me a few years back by a friend. I asked her what her favorite book was and this was her response. It obviously took me awhile to get around to reading it, but I am glad I did. Better late than never, as they say.I feel the book is best broken up into three sections: pre-college, college and post-college. And the first and third sections were my favorites. The pre-college section covers his childhood as Fitzgerald writes him as an Elizabethan \\"mack daddy.\\" I laughed continuously as the young man with the silver tongue would, always minding his manners, attempt to seduce any woman he encountered.The college section, which is the majority of the book, we begin to see the transformation of Amory Blaine. Through a group of friends that I found similar to the Dead Poets Society from themovie of the same name, Amory begins to finally see pain, suffering and injustice. He is handed a social conscience and wears it from then on as a badge of courage. This section of the book grew a little monotonous for me and was where I had to strengthen my resolve to get through it.The post-college section, though somewhat pessimistic, was my favorite part of the book. In this final few chapters to the book I believe I found why my friend had recommended it. While I agreed with some of Amory's arguments at the end of the book and disagreed with others, I found them all to have merit. I must admit that I am even depressed that many of Amory's complaints about the state of society still plague society today. I applaud the author for writing a book that is still relevant so many years later.This Side of Paradise is a short book where you may breeze through the beginning, lose interest in the middle, and become somewhat empassioned towards the end. I did not love this book, but I enjoyed parts of it a good deal. I'm glad to have now read some Fitzgerald other than justThe Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"In the beginning of the book, I was turned off by its seeming self-indulgent tone and nature. A brilliant, handsome, self-centered young man goes to prep school, then to Princeton, then out in into the world. The story seemed obviously autobiographical, and I knew what had happened to F. Scott Fitzgerald: a short, romantic but unpleasant, alcoholic life. So I read on, with the thought, \\"This is explaining why his life was such a disaster\\", so maybe that can be a reason to keep reading. (Also, I wrote a lot of largely autobiographical, very poor -- not that This Side of Paradise was poor in any way -- fiction when I was in my twenties, so maybe that was bothering me, as I identified too much with Fitzgerald's self-obsession.) And, as Amory Blaine's (the Fitzgerald-like protagonist's) story progressed, it became more entrancing and the self-centeredness less an obstacle and more of the heart of the novel itself. In the end, I would have to summarize that it was a beautiful, brilliant, compelling book, at least as good as Fitzgerald's other work. It's about the experience of the transition from childhood to adult life as viewed by a priviledged (although he wastes/loses his advantages), wonderful (if not very likable at times), artistic genius -- expressed aptly through prose as well as poetry and playscript-type sequences."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"just perusing the reviews and was frustrated to find out the possible ending. don't think they should have said that amory is rejected. I haven't finished the book yet but I'm pretty sure that is an important turning point."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"As a HS sophomore I read this book for the first time, and I was enthralled with Amory's journey to find himself. The closing lines of the novel remain some of my favorite of anything I've read. Everytime I re-read this book, I am captured by the search for self and prompted to rethink my own self-concepts. Some criticize the book for its unrefined style, but the variance in techniques used is one of my favorite parts of the novel. I love Fitzgerald most for his way with words, and the use of both poetry and script along with prose truly showcase his brilliance. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"&quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; was Fitzgerald's first novel, and it is quite immature. But nevertheless, it is extremely vital, and fascinating not jut as an example of his early work, but on its own... the compelling story of a young man trying to make his own way in an increasingly complex world. Rings as true today as it did with the Lost Generation 80 years ago."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's early work is gorgeously flawed. No reader will ever forget Amory Blaine. This Side of Paradise is an experimental, naiive, and self-consciously brilliant work, and should be read by anyone on the brink of their college years, and then again and again."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"While reading the book, I really enjoyed the prose, but my impression was that Fitzgerald KNEW that what he was writing was top-quality, and I think he tends to overdo it a little because of that. The novel is definitely a fun-to-read story. The author has a great sense of humor and has an eye for the subtle traits that make people who they are. And to correct a statement by a schoolmate of mine...Princeton is BETTER than it was during his day. Go Tigers!"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Okay, so not the ABSOLUTE best, but by golly definitely one of them. At first, you think, &quot;Oh, no, I'm going to hate this Amory Blaine, I really am.&quot; But then he grows on you somehow, because you can say to at least one of the situations he gets in--usually the abortive romantic ones--that you've been there, too. Especially good for young men (although by no means just them) and aspiring writers of whatever gender. I liked the way Fitzgerald experiments a bit (the one scene done in the form of a play) and how he ends the book with a phrase that many of us can say, at the end of our journeys--- &quot;\`I know myself,\` he cried, \`but that is all.\`&quot;"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This book was a complete surprise. The structure and material are very fresh and original, although it is almost 100 years old. The plot is not atypical (life story, growing up, especially college) but I'll be damned if any one I ever met in college had conversations like this character and his friends. It makes the reader think - something this reader hasn't done in a few years (and certainly didn't do in college either!). I liked it very much. It touched my imagination and made me realize that I've been a little bit stagnant for some time... (I'm 30). I would recommend this book to anyone. It's very readable, with a lot to say about the world, and all of it applying to today's world as well as the writer's. Thank you, F. Scott."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This first Fitzgerald novel is a brilliant telling of college life in the early twentieth century. Fitzgerald is a genius, inserting psychology and philosophy into his writing with ease. This book is extravagantly written with wonderful detail and a well developed protaginist. A book about egotism, this is a must-read for any reader. One of the best books all time. Pure Genius."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"A young middle-westerner walking in the great paths of Fitzgerald's Caraway and Blaine, not to mention Francis Scott himself, I found This Side of Paradise a brilliant illumination of human character and the subtleties of interactions between people. Who can ever forget such flippantly poignant lines as, &quot;I'm afraid of you. I'm always afraid of a girl--until I've kissed her.&quot; Reading this book, you will find your mind alert, sensing your heart melt."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"It's a shame modern Princeton (or any other college) is not half as wondereful. Nice book, great in parts. It's a good thing Fitzgerald didn't graduate from Princeton, he never would have been even a halfway decent writer then."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Upon concluding my reading of this piece, I came to the realization that F. scott is quite a good writer. Still His style isnt quite to my suiting, but I thought The Great Gatsby was a good book too, only that it ended a little off key, like something wasnt quite right. The same goes for This Side of Paradise. Just seemed like something was missing. The whole book Amory the main character seems to be out to &quot;find himself&quot;. Amory is a young fella attempting to move up in the world. But the structure of the book poses some problems for me as a reader because it has no real structure, very undirected. But even so, I do think it is well written as much as it bugs me that i have trouble following it. After all, cant you think something is beautiful even if you dont like it? Cant you think that a song is well written even if it doesnt appeal to your taste? Well thats how i feel about this book. I suppose maybe you just need to be a certain type of reader to really understand F. Scott Fitzgerald. Bottom line, Good book, i didnt like it though."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This novel is concerned with the growth of Amory Blaine, a romantic egotist, into a true personage. It ends with Amory's declaration, &quot;I know myself...but that's all.&quot; But what does that mean?The novel is okay. Amory reminds me of holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye. Holden believed in honesty and detested phony people and phony things, so he went all over the place trying to stay away from all the phoniness in the world. Amory is like Holden in the extent that they each had a journey which reveals to them new things and expands their horizons.What I don't like about the book is that Fitzgerald inserts numerous poems that he made up. They are put in inappropriate places and don't make a lot of sense. Also, every character in this book lives a luxurious life and looks beautiful and is pedantic and speak incredibly long and grammatically correct sentences. It is like Melrose Place (except the stuff about the long sentences). What enrages me more is the fact that at the end, even though Amory gains a greater knowlege, he still views the poor as stupid and unclean."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald is obviously one of America's greatest modern writers-his prose style and use of language is amazing and The Great Gatsby is a classic that everyone should own and re-read on a regular basis. Yet this book, his first, has one of the most obnoxious, least-likeable protagonists in American literature- Amory Blaine. Blaine is arrogant, self-centered, self-important, and a pompous windbag; yet not in an interesting way such as Holden Caufield. Also, Fitzgerald's description of the idealism of Ivy League life and society is so corny and hokey that it is difficult to read at times.Of course, the book has its merits for the fact that it is the first novel of a great novelist and it contains the seeds of the literary style that he polished with later works. You can still find insights and character descriptions that lesser authors could only hope to create."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Sorry to disagree with most everybody writing their reviews but Fitzgerald failed miserably at getting down to the nitty-gritty of the human condition. He reminded me of the clueless politicians we have in Washington debating health care issues or national defense. Like our politicians, Amory was selfish, pompous, obnoxious and what's perhaps even more inexcusable considering his education, a dim-wit. Fitzgerald's vision doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of our daily lives. His characters are terribly vapid, philistines, bourgois to the max. I tell you what, Amory deserved the ass-kicking he received. I only wish I could have got in a few punches on Amory and Fitzgerald. And his entire rap at the end of the book was nauseatingly peurile. The novel was pure bull."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"who cares if it want written with impeccable structure..so what if its immature....it IS art..i was under the impression that that is what literature is supposed to be..."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Okay, okay I've heard it a million times about This Side of Paradise, Amory Blaine isn't the most likeable character. True, but I ask you, who among us is completely likeable? Who out there doesn't have some flaw? It is these flaws in Amory that make him one of the most wonderful characters in American Literary history.It's also true that This Side of Paradise is a young person's book because it deals with a coming of age and within Amory's character is a certain amoount of angst and maybe even repressed sexual anger, but still no matter who you are, wouldn't you rather read about a character you can relate to on more than just an idealized level like many of the characters in the Great Gatsby? Due to the strength of its central character, Amory Blaine, I think that This Side of Paradise is F. Scott Fitzgerald's real masterpiece."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"An extremely enjoyable read. Fitzgerald writes about what he knew best, himself. There is no such thing as a poorly written F Scott Fitzgerald novel or short story. His body of writing is all excellent. The book is basically a fictionalized autobiography of his early years, with the names changed. Paradise goes into Scott's formative years, his wonderful mother, his early romances, money problems, adventures in writing, and the private schools he attended. It then goes into his Princeton years, his joining the army towards the end of WW1 never having graduated, and of course the meeting and courting of Zelda. His youthful years are wonderfully revisited in the 'Basil Stories'. In his later years Fitzgerald's popularity virtually disappeared, and to contrast Paradise 'The Pat Hobby Stories' has him abasing himself horribly and quite humorously as a washed up hack hollywood script writer who can't write. Of course the Hobby stories prove that he could still write excellent prose"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise is simply astounding--a cautionary tale of youth, of lost innocence, of the things we do when we don't know what to do. His hero, Amory Blaine, is a boy on a search for something--for meaning, for love, for the marrow of life itself. But like the people who characterized the era of &quot;The Lost Generation,&quot; Amory is met with heartache and despair. Like Fitzgerald later wrote, &quot;Show me a hero and I will write you a tragedy.&quot; A must read for anyone still searching for themselves. It is moving, insightful, and filled with notable quoatables:&quot;I'm in love with change, and I've killed my conscience&quot;-Amory Blaine."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I like F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing style because it consists of flowing conversation between characters and good character development. Fitsgerald was one of few authors in the 1920's who was able to capture a period of American history and paint a portrait of the new youth culture. \\"This Side of Paradise\\" is a character study of the protagonist Amory Blaine. Throughout the novel, Amory attempts to make peace with himself and find his place in society. Several times in the novel, Amory reflects what has on his road to self realization that convention, women, and money are the main elements that have influenced his life. Raised by an unconventional mother, Beatrice, Amory tries to correct her influence by indulging conformity. Eventually he discovers that a life full of conformity is full of emptiness and attempts to get back on the path of individuality. After many love affairs, Amory falls head over heels in love with Rosalind, sister of a former friend. Rosalind breaks Amory's heart by refusing to marry someone without great wealth. Amory Blaine eventually abandons women as a source of inspiration. By the end of the novel, Blaine finds himself penniless because of bad investments and no inheritance. With no money, Amory has to look harder for the meaning of life finding a source of guidance within himself. The last line of this novel, 'I know myself, '...'but that is all,' sums up the theme of the entire book. Mistakes are defined as experience."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Banality without laughter and stoicism with epicurean delights are books to the soul. A riddle and a puzzle that combines the heart working with the mind to melt into an orgy of feelings and thought, it is bliss on paper.This book I believe to be Mr. Fitzgerald's greatest, eclipsing the likes of The Great Gatsby more powerfully then the moon does to the sun. This piece being his first published novel offers a depth of understanding that is not normally seen in a first time novelist. It is an inspiration to all those who hope to one day have their names grace the cover of the printed page.The book shows remarkable growth within its pages. The structure is easy flowing and offers glimpses into the life of a man, Amory Blaine. It shows his growth from a person to a personage. The triumphs, tragedies, and laughs of his life. If shows remarkable growth in the style choice by Mr. Fitzgerald and the discerning eye can see the change in his flow throughout the book. He grows in writing as Amory grows in a person.For anyone who read The Great Gatsby in high school and enjoyed even a morsel of it will love this book."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Ever wonder how a person like Gatsby could end up in the situation he is in, having unmeasurable wealth. Well, This Side shows the thoughts of a youth like Gatsby and their major endeavors as members of the lost generation. We learn Gatsby takes a ride with Meyer Wilhelm to lead him to his wealth, well This Side leaves off at that point bearing an eeeerry similarity to the Great Gatsby. Find out about the mysterious Gatsby and his alter ego Amory Blaine today."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise was a very interesting book that shows the life of Amory Blaine from childhood through his early twenties.This book, written in 1920, shows how life was like in the new era of American history. It shows the wild new youth culture which involved drinking and casual kissing. This Side of Paradise is much like an autobiography of Fitzgerald's life shown through Amory Blaine. It tells of what his college life was like and his love for literature. This book expresses views of the social system and expresses the importance of discovering who you are and developing and growing as a person. My opinion of this book is that it was interesting, but it was very boring to read. There was very little action in the story that kept me interested. There was no suspense in the story that made me want to keep reading."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I give this book 5 stars for several reasons: Fitzgerald puts his characters into words on a level I never experienced with any other author: His descriptions of thoughts, behavior and feelings of the characters are very accurate and colorfull. To this, Fitzgerald adds deep psychological insights. No shallow chatter about puberty and well-known theories, but a real , deep dive with a skilfull instructor is offered to those who read carefully. To me, Fitzgerald was like an exquisite but huge strawberry pie: Every bite is delightfull, but to enjoy to the fullest, you may not eat too much at once. I read a few pages a week, so I could let my thoughts linger on these for a while. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best way to read 'This side of paradise.' As if this isn't enough, Fitzgerald puts quite an amount of magic into his work: the meeting with a girl on a dark and stormy night in the fields, the devil staring at our main character, the mysterious relationship with a religious man, and so on and on. In short: Reading this Fitzgerald was a tiring but rewarding experience."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I love F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, his almost florid romanticism and his poetic prose. The first part of This Side of Paradise had me completely, young glib man going to Princeton, full of himself, living a frivolous college life, falling in and out of love. I awaited the story's last part, wondering how his life might turn out. Instead, about mid-way through, and with virtually no coverage of Armory's WWI duty on the front lines, we are served a random, lazily assembled smorgasbord of poetry, memos, script form dialogue, long-winded essays on a very young person's attempt to come to terms with the world, etc. etc. etc. Most disappointing of all is the author's failure to explore the serial failure of his love affairs, a subject I wish he had addressed in far greater depth.I kept on to the end, because of my interest in Fitzgerald's tragically short-lived career. Greatness I suppose was his with Gatsby, for it is work whose substance come through in a structural maturity, forming a contrast to the insubstantial characters and the shallow lives they live. A preface to the Paradise I read by defender Aaron John Loeb acknowledged the book's \\"technical errors.\\" No, no,, we are talking strucutral errors.And still, there is the soul of this author; but what a wasted opportunity that he should have been allowed by his editor (not Max Perkins, I hope) to stop working after the first 100 pages. Because of its second-half collapse, I can only give this book two stars.David Lewis / Showbizdavid"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Mentally taxing. I'm currently almost at the end of reading this book and, given that I have reached yet another confusing and frustrating segment in it, I have decided to put it down for a minute and write this review.I am a growing fan of Fitzgerald. His style of writing is spectacular and magnetic, and it is for these very reasons that I am continuing to read \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" The character that Fitzgerald paints of Amory Blane is impeccable, possibly one of the best characters I've ever encountered in a novel. Undoubtedly, I love the way F. Scott describes all of his characters. His endless use of descriptive phrases weaves this portait of a complex and human being with a completely individual personality that the reader can relate to in some way. We are drawn into them, as if they are our next door neighbors and we empathize with them as if they are our best friends. Simply put: Fitzgerald definitely deserves the recognition of being one of the best American writers.Unfortunately, it's not the way he writes that is an issue for me. It's more or less the way he organizes what he writes that leaves me confused. Just when you are getting into some juicy portion of Amory's life, F. Scott suddently flips the switch and takes you on yet another turn, as if all of his ideas for the life of Amory seem rushed. I would have loved to have read more about Amory's days at St. Regents or about his relationship with Beatrice. It's as if each important segment in \\"Paradise\\" could become a book in of itself. Also, the sprinkling of poetry in every section of the book makes me a little annoyed. It's almost as if Fitzgerald wanted to show off his poetic talent in between telling the story of Amory and it further takes away from the already fragmented flow of the book, distracting the reader from the original storyline even more.Nevertheless, in spite of its flaws, \\"This Side of Paradise\\" is a book I would recommend. Amory Blaine is such a relatable character and F. Scott Fitzgerald is totally an amazing writer that one can look past his missteps and easily see the gem that this book is. You become deeply concerned about Amory's wellbeing and that amount of emotional connection to a particular character is a rarity that I have hardly experienced. Instead of an impassive observation, you feel as if you have grown up with Amory and understand all of his eccentric characteristics. Fitzgerald definitely has a way with words, albeit a very unconventional way."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"In \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" Fitzgerald recounts Amory Blaine's journey from childhood to adulthood, a journey that he himself was just starting in the writing arena. \\"This Side of Paradise\\" has moments of brilliance that rival some seen in his later works but it is missing something that makes the later works truly memorable and classic. I recomend this book if you are trying to gain a complete understanding of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his life, but if you only read occasionally, one of his other books or his short stories would be more enjoyable."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This book is perhaps my favorite of all Fitzgerald's works. Unlike Gatsby, with its high drama and giant archetypes, This Other Paradise is a book of subtlety. Amory Blaine is one of Fitzgerald's best drawn protagonists, perhaps because he is is Fitzgerald himself. Reading this book, you can't help but feel young, idealistic, and full of innocence."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I read several of Fitzgerald's books before this one, and, although they were all fantastic, this one blew me away. It was Fitzgerald's first book, and you can tell. I can just see his mind saving up all these things to say for twenty years as he grows up, and then finally finding an outlet. The book has energy, much like Kerouac's On The Road, and it sustains an intense level of philophisizing and intellectualizing all the way through. It is an explosion of ideas, coming from one of the greatest literary geniuses of the century.I do admit that subtley is not one of the traits of this book, and that each idea is expressed fully, with nothing held back. I think that's what makes this novel so unique among his other works; he is letting out all he has been dying to say, and he says it very well."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"F Scotts first novel really should be the last thing you read,as it is a pot pourri of the themes and styles F Scott used to mesmerizing effect in his other novels and many short stories.I felt that,had this been my first encounter with F Scott;I wouldn't have come back for more.It starts off like a witty Oscar Wilde tale,then heads into meloncholy and philosophy,and at times tries to be too literary for its own good.But I found 'This side' hugely important and enjoyable having read his 3 other completed novels;Pat Hobby and the benchmark of all short stories,the wonderful \\"Diamond as big as the Ritz\\".(Only Richard Yates' 'The Builders' or 'Liars in Love' can be said to have reached that mark-but please list others you feel are as good;I can't read everything and appreciate pointers!)'This side' is a great slice of history and F Scott displays his many writing gifts throughout.That 'This side' doesnt quite run smoothly or consistently is ,I admit, a trivial criticism.F Scott was just 23 when this was published and helped change the style of the novel."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a novel that tells the story of Amory Blaine from his youth to his twenties. As a youth Amory travels through out the country with his high class and extravagant mother, Beatrice. After living a life like no other he leaves his mother and enrolls in St.Regis prep school in the Northeast. There, Amory tries very hard to fit in, but with his unusual childhood it is very hard. He is very intelligent, but an underachiever in his work. From here, Amory attends Princeton and his primary concern there is to be popular. After he earns an \\"F\\" in a class he gives up this goal and becomes a wallflower. He decides to take nothing in from his classes and only learns through personal reading and discussions. Near the end of his stay at Princeton Amory joins up for World War I. Whilst over in the war fighting, Amory's mother passes away. When Amory comes back to America his heart falls girl named Rosalind Connage. She, as well, falls for him, but a problem comes in to play when Rosalind fins out that the Blaine's have made poor investments and Amory is no longer wealthy. Amory decides to work for an advertising agency to try and keep Rosalind from leaving him, but his efforts do not help. Rosalind breaks up with Amory to marry a much wealthier man. The result: Amory is so devastated he goes on a three-week spree of drinking. The only reason it is cut to three weeks is because of the beginning of Prohibition. After he gets in to a summer fling with a wild French girl named Eleanor. Things do not last and Amory moves on, still thinking of Rosalind. One night Amory joins his old Princeton friend Alec in Alec's hotel room. Alec is in politics and on this he has a girl in the room. He is caught, and to save his friend from the possibly devastating publicity Amory takes the blame. At this point Amory tries to contact his old father figure, Monsignor Darcy, but learns that he has passed away. Now Amory finds himself in a hole with no money and no close friends. He decides to walk to Princeton and while walking is picked up by the father of a friend from the war. Now with no money, Amory expresses his new socialist beliefs to this man. Finally he departs from the car and continues his walk. The novel closes with Amory's famous words of self-knowledge: \\"I know myself, but that is all--\\".I found This Side of Paradise to be a very intriguing and entertaining work. It, as well, served as a very educational work. Like any writing there were some flaws in my opinion, but, overall, it got the job done. The novel took the reader inside the world of a teenager and young adult during the 1920's. Before reading this I had no idea how interesting the social life for this age group was in the 1920's. It showed how fun life could be one moment and than in an instant it could all be turned upside down. Through out the novel Amory was in search to understand the world, but in the end he realizes he does not need to, all he needs to know is himself. Being a senior in high school I feel that the lessons here on how one cannot rely on anything and that realizing one's self is of great importance are going to play a role in my life for years to come. The one biggest problem I found with this book was the \\"Debutante\\" section. It is written in screenplay form and this really does not flow well. Besides this one problem, This Side of Paradise is an unbelievable novel with great insight into the world of the 1920's that shows the reader lessons about life for the 21st century."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"After 80 years, what can be said about Fitzgerald's first novel that hasn't already been said? The first thing that struck me on reading this was the timelessness of its subject matter, no matter how dated the setting is. The Ivy League of Fitzgerald's indifferent hero, Amory Blaine, is a thing of the past, with only the faintest reminders of its aura of American royalty remaining today. Reading about Amory's days at Princeton is a bit like looking at the ancient photographs of 19th century football teams that every university seems to have on display in some corner of the campus, with the added twist that most of those long-ago jocks were presumably the sons of bankers and senators. And yet, Fitzgerald's depiction of a whirlwind of exhilaration, alienation, eagerness for the future and a sense that it should all be more meaningful is still all too recognizable to those of us who are just a few years out of college. So like all the best fiction, the story works both on a historical and a contemporary level.Amory isn't the most sympathetic of protagonists. Coming from a non-aristocratic but quite cushy background, he's all you would expect from a Fitzgerald hero: full of himself, indifferent to the less fortunate, somewhat lazy, and at once condescending to and inept with women. But this is a story of young adulthood in the last gasps of the pre-World War I upper-crust, and Amory is the perfect vehicle for illustrating the youth of that time and place. Although the relative lack of details provided about Amory's experience in the war is odd, it adds to his Everyman quality for the generations since his, all of which have had their own reasons for a bleak outlook at some point even if few could match the sheer trauma of 1917-18. The one real flaw in the story is an inconsistent, and often unconvincing, quality when it comes to how and why Amory falls for the several women he endures romantic misadventures with. For all the heartbreak he endures, the reader is often left wondering where his attraction stemmed from in the first place - an odd shortcoming considering how good Fitzgerald was at illustrating that issue in later works. But the romantic episodes that do work are vivid enough to forgive the weaker ones. Also, as usual, Fitzgerald's narrative style is somewhat purple; but he's so good at it that it usually doesn't strike the reader as a problem.Bleak as it may be, this is a great book for anyone who has survived young adulthood and remembers it honestly. Just try not to laugh or cringe next time somebody wants to talk about \\"the good old days.\\""},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was 15 years old. I read it several times and carried it with me around the dreary halls of the oppresive, boring land called High School. Even as a kid I sensed Fitzgerald's amazing writing gift: his effortless way of painting a visual picture in the mind of the reader. He was always extremely funny, off-beat and his charactizations are usually on the mark. Though Amory Blaine's psyche wanders a trifle after the first hundred pages, it's impossible not to gravitate towards him, the things he says and the stunts he pulls.After 25 years I picked up the book again recently. Dusting off my old copy, I re-read the pages that had so captivated me as a teenager. Time dulls many things and people change. But I still love the book and think it's a brilliant first novel. Though it's sappy in spots and it definitely lags at the end, Fitzgerald still had a beautiful ability to harness the emotions of the reader into a world now vanished. It's not his most complete or mature work by a wide margin, but it matters not. This is still a great book, especially for young people or those still a kid at heart."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's novels are a one trick pony in the sense that he writes about the same time period (the 1920's), the same kind of people (rich or successful Americans) and protagonists who suffer the same fate (men whose ultimate failures are the result of their own shortcomings and the influence of women). His works are also highly autobiographical. Thus to read Fitzgerald with understanding one should start at the beginning (This Side of Paradise), move to the full bloom of his talent (The Great Gatsby) and culminate at the end (Tender is the Night). It would help to read a good biography along the way. The other option is to just read Gatsby which is one of the finest American novels ever written.This Side of Paradise is his first novel and here we see both the promise of the character, Amory Blaine, and the author. On the very first page of the novel Fitzgerald displays his talent for words in his description of Amory's mother: \\"All in all Beatrice O'Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again; a tutelage measured by the number of things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming about; a culture rich in all the arts and traditions barren of all ideas in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud.\\" This lengthy sentence, despite its seeming awkwardness, tells us all we need to know about Beatrice and suggests that the son will share the same qualities. Other examples of Fitzgerald's facility with words follow. On page 45 he describes Isabelle thusly: \\"She paused at the top of the staircase. The sensations attributed to divers on springboards, leading ladies on opening nights, and lumpy, husky young men on the day of the Big Game, crowded through her. She should have descended to a burst of drums or a discordant blend of themes from \`Thais' and \`Carmen.' She had never been so curious about her appearance, she had never been so satisfied with it. She has been sixteen years old for six months.\\" And on page 47 is Isabelle's description of Amory: \\"she had expected him to be dark and of garter-advertisement slenderness.\\" Only Fitzgerald could come up with such vivid and evocative descriptions.One fault of the book is that it is too episodic without clear transitions. First Amory is a child, then a student at Princeton, then a soldier (although we really do not see this part of this life and it seems to have not affected him), then a lover of Rosalind, then at loose ends, then has a relationship with Eleanor, then the book ends with Amory alone in the world and spouting socialist maxims. It is hard to picture this individual, who for 200 pages has been totally absorbed with himself, suddenly developing a social conscience!Another problem I have is that Fitzgerald tries too hard to show his education. The book is full of poetry and literary references. It is written much as a college student would write a paper to try to impress the professor and thus get a high grade, rather than in a manner that is appropriate to the telling of a story. Fitzgerald is, of course, at this point in his life not far removed from Princeton and perhaps is still writing as a college student.In the end, then, we should read This Side of Paradise for the beauty of the language and not be overly concerned with the story line and characters."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Reading some of these reviews has proven to be depressing - in the sense that everyone is focusing on the youthful 'flaws' of this novel. Perhaps it is not comparable in brilliance to Gatsby - but kids-Fitzgerald was a rarest of species-he was a literary genius and Gatsby was his masterpiece! 'This Side'...may have been his first attempt out but never the less a marvelous portrait of being young in the 20th Century. It's shameful that people constantly compare this story to Gatsby, his Sistine Chapel of novels. No, this is simply a terrific story - and it truly is. Amory Blaine is an exceedinlgy likeable protagonist(something all the 'young hip'writers of today seem to forget to have), his images are portraits and his prose are just beginning to blossom. Indeed, this a youthfully 'flawed' novel by a young genius - which still equals an excellent work of fiction. - Oh, and if one reads this book and does not like Amory Blaine, that someone either forgot what it was to be young - or simply doesn't want to be reminded. Ciao."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"As much as I would love to give F. Scott Fitzgerald's first novel five stars, the fact that it is a mere shadow of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (my all time favorite novel) holds me back.It amazes me to think that he wrote this when he was only twenty-three years old, and yet the vanity and arrogance expressed by Amory Blaine and his generation is suggestive of youth and the ideas of invincibility.Without doubt this is a smartly written, witty novel yet also highly indicative of how truth and experience are blindsided by youth, beauty, and the hauteur of the newly educated. Perhaps the best aspect of the novel, for me as a diehard Fitzgerald fan, is his signature of wonderfully poetic prose. There is something about the way he crafts a sentence that allows for every sense to be involved. You can not only hear and see what he says, but smell and touch it as well. Despite the intellectualism involved in his writings, it is his poetic honesty that speaks to me on a visceral level. He is simply a genius in this respect. In reading this work, one can only consider \\"The Great Gatsby\\" as a natural progression of the privileged wealth and leisure demonstrated here. And on another note, there is also a great deal of recognizable autobiography going on in the text which adds to the authenticity of the story.And lastly, this is the book that \\"sealed\\" the marriage between F. Scott and Zelda...perhaps the most tragically romantic marriage to date, at least in my opinion.And with this, I will leave you with a quote from the book:\\"While the rain drizzled on, Amory looked futiley back at the stream of his life, all its glittering and dirty shallows. To begin with, he was still afraid--not physically afraid anymore, but afraid of people and prejudice and misery and monotony. Yet deep in his bitter heart he wondered if he was after all worse than this man or the next. He knew that he could sophisticate himself finally into saying that his own weakness was just the result of circumstances and environment; that often when he raged at himself as an egotist something would whisper ingratiatingly--'No. Genius!'\\""},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"An interesting thing about This Side of Paradise is how strongly autobiographical it is. Like Fitzgerald, the protagonist, Amory Blaine, goes to Princeton; like Fitzgerald he forms a strong friendship with a prominent intellectual in the Catholic church; like Fitzgerald he struggles through various romances; like Fitzgerald he searches in vain for meaning, for his own path intellectually.In a sense, this is an autobiography of Fitzgerald's own intellectual awakening, and interwoven into the tale is a sort of reading list of literature that Fitzgerald found meaningful at various stages of life, such as Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Whitman's Leaves of Grass. It's interesting to trace his development by looking sequentially at the literature he got into, what he found most interesting and most relevant.This is the story of an intellectual struggle, a search for meaning, and as such it can be rather depressing at times; it's very relevant, however, to our own times. The issues Amory Blaine grapples with -- his own desire to be powerful, his struggle to find who he is intellectually, the trials of maintaining intellectual and artistic integrity in the era of the mass media -- are ones that we still face today. For today's youth struggling to figure things out, the tale of Amory Blaine, lurching in fits and starts down his own path, is relevant; the general emotions and impressions he encounters, combined with the specific works that become instrumental in his development, make this a unique and interesting novel. It was Fitzgerald's first novel and does have its shortcomings -- a strange structure, sometimes incredibly artificial dialogue, and a style that hadn't yet matured into the graceful prose Fitzgerald would exhibit in The Great Gatsby. Yet as a story of a young man's intellectual awakening, it has great relevance even now, at the start of the 21st century."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Okay, so I didn't even want to read it, but I picked Fitzgerald for my major paper at the end of my AP lit class, and Tender is the Night was checked out of the library. So I picked this as a substitute, I read it really fast, and I tried to analyze while I was reading. I didn't get it until I stopped trying to figure it out. Amory is such a great character, a work of genius in my mind. Fitgerald has such a talent for wrapping his books up in one last line, something that summarizes the entire novel and reveals to the reader the true purpose of the story. Amory's last line, &quot;I know myself, but that is all&quot; is perfect for a story about a man's growth and maturing in every way. Amory Blaine, I love you even if you are an egotist. I would recommend this book to anyone with a love for literature or just a love for a good story. It is a book that can be seen on a million different levels, one is never too uneducated or too intelligent for it, I believe that it can speak to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"It's an enormous comfort to find that the 24 year old Fitzgerald did not produce a perfect novel. It's not as comforting to know that the 29 year old Fitzgerald did. Ah well, the Beatles were done being the Beatles before they were 30.This book is no pleasure to read unless you're interested in seeing FSF develop, and this is his start. This is an interesting lens on Gatsby and reveals some of the more subtle techniques by being used crudely here. The primary similarity is the use of satire in the real old Satyricon sense. In both novels, there's a devoted attempt to meticulously record his surrounding in order to hold their trappings up to ridicule.The problem with This Side of Paradise is that it's a bildungsroman and a fairly autobiographical one at that. The self-criticism and self-knowledge that is necessary to declare one's own quest for adulthood as absurd isn't available to one immediately upon entering it (See Stephen in Ulysses for a successful version - decades older). That's sort of the problem with the whole work. F keeps falling in and out of admiration for Amory, and consequently, Amory is never a reliable lens on his world. It's kind of a wreck.This book made Maxwell Perkins's career at Scribner, and so TSOP could be said to have been crucial to the development of Hemingway, Wolfe, et al. What made Perkins think that this was so revolutionary? Perhaps some was scandalous - She's been kissed many times! - it's not so shocking now. Perhaps it showed a world not seen before, St. Paul's, Princeton. Perhaps he was the first voice of a generation. Maybe Perkins just had an unbelievable eye for talent. The evidence is there if you look hard enough. It's up to the duly warned potential reader to decide whether they want to.However, as an inspiration to young writers out there. Get going. Write a bad book. Write another bad book. Then write a great one."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I don't know why. I liked The Great Gatsby. I love Fitzgerald's short stories. But I just couldn't get into this book. It took me months to make it halfway through because I'd put it down and read a few other books before picking it back up. When I realized I was looking at finishing the book as a chore instead of a leisure activity, I moved on completely. I'll just have to live with not knowing what happened in Amory's life."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is a brilliant work that many categorize in the &quot;male coming of age&quot; genre. It is correctly placed there and is on par with, if not better than, &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This novel shows the zest of a young writer already in greatness on his way to perfection. The radical structure of this novel shows the creativity and non-conformity that Fitzgerald set as the mode for the modern day contemporary novel. His incorporation of poetry, music, and, and then sudden shift to play-writing, in his prose, to get his point across are brilliant in his execution of &quot;showing rather than telling.&quot;Amory (wordplay on amorous) is looking for truth and sense in his life. He seeks it in intellectual pursuits, riotous living, and love. Love is what makes him most vulnerable.His general liking for the arts rather than the sciences mirror the ambitions of so many young males, males who would be reading this novel. He can't dwell in what is known or scientifically documented, his heart lies in the arts and history: the former a place an outlet to seek truth and the latter a point of reference by which he categorizes himself. He believes love to be something tangible like the music he hears, the poetry he reads and writes, but love is chaos. He makes lists to categorize and make sense of elements of the social world around him, but life (especially in the shift from adolesence to young-adulthood) and people are so incongruent that none of it is able to be categorized. The use of the shift to play-writing is not used gratuitously. Amory believes that life and love fall into place once one is done with school and sets out for the world. He is acting/living out a love story in the real world, but nothing in life is structured like the story line to a dramatic romance.Fitzgerald's narrative is a lyrical, yet chaotic whirlwind, it perfectly coincides with the life of a person coming into adulthood during a time of drastic social change and the disillusionment from the atrocities of The Great War.The last quarter of the novel shows the roots of what would grow to Fitzgerald's literary perfection. Reading the ending to this book keeps the reader in a state of awe.There is a beautiful array of one-liners gracing the pages during Amory's conversation with the Goggled Man and his partner. Everyone I discuss this novel with has a favorite line or two from this section. The words that have been turning over in my mind ever since the first time I read this novel are:&quot;'I'm restless. My whole generation is restless. I'm sick of a system where the richest man gets the most beautiful girl if he wants her, where the artist without an income has to sell his talents to a button manufacturer.'&quot;The last line of the book is a lesson in itself. Fitzgerald entertains the reader from the soft and subtle beginning, to the chaotic yet, settling end:&quot;I know myself,&quot; he cried, &quot;but that is all.&quot;After all the people he had come in contact with during his journey for truth and love, and all the low and high points that Amory has had, he feels his efforts were worthwhile, but doesn't know why.Mapping life is a futile effort. Mapping and knowing yourself is an amazing feat in and of itself that few achieve. And knowing yourself is &quot;all,&quot; everything that you would ever need to know in life...This novel is a must read for all young men. ENTER THE LABYRINTH."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise - F. Scott FitzgeraldI have loved F. Scott Fitzgerald's works since high school and the Jazz Age has always been my favorite time period in history. I've met a fair number of people that don't like his works, but it takes a certain sort of imagination to enjoy his writing style. He's a very simple but whimsical writer. When reading his works you get swept up in a world of noise and excitement and privilege.This Side of Paradise is a perfect example of that. Told as a series of short stories, or vignettes, tied together to make a full length novel, This Side of Paradise introduces us to Amory Blaine and takes us on a journey through his life, beginning with his years in Minneapolis while his mother Beatrice is away recovering from a nervous breakdown. We then follow him through his years at St. Regis' school in Connecticut. Sadly, the book does not stay on this upswing of glamour and romance.By the time Amory has goes off to college, he has become more egotistical. In fact, I found him to be quite the egotist throughout the entire book. He even admits that he spends a lot of time thinking about himself:Amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant. Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him...sat in the train, and thought about himself for thirty-six hours (Fitzgerald, 61).This paragraph is a perfect example of his selfish nature - he wants only what he wants when he wants it.Throughout college, Amory splits his time between going to class and having adventures with his friends. He is still trying to find himself (which I think anyone in college is able to relate to). On a break, he spends an evening with Isabelle and wants to be with her, but knowing that he is going back to school they end the night as friends. Despite their closeness and the allusion to a possible relationship, Isabelle's role in Amory's life comes to an abrupt end. Once he gets back to school, he ends up going to the beach with his friends, where they manage to have quite a good time, despite the fact that they don't have any money.I found Amory, as a person, to be quite selfish. He is always looking out for number one and doesn't seem to care what happens to others. He is picky about his friends and who he will allow into his life. As a character, Fitzgerald does his best to develop him and tries to help him grow as all young people should, but Amory comes across as the sort of person that you should be leery of if you met him in real life.Honestly, this book was terrible. I found it boring and poorly executed. It is billed as semi-autobiographical and it really makes me dislike Mr. Fitzgerald as an author. I am typically a huge fan of his. I have nearly all his works and The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books, but I am having a hard time getting through this work. I understand it's his first and that perhaps he hadn't found his writing niche yet, but it still feels too choppy and incomplete, even for an inaugural work. I dreaded reading this book and had to set page requirements for myself in order to get through it. I am always disappointed when a book is like that, because there are so many great books out there that I do want to fly through and find out what happens. I didn't have any attachment to the characters in This Side of Paradise.The interlude of this book was my favorite part, because it was the shortest. Without warning, the reader is thrust into a one act play entitled The Debutante, which was strange. The remainder of the book is somewhat existential stream of consciousness prose. Amory is going through life as if he's the only person on earth. He wants money, but he doesn't want to work to earn that money. He wants a girl, but doesn't want to be married. Unfortunately, none of the women he's met were willing to just be his girl - they all wanted to be married. And who can blame them? That was the expectation of the time.I really feel that Mr. Fitzgerald was trying too hard with this book. He should have slowed down and treated it as a first work - not as license to write a crappy novel but as an opportunity to experience growth and learn as he wrote. The book ended very abruptly and there really was no closure to any of the stories. We have no idea what Amory or any of the other characters end up doing with their lives. I was disappointed in this book and my love for Fitzgerald has waned."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I really like this author and he has an unmatched ability for subtle description, his works are definitely must reads."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's first novel, This Side of Paradise was given a tentative thumbs-down by the literati of the day, most not understanding what Fitzgerald was trying to accomplish. And even today it's not a particularly easy read. From the standpoint of early twenty-first century, though, the book seems a precursor to postmodern literature, with its disjointed narrative, its social and political references, and above all, its overwhelming self-awareness. The book has been called a critique of humanity's attraction to glamour, but that hardly seems the complete story.Amory Blaine is a well-to-do, bratty WASP - egoistic, handsome, with a glib mouth. Underlying all this is an insecurity that begins to show its teeth during Amory's Princeton days, as his mum dies and leaves him with nothing of value. He turns to girls for succor, but he quickly discovers, in the way of early twentieth-century life in the U.S., that his looks, his disarming way, have little truck without a serious jingle in his pocket.So Amory enters into a series of promising but ultimately unfulfilling romances, joins the army during World War I, and returns to life as a menial ad copy writer. His conscience during this time is a Catholic priest, Thayer Darcy, who has had a dalliance with Amory's mum in days past. But Amory can't be corralled by faith and religion. He does, though, offer to sacrifice himself before the law in order to save a friend's reputation. Still, even this turns to spoiled milk.In the book's final pages, Fitzgerald offers a clumsy, summarizing motif: Amory is given a ride by two well-off, conservative men, and they enter into an argument concerning what today would be Milton Friedman's capitalism versus socialism. I was stunned as I read these pages - how appropriate that argument seems to today's bare-knuckled conflicts over the same ideological ground!Fitzgerald's writing here is brilliant in places, but his structure seems of the ad hoc variety. As with the argument mentioned above, many of the book's themes and situations are handled clumsily or are dropped unfinished as the author moves on to other ideas. At its basis it's a bildungsroman. But there's also Amory's fall from grace, which establishes his reinvention, something that was a religio-literary staple of the day. In the end, Fitzgerald leaves Amory disillusioned but hopeful. In the final paragraphs, Amory sums up thusly:\\"It's all a poor substitute at best,\\" he said sadly.And he could not tell why the struggle was worth while, why he had determined to use to the utmost himself and his heritage from the personalities he had passed....He stretched out his arms to the crystalline, radiant sky.\\"I know myself,\\" he cried, \\"but that is all.\\"Still, that 's a start, as this supremely talented writer began a slow, awkward climb toward a never-achieved literary perfection."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I was really intrigued by this book and Fitzgerald's style of writing.

Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece, both in style and breadth of storyline. It will remain a classic and with any luck will be read by generations to come."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Few would argue against including \\"This Side of Paradise\\" on the required reading list for students of American fiction. It's F. Scott Fitzgerald's first novel, which provides both a taste of how great Fitzgerald would become as an iconic American writer, and also an autobiographical glimpse into his life at the turn of the century. The protagonist of the story is Amory Blaine, an aspiring young writer who comes of age at Princeton during the First World War. Amory struggles to find his place among his peers and within society. The story flows very smoothly, but with a few fits and starts during the middle chapters.It's clear that Fitzgerald also struggled to complete this book. Satisfying himself didn't come easily, nor was it easy for him to satisfy his editors. The end result is very readable and highly enjoyable. The play which appears mid-way through the novel is a little strange, but it doesn't take away from the development of the plot.I also recommend reading the book's preface for its interesting analysis of Fitzgerald's early years, and its discussion of the book's background and genesis."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's first novel is a profound and insightful coming of age story that reads like my deepest thoughts. Amory Blaine, who was raised by an eccentric mother and a sensible aunt, attends boarding school and eventually enters Princeton in 1913. He goes to the war for a bit and returns to a fairly aimless life in NYC.Amory is an eccentric and utterly self-obsessed and egotistic. He is clever in almost all ways and knows that he is in some ways a genius - but the type that has no channel for his potential. Amory is at times brutally honest with himself and painfully self-aware. He knows he is vain and knows that - like a superman - he id detached from morality. He wonders if he is a \\"good man\\" and admits he is not. He wonders if any \\"great man\\" can be \\"good.\\" He also lacks self-awareness at times - or at least the discipline or motivation to change his self-defeating attitude. The book ends with Amory's iconic lament \\"I know myself, but that is all-\\"He sees things too clearly to ignore the baseness of life, and just short of clear enough to know how to live and how to be happy. He is for one day or one week or one month overwhelmed by the beauty and possibility of life and by the way in which 2 people can connect with each other. He knows that he is special for fully appreciating these times. . . . Then, he is struck by the way in which \\"life\\" and \\"society\\" distanace and disconnect individuals from this beauty and from their ability to feel this beauty. The young Amory Blaine is in touch with and cultivates his ability to feel the grandeur of life; his life at Princeton allows him free time and few worries. As Amory ages, he cannot figure out how to live in the real world - with all of its boringness and convention, and his own desire to impress others (the latter of which also features big at Princeton). Amory flip-flops between a conviction that he must stay true to his youthful state of mind and a conviction that he must recognize the inescapability of responsibility and the limitations of society. He searches endlessly for a book which offers the answer. The irony is that Amory's magnificent mind and heart which see so clearly the beauty of life also see the tragedy that society as a whole operates outside this fold. Knowing that society is so flawed, Ammory doesn't know how to participate in it and he fears he will lose himself if he does. Amory's gift is his downfall.Things that had been the merest commonplaces of his life then, deep sleep, the sense of beauty all around him, all desire, had flown away and the gaps they left were filled only with the great listlessness of his disillusion.\\" Amory Blaine looking back on the way he was in boarding school and in univ. From F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1st novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"On a completely different note, the life of young privileged men in early 20th century society is interesting. Princeton is a \\"right\\" of these men. There is such a sense of entitlement and empowerment, as well as a separation from the constricts of responsibility. Princeton boys do what they want. They have crazy outings to NYC and Boston. They miss class and don't blink an eye. In fact, class matters little although reading, cleverness, and talents matter a lot. There are a dozen clubs and even more posts to which students belong and prestige is everything. Fitzgerald's depiction of a whirlwind of exhilaration, alienation, eagerness for the future and a sense that it should all be more meaningful is still all too recognizable to those of us who are just a few years out of college.I wish a bit more was said about Amory's time in WWI and it also seems odd that he doesn't hugely react to it although it must affect him. The repetition of Amory's thoughts is sometimes a bit annoyin but accurate to the character. The story also lags a bit at the end and I wasn't convinced that Amory had come closer to his \\"answer,\\" as so many times before he had epiphanies and then abandoned them.Finally, the prose is at times so gorgeous - so melodic - that I've consciously slowed down my reading speed to fully appreciate the beauty of Fitzgerald's song. Fitzgerals is also an amazing poet - \\"Amory\\" and his friends pen many beautiful pieces. I would absolutely read this book again - perhaps even slower. There is so much insight and philosophy to chew on, and so much beauty in the prose, that one could never tire of this superb novel. The writing is, admittingly, a hodge podge of different styles (80 pages of it taken from an earlier scrapped novel, other bits from poems and short stories) but I like that."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"FITZGERALD writes about a young man's youth and struggle to find himself and what his generation stand for.

I don't remember ever reading This Side of Paradise before, so it was fresh. But it was not the tight piece of writing I found in Gatsby. It seems to be a bit autobiographical, following the life of the hero, Amory, from his boyhood, with his non-typical mother constantly kowtowing to him, into his young manhood, with its many disappointments. It is packed with quotations, many of which are quoted poems written by the author, but which seem to serve little or no purpose. There are also witty remarks and ironic observations on the society of the time. The novel describes Amory's intellectual, romantic, career, and friendship pursuits and the various environments in which he finds himself. He is an egotistical, self-serving character, so it's hard to feel much empathy for him or for anyone in the novel, for that matter. This makes it quite different from Gatsby. This was Fitzgerald's first published novel so his writing apparently improved over time. But it was a struggle to get through it when I was expecting something better."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"So dated it annoys. The language seems made up at times.

I finally donated it to the Goodwill"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Before the decade of the Twenties became known for its flappers with bobbed hair and a general freedom for America's youth, F. Scott Fitzgerald advertised those possibilities in his first novel, \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"Fitzgerald wrote parts of the novel while a student at Princeton, based on his own experiences. He was a mediocre student at the Ivy League institution, but obtained an education nevertheless by performing with a college theatre group called the Triangle Club and reading literature, much like Amory Blaine, the main character of the novel. Just before he enlisted in the army for the Great War, Fitzgerald tried to get a first draft of his novel published. After the Armistice was signed, Fitzgerald worked as an artist for an advertising firm before quitting, moving to Minnesota, and reworking the novel.Mass consumerism and mass marketing developed after the Second Industrial Revolution in America. Businesses found that a catchy slogan and well-constructed advertising sold their products. As others caught on, advertising became required. A popular political cartoon of the day reflected the importance of advertising. In the cartoon, an inventor fell asleep outside the door of his out-of-the-way cottage. The reader realizes that building a better mousetrap doesn't guarantee that people will buy the new product, especially if they do not know about it.Advertising firms hired artists like Amory Blaine to construct the advertisements for these products. Advertisements were featured in newspapers and weekly publications, who hired talented writers to compose short stories to entice the public to read their journals and thus, improve their viability to advertisers. Prices fell as the journals made their profits on selling advertisement. Fitzgerald's short time as an artist with an advertising firm, and his subsequent career as an artist of short stories were as much a fabric of the Twenties as the hedonism in the novel that most readers responded to.Two of the love interests of Amory Blaine, Isabelle Borg&eacute; and Rosalind Connage, were based on real-life loves of Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was able to get the girl in real life that Amory Blaine could not. The fame generated by his first novel improved Fitzgerald's earnings potential and made him a viable suitor. Thomas Parke D'Invilliers and Monsignor Darcy were also based on friends of Fitzgerald. Amory's mother, Beatrice Blaine, was based on a mother of a friend.Critics loved the novel, citing it as the only adequate study of the contemporary American adolescent and young adult. Universities condemned Amory Blaine's impression of college life as a country-club atmosphere of snobbery even though colleges, at the time, were primarily composed of students of well-to-do families from prestigious high-school academies. American adolescents and young adults experimented with the drinking and casual kissing outlined in the novel, creating a new sea of morals for the Roaring Twenties. The mass-produced automobile, available to more customers because of its low price, brought mobility into the life of people. Young lovers could get away from judgmental eyes, and they did.Other notable authors produced stories on similar topics later in the decade. Sinclair Lewis wrote of a middle-aged GeorgeBabbittcatching the seven-year itch and going on a drunken spree of debauchery.Oil!of Upton Sinclair also explored the era's possibilities with Bunny Ross, the son of a wealthy oil mogul. These two heavy hitters of literature helped capture the spirit of The Roaring Twenties, but the novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald defined the era. This Side of Paradise and The Great Gatsby are required reading for anyone looking to explore the changing cultural fabric of American society in the Twenties."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is a difficult read. I am glad that I am able to select a word and it will give me a brief definition because Fitzgerald uses a lot of out-dated, obsolete, and fringe words. It is almost as if he feels he needs to prove he attended college by using these words that (I don't think) were ever in popular verbiage. I have not read the entire story (my kindle fire informs me I have read 25%), so I don't know about the plot, but so far it is nothing &#34;to write home about.&#34;"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"The original title of this book was The Romantic Egotist -- the more apt title than what Fitzgerald's editor had created: the highfalutin feather, This Side of Paradise. In comparison, Hemingway's In Our Time (1925) still can hit you in the gut. This Side of Paradise is only effective in that it could be about today's frat boy at a beer keg party who suddenly has an existential moment after puking his guts out -- think of Lindsay Lohan or some &#34;dude&#34; at a college orgy who finds his or her underpants missing and can't go home then speaks of the moment as the Lost Generation -- a quip bequeathed by Gertrude Stein when her patience wore thin.Fitzgerald did have moments of clarity, in-between drinks and parties, but like many of his romantic egotist admirers, the party was the drink. So in that, moments of the book are painful, not as a mark of his time, but as a waste of it. The 1920s was more than about parties, as today is more than about bankers or movies stars in the Hamptons or L.A. Or so you would think."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use! They take up no space on the bookshelf and are always with you!!!"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"When F. Scott Fitzgerald left Princeton and joined the military, his belief that he would die at war led him to begin writing the autobiographical \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" Written rather schizophrenically - alternating between prose, verse, letters, and stage direction - readers are given a unique and multifaceted introduction to Amory Blaine, the intellectual, perpetually disillusioned youth. As he stumbles through life attempting to figure out what he believes in, who he loves, and how he comes to terms with personal losses, it is impossible not to feel a little closer to the iconic author and his own internal struggles. Amory winds his way through the Midwest, Princeton, Europe, and New York, morphing his perspectives on everything from romanticism to socialism based on his experiences and especially his failures.Fans of Fitzgerald will appreciate the beautiful writing of this work; his word choice and turn of phrase make him remarkably quotable. However, this book is also plagued by narcissism and an overabundance of crazy women with an affinity for poetry, which could prove too much for the reader taking Fitzgerald for a test drive. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" or \\"Tender is the Night\\" would make much better introductions that the majority would argue are simply better pieces of literature. While admitting to myself that this book was a bit bizarre and will never make it onto my \\"books I would take with me on a deserted island\\" list, I could not help enjoying it. This book may have revealed to me just how highly Fitzgerald thought of himself, but I tend to think pretty highly of him, too."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"It's not Fitzgerald's best (Gatsby and The Beautiful and Damned share that distinction), but if you love modern American literature, then you are lucky to have this document of the youthful enthusiasm, exuberance, self-assuredness, and early blossoming of one or our greatest most tragic writers. This is Fitzgerald's foray and kickstart into the world of glamorous literati that he longed for and attained in this first novel. We should all marvel at that accomplishment and rejoice with Amory Blaine's own cocky venture into life's jaunt."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"F. S. Fitzgerald used a Rupert Brooke verse and an Oscar Wilde line as the epigraph of his first published novel \\"This Side of Paradise\\". The verse says that in this side of paradise, the wise can find little comfort. In his novel, he'll try expose how the wise ones feel lonely and lost in this side of paradise.The \`wise one' is Amory Blaine, a wealthy young man who goes to Princeton and discoveries that life is a little different from what he was told. Before that, he has a wonderful and extravagant life with his mother Beatrice. She loves her only son that for some readers it can be a little disturbing. By the way, by using such names (Amory from \`amor' [love]) and Beatrice (Dante's muse), Fitzgerald shows what he is talking about here. He wants to explore the European tradition of love (found and lost) and the importance of love in the life of the protagonist in his growing process.The story is told by an outside narrator who is always adding things from Amory's point of view -- this third person narrator even knows the character's thoughts. Less than making the thread of the story, Fitzgerald prefers to draw sketches of Amory's life. In this fashion, the novel is more a character study of Amory, telling the most important moments that would help the reader to understand the character's quest to find this place in the world.Much of what Fitzgerald used to create \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and its characters comes from his own experience. Many critics have found much of the author in Amory Blaine. This technique of semi-autobiographical novel was often used by Fitzgerald throughout his career -- and it was largely criticized.But \\"This other side of paradise\\" found more acclamation and was his most commercially successful novel. In this book, Fitzgerald was able to capture a period of American history virtually like no one else, and gave a candid portrait of a new youth culture. Not only was he able to described the glamour of the period, but he also made critical commentaries on its flaws."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise is a paean to that special period in a young man's life when he forges the principles, flirts with his talents, find and loses love.Fitzgerald's story is a bit more convoluted as he nurtures his hero from strangeness of childhood (a Portrait of the American Artist, to some extent), through the vanity of teens, through the confusion of college. He captures some of the ubiquitous sensations of being a college student - of the effervescent but ephemeral experience that feels like it will last forever; of friendships, and the general experimentation of finding and losing.The book is also notable for a protofeminist (albeit from a male perspective) subtext that seems to play out in the background. When women enter into Emory Blaine's Life, it is as if the narrator yields the floor to the object of his affections so that she can write her own part, and by providing differentiation and individuation for the female characters, Fitzgerald validates them as living, breathing, self-willing entities.By its end, This Side of Paradise seems like an incomplete story whose only outcome is melancholy. It is the gateway to FSF's biggest works, as the pathos of graduation from college leads to our most consequential decisions and ambitious acttions. Yet something is missing - the carefree, unadulterated moments of certainty that we will do something great, that the world is great, and that anything is possible as long as we don't attempt it."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I missed this one back in college, where I became enamoured of much more sophisticated writers (Joyce and Hemingway, though some here may question this characterization of Hemingway at least). Indeed, I had liked THE GREAT GATSBY back then but was not overly fond of the Fitzgerald opus of short stories so, on balance, I never felt motivated to read any further into his works. And yet I recently found a copy of this one so, having a little time on my hands, set out to read it. At first it was slow going and very dated in its feel. Hard to relate to the early twentieth century upper class snobbery which seems to suffuse the book and, indeed, Fitzgerald's very sensibility. Hard, too, to relate to a bunch of sophomoric college boys roaming the streets, arm in arm, singing silly little college songs and angling to outshine one another by securing a better reputation among their peers and better connections with the &quot;in groups.&quot; And yet, perhaps it was just a simpler time for, in truth, people are not entirely unlike that today though they are, I think, less transparent about it and more sophisticated in their areas of concern. Nevertheless, once past the first superficial ramblings of this book, I began to get sucked into the mind and world of Amory Blaine (presumably the alter ego of Fitzgerald himself). Although he remained a rather superficial and tiresome personality to the end, he was also an interesting soul and one whose travails, such as they were, could and did draw a reader in. I found Blaine's coming of age tale oddly enlightening, if only because I began to see the world as it was, roughly a hundred years ago, in a sharper, almost first-hand perspective. Blaine grows a bit though he never outgrows his essential self-absorption. But the loss of family and friends and lovers take their toll on his psyche and the Blaine we have at the end of the tale is a wiser and bigger boy than the one at the beginning. I think, in general, our serious writers in the twentieth century forgot about telling stories or creating worlds in favor of word-play and self-revelation and that this has done literature no service. Fitzgerald certainly was among those who took writing in that direction. But he sure could write and the fact that the very thin and sophomoric tale of Blaine's coming of age could hold me at the dawn of the twenty-first century is testimony to that. There are better and stronger books out there and some I much prefer. But the man could write. -- SWM"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Reading this book coincided with my decision to major in English. I find it easy to relate to as a college age male (Fitzgerald wrote most of this work while an undergrad at Princeton). It is certainly less polished than his later work, but there is such a young, excited, romantic feeling here. In his later works (including Gatsby) he's come in contact with the unhappy sides of life. This makes his later works more poignant, but you have to love his young idealism mixed in with romance, alcohol, college life. Like almost all of Fitzgerald, this is extremely autobiographical, and this makes it seem more heartfelt in my mind. I couldn't recommend this book more, especially to those in college."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is only my second foray into the world of F. Scott Fitzgerald. I had read \\"The Great Gadsby\\" years ago, as part of a college reading assigment. I also had seen the movie starring Robert Redford.So, over the past few weeks I approached this other great Fitzgerald work with a sense of anticipation, and maybe a little hesitation. Gadbsy had left me flat and drained. I expected Paradise to do the same.Yet, in the life meanderings of protagonist Amory Blaine, I found not a pointless pursuit of nothing much, ending in quiet tragedy. Rather, there is a sense of ultimate success on the part of Blaine, as the narrative closes. Here is a person that seemed to have no real purpose in life, other than a continuation of the first two shallow fraternity years in an Ivy League college.But Amory is no typical Ivy-Leaguer. His wealth comes from some nouveau riche earnings of his late father's smart investments. Tragedy seems to loom on every page, as his inheritance dries up and he is left with nothing. He has not even a healthy ambition to drive him.As a romancer, he can seduce, but never truly win, the most beautiful women crossing his path. They all approach their liaisons with him, fully aware that it is going nowhere. He is a rake without pretense.Blaine's frustrations with the ladies are part of his character development, in his sysiphusian forward-and-back-again career path to nowhere. But in this there is nothing really unique about the character. There is not a man alive, who wouldn't love to have the same romantic experiences as Amory. Eventually the smart ones realize that the best women are the nice ones. The most alluring ones are the ones along the edge of society, not the ones that place themselves front and center, as Amory's love interests always manage to do.So the story ends, somewhere around the year 1930, with Amory at around thirty years of age.In the final chapters, Fitzgerald wraps it up with some prescient social commentary, which seem even to point to reforms in our society that may yet be a hallmark of the Obama era. Fitzgerald pleads - why does our society not more highly value those with creative gifts? Why do we stress a liberal education, and then cast to the gutter those that excel in the liberal arts?Fitzgerald says, no wonder socialism has such an allure to the intelligentsia! If the business and monied classes cared more about letters, music, and the arts, then there would be a place for those so gifted! Yet any advanced civilization needs to celebrate those gifts! Fitzgerald has written this book as a commentary on America's need to put its money where its mouth is. If you can write and create - then it is in society's best interest to take good care of you. The failure to do so may be an overturning of our free market system (one needs only to look at people like Bill Ayers to see how it all may come topsy turvy, even in our generation).But, one wonders about Mr. Blaine at the age of fifty and beyond. I can easily envision him as a respected adademic, with a wife that is also a professor. In his late middle years he has one or two young children, that bring him great joy. He has served on several local boards by this time.And, at long last, he is happy."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Some novels are great stories. Some novels are stories greatly written or told. And, in rare instances, some novels are greatly written great stories. This is one of those rare novels.This novel closely follows the prepubescent Amory Blaine through his 20's. In the beginning, he is a spoiled boy whose father is distant and mother is a great but disturbed woman. With cash in their pockets, Amory and his mother, Beatrice, enjoy one another as best of friends. Home schooled, he is little boy Fauntleroy during the turn of the century America.Things change, step by step, with Amory's character increasing while his bank account is decreasing. Fitzgerald calls Amory the Egotist in Book One, and then dons the title \\"Personage\\" for that same, but now grown, Amory in Book Two.This is very autobiographical. Amory, an Irish Catholic (like Fitzgerald), lives his high school years in St. Paul (like Fitzgerald) then attends prep school (like Fitzgerald) as he is a privileged youth (like Fitzgerald) and later attends Princeton (like Fitzgerald) where he becomes part of Princeton's Triangle Club (like Fitzgerald) and follows Princeton for the Army (like Fitzgerald). Book One, in fact, was written while Fitzgerald was attending Princeton.What makes this novel more interesting than other Fitzgerald novels are the different - and somewhat raw - items within it pages. Scribner initially rejected the book because of it being raw. The rawness is evidenced by numerous poems tossed about within it - great stuff. There are added poems from girls he adored - more great stuff. The letters are also great and pithy. And, in the \\"Debutante\\" chapter of Book Two, he writes in playwright form the Amory wooing of beautiful Rosalind. In his short novel there is poetry, prose and a play. Although somewhat disjointed, it works. And, works magnificently.The ending really shows you something about the young man. He preaches Russia's Socialism to a fat capitalist who kindly gives the Princetonian a ride. Ayn Rand (the Russian born writer who immigrated to America) almost rebuts this portion of the book with her 1957 \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" Remember, Stalin and the ugly head of Soviet Socialism did not exist at the time of \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" Rand, and her people, lived through some of the Red Terror and by 1957 had learned much more about how Russian implementation of Socialism seriously deviated from the ideology espoused by Marx and his peers.Fitzgerald is a great writer. Maybe America's greatest of the 20th century. And, this close-to-home rendition of thought and emotion, may be the most poignant depiction of what the author felt and feared. If you have any interest in Fitzgerald, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"For all the reviews that mention how egotistical and arrogant Amory is, well, that's the point! The book deals with how he goes from being so egotistical to finding out that there's more to life than his self-indulgence. He learns a great deal, and is faced with moral choices that he must deal with. He feels so guilty in places that he mentally projects the devil staring him down, which is a heck of a way to learn your moral stance on something. Fitzgerald admits Amory's arrogance throughout the book and never makes Amory unaware of it, either. But look at it as Amory's life lessons and get swept away in the magical quality of the prose, which for a young man writing his first novel is astounding in parts. Also, for those who find it corny, etc., try to remember that it was published in 1920. Lots of perfectly serious things from that time would seem corny today."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Like everything Fitzgerald wrote this has that burnished by the morning sun feel to it. Certainly there are real themes in it that make this a substantial first novel but the lasting appeal is that romanticism that Fitzgerald himself seemed to have created with his own hands. Forged in that prep school fire though that romanticism isn't made of the toughest stuff and perhaps since Scott never really had any difficulties along the way to becoming a young succesful novelist he was never really forced to become more than that, a young success. His great theme is romance itself, he brings it to everything from football to war to young ladies to writing, he just has the gift to touch and make golden. Not many people will be immune to the contagion of such a disease. Amory is the perfect name for this amourous and ardent young east coaster, a character who was immediately embraced with the publication of this book as the spokesmen for the new up and coming generation, not yet named the lost generation. This book was full of promise and that feeling was infectious and equally attractive was the rather free libertine approach to sex. With Fitzgerald the twenties were born. Amory's affairs are just that, his romances mere flirtations, but he has the ability to make all seem of utter importance because all outcomes effect the state of our heros grace. An egotist, yes! But at that age, college age, what else is there to be. His egotism fuels his romantic ideas about life, and the fire builds and builds slow and burns as bright as life can burn in youth.....at least on this side of paradise."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"this is a brilliant and thoughful book, wonderfully written. it is a true &quot;philosophy on life&quot; that everyone should read."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Few have had the balls to call this book the pretentious pseudo-intellectual twaddle that it is. Amory, a spoiled rich boy, goes to the best schools mommy can buy, but squanders his time there partying and worrying about the cut of his clothes, while becoming a smug, poetry spouting phony. After an undistinguished hitch in the army, he realizes he is too good to work, and toys with several women while becoming an alcoholic and subjecting the reader to lots of bad poetry. Finally, he turns into a political bore, spewing Fitzgerald's socialist propaganda, and wanders the earth insulting innocent people.An episode in one of Amory's shallow affairs, in which he and his girl-squeeze of the moment take a break from reciting poetry at each other to wallow in sociopathic self pity after she has murdered her horse in a narcissistic fit, is particularly disturbing."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Scott Fitzgerald's first novel and his depiction of the \\"lost generation\\" during their college days. Amory Blaine, wealthy and snobbish, but also purposeless, attends Princeton University, joins some clubs, writes for the literary magazine, flirts with a few vampish young women, experiences the typical collegeman's adventures - all the while acquiring the \\"refined sense of the proper 'social' values.\\" But his mother dies and his wealth becomes depleted. He falls passionately in love with the honest but headstrong Rosalind Connage, but she rejects him to marry another man for his money. He has an affair with Eleanor Savage, an atheist, but it doesn't last longer than a few weeks. He flounders in NYC for a while, tasting poverty, and then pays a visit to Princeton again where he ponders his cloudy future in a cemetery, knowing he has \\"only himself.\\"Fitzgerald wrote the book quickly and much of it is autobiographical. It was a rallying cry for the WW I generation that suddenly felt all the old beliefs and systems were dead and gone. Very interesting was Fitzgerald's take on the relationship between Blaine and Rosalind, where he is rejected for one with greater wealth; it's similar to his own early relationship with Zelda. It's a wonderful novel - my second favorite of his after GATSBY."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This book is a series of vignettes about Amory Blaine, the young, privileged and intelligent Midwesterner, as Fitzgerald skims his childhood and then steady focusses on his college years at Princeton, and then post-college barcrawling and womanizing in New York.Fitzgerald thought of Paradise as a booklist. He gives some great ideas throughout the book of works that were on his mind, stuff by Wells, Butler, Dreiser, and Bernard Shaw. This is the ideal place to start for a Fitzgerald reader, because though he does not have a firm command over plot, he has brilliant patches, moments of extreme clarity. And to say this book is plotless is to lie. Amory has poignant moments that offer us a lure to his character. He slips into a deep depression, a three week binge of drinking, to get over a girl. Fitzgerald was a scientist of courtship, and this tale offers a prototype of that same story that Fitzgerald regurgitated over and over again. But what a good story it is, and one we all relate to and hope to eventually overcome."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I have to say, I found this to be by far the best book of Fitzgerald's. Not only was it entertaining, but by turns I was repulsed, horrified, overjoyed, and attracted to the main character. I find that he is very much like a 17 or 18 year old male, heading to college. The descriptions of Princeton are apt, and vivid. I think it would make great reading for a high school English class-- not only is it better than Catcher in the Rye, it is also far more appropriate to their age than Gatsby."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"\\"It was always the becoming he thought of, never the being.\\"The imagery and the romantic ebb and flow of Amory Blaine was riveting."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I attempted to read this for a book club.

I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY KINDLE FOR ME...THE DELIVERY WAS INSTANT AND THAT WAS GREAT! I WOULD RECCOMEND USING AMAZON FOR THE KINDLE AGAIN."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I love Fitzgerald and, in this, his first novel, you can see him being born. It is a sometimes chaotic blend of styles and structures and although his lyric prose is not what it will be, there are glimmers of it. Here too are the (almost voyeuristic) biographical characters and settings and the haunting emptiness and cynicism that will grow to consume his later work and, eventually, the writer.I would say that if you already love Fitzgerald, this book will please, but if you are new to him or new to the Jazz Age writers, this book will not deliver as it could. Much of what one thinks of a writer, I think, depends on which work one reads first and I would hate anyone to miss out on this genius because they began with the diamond in the rough.If you are reading just to read a book, I think you will find the story is one that is thoroughly contemporary and enjoyable."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I did receive the book, but just today (Nov. 8, 2011), which was a couple of weeks past the date promised for delivery. That was my primary concern. The product itself was great and was in good condition. There was no dust jacket on the book. This first novel by FS Fitzgerald is amazing!"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is such a boring book.

Not even finishing it."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I don't know what everyone sees in this book.

The book is childish tripe, chiefly attractive because, with its ivy league &quot;insight,&quot; undemanding readers will think they're in voyeurs' heaven. They aren't. Forget it. Get some brains and go try to figure out any Hemingway short story instead. You will spend more time on a Hem short of 4 pages than this couple hundred, if you have any probity. Treat yourself. If you can't probe, have some ice cream instead. I'm buying. Or a nap."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Don't think I'm stupid or don't get the \\"Roaring 'Twenties\\"... let me just tell you why it sucks.Here goes: first of all, everyone in the book writes poetry. I don't even know why I bring this up first, but it bugs me. It's just like everyone reflects Amory. The only good one was by his friend who sooner or later seems to be stifled of his creativity by simply hanging out with the dull Amory.Another point I have to make is that his one little affair with this country girl is so vague and unclearly written, the only things I understood about it was her poem and a horseback ride.Honestly, it was good in the beginning, but soon enough, it slowly fell apart. By the end it was just a chaos of words. By the end, when he climbs into a car with a big man with goggles and begins a string of vignettes about his views on society which all go nowhere, the book is just analyzations.Well anyway, it just had a horrible impact on my life and I hated his little encounter with the man with curly feet."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"It all begins on 1924. We have many characters which caught great attention to my eye.Let me start out by saying how much I liked this novel. It really caught my attention because it seems that Fitzgerald transported gatsby to the south of France. Dick Diver is a talented psychiatrist that has invited everyone to his mansion. \\"I want to give a really bad party. I mean it. I want to give a party where there's a brawl and a seduction and people going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the cabinet de toilette.\\"Sounds just like Gatsby.We don't know Dicks' story yet and are left to make a judgement to what it was. The party all include many people, but of all there are three that are very significant. This whole idea that there'e to the novel is very confusing at times. Even though I may have liked the book alot, I think it's not directed to the audience I stand in. Fitzgerald compounded the book with many words that were unfamiliar to my understanding. Which required alot of searching in order to comprehend the novel. There's even some French in this novel. So if you're looking for a challenge and to enrich your vocab this would be a good book. Moving off that subject i need to state thate this novel is written in three different perspectives. Such that it's diveded in three books. It was a first to me, and i kind of liked that style. Moving back to subject, I would not recommend this book to others just because of the time it took to read it. I know it's a great book and all but many of my peers like to stick with t.v. Thereof its not one of my recomendation if you don,t like to read.Overall i give it a four out of five.P.s This book left alot of unanswered questions. Some like Who is the victim Dick or Nicole? Will either Nicole or Dick find happiness? See if you can figure them out."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise captured a human being more completely and honestly than any other book I have ever read. Amory Blaine is the main character, but he can't really be called a &quot;hero&quot; or a &quot;protagonist;&quot; he has all the same petty, self-centered, foolish thoughts at times that all real people have; he has ego problems; he has all the passion of youth and none of the direction of age that is sometimes falsely imparted on young characters by their authors. Do not read this book for a story, because it has none; it is rather a character study, the portrait of an ordinary and extraordinary human being, but it is one so undeniably brilliant and candid, so mind-stoppingly beautiful, that it should be read at all costs and as soon as possible by everyone who has ever looked in the mirror."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Being a 14-year-old, I thought that I would've probably liked this book - the main character being a young man who's really not sure of anything, as myself. But the book dealt a little too much with Amory's helpless egotism and conceitedness, thus lacking good storytelling - the damned thing never even reaches a climax. It even goes into a rather tedious part towards the ending which is almost written in the stream-of-consciousness technique, save that it's written in the form of prose and not in separate lines, as in Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. All in all, the story was somewhat nice, but not as good as I thought it would be - keeping in mind that Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"What is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book -- which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that Fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24. Nope, the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced \\"The Great Gatsby\\" a mere five years later.\\"This Side of Paradise\\" is a mess: it is as uneven, affected, feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero, the tiresomely self-conscious young Minnesotan-gone-to-Princeton Amory Blaine. (One suspects, in fact, that had Fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as Amory's diary the result would have been considerably more readable -- or the book's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable, at least.)That the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 -- it was to prove the most popular book, in terms of sales, ever produced by its author -- presumably speaks to the public's recognition of something new and revealing in it. Okay, Amory Blaine may well have been the original Jazz Age prototype; and the drinking and shameless smooching (etc.) that he and his prep school and Princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably, one can accept, a revelation to see in print (and likely a titillating one) for an American audience raised on McGuffy's Readers -- and ready for some sort of Great Departure after the Great War. Welp, here it comes:\\"On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact with that great current American phenomenon, the \`petting party.'None of the Victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were Victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed.\\"To the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is, of course, very small beer. What was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now, in the best cases of the Paradise narrative, as unalarming quaintness. While this is not exactly Fitzgerald's \\"fault\\", so to speak, it is also true that the use of \\"shocking revelations\\" of this type -- scandals specific to a place and time -- represents a risk a writer takes: the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and/or universal in such episodes. In any event, the price the reader pays here, in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds Amory's adventures in quaintness during the nascent Roaring Twenties, is very, very high for payoffs of such modest proportions. I mean, come on:\\"For years afterward when Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart. The night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it. Eleanor was, say, the last time evil crept close to Amory under the mask of beauty, the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes.\\"Yikes. I don't care what New Generation you're talking about, can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody? (Can it represent ANYTHING to anybody?)There are things to like, even admire, here and there in Paradise. Fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark (e.g., \\"They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered.\\" \\"Sometimes I wish I'd been an Englishman; American life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy.\\" \\"It's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better.\\") And the political incorrectness of some of the narrator's observations is, in its now-curious way, refreshingly, bracingly funny:\\"Slowly and inevitably, yet with a sudden surge at the last, while Amory talked and dreamed [which is about all Amory ever does-MHT], war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where Princeton played. Every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings. When Amory went to Washington the next weekend, he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back, for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-Greeks, he guessed, or Russians.\\"Nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there's a war on, I always say.Anyway, most of the novel consists of young Amory's elaborate ponderings -- romantic, philosophical and egotistical -- which are as forgivable as they are forgettable. I've forgotten them already. At some level, in any case, Fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character -- who was, of course, a not-very-disguised version of himself. For how else, if not as commendably self-deprecating irony, are we to take this observation?\\"Amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant. Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him, and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours.\\"In the end, in any event, one comes back to the initial Fitzgerald vs. Fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder. In Paradise almost nothing works: form, content, narrative stance, dialogue, character development, pacing -- you name it, it's a problem. Yet in Gatsby, five years later, everything works -- everything. If there is to be a Great American Novel, it will have to supplant Gatsby for the honor. While it is hard to see how Fitzgerald got from point A to point B, the fact is that he did -- and without point A the journey could not have begun. So while \\"This Side of Paradise\\" hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon, it surely deserves our respect, and indeed our gratitude, for what it led to."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I realize that some reviewers find Blaine's selfishness and hubris offensive, and I ask, did you finish the book? He spells it out in simple english, though disguised as an afterthought, \\"Yes - I was perhaps an egotist in youth, but I soon found it made me morbid to think too much about myself.\\"This novel is the pronunciation of Amory Blaine's (read Fitzgerald's) emotional growth, sparked by the destruction of all the axioms that he thought he knew. He realizes at the end of the book (and the beginning of his life) that in order to matter, in the Descartes sense of the phrase, you need to make an impact on the lives of others. Blaine uses socialism as Monsignor used religion, to make himself indispensible to those that would listen to him, and so in some respect this novel is a blueprint for a good life lived, as any coming of age story should aspire to be. But above all, this novel is a doctrine of love. As Fitzgerald puts it, \\"yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul, responsibility and a love of life, the faint stirrings of ambitions and unrealized dreams. But oh, Rosalind, Rosalind... It's all a poor substitute at best.\\""},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's first novel, this book is a character description of one Amory Blaine. In terms of plot, there doesn't seem to be one - at least in the traditional sense. A lot of things happen, such as Amory's romantic exploits and induction to Princeton University.The best thing about 'This Side of Paradise' is its beautifully-written prose. The description and narrative are poetic, almost sugary. That is what makes this book worth reading. Also included is insight into the times of turn-of-the-century America and the images summoned at the mention of the Roaring 20s. World War I, speakeasies, flannel suits and ballroom dancing are all events Amory experiences. If you've read the Great Gatsby, this would be a good follow-up book.Note: There are a few typos present in this book. The omission of the word 'gods' on page 287 is by far the worst."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Ahhhh Mr. Fitzgerald. How you woo me with your lyrical prose and bore me with your philosophical shpeel.There were times during This Side of Paradise where I was overcome by what I was reading because it was just that amazing. And then there were times where I glazed over the philosophy with dry eyes and an annoying buzz in my ears. But looking beyond those parts, I have to acknowledge Paradise as Fitz's first novel, and therefore the good parts were made that much better since he had nothing Gatsby-like to live up to. The bits of genius were effortless and beautiful because they were the first of their kind, pure and innocent. Paradise seems like it was easy for Fitz. Fun. I feel like I can tell this is his first novel because it wouldn't be until later that the pressure of being a \\"good writer\\" would hit him. For that reason, I enjoyed this novel tremendously.This Side of Paradise revolves around Amory Blaine. There are many words to describe Amory: self-involved, self-indulgent, self-conscious. Overly dramatic, lost, found, curious, lonely, broken, bruised. Affected. Amory is a character. He's full of life but completely lost. He's a dreamer and an idealist and a realist all at the same time; he is one big hypocritical oxymoron, and he's completely overwhelmingly tragic.We begin Amory's life from whence all his issues started: Beatrice. Beatrice is dear old mother with her delicacy and indulgences, and her personality makes Amory into the person he is because of her eccentricities and failures. We follow Amory through school and his younger years (where he's disliked by his classmates because they don't get him), through his college years (where he's liked by classmates because they don't get him), vaguely through World War I, and always through his women, until we meet Rosalind - the beginning, end, and in-between of everything Amory wanted and could never have.Amory is always looking for himself, and never finding the person he wants. He loses himself in whatever he likes at the time, whether it be school, an idea, a place, or a person. He's never happy and never content for long. He wants to be remembered, but never sticks to anything long enough to be cause for remembrance. He's lost, and I feel sad for him. He never quite finds what he's looking for.The best description of Amory can be found on the twelfth page of the book:\\"It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being.\\""},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I found this a trifle indulgent, not very economically-written. Chunks of it consist of two people sitting down and discoursing philosophy, basically the author putting forth his views directly through his mouthpieces. In one chapter towards the end, Amory Blaine gets into a car with two men - this scene appears to serve no other purpose besides letting him expound on communism to them. Also, this does not have much of a plot, which is something I personally prefer; admittedly, this was a literary experiment and not a linear novel. In general, I'm not saying this is bad; only that it did not interest me much.I would read this, though, for Fitzgerald's depiction of Princeton life - the breakfast clubs, midnight jaunts, arrogant students, the popularity race. Secondly, for his philosophical insights, which made me think (or try to). Then there are Blaine's romances with various girls, which is the liveliest portion of the book and gives us an idea of high society then. Lastly, for Amory Blaine himself - a memorable, striking character of self-absorption and constant self-analysis."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of the best books I've read, period. Fitzgerald's masterful use of the language is stunning. He approaches Shakespeare in technical skill and his ability to express with precisely the right words what his characters are thinking and feeling. The self-exploration of Amory Blaine as he grows from a child to a young man is exquisite. He epitomizes the lost generation that I enjoyed identifying with in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. It is intellectually stimulating but not boring, exciting but not full of action. An excellent work."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. It's inconceivable that his next book was The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald spends way too much time on late night bull sessions, but then skips over Amory's military service in World War I. Did anything happen to Amory while he was there? A great alternative to sleeping aids."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This was a very intertaining book. I love reading it. Just good all around product. I have read it several times."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"When I first picked up &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; I was moved at once to put it back down. A casual thumbing through the pages, though, held out the promise of a surprisingly witty author. (After all, good readers should approach with extreme caution that pantheon of flatulent phonies extolled by schoolmarms!) But, the &quot;Bored of Education,&quot; aside, I allowed my interest to master my natural prejudice and read a few more lines. &quot;Hm. Actually intelligent,&quot; I thought. &quot;Sardonic!&quot; Indeed! With overtones of Mencken's Nietzschean irony and Oscar Wilde's talent for pithy phrase-making, the young Fitzgerald produced a remarkable novel, by anyone's standards. One of the ten best of the 20th century, in my opinion--right up there with &quot;Lolita,&quot; &quot;Steppenwolf,&quot; and &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;! . . . . Certainly, readers of limited vocabularies (or else readers with ample vocabularies, but no playfulness) should not attempt this book. Its free-flowing structure is reminiscent of that used by Melville in &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; which itself drew heavy criticism by people who wanted craftsman when they had before them Artists! So, for anyone to see in such virtuosical creativity the &quot;follies of Youth&quot; just because it refuses to conform to the old, boring and hackneyed formula of a linear novel, betrays a lack of understanding on the part of the blathering critic. &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; is a great book--not because we were told it is; but (by some accident, some mistake, some blessing!) it really and truly is!"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"If you can only read one F. Scott Fiztgerald book, read The Great Gatsby. If you can only read two, read Tender is the Night as well. But if you are interested to view the development of Fitzgerald's prose and themes, read his first opus, This Side of Paradise. The book chronicals the rather indifferent life of Armory Blaine, a wealthy young man who drifts from boarding school, to Princeton, to World War I, to adult life characterized by emptiness and uncertainty. Thousands of young flappers embraced the novel, and through it Fiztgerald became the spokesman for the \\"lost generation.\\"The prose is occasionally brilliant, but the novel rambles and frequently becomes as lost as the generation it depicts. This is somewhat a novel about nothing, and the shallowness and listlessness of Armory becomes annoying and rather pathetic. The book is hard to finish, and is ultimately unsatisfying. For Fitzgerald buffs This Side of Paradise completes the rather limited Fitzgerald cannon, but the only people who are likely to truly enjoy this book are first year Princeton students with nothing better to do than compare themselves to the young Armory Blaine."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Many people consider The great Gatsby to be Fitzgerald's greatest work. In doing this they are shortchanging him from all his other novels, and his short stories (which are also gems of craftsmanship). This side of paradise is a work that I consider equal to the Catcher of the Rye by Salinger. It evokes a setting and a time, captured beautifully, that has been past and never to come again. However, we of the 2000s can still relate to the protagonist because what he goes through in college: the inadequacies, the romance, the questions, is something that we all feel, are torn by, and befuddled with. The work makes you laugh at it's antics mainly because we can place ourselves in those setting and making the same mistakes. The prose is so beautiful because Fitzgerald was a careful craftsman and left nothing to chance. This is a coming=of=age story every young person need to read, and every young-at-heart person, for that matter. So sit back with this book, and be ready to be taken to an era that will never be again, but will always live on in Amory Blaine (the protagonist) and everyone who has a little Amory in them."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's first novel, full of autobiographical undertones, has already the mark of the Lost Generation: a US that is frivolous, nouveau riche, at the same time innocent and perverse. Amory Blaine is the scion of a young American fortune. He's handsome, well read, and spoiled by his eccentric, alcoholic, and overpossessive mother, Beatrice, who gives him a bookish education while at the same time she carries him around the US, where he mixes with all kinds of people. During a stage of drinking problems, Beatrice sends his son to live with some relatives in Minneapolis, where Amory begins his flirting career with rich brats. Then comes life in Princeton, his first real love, his passive service in WWI, his first job in advertising, and a maturing process expressed as the full acceptance of egocentrism, which simultaneously adopts and kills his former religious and altruistic spirit. Religion becomes not so much conviction and mysticism, but a mere reference and moral containment. Similarly, Beauty stops meaning the appreciation of a transcendental experience, to be left only as an aesthetic perception of Pleasure. Amory Blaine becomes a kind of disenchanted Oscar Wilde, less caustic and more introspective. The game of playing to be Dorian Gray finishes in front of the difficulties of life, and what remains is not the criminal being, but the eternal dilettante. The apparent frivolity and emptiness of Amory's story is more than redeemed by the the poetic quality of the prose. Behind the merry life of a rich kid, the XX century is full fledged already: \\"a new generation grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken\\".Although not yet in league with successive works, especially \\"The Great Gatsby\\", this book gives a good appreciation of how Fitzgerald would develop as a writer."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is typical Fitzgerald. You either like him or you don't. It is a study in character, or, perhaps I should say lack of character. Amory Blaine is not very sympathetic. But, then many of us aren't when we are college aged and know everything. His girl friends are frivolous. His relationship with the old priest was interesting and more could be drawn from the priest's love for Amory. His mother is a dolt and hypochondriac. Depressing, but well written."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald has once again perfectly captured an entire generation in this book, yet did so in such a way that people can still relate today. Everyone can relate to Amory Blaine's plight of finding who you are amidst a generation that is lost and determined to do nothing substantial. Furthermore, Amory's incessant dissatisfaction with himself is something else we all can relate to. The reader is told that with Amory, &quot;it was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being.&quot; Amory always wanted to do things but never took the time to appreciate what he was. This Side of Paradise is a must read for anyone who wants to explore their own life, and how they are living it."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I consider myself a pretty well-read person, and I'm always willing to give a book a chance. But try though I may, I could not finish this mess. It was like trying to plow through concrete.It is Fitzgerald's first attempt at literature and it shows. The book sounds like a lot of notes the author jotted down and then put together in a hurry, without bothering to go through it more carefully before submitting it for publishing. Amory Blaine is a vapid, self-centered, insecure, silly young man who seems incapable of sticking to one subject or idea for too long. He considers himself superior to others (no, don't ask me why), but at the same time envies his friends and craves their approval. He is a political dilettante, who babbles a lot of nonsense that sound like a pastiche of ideas snatched hurriedly and superficially from conversations with his friend Burne (very much like the format of this book). In short, Amory is not a likeable or even intriguing character. I don't care a straw for political correctness, but yes, this young man is racist, xenophobic and discriminating. I found him obnoxious, tiresome, and finally exasperating. If Paradise - the reward for a righteous life, we're told - is as boring as this side that Fitzgerald shows us, you might as well indulge in wickedness and get your fun while you can.This novel is just further proof that even the most exalted authors in literature are human, therefore, fallible, which is why nobody should expect ALL their work to be perfect. Praising this book just because it was \\"written by Francis Scott Fitzgerald\\" is as pretentious and fatuous as going into raptures over a boring musical piece just because it falls under the category of \\"classical.\\" I'm going to pick up The Great Gatsby again and remind myself why Fitzgerald made it to the hallowed grounds of American Literature.I read it somewhere that this novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920. Really? Well, no wonder they called it The Lost Generation."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This is a complex coming of age tale about a young man that doesn't really come of age. The young protagonist, Amory Blaine, struggles to find and accept the real person he is as his \\"fundamental self\\" and his \\"conformist self\\" clash throughout. Amory has a few personality traits (an unreasonable sense of entitlement --possibly from overpampering-- and general lack of self-confidence masked by glibness) that also hinder him from attempting to find out who he is. I found him to be a very frustrating, yet real character that seems completely relatable. Amory has alot on his plate by society's views. He knows he's supposed to do what's necessary to achieve the American Dream, and even though he has been given all the comforts (good money, good schools) and advantages to better achieve that dream, it's not enough. He is confused by why these opportunities aren't just falling into his lap, since by society's views he's doing everything right. He goes through the motions, but finds nothing inspiring. He is constantly sizing himself up to his peers and is jealous that they seem to have something to stand for and he can't seem to feel anything but ambivalence for all situations he's in. His character is so young and naive that you can't help but feel sorry for him. He spends the whole book putting on airs when inside he's a confused and scared kid. While he is a wise-mouth, he is not a wise person. Even the end of the novel is as unsure as he is. I thought it was really humanizing and almost reassuring to see a character out there that is so flawed and realistic."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"If your considering buying this book you probably already love Fitzgerald's style. You won't be disappointed by this offering then. The images are brilliant and stick with you for some time afterwards. It has echoes of Gatsby's deep meditations on American culture and the criticisms of modern society are still relevant today. The novel's depiction of the loss of youthful innocence is spot on. Fitzgerald describes a new generation \\"grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths shaken...\\" a sentiment that is as true in 2011 as in 1911. That said, there are some rough patches. Fitzgerald includes some unfortunate poems and some rather dry political discussion. I suggest you skim these passages. You'll still get the full effect of an excellent writer with a so-so editor."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's first novel is a profound and insightful coming of age story that reads like my deepest thoughts. Amory Blaine, who was raised by an eccentric mother and a sensible aunt, attends boarding school and eventually enters Princeton in 1913. He goes to the war for a bit and returns to a fairly aimless life in NYC.Amory is an eccentric and utterly self-obsessed and egotistic. He is clever in almost all ways and knows that he is in some ways a genius - but the type that has no channel for his potential. Amory is at times brutally honest with himself and painfully self-aware. He knows he is vain and knows that - like a superman - he id detached from morality. He wonders if he is a \\"good man\\" and admits he is not. He wonders if any \\"great man\\" can be \\"good.\\" He also lacks self-awareness at times - or at least the discipline or motivation to change his self-defeating attitude. The book ends with Amory's iconic lament \\"I know myself, but that is all-\\"He sees things too clearly to ignore the baseness of life, and just short of clear enough to know how to live and how to be happy. He is for one day or one week or one month overwhelmed by the beauty and possibility of life and by the way in which 2 people can connect with each other. He knows that he is special for fully appreciating these times. . . . Then, he is struck by the way in which \\"life\\" and \\"society\\" distanace and disconnect individuals from this beauty and from their ability to feel this beauty. The young Amory Blaine is in touch with and cultivates his ability to feel the grandeur of life; his life at Princeton allows him free time and few worries. As Amory ages, he cannot figure out how to live in the real world - with all of its boringness and convention, and his own desire to impress others (the latter of which also features big at Princeton). Amory flip-flops between a conviction that he must stay true to his youthful state of mind and a conviction that he must recognize the inescapability of responsibility and the limitations of society. He searches endlessly for a book which offers the answer. The irony is that Amory's magnificent mind and heart which see so clearly the beauty of life also see the tragedy that society as a whole operates outside this fold. Knowing that society is so flawed, Ammory doesn't know how to participate in it and he fears he will lose himself if he does. Amory's gift is his downfall.Things that had been the merest commonplaces of his life then, deep sleep, the sense of beauty all around him, all desire, had flown away and the gaps they left were filled only with the great listlessness of his disillusion.\\" Amory Blaine looking back on the way he was in boarding school and in univ. From F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1st novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"On a completely different note, the life of young privileged men in early 20th century society is interesting. Princeton is a \\"right\\" of these men. There is such a sense of entitlement and empowerment, as well as a separation from the constricts of responsibility. Princeton boys do what they want. They have crazy outings to NYC and Boston. They miss class and don't blink an eye. In fact, class matters little although reading, cleverness, and talents matter a lot. There are a dozen clubs and even more posts to which students belong and prestige is everything. Fitzgerald's depiction of a whirlwind of exhilaration, alienation, eagerness for the future and a sense that it should all be more meaningful is still all too recognizable to those of us who are just a few years out of college.I wish a bit more was said about Amory's time in WWI and it also seems odd that he doesn't hugely react to it although it must affect him. The repetition of Amory's thoughts is sometimes a bit annoyin but accurate to the character. The story also lags a bit at the end and I wasn't convinced that Amory had come closer to his \\"answer,\\" as so many times before he had epiphanies and then abandoned them.Finally, the prose is at times so gorgeous - so melodic - that I've consciously slowed down my reading speed to fully appreciate the beauty of Fitzgerald's song. Fitzgerals is also an amazing poet - \\"Amory\\" and his friends pen many beautiful pieces. I would absolutely read this book again - perhaps even slower. There is so much insight and philosophy to chew on, and so much beauty in the prose, that one could never tire of this superb novel. The writing is, admittingly, a hodge podge of different styles (80 pages of it taken from an earlier scrapped novel, other bits from poems and short stories) but I like that."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise is the classic novel depicting the confusion and unfocused energy which accompanies young adulthood. It is the paradigm on which all other stories of its kind are based. Fitzgerald brilliantly describes the misdirection of the young Armory Blaine with brilliant prose and unbelievable vocabulary. In trying to make sense of the confusing and unguided transition to adulthood, rather than looking at the world around him, Blaine obsessively looks inward at himself for answers. Attempting to unravel the mysteries of the uncertainty and alienation which come with adult freedom, Blaine floats along on a journey of self-discovery, anguish, and eventual redemption. A must for any Fitzgerald fan, any connoisseur of the American novel, or any one who has ever asked themself the ever demanding question: &quot;What am I going to do with my life.&quot"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Many may argue that the title of this review is nonsensical-I agree. It was a ruse. I found this book to be, most simply, erudite. This is a wonderful case where the book is merely a vehicle of message. I was not particularly attached to any of the characters and I was not meant to be attached. No character is ever truly developed and they, in effect, act as mirrors of the personality of Amory Blaine. Its just him from different directions. Even with them surrounding him-hes still not quite lovable as a character(However, I thought the concept of Amory was great).Noting this, I found the book insightful. Fitzgerald certainly had alot to say about the generation in question. He emphasized their feelings of disenchantment and emphasized this by the seemingly stale characters of the novel. He may have coined one of the best phrases that I have seen in such a novel-&quot;I know myself, but that is all I know&quot;. Its a line I'll have to remember. Its a good read, sophisticated, and worth it for it's ambitions."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald is considered to be an important early 20th century American writer. I bought and read Fitzgerald's five major novels (the present, \\"The Beautiful and the Damned, The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and The Last Tycoon\\") plus one book of short stories plus the biography \\"Some Sort of Epic Grandeur\\" by Matthew Bruccoli.Fitzgerald wrote about half a dozen novels and over 100 short stories - the short stories were done largely to make money to support his life style - plus he worked on a number of Hollywood film scripts. He died poor in Hollywood in 1940, leaving an insurance policy as his main asset.There is a tremendous variation in his writing. The first two novels have good prose, and the present book is better than his second novel \\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\\" This present book is probably his best work, but with so much variation in his work, you can also make a case for \\"Tender is the Night\\" as being the best.The book is the story of a young wealthy student, Amory Blaine. The book is divided into two parts: \\"The Romantic Egotist\\" and \\"The Education of a Personage.\\" Blaine attends Princeton in Part I. The second parts of the novel covers his experiences after university. Many thought that the book scandalized the life of a Princeton student, and it was controversial and popular in its day. Fitzgerald cites many other authors in the book and it descibes the culture of the times in New York and Princeton. The novel - with the beautiful prose, the interesting story, and the references to the 1910-20s culture - propelled Fitzgerald to instant fame.The following is an example of the prose in Part I, Chapter 2, and it speaks for itself. The setting is Princeton University.\\"Amory decided to sit for a while on the front steps, so he bade them good night.The great tapestries of trees had darkened to ghosts back at the last edge of twilight. The early moon had drenched the arches with pale blue, and, weaving over the night, in and out of the gossamer rifts of moon, swept a song, a song with more than a hint of sadness, infinitely transient, infinitely regretful. He remembered that an alumnus of the nineties had told him of one of Booth Tarkington's amusements: standing in mid-campus in the small hours and singing tenor songs to the stars, arousing mingled emotions in the couched undergraduates according to the sentiment of their moods.Now, far down the shadowy line of University Place a white-clad phalanx broke the gloom, and marching figures, white-shirted, white-trousered, swung rhythmically up the street, with linked arms and heads thrown back:Going back going back,Goingback to Nas-sau Hall,Going back going backTo the Best Old Place of All.Going back going back,From all this earth-lyball,We'll clear the track as we go backGoing back to Nas-sau Hall!\\"Here we have excellent writing, beautiful prose, and an example of a great American novel. It is the type of novel where the reader stops to admire and re-read some of the prose."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I am quite accustomed to reading \\"the classics\\"...Tolstoy, Dumas, Rinehart etc but this book bored me to tears...about the only time I found myself interested in it was near the very end, when it all comes together, and talks about the main characters philosphies...it was agony reading it through to the very end, but I forced myself thinking all along, surely this drivel has got to change at some time...and in the last 5% of it it did...I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise is a truly classic work. Be warned though, having read The Great Gatsby as well, these are different books. Not better or worse, just different. As a member of the incoming Freshman class at Princeton, I read the book before starting. I will easily admit to not liking the first half of the book. However, the 2nd half is an, albeit depressing (until the last few pages), wonderfully written work about the lost soul of the youth (grr. . .I'm 18 and using the word youth) of the 1920s. The last 10 pages are offer an unparalleled view into the soul of a truly remarkable character. I didn't personally like Amory (for a variety of reasons), ie, I wouldn't want him to be my best friend, but he was an amazing character study (pardon the term). Learning about him through Fitzgerald was a fabulous experience. This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Man, this was good. It has aged well since it was written in 1919 and published the next year. The story is pretty much the life of Amory, the main character who is clearly based on Fitzgerald himself. The story is, for the most part, Fitzgerald's life. All of his happiness and sorrow, mostly sorrow, was poured into this novel. This is definitely one of the books you must read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Mention the roaring twenties in literature and one name comes to mind!F. Scott Fitzgerald the Midwest Roman Catholic middle class lad who went to Princeton; served in the World War I US Army and married Zelda Sayre the lovely but confused southern belle from Alabama. Fitzgerald is known for his great short stories and classic novels such as \\"The Great Gatsby,\\"; \\"Tender is the Night\\": \\"The Beautiful and Damnned\\" and \\"The Last Tycoon.\\"This Side of Paradise is his first novel published in 1920. He began writing it while in army training camp in Fort Leavenworth Kansas in 1917. It is a \\"bildungsroman\\" meaning a novel of character development and maturation of the hero. Amory Blaine is the spoiled hero. He is a scion of the upper class with an eccentric mother named Beatrice. His family is wealthy allowing him to board at a prestigious Catholic prep school and attend Princeton. Blaine is a terrible student who drops out of school to serve in the military. He does not go overseas. After the war he finds employment in an ad agency while beginning his writing career. Blaine falls in and out of love with several women but at novel's end is still seeking a mate. He is disillusioned by the war and failed romances. TSOP is one of the first literary productions by a young author who was part of what Gertrude Stein labelled as \\"The Lost Generation.\\"The women with whom he becomes infatuated include the flapper Isabella, the spoiled mankiller Rosalind, the suicidal inclining Eleanor Savage and back in Philadelphia a young widow named Clara. All of these women are interesting, beautifully seductive and will fascinate the reader. The two major loves are Rosalind the vamp and Eleanor who loves poetry, men, sex, youth and for a brief summer Mr. Amory Blaine.We also meet several of his college chums and Father Darcy a Roman Catholic priest who mentors young Blaine. We see Princeton in the early years of the twentieth century. It is obvious that Fitzgerald loved Princeton as he describes it in beautifully poetic and evocative language.This autobiographical novel takes its title from a Rupert Brooke poem. It is episodic and contains much poetry and analysis of literary classics being read by Amory Blaine and his chums. It is one of the best serious college novels ever authored by an American. Blaine, like Fitzgerald, is shown as a heavy drinker who wrestled with alcoholism.The novel became a bestseller with the flaming youth of the age of flappers. Money earned from it allowed Fitzgerald to leave his advertising agency job and marry the fetching Zelda. He then devoted himself to life as a professional author of novels, short stories and screenplay work in Hollywood.This is a flawed but always well worth reading classic by one of America's greatest twentieth century authors. Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"This Side of Paradise, F. Scott Fitzgerald's semi-autobiographical coming of age novel, celebrates the intensely felt victories and defeats of a privileged young man. The son of rich wastrels, Amory Blaine is convinced of his physical and intellectual superiority from a young age. He attends prep school in Connecticut, where he meets others of his class and learns how to impress them. He then moves on to Princeton, and here Fitzgerald shares with the reader a lengthy appreciation of what the school offers: tradition, a challenge, and the company of other talented young men from the ruling class. The story takes a brief hiatus when Blaine goes to war, which characteristically he interprets in terms of how it affects him. On returning home, he has a painful love affair that helps mature him.Blaine is not a very sympathetic protagonist - he is selfish and unkind - but to his credit he doesn't pretend to be anything other than what he is. Also to his credit, he is sensitive to beauty everywhere, and he can see merit in others. Through his eyes, we meet a number of friends and lovers, and there are some remarkable characters among them.Fitzgerald is a wonderful writer, and in this, his first novel, he seems at pains to prove it by extensively using poetry, letters between his characters, and the dramatic form to help tell his story. He does indeed seem very comfortable in all of these forms. Fitzgerald went on to write great books, and this one shows the impressive skills he had even as a young man of 24."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Written when F. Scott was a mere 23 years of age, This Side of Paradise elevates itself as a seminal and ground-breaking semi-autobiographical novel that inexplicably remains vastly underappreciated as of today. Amory Blaine manifests himself as a veritable study of egotism, romanticism, idealism, and intense disillusionment. Amory proves to be an endearing and highly affable young protagonist. The prep school and Princeton years of supercilious and pretentious egotist hedonism abound immensely in energy, innocence, and vitality.Through the despair of his failed love with Rosalind et al, his disenchantment with his advertsing job, and the inseparable gloom and despair of WWI, Amory enters into a reproachful state of disillusionment and cynicism subsequent to \\"The Great War\\". Fitzgerald, the acclaimed golden boy of his aptly named Jazz Age, emodies in Amory \\"a new generation grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.\\"Amory undergoes a catharsis of sorts in purging his tragic loss of innocence due to the war with his heavy drinking and nihilistic behavior. Nonetheless, he regains a semblance of his former confidence and intensity at the conclusion of the book, \\"yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul.\\" Is Amory the same romantic egotist that we witnessed at the onset of this powerful work? Not by any stretch of the imagination. However, through his despondent adversity, his intellectualism survives as well as his somewhat frayed, yet repaired sense of hopeful idealisism for the future - whatever it may bring. A strikingly similar ending to Hemingway's later masterpiece The Sun Also Rises, n'est-ce pas?"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Fitzgerald is best known for The Great Gastby, his later work, but the earlier This Side of Paradise is nearly writing perfection(it is not hard at all to see how this novel catapulted Fitzgerald into superstardom). Amory Blaine is incredibly believable. Pompous, concieted, talented and sensitive, Fitzgerald's semi-autobiographical novel is intelligently written, not condesending like so many later writers tend to act. The unique way the novel is structured only adds to its feel of reality. Word to the wise: if a this-week bestseller is your idea of a good read, stay away from this insightful and clever story of a young man's coming of age in the dramatically quickly changing 1920s."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I really enjoyed this book. At first I was wondering how I could ever relate to a book like this considering it was written many years ago, but as I was reading I realized the relations to myself and the character. In this book the character Armory Blaine is basically finding himself. Although, he does not realize it through most of the book he spends much time in self wonder and development. Everyone goes through a period of this time in their life and I thought it was really cool to see a perspective of someone living in the 1920s way of self development. Many of his ideas and thoughts can still be related to situations today. Many people have issues with convention, love, and money. In Blaine's case they all came together and he fell down in a hole. He lost his money which lost his one love. Then he realizes his extreme amount of selfishness that we see through the entire book. Many times in the book Armory says how good looking he is, how good he is at sports, etc. Then finally at the end of the book he realizes that none of that really matters, he has to find the meaning of life. He says' I know myself, '...'but that is all,' pretty much sums up the theme of the entire book that knowing yourself is the most important thing in life. Material things and good looks don't really matter; you just have to be the best person you can be. He also shows that through all his mistakes in life, he has come out with the greatest knowledge of all by learning from those mistakes."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"...Not Armory. Just wanted to clarify that, although I agree with many of the points raised by other reviewers.This is the first work of Fitzgerald's that I've ever read, and now I realize that I will have to read another (perhaps Gatsby) to give him a chance to redeem himself in my mind.Amory Blaine is possibly the least appealing protagonist I've ever encountered in fiction. He is self-centered, spoiled, snobbish and priggish, and not in an amusing way. Worse that this, as the book progresses, Amory gets progressively more misogynistic and racist. He \\"discovers\\" that beautiful women are evil incarnate, is disgusted by having to share a train car with \\"stinking\\" foreigners, and wishes that America were comprised of \\"a homogeneous race\\". Because I was determined to finish the book, I tried to excuse some of these appalling views on the grounds that this novel was written some 85 years ago, and cannot be judged the same way as modern novels. But it's funny, isn't it, that authors like Twain held such enlightened views decades before Fitzgerald was born?So why do we consider Fitzgerald one of the masters of American lit? THis Side of Paradise gave me no clues. Apart from being morally and politically repulsive, it was mind-numbingly boring, completely lacking in dramatic tension. I am going to have to read another of Fitzgerald's books, just to see if I can comprehend the reasons for his fame. But first I'll read a different author, to rid the bad taste from my mouth."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"The delivery was very prompt and the book was in the same condition as described...I am very satisfied with my purchase as well as the delivery"},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Upon concluding my reading of this piece, I came to the realization that F. scott is quite a good writer. Still His style isnt quite to my suiting, but I thought The Great Gatsby was a good book too, only that it ended a little off key, like something wasnt quite right. The same goes for This Side of Paradise. Just seemed like something was missing. The whole book Amory the main character seems to be out to &quot;find himself&quot;. Amory is a young fella attempting to move up in the world. But the structure of the book poses some problems for me as a reader because it has no real structure, very undirected. But even so, I do think it is well written as much as it bugs me that i have trouble following it. After all, cant you think something is beautiful even if you dont like it? Cant you think that a song is well written even if it doesnt appeal to your taste? Well thats how i feel about this book.

Scott Fitzgerald's first novel (published when he was twenty-three) is so glitteringly brilliant you might--I say MIGHT--just like it more than THE GREAT GATSBY. By the Gatsby masterpiece Fitzgerald was cutting back deliberately on his flourishing prose--read THIS SIDE OF PARADISE to see him let it all hang out.Fitzgerald's protagonist Amory Blaine inherits from his mother exquisite manners, a European sensibility, and a dangerous superiority complex. It is to Amory's credit then, that throughout his prep school and Princeton years he regains the respect his attitude loses for him through talent and hard work. His stunning good looks (a point repeatedly established) position Amory well to lose his innocence as a variety of beautiful girls fall for him throughout his adolescence. Looking back nostalgically later on, Amory is honest enough with himself to realize that he doesn't really want to \\"repeat\\" his innocence, but merely \\"want[s] the pleasure of losing it again.\\"When I first read this book almost four years ago I shook my head after a few pages and said, \\"there's no accounting for genius.\\" Much later I read E. M. Forster's ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL where he points out what I said as characteristic of the \\"pseudo-scholar.\\" Yikes! The truth is that there is accounting for Fitzgerald's genius: it lies in his depth of insight, sharpness of wit and overall \\"will to bigness,\\" as his narrator puts it for Amory. GATSBY is certainly the book that crowned Fitzgerald an immortal, but THIS SIDE OF PARADISE is a must-read for those who want to know what first made him a star."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I love this book so much, it kills me. I love Amory Blaine, with all his flaws and imperfections, that it seems I'll never find a man in the world, because this creation, of this man, was somehow a fiat from God. Usually after reading something that means very much to me, I get this strange sad feeling - After reading some of Hemingway, I thought he was such an adorable man, and wished he were alive... talk to him, anything, to appropriate some of that passion and that gift and that wonder for myself. I get the same feeling with T.S. Eliot... But Amory Blaine? Shoot! Can you fall in love with a literary character?With Fitzgerald, it seems you can. I'd rather sleep with who he creates than he himself. This was the first Fitzgerald I've ever read - then I read all the rest of his novels. Several times each. Because I want to be a writer, and am somewhat of a writer I guess, I can't say this is my favorite Fitzgerald novel AS A WRITER. But as a PERSON, a young person, perhaps it is. Or it's very close.This Side of Paradise is beautiful, ugly, brave, cowardly, immaculate, flawed. It's paradise lost and paradise regained and paradise in purgatory. It's everything life and man should or shouldn't be, all at once. I can perfectly understand why someone wouldn't like this novel, wouldn't understand, wouldn't appreciate. But I also understand that if all the world were Amory-ish or Amory-leaning, Amory-sympathetic, Amory-lovers, or even Amory-haters - somehow the world would just collapse and be ruined. And I think this is also a bit of what Fitzgerald was trying to impart, so it is as it should be."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I'm afraid I fail to understand what's so great about this book. I picked it up because I liked 'The Great Gatsby'. This book, however, was disappointing, to say the least. First of all the main character. A narcist, and not very likeable. He's allright in the beginning but as the novel progresses becomes rather insufferable. However, that was not the main problem, since I could relate to him a bit. The problem starts when he enters Princeton. Who cares about some silly college boys who think they're all destined to become philosophers and think the rest of the world is filled with idiots? It wasn't even real philosophy, it was quasi-that, quasi-[hot air]. Someone should have gotten their heads out of the clouds. They were boring. Also, the love-affairs were rather superficial, since Amory only loves those in whom he sees a mirror of himself. In the end he is as tiresome as he was in Princeton, though a little wiser. What a great coming-of-age book! Fitzgeralds prose is nice, but not nearly as beautiful as in 'The Great Gatsby'. Hardly a recommendable book.P.S. The Catholic intellectual was an old bore."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"I suppose it's supposed to be intentional that no character in this book is very well-drawn. I suppose it's supposed to be intentional that not even Armory is very interesting. I suppose it's supposed to be intentional that you can't remember a single thing about a chapter two chapters later.But is it intentional that this book is supposed to be so dull?Armory goes through life, makes friends, gets girlfriends, breaks up with girlfriends. But you don't remember any of them because they are all reflections of Armory himself. Yet he's dull. So a reflection of a rock is not much to take home. It would be nice if just ONE character held your interest. If just ONE episode was expanded so we got to know these people a little more, but the main character is off doing other things instead.Autobiographical novels are fairly popular, however when the author has no insights into his own life, they are very useless in the long run."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"Frankly, the most self-indulgent piece of tripe I've ever been forced to read. It was a summer reading assignment, and one of two terrible books I brought on a visit to my grandmother's. I nearly went mad.Amory is clearly a vehicle for Fitzgerald to catalog, and perhaps justify, his wasted youth. Scenes are strung together with no other merit than that they occured. Amory spends his life beholden to, and hating women, from his wealthy but distant mother to the women whose sexual approval he craves. His only goal is to attend Princeton University (hailing from the area, I was greatly offended), and once there, become popular and do no work whatsoever.Well, he does eventually get into the University (how low you have fallen in my eyes, dear Princeton...) and quickly gets himself into a sort of fraternity- a houseful of young men who are all far more interesting than Amory himself. Naturally, they have little impact on the story. He attempts to become popular, but instead falls into disfavor, and holes himself up in the dorm with a friend to smoke, drink, read and write ridiculous poetry, and philosophize about things they know nothing about. For instance, they assume that the indigent must be stupid, as they never consider any of the same lofty subjects. (The truth is that they could not then, and cannot now, afford to attend.) Amory criticizes everyone from women to foreigners to the most famous of thinkers. When he at last finds the love of a semi-decent woman, whom he latches onto as a means to redefine himself and create a new life around, he appears to redeem himself somewhat. His deceased mother has squandered the family fortune, leaving him destitute, but Amory swears that poverty matters not- they may live together like churchmice and be happy!All I'll say is that the book ends with him wandering the rainy streets of Princeton, drunk, stunned, and alone.I have never hated a character so much as I hate Amory Blaine. He is selfish, self-loathing, egotistical, insecure, mysogynistic, arrogant and pretentious. He typifies the absolute worst of the indulgent \\"roaring twenties\\" and if he were a modern teenager, he would have a bigoted blog ranting about how terrible and dull his day was. And how terrible his mother is, of course.In fact, if Fitzgerald were writing about him in the present day, he would no doubt include excerpts from IM conversations, Amory's blog, and netspeak. Instead, he switches tenses, voices, and even trips out to script-format for the extent of Amory's affair with one woman. (I actually had some fun with that, reading it outloud to my mother and my aunt. Pictures the most banal \\"John!\\" \\"Marcia!\\" \\"Oh, John!\\" \\"Oh, Marcia!\\" scene possible. Amory and his lady love are worse. \\"But I love you!\\" \\"What is love?\\" \\"Don't touch me!-- Oh, Amory, hold me!\\")If you can avoid it, do NOT choose This Side of Paradise, unless you're able to throw it away when it gets too much for you."},{"Title":"This Side of Paradise","review":"... which is already lacking...I have read a huge amount of books in my life and I have never read anything more boring than this book.

I bought a couple of his train books years ago, in particularSignatures in Steelwhich is all about freight railroading in Canada. To my mind he is one of the few professional photographers who can't take a bad shot and Wheat Kings is full of beautifully compositions. It's his knack of framing the center of interest in such a way that you get pulled into photo and the really neat thing is its not obvious. No need for crazy angles, saturated color or other gimmicks because he captures scenes that are fascinating within themselves.On page forty-nine there's a shot of some shovels, a brush some mini posters pinned to a wooden wall, dusty floorboards, wooden upright posts and rich deep shadows. It couldn't be simpler yet I love that shot, it just works. The book is full of this kind of visual creativity. Most of the photos are exterior ones with the extraordinary angular elevators standing, rather incongruously, in the open prairie and Mcdonnell says in the text that many of those shown throughout the book have been pulled down in favor of efficient, huge concrete units.The interesting text, photos, layout all come together to make this a lovely tribute to the disappearing Canadian prairie scene and Greg McDonnell's photos couldn't be better.***SEE SOME INSIDE PAGES by clicking 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Listening In: A Multicultural Reading of the Psalms","review":"iT IS NOT BY ACCIDENT THAT THE MASS ALWAYS INCLUDES A RESPONSORIAL PSALM.

Her abusive husband has been put to death according to pack law after he was found guilty of three murders, and an attempted fourth murder. She leaves Canada and travels to the sophisticated city of Fargo, ND, to try to make a new start. But things are not peaceful in Fargo - humans have begun killing werewolves and no one knows who is instigating this pogrom. They do know, however, that a werewolf is working with the humans to give them information on who and where the werewolves are. Adam Knight, of the FBI Werewolf Affairs department, has been sent to solve the mystery. When Trudy first arrives in her new home, looking for the werewolf couple with whom she'd arranged to stay, Adam is suspicious of her motives, but is also totally blown away by his instant attraction to her.I have read all of the Lunewulf series and, as a whole, I have enjoyed them. Ms. O'Clare knows how to plot a tight story as well as write riveting love scenes. What has frustrated me about these books is the way her werewolf males tend to be overly protective and controlling of the females. In 'In Her Soul,' Trudy has just escaped from a marriage to a controlling, abusive spouse, and seeks only to test her ability to live independently. However, when she arrives in Fargo, Adam immediately takes control of her life, and forces her to ask his permission to go where she wants to go and do what she wants to do. ...The sexual scenario in this story is extremely hot and a bit edgy. The Lunewulf pack was forced by their former Alpha (Grandmother Rousseau) to participate in group marriages of 1 woman and 3 men to diversify the gene pool of their insular group. Now that she is dead, and Johann Rousseau is pack Alpha, that Pack Law is no longer in existence. Some of the pack members continue to prefer multi-partner marriages. In Her Soul further explores multiple partner sex and its possibilities. Those who are sensitive to differing sexual practices should be aware that this book contains many explicit, hot sex scenes including voyeurism, male domination/female submission, female/female sexual encounters, and group sex involving two couples. I did enjoy this book. Ms. O'Clare certainly has a creative imagination, and I look forward to seeing where it leads in future books in this series. -- Jean, Fallen Angel Reviews (courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews)"},{"Title":"Ellora's Cave Presents Lunewulf: In Her Soul, Book 5","review":"Just wanted to say I loved this series.

Lisa Brenneis has done a great job in this version as she has done in others. This text has been a lifesaver for me many times. I could not imagine trying to work in FCP without it. For those who have upgraded from a previous version of FCP I recommend you also update to the current version of Lisa's book I have found that the quickest way to get my head around the many changes FCP has gone through is to read the upgraded text.

(quite a few procedures require a bit of trial-and-error) I have also found it difficult to look in the index for certain topics and been able to find what I was looking for easily.

It was too complicated, but my thought was to start with Chapter 9 and then go back and put together what I might need to know. I found this book to be a disaster.

One can grasp more about the strange thought patterns of the Nazi elite, for example, by reading a small book called THE NAZIS AND THE OCCULT than by tackling the big, fat, broadside history book. One of my favorite books about the medieval mind is Jeffrey Burton Russell's LUCIFER: THE DEVIL IN THE MIDDLE AGES. Now Naomi Kline has given us an elegantly produced, beautifully illustrated, classically well-written guide to medieval culture by focusing on a deerskin vellum map housed in Hereford Cathedral, demonstrating yet again the value of the oblique approach to illuminating the spirit of an age.Kline's work will be definitive for generations of scholars, but it should bring more than equal joy to all who are interested in intellectual and cultural history and who delight in watching the conjuror/scholar produce a series of dazzling effects. The author looks at the Hereford MAPPA MUNDI, with its rich and teeming images, as a storehouse of knowledge, legend, and symbolic approaches to medieval understanding of the cosmos. These images (lavishly and unforgetably reproduced, and supplemented by hundreds from rare sources) include strange and monstrous races of men, animals from the traditional bestiaries dear to the ancient and medieval world, references to the cult of Alexander the Great, and an array of biblical and theological images and symbolism. All are described with lively insight and intelligence by an author who combines dogged scholarship with subliminal humor and zest.Kline's very significant overarching theme is the value of the map as mnemonic device in a tradition-based culture where literacy was very rare. It served as a publicly accessible synopsis of many complex and familiar themes and legends that were important and significant to medieval society as a whole.Kline has also created a companion CD ROM with a stylish narration and great imagery that should be a marvellous classroom aid for teachers at all levels. Like all medieval cultural artifacts, the Mappa Mundi abounds in material that will appeal to all ages.MAPS OF MEDIEVAL THOUGHT is NOT TO BE MISSED by anyone who loves the life of the mind and the incomparable vitality of the middle ages. Expensive, but worth every farthing!!!"},{"Title":"Maps of Medieval Thought: The Hereford Paradigm","review":"Professor Kline's exigesis of the Hereford Mappa Mundi, combining as it does prodigious research, incisive analyses, brilliantly clear writing, and a wealth of detailed illustrations brings the medieval mind to life.

McSpadden writes here of Benjamin West, John Singeton Copley and Gilbert Stuart, who were our foundational painters, and then he skips to the Tonalist George Inness and that painter of loneliness, Winslow Homer. Then its onto the poetic and imaginative illustrator Elihu Vedder, the Boston painter and decorator John La Farge, the sometimes brilliant eccentric, expatriate James McNeil Whistler, John Singer Sargent, the master of the bravura portrait and watercolor genius, then the historical painter and Shakespeare enthusiast Edwin Austin Abbey - almost unknown today - and finally, to wrap up the 350 page volume, another bravura performer, the American Impressionist and art guru, William Merritt Chase.

But whereas books like Jonathan Kozol's Savage Inequalities will outrage some and spur them to either imagine new ways of fixing an educational system that, despite what many say is better than what we had 50 years ago, still is not enough when students start hopeful and end homeless, or to throw money at that system and hope someone will do something useful with it, Landsman's book focuses your attention differently, in ways that are simultaneously more specific and just as broad.Landsman writes about one specific group of kids during one school year, about kids who were already slipping through the cracks. The apparent lack of complete success in helping these children, coupled with incremental, inconsistent but spirit-raising breakthroughs, may leave you with needs you didn't know you had. It may remind those who have seen The Year of Living Dangerously of Linda Hunt's words to Mel Gibson, something along the lines of &quot;You can't help everyone, you can only help those fate puts in front of you.&quot; Landsman makes you more willing to watch what's in your path, perhaps even to range further off of it to see if anyone needs help.

I like hanging with my friends and playing with my Play Station II, he talks about exercise &#65533; something I definitely didn&#65533;t care about. I could hear him in the next aisle, and the more I heard, the more I listened. This time he was talking about something I could relate to, being a fat kid, not being popular, being invisible. I slowly started to walk over. He was talking about Get Strong. Finally it clicked. My brother has been an athlete all his life &#65533; the exact opposite of me. I always wondered why he got the good grades, the girls and had tons of friends. Jake said that all guys needed was a little physical fitness to get confident. I thought about it all the way home and asked my mom to get the book. I expected my brother to give me a hard time about it, but he thought it was cool. I have read the whole book twice and have begun exercising. My brother is a terrific coach and my family is really proud of me. I&#65533;ve only had the book a little over a week and it has changed my life. For one thing, I didn&#65533;t know that I was so strong.

For years I have seen my son's attitude and self esteem go down the drain. Nothing but video games, the computer and pizza and sodas. It never occurred to me that his physical fitness (or lack of it) had so much effect on his life (and confidence). We made a deal that he would give this book a try. I really didn't expect much, but in a few short weeks, I saw his whole life change. He rushes in from school and heads for his weights and his workout. I think he finally feels that he has some control over something in his life. I feel that this is a much more productive way for him to spend his afternoons. He has more confidence, more interest in life and he is even starting to get better grades.

I was lucky enough to recieve an advance copy which I sent to my teenage brother. He is a great kid who gets good grades, has nice friends, and stays out of trouble - but he lacked confidence and an understanding that he is in control of his own life. Basically he was living a &quot;typical&quot; teenage life, I hoped this book would challenge him t strive to be &quot;exceptional&quot;. It did just that!!!When my phone rang 2 weeks after I had sent the book, I barely recognized my brother's voice. He was so excited and talking 100 mph thanking me for the book, telling me about the goals he had set, and those he had already achieved! In a very short time he had seen the results of setting a goal, working for it, and seeing it happen... he is a new guy!!!

Nobody has a better plan for that than Jake Steinfeld. The guy is a phenomenon, and in this book, you learn that he started out as a pudgy guy who had trouble speaking and had the self-confidence of a beaten puppy. I've got 3 sons who think Jake is tops -- not just because he's a monster physically, but because he's created a great life for himself and his family, pretty much from scratch. It all started for him as a teenager, and this book is more than his life story: it's a step-by-step way of thinking about what you want, and then methodically making it happen. It's got great ways to make muscles and gain the flexibility to use them, but it's a whole lot more. And it's a book that's clearly written from Jake's heart, and in his own unique style - straight to the point, as clear as can be, and often funny as all get out.

It starts by building an awareness of systems thinking as a discipline, and by providing a series of learning activities that lead you through the basics.The two main techniques that this book teaches are (1) behavior over time graphs and causal loops, both of which are the main tools employed in systems thinking. These are also the foundation of system dynamics of which systems thinking is a subset (system dynamics uses expanded techniques such as simulation models and analysis of alternatives).What I like about this book is the clear explanation of the basics and the use of illustrations and learning activities. I also like the summaries of system archetypes and system thinking tools included in the appendices, which provide starting points for further study. It's not the best book for self-study because it is written more as a workbook than an introductory text.

(Book 4).","review":"Number four in the five volume series entitled \\"The Fantastic Art of Frank Frazetta,\\" this book, like the others, begins with a brief introduction by Betty Ballantine. Contains images of fantasy and science fiction containing some violence and nudity. For those wondering whether the art reproductions in these out-of-print Ballantine volumes are closer to the originals than the reproductions in Icon are, the answer is: sometimes. I went to the Frazetta Museum in PA in part to answer this question because I saw clear differences between the books. In Icon, reproductions are sometimes cropped and appear washed out with a dominant color. In Icon, for example, \\"Berserker\\" is washed out with red, almost duo-toned, which ruins his skin color. In Icon, many reproductions are cropped off. In the Ballantine series, reproductions are complete and have vibrant colors much more true to the originals.Book is a 9\\" x 11\\", 95 pages, soft cover, first published in the U.S. in August 1980 and going into at least three printings thereafter. The cover painting is Sacrifice. Volumes four and five were printed in fewer numbers than the first three. Paper is high quality: thick and glossy. It contains assorted small sketches, figure studies, and the following untitled black and white drawings and color paintings: Eternal Champion, Iron Thorn, Tree of Death, Gollum, Fantasy World, Carson of Venus, Black Star, Count Dracula, Outlaw of Torn, Beyond the Grave, Winged Terror, Mongol Tyrant, Two of a Kind (fat nude female with fat pig) colored drawing, half page (hp) drawing African tribesman with shield & spear vs. big cat, hp drawing primitive man with spiked club in swamp, hp drawing primitive man with spiked club vs. triceratops, full page (fp) drawing seven primitives with spears vs. a tyrannosaurus, fp drawing cloaked, helmed man holding nude with two guards and corpse, primitive man carrying off two resisting nude women, preliminaries for Green Death and A Princess of Mars, God from the Sky, fp drawing primitive man with knife in grip of flying pterodactyl, hp colored drawing two primitive men fist fighting over woman on ground, small colored drawing tyrannosaurus in swamp, fp drawing tyrannosaurus in swamp, Space Attack, Space 104-Scramble, The Tempters, Circle of Terror, New World, The Cave Demon, Eve, The Return of Jongar, Thor's Flight, Witherwing, Frankenstein and Dracula, Las Vegas, Devil Rider, Sacrifice, The Secret People, Sound, Seven Romans, Flesh Eaters, Mothman, King Kong and Frazetta Self Portrait."},{"Title":"Frank Frazetta; Book Four. (Book 4).","review":"If you like Frazetta, this is a good calendar, as good as any art calendar with nice color reproductions, not big (about 10.5&quot; X 13.5&quot;), with holidays and phases of the moon, titles, dates and publication data on the illos which are printed to take up the entire top area, without borders, plus beautiful small pen and ink illos (about 2&quot; X 2.5&quot;) on the lower page with the name of the month. The reproductions are slightly warmer in hue than in the book collections (that is, yellow, red, and orange are perceptibly more predominant over green, blue and violet when compared to other reproductions of the same work). They all look sharply focused.I might quibble with some of the selections. Maybe other Frazetta calendars have come out in previous years and they don't want to repeat themselves, but Jaguar God I is compositionally not in a league with Frazetta's best, and Mongol Tyrant is a weak choice for October when Frazetta's great paintings for Creepy magazine are available for a Halloween theme. Still, it will grace my kitchen wall for a year, and I'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Formosa Straits","review":"While the world watches from the comfort of their living rooms, Premier Xiao-ying Tien, &quot;The Smiling Man&quot;, masterminds an invasion of Taiwan. Thousands of planes attack Taiwan, while millions of troops take the beaches after crossing Formosa Straights. Even as the valiant efforts of the Taiwanese spirit goes unnoticed by the world, the people of Taiwan struggle all the harder. FORMOSA STRAIGHTS is a terrifying look at a possible future, all the more startling for its real-life possibility.Taiwanese President Chiu Wong Chen and General Kai valiantly lead their people to oppose in the encroaching communists. But they are crippled by a mixture of modern and obsolete weapons and the large numbers of invaders as they struggle to save the lives of a billion and a half people.Between snatches of the political powers which govern both sides of the war, the reader also is privy to the viewpoints of others: The American reporter, Mike Shannon, finds himself swept away by the extraordinary people of Taiwan. American pilots lend their skills to the &quot;Flying Tigers,&quot; providing invaluable aid in the air. Veteran Marshal Zhou's wish to save a family member leads to incredible deception. Party Chairman Lap Wo Lam, the Marxist fanatic, greatly underestimates China's new capitalists. Zheng Yi Kwan and his grandfather lead their Party Militia in a deadly game they underestimates and cannot control.As the islands of Quemoy and Matsu fall into the hands of the Communists, the bloody carnage reflects the destruction of the land. Naval and air battles rage around the embattled islands, in the command centers and meeting rooms where the fate of nations are determined, on battlefields where thousands die for the dreams of their nations.Perhaps my lack of knowledge of weaponry and military tactical understanding interfered with my enjoyment of FORMOSA STRAIGHTS. But the weakness that truly prevented me from becoming fully involved in the narrative was the fact that the novel is so plot bound. Certainly the genre is not to blame as I have read quite a lot of &quot;war lit&quot; that I have thoroughly enjoyed even without an understanding of weaponry, because of the human element. With FORMOSA STRAIGHTS, however, the flashes of characterization piqued my interested but didn't last long enough, or delve deep enough, to fulfill the promise.Nevertheless, T.J. McFadden certainly brings the skill and precision of a master craftsman who knows war and the battles contained therein, both on the battlefield and in the command center. He starkly brings to life the hell of the destruction of a people in a world where nobody can be bothered to notice. Moving deftly between common soldiers and world powers, Americans and Taiwanese, living and dying, FORMOSA STRAIGHTS presents a profound vision of the deadly cost of ignoring the destruction of a small country."},{"Title":"Nicholas Roerich","review":"Being great Roerich fans and being that there is so precious little available in print, myself and several friends were all bitterly disappointed with this otherwise very promising book. Ken Archer is undoubtedly a Roerich expert and all of our hopes were high. However, precious little information of a more than superficial nature was not forthcoming. Whilst the reproductions are good on the whole, some are reversed or wrongly titled....We had heard of this book many, many years ago and were eagerly anticipating what promised to be a great book on a spiritual artist dedicated to Beauty and to raising the vibrations of humanity through the Creative Fire.

Decter titled: NICHOLAS ROERICH - THE LIFE &amp; ART OF A RUSSIAN MASTER and this book I can thoroughly recommend."},{"Title":"Clausewitz and Chaos: Friction in War and Military Policy","review":"The author, and this book, may well be among the strongest elements of what I perceive to be a growing backlash against the prevalent technophelia characteristic of the military-industrial complex that President and General Eisenhower warned us against--a technophelia that advocates a &quot;system of systems&quot; with no provision for strategy, doctrine, or intelligence; and a Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that looks to micro-UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and robotic ants as the primary means for defeating any enemy. We will simply assume every enemy will conveniently expose themselves to the narrow range of capabilities that we have devised at great expense!The author provides as good a review of &quot;friction&quot; in war and in policy as one could hope for. Although sometimes tedious and not always easy to follow, this book is a must for any serious scholar of future conflicts between states, nations, and organizations. Above all, this book is a giant compressed Castor Oil pill for the techno-meisters so eager to believe they can shape a world where our money and our technology can overcome every obstacle and every opponent.A few highlights intended to recommend the purchase of this book and its digestion:1) Friction is not receiving the attention it merits from modern social scientists, including all those on the Department of Defense payroll. We still conceptualize our capabilities along techno-rational lines instead of human-normal chaos lines.2) It is the combination of thoughtful doctrine, individual and unit discipline, initiative at all levels, and good intelligence (individual, organic, and external) that leads to victory through the reduction of friction--what General Alfred M. Gray, former Commandant of the Marine Corps institutionalized with his concept of &quot;commander's intent&quot; on top of training for war with the assumption that communications and computing *will* collapse in the heat of battle.3) Although very brief in his coverage of intelligence per se, the author is helpful in reviewing Clausewitz's top eight sources of friction, the first three of which deal with information: insufficient knowledge of the enemy; unreliable information from patrols and spies; and uncertain knowledge of our own capabilities and dispositions. The author administers the coup de grace to technophiles with some elegant quotes from these worthies claiming that the new world of satellite intelligence is taking us to a non-Clauswitzian world where friction can be overcome by &quot;information superiority&quot;--these are the same folks that cannot find Bin Laden and had to invade Panama in order to capture Noriega--the same folks that let a warlord in Somalia run amok and let a small crowd chase away a U.S. Navy ship of war from docking in Haiti...the same folks that ignore 18 distinct genocide campaigns on-going today, with all that implies in terms of forced migration and epidemic disease and failed states and rampant destabilizing crime.4) The author's review of groupthink (Janis) and how this leads to policy fiasco's is very worthwhile, not only because it is acutely relevant to how we are making decisions today in defense, energy, health, and fiscal policy, but because it highlights so clearly the dangers that come from a leadership that thinks it is invulnerable, morally superior, self-censored, sharing illusions of unanimity, subject to stereotyped visions of the world, and--worst of all--protected from reality by self appointed &quot;mind guards&quot; who put direct pressure on &quot;deviant&quot; naysayers (or dump them from the team).5) The author is one of the few to focus on the impact of friction on what Clausewitz calls the ultimate disconnect, that between ends and means in war. As America prepares to rethink its military force structure, it is especially appropriate to note that we are planning to downsize the conventional forces while investing heavily in electronic capabilities, at the same time that the most advanced thinkers have moved beyond asymmetric war to non-traditional soft power including major emphasis on disease control, water preservation, transnational law enforcement, and major diplomatic and economic assistance options. Looking at today's situation through the author's eyes and this book, one can see that we do not have a strategy; we don't even try to understand what everyone else's strategy might be; and we are completely ignoring the need to fully integrate home front and overseas defense, foreign affairs, and trade strategy and capabilities management.Over the course of 7 chapters, the author reviews friction both at the policy/acquisition level and the operational level of command, in relation to irrelevant and inflexible war plans; nuclear crisis management; within Desert Storm; in small wars, &quot;faux wars&quot; and peace operations; in modern deterrence; and in relation to mass destruction and information warfare paradigms. In the latter instance, he is acutely sensitive to the teachings of Dr. Steve Blank, that one man's information &quot;warning&quot; attack is another man's signal for &quot;total war&quot;--witness Russian doctrine that considers a C4I attack to be fundamental and requiring an immediate &quot;dead hand&quot; retaliatory attack.The author concludes the book with a review of simple, compound, and complex friction in policy and operations, with examples, and for this section alone the book merits inclusion in any serious library concerned with international security."},{"Title":"Clausewitz and Chaos: Friction in War and Military Policy","review":"In Clausewitz and Chaos, nuclear strategist and historian Stephen Cimbala analyzes the role of \\"friction\\" in military planning and strategic decision making. Taking friction to the level of politics and strategy is an excellent idea, and one that many politicians might learn from. I enjoyed the book, and found the review in the first chapters on the modern thought about friction to be quite helpful.The remainder of the book, though, rehashes themes that Cimbala has covered in significant depth in the past. He uses the examples of Russian war planning at the start of WWI, US/Soviet relations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and nuclear war planning to demonstrate how inflexible plans and thoughtless leaders can precipitate undesired wars. In this, the book is a simple repeat of his earlier book, Military Persuasion.Cimbala does include two thoughful chapters that expand his earlier themes and contribute to the study of friction in modern, information driven conflicts: one on NATO action in Kosovo, and one on the Gulf War of 1991. Both chapters are useful and highlight his thesis that war planning in the information age is just as susceptible to friction as it was 100 years ago.Overall, those interested in friction in policy decisions, or friction in information war will find the book useful. Those who have read some of Cimbala's other works can safely pass this one up."},{"Title":"Medicine in the Industrial World (History of Medicine)","review":"A part of the outstanding John D.

For example, I'd rather not have the FTC taking my tax dollars and using them to chase down value producing entities like Microsoft. I do agree that the people who ride in the cart have responsibility; however, I am concerned about the erosion of respect for private property that causes many to believe that their need is a claim on my earned assets.

I've got news for the author, &quot;We all know this!&quot; The book promised solutions, but I did not find any real solutions. Amity decried the National Sales Tax, which is an absolutely wonderful idea, because we would probably end up with both an income tax and a national sales tax. This should not knock out the National Sales tax idea. Just don't let a dual system develop. The biggest problem we have by far is the fact that our current tax system is the source of power for Congress. If they gave up this power, they would not receive nearly as much campaign contributions, they would not enjoy as many free meals, golf outings, etc. I am at a complete loss about how you would get these people to vote for a system totally against their personal interest! What would it take to drastically change our current tax system? Taxes really aren't the problem either - it's runaway spending. We should only give the various State governments and the Federal government a limited amount to spend and not allow them to spend a penny more - but, again, how do you stop them? It might work if 10 or 20 million people refused to pay their taxes, but I wouldn't want to have the IRS Gestappo after me! Amity needs to give us solutions!!"},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"When George Washington was president, taxes were few. Since then, times have really gotten expensive. The 20th century especially was an arms race between the governments in the United States and its citizens to determine who would control the citizens' income. Government was on the offense and the citizens were on the defense. The citizens lost to date. Taxes went from less than 5 percent of income to 40 percent over that time. Most would agree that we cannot afford another century like that one.This book nicely lays out the history of taxes that take more income and waste a lot of time and effort in the process. The author looks at sales taxes, withholding taxes at work, the marriage penalty in the income tax, whether the housing deduction for interest and taxes is a good thing or not, the problems with taxes on domestic help, property taxes and school support, the social security system, and estate taxes.She doesn't like much of what she sees, and is concerned that reform could simply lead to adding new types of taxes (like a national sales tax while keeping all of the old taxes).The newer the tax or tax idea, it seems like the worse it is working.Her solutions are basically principles to be followed in reforming taxes. I doubt if they will be followed anytime soon. Recent polls show that most Americans are concerned about paying off the national debt and fixing social security before doing anything about cutting taxes.Although most of her observations were good ones, I was a little doubtful about her automatic focus on the high income people being taken to the cleaners unfairly. There was not as much attention paid to benefits that lower income people may be receiving.If you spend time thinking about how to keep your tax bill down, there's not much new in this book. If you are new to all of the ways that government helps you spend your money, this is a good introduction to the subject.The book is well written and pleasant to read. The only drawback I found was that it was a little depressing to be reminded of how much I actually pay to all of the various governments. Every year, I find April 15 more and more depressing."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"A required read for all Americans - those who pay taxes and those whom receive benefits from the taxes paid!!!"},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"An excellent review of the history of various types of taxes levied on Americans.

Woven through the book are tax law changes over time and people's reaction and behaviors to them. For example, people who work in Massachusetts live in New Hampshire to escape the taxes of Massachusetts. New Yorker's send expensive purchases to friends and relatives in other states to avoid the high taxes of New York City. Nevertheless, there seems to be less of a cry to redo the system today, perhaps because the economy is good, than there was under in the Reagan years. The cry for change is bound to be heard again as soon as the stock market and the economy falter. In fact, corporate profits are already under pressure. It appears that there is no simple way to fix the tax system. Do legislators know how to adapt to the kind of change that may be suggested to develop a new system? Tradition and Bureaucracy Stalls may get in the way. Disbelief and Misconception Stalls about the benefits of a new system will be raised. Perhaps a new process, starting fresh and looking for the ideal solution, without any old baggage and emotions, would generate a better process.

Aptly subtitled &quot;How taxes drive Americans crazy and what to do about it,&quot; The &quot;Greedy Hand&quot; will be call to action for anyone who is wondering where nearly half their paycheck goes each year and just what those folks in Washington are doing with their hard earned money. &quot;The Greedy Hand&quot; will be a cold shower for the its-not-as-bad-as-Europe crowd; raise the supply-siders from their decade-long torpor; and let's just hope the black helicopter types' don't get their hands on it.&quot;The Greedy Hand&quot; is a provocative examination of how the hand of government reaches ever deeper into everyone's pocketbook and influences American's lives from cradle to grave in ways that would shock even the most ardent tax haters. Yet this is not one of those angry little books we expect each tax season, nor is it another numbing how-to-pay-no-taxes tome. It is, rather, an &quot;X-Files&quot; meets Good Housekeeping account of every dollar one earns, spends or saves and may well become the most influential work on political economy since Paul Johnson's Modern Times.Shlaes, the top tax writer on the Wall Street Journal's editorial board, begins her tour of the IRS sausage factory with a novel proposition: That the father of modern America was an obscure department store executive who concocted the notion of withholding taxes and in doing so, severed the link between what people pay for government and what they get in return. The theory goes something like this: Since the withheld dollars never make it into workers hands (as with sales and some investment taxes), workers often do not have to cut a check and never feel the full brunt of working nearly half the year just to pay the costs of government. In fact, in what amounts to a fiscal Stockholm syndrome, taxpayers are actually grateful when Uncle Sam refunds a few of the dollars he borrowed interest free for the better part of the year.Shlaes' hard-hitting editorials strikes fear into the hearts of Congressional tax &quot;cutters&quot; who opt for nail clippers instead of chain saws and the &quot;The Greedy Hand&quot; goes several steps further by putting the recent piddling social tax credits into historical perspective. To wit, the average American worker today pays more in Social Security taxes alone than millionaires paid in income taxes when it began in 1913. Other examples abound.The &quot;Greedy Hand's&quot; chapters are like levels in a tax Inferno--baby taxes, school taxes, shopping taxes, house taxes, job taxes, success taxes, retirement taxes and ultimately death taxes. But this is not Dant&eacute; and the reader comes away a true believer that if the Devil is in the details of anything it is in the incomprehensible 7 million-word tax code and that an exorcism is long overdue.Adam Dubitsky, abdcomm@erols.com"},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Read it.

For example, the author criticizes wage withholding as an unwarranted grab by various levels of givernment. In fact, almost no one criticizes the concept of wage withholding- certainly not the government (which, after all, is responsible for collecting taxes), and not employees (given that, absent wage withholding, about 100 million employees would find themselves making quarterly estimated income tax payments). In other words, wage withholding, whatever its original motives, is an administrative convenience for employees and the government. One chapter contains a curious criticism of 401(k) plans- that, since the employees funds are being invested in stocks, mutual funds, and the like, then withdrawels from the 401(k) plan should be taxed at capital gain rates, and not as 'ordinary income'. The author does not indicate that she understands the underlying concept of 401(k), IRAs, etc.- that the amounts invested in such tax-preferred vehicles are deducted from ordinary (wage) income; correlatively, withdrawels are taxes as ordinary income. The chapter on school funding is excellent, but it has little to do with the local property tax. Rather, it is a compelling critique of the travesty of federal and state judges seizing control of local school districts. Interesting, but not really a tax issue. The chapter on the estate tax is also excellent, especially the discussion of this tax being a 'zero-sum game'- the revenue raised (about 1% of the federal budget) is less than amounts spent by citizens to plan around the estate tax. The 'deadweight' costs of the estate tax are staggering.

I have not read the book yet but am planning to purchase it since the overall premise is sound. I've noticed that several negative reviewers have stated or implied that simple taxation is not fair. Well, let's try this out. Read my small and brief essay on fairness and tell me what you think. I had posited this essay to several friends, family and colleagues and was met with mixed reviews. Some positive, some negative.----------------------------------------------------------------------Fairness. What is fairness? I've been thinking a lot about this not only about life in general but especially with this election coming up. Before I get into the crux of the matter let's start by defining fairness or, more specifically, fair.Merriam-Webster defines fair as \\"marked by impartiality and honesty: free from self interest, prejudice or favoritism\\". Synonyms include JUST, EQUITABLE, IMPARTIAL, OBJECTIVE. JUST, in regards to Fair, implies an exact following of a standard of what is right and proper. EQUITABLE implies a less rigorous standard than JUST and usually suggests equal treatment of all concerned. IMPARTIAL stresses an absence of favor or prejudice. OBJECTIVE stresses a tendency to view events or persons as apart from oneself and one's own interest or feelings.1Now, how does fairness come into play in our lives? How do we properly judge what is fair when arbitrating disputes or, more in general, giving out rewards and punishments? Most of us do this based on our past experiences but mostly based on the specific workings/ideology of the parties concerned. For example, you hire two men to work on your lawn. Both men are of equal fitness, intelligence and capacity to work. Your lawn is equally in disarray on both sides and you task each man to clean up a side. One individual mows, weeds, bags the trash, bug sprays, and cleans up after himself. The other just mows the lawn. I believe that most, in fairness, would pay the first man more than the second because he did a far better job. Now, what if we paid both individuals the same amount? Is this fair? Why or why not? This goes into the heart of my idea of fairness and how to institute it across the board throughout the United States. Bear with me on this. Take a few seconds to think about each item then go to the next.First of all, everyone would be treated exactly the same. Everyone who is of working age, 18 and older, would be paid the exact same wage of $50,000 a year. No more, no less. Not a penny. It does not matter what you do or what position you have, everyone will receive the same amount. Is this fair?Second, everyone would have the exact same car and house with both items having the exact same features, colors, and furniture. Is this starting to sound fair?Third, everyone would receive the exact same type of medical care. Across the board. No favoritism, nothing.Fourth, no one is allowed to buy anything. Everything is free but everyone will receive the exact same thing as everyone else.Fifth, everyone will have plenty of food to eat for each person but everyone will eat the exact same thing in the exact same portion every day. The meals will change from day to day but everyone will have the same meal. Meals will be brought to each house at the exact same time for each meal. There will be no storing of food, either from attempted purchases, which will be illegal, or from meal leftovers. All leftover food from meals will be discarded.Sixth, everyone will have the same clothing. There will be no makeup, jewelry or headgear.Seventh, there will be no money making mechanisms, i.e. interest yielding accounts, bonds, stocks. This will also be illegal since you can't buy anything anyways.Does this sound fair? Can we do this? It IS fair for everyone. What do you think? Why or why not can this be accomplished? Give reasons for either argument, whichever side you take."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Simplifying taxes is a trap that every tax reformer falls into.

So I'll confine my review to some of the obvious problems she either ignores or skates over...To begin with, Shlaes completely ignores the international picture. Amazingly, America is the LEAST taxed developed nation in the world, yet has the largest military forces (bigger than the next 10 nations COMBINED), the largest road network, the largest criminal justice system, the largest education system, the largest number of public funded colleges, the largest (combined) police force, the largest number of professional fire-fighters and so on and so on. All these huge organisations cost huge amounts of money; a simple yet devastating fact Shales prefers to ignore. Instead she talks of waste and corruption. Well, those are probably inevitable, given the mind-blowing size and complexity of the organisations the US has.Then there's the whining and angry (although passive and prosperous) American middle class, provided with free education, subsidised housing (tax cuts for home buyers), subsidised gasoline, subsidised roads, and so on. In fact this class has some claim to be the most subsidised group in the country.Shales may well be aware of the major paradoxes I've outlined above; how else to explain her hopelessly weak suggestions (worthy of a High School debate) on reforming and and streamlining the system?Ultimately, like every other commentator and politician, Shales cannot escape the contradiction that American citizens have grown to demand and expect the best from their government, yet (unlike any other aspect of national and private life) they expect the best to be provided for almost nothing, as if by magic, by a mysterious entity called &quot;Washington.&quot;Without a major rethink of American citizen's expectations and the country's world role, any talk of significant tax cuts will remain limited to misty-eyed dreamers like Shales and her followers."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"It is a shame the author didn't read the tax code before writing this book. It is obvious she was unwilling to be encumbered by the facts. My right wing relatives love it. They also think of pork rinds as an entree."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"As the title says this is silly, political posturing bysomeone who has hers and doesn't particularly care if peopleare out of work. Maybe she doesn't care if you're on the dole."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"This should be required Civics reading for high school students. The author gives a politically non-biased explanation of the events that have warped simple tax proposals into Frankenstein's monster."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"This book is similar To Martin Gross's the Tax Racket. It provides good summaries of the various taxes that we are slammed with by all levels of government. However, the portion of the subtitle telling us what we can do about the problem is short and weak. Elect politicians who will cut our taxes...yeah, ok. The only way the American people will get rid of the IRS and the income tax is if we all collectively decide to not file returns next year and we amend our W-4's so that no witholding tax is taken out. Hell, they can't arrest all of us. Where is the Spirit of 76?"},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"The 20th century was an arms race between the governments in the United States and its citizens to determine who would control the citizens' income. Government was on the offense and the citizens were on the defense. The citizens lost to date. Taxes went from less than 5 percent of income to 40 percent over that time. Most would agree that we cannot afford another century like that one.This book nicely lays out the history of taxes that take more income and waste a lot of time and effort in the process. The author looks at sales taxes, withholding taxes at work, the marriage penalty in the income tax, whether the housing deduction for interest and taxes is a good thing or not, the problems with taxes on domestic help, property taxes and school support, the social security system, and estate taxes.She doesn't like much of what she sees, and is concerned that reform could simply lead to adding new types of taxes (like a national sales tax while keeping all of the old taxes).The newer the tax or tax idea, it seems like the worse it is working.Her solutions are basically principles to be followed in reforming taxes. I doubt if they will be followed anytime soon. Recent polls show that most Americans are concerned about paying off the national debt and fixing social security before doing anything about cutting taxes.Although most of her observations were good ones, I was a little doubtful about her automatic focus on the high income people being taken to the cleaners unfairly. There was not as much attention paid to benefits that lower income people may be receiving.If you spend time thinking about how to keep your tax bill down, there's not much new in this book. If you are new to all of the ways that government helps you spend your money, this is a good introduction to the subject.The book is well written and pleasant to read. The only drawback I found was that it was a little depressing to be reminded of how much I actually pay to all of the various governments."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Most Americans believe that their government is greedy. Those who do will still find this book earth shatering. Shlaes gives stunning examples of just how much Americans are being ripped off by the current tax code. In painstaking detail she describes how achievement, hard work, and even marriage are punished by the greed of the U.S. government. She points out very effectively that it is now possible to make too much money. When one reads this, one can't help but think that the government views them only as a revenue target. Her chapter on the I.R.S. is very enlightening. It is commonly believed that the I.R.S. is tyrannical. One would think that if it was tyrannical it would at least be effective. Shlaes really hits one out in describing just how ineffective the I.R.S. is. Also, Shlaes argues very convincingly that problems such as rising healthcare costs and the collapse of public education can, at the heart of the matter, be blamed on an inefficient tax code. Words cannot effectively state just how powerful this book is. A must read for all Americans. Maybe then some real tax reform will begin."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Although many Americans are aware that our tax rates are high and getting higher, the &quot;Greedy Hand&quot;, shows us just how and how much the government steals from its citizens. It is very clear that although we have a representative republic and a capitalist economy, we are behaving more and more like any socialist country in Europe. We have cast the federal government as a twisted version of Robin Hood, stealing from the &quot;rich&quot; and giving to the &quot;poor&quot;. The means through which this occurs runs the gamut from payroll taxes to the bewildering concept of the progressive tax, which punishes persons who dare to make a success of themselves. I am perplexed by the 15% flat tax opponents who cry that the rich won't pay their &quot;fair share&quot; - although these folks shoulder over 90% of the nation's tax burden. We have only to look at our President to see how well our progressive tax (with its special provisions for the rich) is working. According to published reports, the Clintons' tax return showed over $500,000 in income, while paying taxes at a 16% tax rate. Surely our president would not disapprove of the flat tax solution, since in effect, he is already practicing it."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Finally, an appropriate label has been placed on the monstrosity we call the tax code -- GREED. I don't think a more anti-family, anti-business, anti-prosperity, anti-success, anti-savings, anti-investment tax code could have been devised had it been planned that way from the start. Ms. Shlaes does what government would never dare do - break down the taxes we pay into the most important aspect of our lives - marriage, children, education, success, retirement, and death. Every taxpayer ought to read this book."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"There are probably few people in the country who would disagree that the tax system needs to be seriously overhauled. But, the widely dispersed views of how to do this, the bureaucracratic proceedures required to make any change and the tradition of continuing to do things the same way, seem to prevail. What results are practices like the ones described in THE GREEDY HAND which encourage people to look for ways to reduce their tax burden - Work in one state but live in another that has a lower tax burden and buy goods in one state but ship them to another with a lower tax burden. We will have to reach &quot;a burning platform&quot; in this country to make significant progress, or we will have to educate those in control and teach them a process to get the information they need, reach a consensus, look at alternatives and choose one that will benefit the most people in any economic and social environment that we are likely to experience in the decades to come. This is no small task. There are some lights on the horizon, however. I have just read a wonderful new book, THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION, by Donald Mitchell, Carol Coles and Robert Metz, that describes a process like this. That book also describes why people are &quot;stalled&quot; and unable to make progress. I urge those interested in positive change and more rapid progress to read it."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"A cogent, easy-to-read yet well-thought analysis of our current tax system, loopholes and all. Organized in a user-friendly manner, this is a powerful analysis that is within the intellectual reach of anyone interested in the topic. Ms. Shlaes' comments and recommendations are right on target."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Americans hate paying taxes and our government loves to raise them. Just look at how hard we work to get loopholes and tax breaks and watch how Congress and the Administration are planning the newest set of higher taxes. In this book, the author takes a look at this phenomenon, demonstrates the problems with our current tax system, and then offers up a few suggestions. Some books are heavy with raw numbers and charts, but in this book the author uses a fun of a narrative format to make her points. In so doing, she makes her book much more readable and pretty quick to go through. This book is worth your time if you're at all concerned about the state of our tax system, especially as the middle class approaches close to paying 50% of their income in various taxes (thus the title). Sadly, while the author's analysis is spot on, I don't see any change coming in the near future. Let's hope I'm wrong.p.s. The author's other book, The Forgotten Man, is an even better book about the history of the Great Depression-check it out."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Amity Shlaes presents in extremely readable fashion a history of taxation in America. She shows how since the Tariff Act of 1917, taxes in this country have come to consume nearly half of everything we earn. Her description of the ills is better than her suggested solutions which don't really break new ground.There is no disputing her thesis however, that the invisible hand of commerce is in a life and death struggle with the greedy hand of government which believes it knows best how money should be spent, and by whom. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the culture of taxation in this country and ponder the prospects for tax relief."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"As a enthusiast for liberty I buy everybook on income taxation I see-almost.This one just wasn't worth buying (I read it standing in a bookstore). Why? because once again we've got a writer here devoting her excellent writing skills to describing the problem (mostly the symptoms) but not mustering the courage to call for income tax abolition.What set America apart form every nation in the past was the government staying out of the lives of the common man. It allowed a confidence like no people ever had in history. Because they weren't being forced to do anything, they dared to believe they could do anything.The author says that most american's don't want to &quot;kill.&quot; the income tax. That's because most americans don't know anything about it. I assure you that most INFORMED americans, especially small business owners would end it in a second.You'll feel the same way if you read &quot;Your Money Or Your Life&quot; by Sheldon Richman, &quot;Freedom in Chains&quot; by James Bovard or &quot;Why Government Doesn't Work&quot; by Harry Browne.Everything about income taxation is evil. It nutures government irresponsibility and misspending, and pointless class envy among citizens."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"Amity Shlaes makes a strong argument for fewer and lower taxes at the federal, state and local levels. Obviously, everybody is in favor of tax reform. The problem is to find an optimum solution that would satisfy all of us. Unfortunately, the book loses some of its credibility when the author suggests &quot;privatizing&quot; social security. Why not a simple progressive tax: the higher the income, the higher the tax."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"The next time you sit down to do your taxes, stop a moment and ask your accountant or tax attorney:&quot;Is the so-called &quot;Income Tax&quot; a tax on income?A most informative statement on page 2580 of the Congressional record of 1943 in regard to the early history of the income-tax law was written by Mr. F. Morse Hubbard, formerly of the legislative drafting research fund of Columbia University, and a former legislative draftsman in the Treasury Department: &quot;The income tax is, therefore, not a tax on income as such. It is an excise tax with respect to certain activities and privileges which is measured by reference to the income which they produce. The income is not the subject of the tax: it is the basis for determining the amount of tax.&quot;Next ask your tax professional and/or the IRS:What activities and privileges am I engaged in that are taxable?"},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"This is a pretty good half-assed book. It does an entertaining job of telling us half the story of taxation in America; it is especially good at illuminating the invisible taxes which we all take for granted because we don't see them every day. But it fails completely to tell the untold story of the extent to which government provides goods and services to virtually every American, goods and services which are so invisible they take them completely for granted. In her Acknowledgments, Shales mentions the help provided her by at least four agencies of the federal government. Did she pay for these services? Did these government bureaucrats charge her consulting fees? Did the Social Security Administration charge her anything for \\"hosting her for a day?\\" No, these were services provided by government which she simply took for granted. She failed to make the connection between those services and the taxes which she so resents. George Bernard Shaw once observed \\"A government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul.\\" The real \\"greedy hand\\" in America is not that of government, but the millions of outstretched hands of a nation of Pauls.Taxation is always resented and railing against it is an easy cheap-shot. More than two centuries ago, Edmund Burke stated the dilemma of government: \\"To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is not given to men.\\" And we even distort our history in the service of this resentment. The American Revolution was not driven by rebellion against usurious tax rates, or even by resentment over \\"taxation without representation.\\" The real problem was that the taxes were levied on the colonies and the benefits were lavished on England. The mature question always is one of the balance sheet between costs and benefits. But a sober-minded accounting of the costs and benefits of modern government would not be so popular. It is much easier, as Amity Shales does, merely to pander to our adolescent resentments about taxes.Amity Shales' book will prove very successful, because of the H. L. Mencken principle about never going broke by underestimating the public. The real story here is not the many ways, visible and hidden, that modern governments raise taxes; the real story is the many services that government provides and how we resent the taxes and fail to appreciate the benefits. But this is one story Amity Shales hopes we will continue to overlook. She is probably right."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"If your expecting something new this book will be a disappointment...Privitization of Social Security, elimination of progressive taxation, etc. The only thing Shales is to be congradulated on is depicting the IRS only as a governmental agency doing its job and not some UN-sponsored New World Order Secret Society. If you have no background in economics and you believe this stuff already, you'll find this book agreeable. If you don't fit this description, look elsewhere"},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"I agree that Shlaes has written an impassioned discussion of taxation and made some fairly reasonable suggestions (e.g., about estate tax). On the other hand, I feel that her argument fails in one crucial respect: she assumes that the &quot;typical&quot; American family is a married couple with two good incomes, and most of the reforms she suggests have to do with easing the burden on them. Maybe this is typical of Wall Street Journal readers, but it certainly isn't the world *I* know: single women supporting 3 kids with little or no help from their exes, &quot;working poor&quot; families with two or three minimum-wage incomes, middle-aged couples where the wife has never worked and they're struggling to survive on the husband's meager pension ... The fact is that our tax system has always given a break to those who can afford tax shelters, and taken proportionately more from low and middle-income wage-earners, and most of the reforms Shlaes suggests would simply perpetuate this inequity. Her book is likely to be popular among those who, in fact, are already paying less than their fair share, but consider it outrageous that they have to pay even that much."},{"Title":"The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It","review":"This is an easy to read and interesting history of our current tax mess, but a few more concrete examples and some suggestions on the way out would have been nice.

Given the title of this book, I was expecting a discussion of the state of our tax situation and some new thinking on &quot;fair&quot; taxation to the masses. I just didn't get it!
