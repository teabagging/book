Dr. Atkins would hate my family right now with all the carbs we are enjoying.That said, some are great, some fall flat...then some you go to almost every time you make a loaf.This is the one I enjoy the most.I was shocked when the book arrived because it's huge...full of recipes! Because of that, regarless of your taste, you should expect to have more than enough choices...even if you wanted to cook a loaf a day.And quite frankly, we kinda love making a different kind every day.Especially if you have a special diet and want to alter bread recipes in your own machine...now you can.Here are some examples:Butter Bread and loads of other white breadsSour Cream BreadWhole Wheat Cuban BreadCoconut Milk White BreadHoney White BreadHoney Wheat Bread and loads of other whole grain breadsJewish Egg BreadSwiss Egg BreadTomato BreadSweet Potato BreadZucchini BreadApplesauce BreadCottage Cheese BreadsRicotta and Chive BreadGreen Chile BreadBlack Olive BreadBalsamic Caramelized Onion BreadSunflower Oatmeal BreadToasted Walnut BreadPecan Raisin BreadOLive Oil Pine Nut BreadBeer BreadCalifornia Nut BreadCinnamon Swirl BreadHot Jalapeno Bread with Longhorn CheeseBeer Bread with CheddarRoquefort Cheese Bread with Walnutsor get creative with your flours for a chance of pace like chickpea flour, graham flour (OMG! I love this loaf! It's like the taste of wheat with a lighter texture and creaminess...I LOVE that one.)recipes for great pizzas making dough such as cheese pizza, caramelized onion and gorgonzola pizza,, mediterranean pizza, etcand all kinds of pizza doughs from white to wheat to cornmeal, etc.there is a whole chapter on gluten-free breadsDid you know you can make pasta dough in your bread machine? Neither did I. There is a whole chapter on it. You'll never go back.Out of yeast? There is a chapter on no-yeast quick breads.Like your bread with jelly or jam? A chapter on how to make them IN your bread machine.and all kinds of rolls, shaped breads, cinnamon rolls cakes, stuffings, foccacias, pita bread, pretzels...I wanted to give a clear picture by listing some ideas but let's face it, there are almost 700 pages of recipes for which you can use your bread maker. That may seem like a longish list but it's small in comparison!I have yet to have any loaf not work. (Incidentally if you ever continue to have bad loaves check the freshness of your ingredients. I had a friend complain about her bread maker and she had old yeast, old baking soda, old baking powder. Bought new and all loaves were perfect! They do matter.)Know going in: These recipes typically call for wheat gluten. Although my regular grocery doesn't carry it, I order mine dirt cheap on Amazon and it's worth it. We now use it in ALL recipes regardless of cookbook...it really improves the taste and texture even if you thought nothing was missing before.Most recipes have the ingredients for a 1.5 pound and a 2 pound loaf. A few are just for a 1.5 pound loaf but work just fine in my 2 pound loaf machine.Negatives: Maybe it would be too time consuming to do for such a huge book, but I really appreciate that one of my other favorite bread machine cookbooks includes the nutritionals for each loaf/slice including the calorie count. That may not matter to everyone but I do like an overview of what I'm taking in. For those who need photos, there aren't any here, although there are drawings. That doesn't matter to me so much especially since all breads are so similar but I know many like cookbooks with photos.Conclusion: I think it's a must have to add variety to your sandwiches and bread routine. You could get by with just this one cookbook for your bread maker and be happy with the endless recipes I think. Wish they had nutritionals but I forgive them that due to the long length of the book already...but maybe in a revised edition at the bottom of each page??"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"The recipes and information about breads and flours are extensive. It's fun reading.Major weakness: The recipes are written in a small font on a medium green background. Even with my normal reading glasses I have to use a magnifying glass to distinguish numbers in the fractions of cups.This means that I will have to type the recipe and print it out in an easily readable font size. I will not be able to assemble the ingredients straight from the book."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Hi!This book works perfectly with my Panasonic bread machine and I have had perfect bread practically every time. (only failure in a year was the flax bread!) I do not have any problems with the recipes being too dry. I even add a lot of whole wheat in with regular white recipes (3/4 white to 1/4 whole wheat) and it still turns out great as long as you add a little water to the dough to compensate for the wheat. (But the recipes I follow by the book do not require me to do so....)It does say SAF yeast is recommended but I was using that but switched to regular bread machine yeast (easier to find) and they STILL come out great. Each recipe will say for example &quot;2 tsp. SAF yeast OR 2 1/2 tsp. bread machine yeast.&quot; so for regular bread machine yeast you need to use a little more but definately guaranteed results. (at least with the Panasonic SDYD250 machine... I know every bread machine model is different. For baking outside of the machine I have had no problem with that either. I have had no problem finding the ingredients even gluten, which is sold at my local supermarkets (and I live in the country in Wisconsin) so I am surprised a person would need to go to a specialty store in California to find gluten! (according to one of the reviews here)Try the sesame bread and the vienna bread! they are both quick and easy recipes that I make often.I am Vegan and do not consume dairy so anyone who is Vegan/Vegetarian can substitute milk for soymilk,egg replacer for eggs and agave nectar for honey and it works fine.Anyhow, give this book a shot expecially for ten bucks or so, I really feel it is worth it."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought all of the top rated bread machine cookbooks when I invested in my Zo and this book by far is the hands down favorite. Now don't get me wrong, there are certain areas where I feel this book lacks in variety/depth of topic (in particular pizza doughs, coffee cakes, etc.), but the scope of this book is so large that I don't think it could try to tackle those those with great detail. Those topics are included in the book, just brief for my liking. I have made many recipes from the book and never, not once, made a bad loaf (both in look and taste).The fundamentals in this book are it's greatest asset. I think once you understand all of her tips and logic, the sky is the limit. One thing I don't like is that some of these tidbits of wisdom are scattered through the book which makes it hard to find at times, but I'm glad they are there. There are two indexes in the back that help with this but sometimes a little tricky.I would agree with other reviewers, if I aerate the flour, I always have to add more flour to these recipes to get the right \\"ball\\" during the knead. At first that frustrated me but it's somewhat part of bread making anyway...darn humidity.The best sandwich breads I have had out of this book have all used buttermilk or sour cream. I make the Instant Potato Bread all the time on the quick cycle in my machine, and it always turns out soft on the inside, crusty on the outside..just perfect! The Basic Pizza Dough recipe is hands down the best pizza dough recipe I have ever tried, and I've tried over 20 of them in search of the perfect hand-tossed type crust. The best recipe by far from this book that I have tried is the Cinnamon Swirl bread. It is an absolute must for anyone to try. The Cinnabun coffee cake is also excellent and the hamburger bun recipe is wonderful. I haven't made a bad tasting loaf yet, and I've tried many of the recipes. I use this book as my go-to book when in doubt, and it hasn't let me down yet. Now if only it were spiral-bound...."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this book at the same time that I purchased my first bread machine (a Sunbeam 5891). Many reviewers sang the praises of Beth Hensberger's book, and I was excited at getting started with baking bread at home. I was looking to lose weight and eat healthier whole-grain bread with most of my meals.Bread machines have absolutely lived up to everything that I hoped; in fact, I've moved on to a better machine. This book, on the other hand, was a disappointment. Three stars is the most that I can give. I am amazed at the number of 5-star ratings that the book received.While the book does indeed provide a large number of recipes, only 28 use whole-grain flour, and in some of these the whole-grain flour is less than half of the total flour -- sometimes much less.But the worst problem is that the vast majority of recipes in the book contain the dreaded words, \\"This recipe is not suitable for use with the Delay Timer.\\" In other words, it contains ingredients that cannot safely sit at room temperature for hours before the baking cycle begins. This means you cannot use these recipes for baking bread overnight, ready to wake you at breakfast. It also means that you cannot use them to bake during the day while you are at work, ready to be eaten hot with dinner. I can only conclude that the book is primarily intended for homemakers who will be home 3 - 4 hours after the cycle starts, ready to pull the hot bread out of the machine and let it cool. (While one could bake the bread immediately and leave it in the machine after baking, you would be risking having it dry out. I don't recommend it.)I counted at least 214 recipes that said \\"This recipe is not suitable for use with the Delay Timer,\\" or required the baker to pull out the dough and bake it in the oven, or required the baker to interrupt the machine cycle some hours after starting and restart. None of these 214 recipes can be made overnight or while you are away at the office. In the Sweet Breads chapter, I did not seen *any* recipes that did not have these problems!Yes, some of the recipes are quite tasty, and the machine does bake them well. But I am rarely able to make them given my busy schedule and tendency to be away from home on weekends.If you believe, as I do, that the real glory of the bread machine is its crockpot-like ability to bake bread while you are *not* home, ready to be served upon your arrival, look elsewhere for your bread recipes."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Oh, my! What delicious homemade breads I produce using this cookbook! Not only are the recipes fabulous, but Beth Hensperger has also done a fantastic job with the educational portions of the book as well.The book opens with a section explaining bread machines in general, followed by a section about the process of bread making. She explains how different flours and other ingredients affect the loaf, and tells you what to expect of your machine. Interspersed among the recipes, the author adds a page or two of helpful information pertaining to the type of recipes in that chapter.Our family absolutely loves the breads I have made using this cookbook. I think our favorite white bread recipe so far is Sour Cream Bread (page 53.) It is incredible! Other favorites are the Cornmeal Honey Bread (page 148) and my favorite whole-wheat recipe, White Whole Wheat Bread (page 127.) With more than 300 recipes to try, it will be a long time before we have tested them all.One thing to mention - I have a Panasonic bread machine and I use only King Arthur flour and Fleischman's instant yeast. That combination always produces a loaf that rises too high using these recipes. I have cut the yeast back to the \\"SAF yeast\\" proportions the author gives, and have cut the vital wheat gluten back a bit as well (King Arthur flour has a higher gluten level than some others.) Doing so has helped the loaves come out perfectly.I can't say enough good things about this cookbook. If you buy only one bread machine cookbook, let this be the one!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this book along with my Breadman Ultimate because of the reviews here. I received my machine and book in November 2004 and have only purchased 2 loaves of bread since then(both were baguettes).I was interested in bread baking and don't have that much time so I bought a bread machine and this book. I don't regret the purchase of the machine or this book.The Maple Buttermilk was our first bread and it was fantastic. As a result I have refused to buy any sandwich bread.I have made pizza dough, wheat breads, country breads, white breads. I still have many more to try but so far everything has been a success.I have not experienced any problems with the yeast I use, which is just plain old Active Dry Yeast. I haven't had any flour problems or liquid problems and have not had to stand over my machine and watch it mix.I have used the delay timer many times so that we could have fresh bread in the morning for lunches and toast.I would also like to add that wheat gluten was very easy to find. If you can't find it your big chain supermarket you should be able to find it in your local health food store. I bought two packages and keep them in an airtight container for easy measuring and storage.Get this book you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"We got our bread machine (a Zojirushi BBCC-V20 which we are very happy with and I have reviewed on this site) and once we worked our way through the excellent owner's manual/recipe book we went searching for a good recipe book.

I use my bread machine several times a week to provide my family with a variety of fresh breads. As a working mother, I don't have time for elaborate recipes that involve making the dough in my bread maker and then putting together a special presentation for baking in a conventional oven. I need to put the ingredients in the bread maker and go on to the next job and forget it. This cookbook fills the bill admirably. I have the variety and ease of preparation that my family wants.My mother and mother-in-law both have breadmaking machines that they have put away and don't use because the final product was not worth the effort. When they have come to visit and eaten bread that I prepared using Beth Hensperger's book, they were surprised. They complained that their bread machines do not put out such good bread, and went to look at the cookbook, convinced that I had better recipes (which this book does!). Both women asked for this cookbook as a Christmas gift so that they could enjoy their bread machines again too.I recommend this book to any bread machine beginner or to anyone with a life too full to spend all day making bread."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this and did not realize that this book is NOT for a small loaf.

The first book I bought (\\"Bread Machine Magic' by Rehberg and Conway) worked fabulously, and so I was excited to try more. I found Hensperger's \\"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook\\" on the shelf with other bread machine books of my local bookstore. It stood out from the pack with such mouthwatering descriptions I could not wait to get it home and start trying it out. To my dismay, the most exciting sounding recipe turned out to be a dismal flop. I thought it might be a fluke and gave a few more recipes a try. I tried five recipes. Some rose up too high and then fell, others had poor texture, one turned out decently but was totally flavorless. This book was a real disappointment. After reading some of the reviews here I wonder, maybe if I tried the right recipe I might find one I enjoyed. However, 5 out of 5 of the loaves that came from this book weren't worth eating, and I don't want to waste the ingredients on such risky prospects. I've decided to consider the $21.95 I spent on this book as enough of a loss and I'm going to buy \\"More Bread Machine Magic\\" instead of taking another shot at this book."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"All right. I have been buying cookbooks for 30 years and I know I should have been more careful up front. BUT there are two huge problems with this cookbook. The first - the recipes for one pound loaves are almost non-existent. Presently, I have only a 1 pound machine. I am planning to buy a new machine, and it will probably be bigger, but in a two-person household, I don't need more than one pound loaves except on special occasions. I doubt that I am the rare exception here.The second problem - even more irritating than the first - the index is inadequate. I wanted to make a bread with coconut. I looked up in the Recipe Index to find recipes with coconut in it. All I found was &quot;Coconut Milk White Bread.&quot; Then I went to the General Index which gave me a page number. &quot;Toasted Coconut Bread&quot; was there. I suspect that I was really being directed to information about coconut rather than to a recipe including coconut as one of its main ingredients. &quot;Hawaiian Sweet Loaf&quot; was not listed in either place.My experience with other ingredients was the same. For aniseed I could find &quot;Anise Christmas Bread&quot; but not &quot;Moroccan Bread with Sesame and Aniseed.&quot; I love macadamia nuts, but could find no recipes listed under that entry. I did, however, find two recipes that have the nuts in it.The three stars I did give to this book are for the breadth of it. There is a wonderful assortment here. Just wish they were in one-pound recipes so I could try them. There are great appendices also.It almost makes me weep that a book so grand is also so unusable for me. Maybe in the next edition they will get it really right."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Hensperger's previous books have been gorgeous, although the recipes were complex and difficult. I was happy to see this book because I figured the recipes would finally be as friendly as the books had been. I was wrong. Many of the recipes involve difficult pre- and post- kneading processes, and use the bread machine only for the kneading. And a few of them simply did not work at all as expected. I am sure others have had much better luck than I have and I envy them because those books appeal to me so much and I hate that I can't use the recipes."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This is a great book with excellent recipes.

It is absolutely my go to guide for making bread. I use a Breadman 2200 (recently upgraded to a TR2700) and it performs flawlessly with these recipes. As is typical of these books there are way, way more recipes that I will ever use. My typical bread is the aptly described 'House Bread' near the beginning. It is simply amazing and I've made it over 100 times. Outside of that I'm made maybe 2 dozen other recipes and loved them all. There is an amazing Sunflower Millet, a Sunflower Pumpernickel, a great potato bread, Grahm flour loaf, and more.. Those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head.This may not be the newest book out there, but it is tried and true. Full of variety. Fun and interesting to read."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This book is very comprehensive. It has many recipes for all kinds of bread. If you're looking for variety in your bread machine breads, you couldn't ask for better.It's very nicely bound and laid out, and easy to read and handle. It is surprisingly inexpensive and a great value.I do have a couple of complaints that may not matter to most people, but are very significant to me.First, there are eggs in many recipes, including some for basic everyday breads. Why? Few bakeries or commercial breads routinely use eggs. I'm a vegetarian, and fooling around with egg substitutes is hardly worth the trouble.Second, each recipe is thoughtfully provided in 1 1/2 lb and 2 lb loaf versions. However, a 1 lb and 1 1/2 lb format would have made the book a winner for those of us with small machines, such as the very popular 1 lb loaf Zojirushi. Recipes on Bob's Red Mill flour bags are for 1 & 1 1/2 lbs. Small and large makes more sense than large and a bit larger. I doubt I'll often use recipes requiring me to halve 3/4 tsp and the like."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I'm a rabid bread baker and have probably tried most techniques, old and new. Just for the heck of it I bought a Zo recently and after a few mediocre attempts at some of my rustic favorites, I decided to go back to the old fashioned, labor intensive ways. I came across a few mentions of Beth's book on The Fresh Loaf website. Okay, I'll try it. Wow. Without a doubt this is the BEST bread machine reference source available. Bar none. She incorporates old and new,even ancient techniques to help achieve some really high quality breads; even sourdough starters are made easy and understandable....and they work !If you have a bread machine...this is the only book you need."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have been using bread machines since they were first introduced, and so, when I was given this cookbook, I wasn't sure that it would add anything to my repertoire. Boy, was I wrong. Beth Hensperger covers such a wide range of recipes and techniques that even veterans will be hooked. And beginners will be given a gentle lead into the world of fresh baked bread. If you drool over the specialty breads in the bakery or bread section in a high-end supermarket, you've found your cookbook, even if you're new to bread baking.Hensperger provides basic recipes for white and wheat bread; however, you can find those types of recipes anywhere. The strength of this cookbook is her expansion on the classics: Sour Cream Bread, Maple Buttermilk Bread, Vienna Bread, Three-Seed Whole Wheat Bread, Whole Wheat Challah, and Cracked Wheat Bread. She includes ethnic and country breads from around the world, multi- and whole-grain breads, sweet breads, sour doughs (including a German beer starter for rye bread), savory breads flavored by herbs and cheeses, and gluten-free. Some recipes are mixed and baked entirely within the machine while others require the dough setting for hand-shaping. (Most of the recipes can be hand-shaped, if desired.) Another note: Recipes call for vital wheat gluten, but I always omit that since my local grocery store doesn't carry it. My breads still turn out great.Many recipes are not of the load-and-walk-away variety; they require either preparation, as with a starter, or a kitchen timer, to do or add something at a specific point. Bakers who bought their machines for convenience -- to make bread while they are at work, for instance -- may find that these particular recipes are impractical. The biggest problem with the more complex recipes is that you must know your own bread machine. If an ingredient is supposed to be added, say, \\"ten minutes into the second knead cycle,\\" as is the case with brioche, then you had better know whether your machine actually kneads dough twice. For special occasions, however, the specialty breads that require a little extra work make fantastic additions to the table. And there are plenty of recipes here for the person who does not want to spend much time with preparation.If you want to branch out from the standard bread machine recipes, this book is a must-have for your kitchen. If, however, you want just a few recipes, with some variation, I suggest gettingBread Machine Magic, Revised Edition: 138 Exciting Recipes Created Especially for Use in All Types of Bread Machines.

Every bread recipe I have followed has been a success, I love it and don't imagine ever needing another bread machine book."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Great info on bread machines of all kinds, as well as ingredients you will need.

I borrowed it from the library first to try it out and now I want to buy it. there is a lot more in it than just recipes. It has her own experiences in it and little tid bits of information about each recipe and group of recipes, flours, and gluten free flours and sour dough... etc. All the recipes I have tried work for me in my cusine art bread machine. My loaves turn out better than the book the machine gave me. It even has a recipe for sour dough which hasn't tasted sour enough for me so I will be trying that again.I give this book a five star rating for being easy and informative"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Seriously, this book is one of the rare few cookbooks in our kitchen that is ALWAYS out on the kitchen counter. I have baked about one third of the recipes so far and I haven't had a single bad loaf. I had not used my bread machine for years, once I had tired of the sad few recipes that came in the little instruction booklet and tried a few terrible bread mix boxes from the supermarket. Now I have a whole shelf in my freezer full of different grains and flours and a bunch of frozen bread too. I'm purchasing 10 pound bags of flour now. Before this book, a small bag of flour used to sit in our cupboard for 6 months or more before it got used. This book really encourages you to go wild and experience the amazing variety of bread recipes. All the classic loaf types are here, plus many recipes you would never see in a supermarket bakery. Try Graham Flour Bread or a French Whole Wheat. Sadly it will ruin Quizno's or Jimmy John's for you, but think of the money you'll be saving! This book will actually make eating your lunchtime sandwich a memorable experience! I recommend spending a few bucks and getting the SAF yeast that she recommends from Amazon. It's much more cost effective than buying little jars from the supermarket. Also, invest in a dough card and a french loaf pan and try the Pain de Paris. Delicious!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"My son is using this book to make bread in his new bread making machine and he has made some great bread."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This book is great for a beginner.

He poured over it Christmas day and decided on one to try the next day. Soon our house smelled wonderful! He has since tried many other recipes in this book and all have turned out delicious. A hint I'd read in reviews, was not to use the larger measurements as the dough rises too high. So he used the one pound amounts and the loaves were perfect! Any larger and they would have been hitting the lid. One other detail is there are many recipes calling for an unusual ingredient you wouldn't normally have on hand but the majority of recipes were fine or you could easily find most ingredients at your local store."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This is an excellent cookbook for use with your bread machine.

Can't wait to try them all!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I borrowed this book atleast 20 times from the local library and every recipe I try works like magic so I am buying it now. I own a Zo and these recipes are perfect for my bread machine.1. The book does not call for any exotic ingredients, just the regular ones you can find in local grocery stores and that is what I love about it. So you can pretty much make any bread out of this book as long as you have the basic ingredients in your pantry.2. Another thing I love about this book is that, most (if not all) of the recipes call for precise measurements of flour (and other ingredients) and does not say add more flour if the dough looks sticky or wet. I usually set my bread machine on delay timer so it bakes overnight and gets ready in the morning. So I cannot wake up in the middle of the night to check the consistency of the dough. So that is another reason i love this book.3. The most amazing thing about this book is that, since it is a collection of different avid baker's favorite recipes, every bread is unique and tasty. I will highly recommend this book if you bake atleast once or twice a week."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"As an experienced baker, I find this book quite good, but not excellent. I received a Cuisinart bread machine as a gift in December 2010, and have been baking a loaf per week since then. When I first read through the book, I found many of the recipes somewhat repetitive, however I suppose that's the nature of bread making. 1/2 a cup more or less of a certain flour, or use of another oil, and the recipe can be given another name.I do like and recommend this book, as I've tried about 10 of the recieps so far, and generally the results have been good. The loaves are not always perfect but all have been good. The Three Grain bread is very good, with a lovely moist texture, and I like the black bohemian bread as well. If not for this book, I don't think I would ever have attempted to try flours other than white or whole wheat. I've now tried 3 recipes using rye flour and will shortly try spelt flour. I must say, my loaves are very very good with the vital white gluten, which I've never used. I use about 1/4 tsp of ground ginger to encourage the yeast, and never use more than a teaspoon each of salt and bread machine yeast. I'm Canadian and have never seen SAF brand yeast in my local grocery store. Fleischman's yeast gives perfect results. Unless it is dependent on the bread machine model, I don't see how using more than one teaspoon of yeast helps the bread. My loaves rise very well.I would like to encourage the uncerain users of this book to modify the recipes if needed. Change the type of oil, sweetener, margarine to butter, milk to water, etc . What is important to the result are the proportions, and the properties of the bread you want to emphasize. I don't drink milk, so I rarelyhave it home. I'll substitute some 10% coffee cream plus water for milk, sunflower oil to canola, and so forth. Good luck to everyone."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"The book has a large variety of recipes and a lot of good information for people just learning how to make bread.

(I was using my mom's from the 90s until it recently died on me. I purchased a new one shortly after I got this book.) I first checked it out from our local library. As soon as I scanned through it I knew it would be worth the purchase. It has an extensive list of recipes and great suggestions on how to problem solve issues. This cookbook, along with SAF yeast has made a WORLD of difference in the bread that my machine makes. As a side note, I was also excited to find an easy Naann recipe."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this book after every other recipe I tried in my bread machine had a 50/50 chance of working out. I live at almost 7,000 ft. above sea level so there is some guess work involved. With \\"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook\\" every recipe I have tried has turned out beautifully. The author includes a chart on possible recipe tweaks to ensure success at high altitude. So far just about 1 tablespoon of gluten per cup of flour and an extra 1/4 teaspoon of salt have done the trick.There are many other helpful charts and tricks that she offers throughout the book. I have enjoyed reading through this cookbook and it has helped me become a more confident bread machine baker. Also, you don't want to skip over the jams/chutneys section. You can easily make a quick, delicious jam with minimal effort using your bread machine. This is probably the only bread machine cookbook I will ever need."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I received this book this past Christmas from my parents, to accompany the bread machine that they bought me. These two items combined are by far the best gift I've ever gotten. I've been baking my way through my winter break (on break from grad school until next week) with this book and have yet to be disappointed. I really enjoy the wide variety of breads that Hensperger includes in the book, and the fact that I was able to utilize the jar of ground cardamom spice that my brother gave me for Christmas. The Cardamom Tea Bread and Cardamom Easter Braid both turned out fantastic (the latter, particularly, is AMAZING as a dessert with a little Nutella spread on it). I also really love the English Muffin and Egg Bagel recipes - I just literally took my bagels out of the oven and they are delicious and moist and the perfect size.My only complaint is that I have a 1 pound bread machine, and 98% of the recipes are for 1 1/2 or 2 pound loaves. Of course you can just cut the 2 pound recipes in half (which is what I've been doing), but that can get tricky with some of the awkward measurements (like how do you cut 7/8 of a cup in half? Or one egg?). So for your next book, Beth, I'd say please include more 1 pound recipes!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have used a bread machine for years and have made bread on a weekly basis most of my life as has my mother before me. I own or have read nearly every bread machine cookbook out there but Beth Hensperger's text is far and above the rest. The recipes are clear, consistently good and logical. There is a breadth of variety as well as detail (should you want it) into how different ingredients work together. There are plenty of basics for the novice baker, yet enough to hold the interest of the more experienced. She also includes lots of additional recipes for bread accompaniments such as Hot Artichoke Dip, Goat Cheese Butter, and Whipped Honey Butter. This is one volume that every baker (bread machine or not) should have in his/her library."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I haven't tried every recipe yet, but the ones I have made all work wonderfully in my bread machine.

Nothing frustrates me more than bad tasting food made from ingredients purchased with my hard-earned money. Thankfully, this author is surprisingly thorough and I've found her recipes to be dependable. Even if you're an experienced professional baker, a bread machine is not a common oven; you simply won't know everything the author has to share about the subject of baking with a bread machine. The first chapter orients you to the subject, even if you've never baked bread before. She carefully walks you through the steps to make your first load of bread in your bread machine. By the time the chapter ends, you will have confidence to take on recipes for other types of bread -- many of which I've always thought I would rather buy than make myself. This alone was worth the price of the book. The saddest part is that I visit my local market's Bakery department a lot less, but now I get to enjoy the smell of bread for hours as my bread machine toils throughout the process."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I just bought the Zojirushi 1 lb. bread machine and the few recipes included with it have come out really good. But wanting more, I borrowed this book from the library to review before purchasing. It's a fantastic book but only has a few recipes devoted to 1 lb. loaves. Sometimes it's difficult to halve a 2 lb. recipe easily/successfully, especially if you're an inexperienced bread maker, but I was able to do that with a few of particular interest.

I'm glad I did, because the number of recipes that came with the breadmaker was appallingly slim.I've made several types and they've all come out great. Be warned, however, that most of the recipes ask for gluten, so if you don't have some, get it. It's easily available in your grocer's baking aisle. And the \\"Orientation\\" section is a good read if you are new to making bread in a machine. She also includes a chart to convert measuring cups to weights for measuring ingredients (and after doing weighed amounts for flour for my last couple of loaves I highly recommend picking up a small digital kitchen scale and using it in your baking).Some notes:- I made the Dutch Sugar Bread and it was AMAZING, but the cubes did scratch the corners of my bread pan. This is my fault; the author warned that she's heard of this happening. It does not appear to have affected the non-stick nature of the pan, but I will be more careful next time. Of course, I also didn't get the little gooey pockets of sugar, so I might just use granulated or totally crushed sugar cubes next time. But the flavor was out of this world!- Under pizza dough, she has 1 and 2lb recipes. Unless you have a giant pizza stone, make the smaller batch. I only have a 12\\" stone, and my last two crusts have turned out impossibly thick, almost like deep-dish. Incredibly good, but very thick. I thought this might be because of the rise period after you turn out the dough, but now I'm thinking that I've got too much dough for my stone.- There is no recipe for cinnamon raisin bread, which I find almost unbelievable. But there are recipes for raisin bread, so I'm sure you can add cinnamon to taste. But still - that's such a staple bread (IMO) that I can't believe it's missing.But well worth the purchase and a really good reference."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have been able to try several of the receipes from this book and ALL are without fail.

So many people own bread makers and don't know how to use them except with the expensive mixes you buy in the store. Using a breadmaker requires slightly different proportions of dry-to-wet ingredients and this can make using a regular recipe either a) a lumpy disaster or b) nothing special.If you are a foodie who really enjoys being able to control what goes into your food, this book opens up a world of opportunities regarding bread. The author includes sweet breads, sourdough and country breads, no-gluten recipes, recipes that include unusual flours like chickpea, chestnut and buckwhat. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

The recipes are great and so is her advice but I feel like the book is poorly laid out and I resent that she only gives you measurements in volume when weight is universally recognized as a superior way to measure for baking. I find the book hard to use too. Her dinner roll recipe (which is awesome) and alternative directions to rolling out the dough are in two different places in the book but she doesn't give a page number to finding the rolling directions. Finally I wrote the page to the alternate rolling directions on the recipe page. She should have done that for me. I find it difficult to find a recipe even the ones I know are in the book. Nothing is given its rightful name. Pulla is called Cardamon Easter Braid. Why couldn't she just call it Pulla like everyone else so I could look it up in the index? With the measurement issue, I am new to baking and I can't tell yet if a loaf needs more water or more flour just by looking at it. It is better for me to have exact measurements as I learn and develop an eye. When I started out on this hobby I bought a scale to insure that I would have my measurements exact but with Hensperger's recipes I have to convert the measurements myself. It can be confusing too. Some bread flour conversion charts differ from others too. She does give conversion advice (not per a recipe but in a separate section) but it is cumbersome to stop and do the math. My ADD kicks in and it is so easy for me to make a mistake. Weighing is so much easier too and so much less messy. She has a great chapter on dough enhancers and she does give directions to use commercially bought \\"dough enhancer\\" on a few recipes but I wish she had given advice for which dough enhancer one could use on each of her recipes as an option and how it would change the results. I have used that new Red Star yeast with dough enhancers and was impressed but it is way too expensive. I bought some of the dough enhancer ingredient listed (lecithin, barley malt, ascorbic acid) in Hensperger's book but I wish I knew exactly which ones should (or even could be) used in each recipe. Again that information would have been so easy to give. According to her most loaves can use at least one of the big three of lecithin, malt or ascorbic acid. They make the dough more forgiving. If she had tied her advice to each recipe it would have been more relevant and easier to absorb completely. For all I know this is the best book out there. I only own a few and this one is the most comprehensive. At least she talked about the enhancers. None of her recipes have failed (which is huge) but I wish this book contained more information. If anyone knows a bread cook book that give weight as well as volume and with recommendations of dough enhancers to use with each recipe, I would love to know so I could buy it."},{"Title":"Valley of decision","review":"This opus is nothing more than a pamphlet consisting of cut and paste, quotes from others and lists of organizations and government agencies.

A total waste of money."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"This is the first compilation of the Birds of Prey series by Gail Simone. This set introduces the inclusion of the Huntress into the BoP group. Black Canary is kidnapped during a mission gone wrong, and Oracle (Barbara Gordon)is forced to rely on the Huntress to help rescue her. Gail Simone's writing is the hook to this series. Ed Benes' artwork is fantastic (see his work on JLA). Some don't like it, but you have to remember; which demographic is the largest purchaser of comics?I think that pretty much sums it up. I have purchased 3 books in this series so far, and will get the entire series, as well as now receiving the new volume."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"Yep, I'm a feminist that reads comics. I first associated with the three leading ladies through Batman, Justice League Unlimited, and other random sources online and via Cartoon Network. Huntress is her lovable, violent self, while Black Canary is every bit as fiesty and fun as she always is. Ladies, just because there is cheesecake doesn't mean you can't read it! This stuff is full of empowering, well-written female characters and I highly encourage you to pick it up. Gail Simone, now writing Wonderwoman, is a fantastic writer that emulates the ways of womanhood perfectly; \\"700 sit-ups a day.\\" She captures the essence of feminism and strength while the artist keeps the story appealing to men as well. It is rare that something this good comes along in the history of women protagonists and while I love Supergirl, her skinny blonde self can't hold a candle to these fierce ladies!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"This book begins with a mystery for the birds of prey to solve.

I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"So I love stories about strong women. Buffy would be my favorite because she is strong, smart, and kicks butt. And she is drawn like a real woman not a playboy model. Birds of Prey and most other comics like it are a slap in the face to women. I would love to read more stories about strong females, especially super heroines, but how can I focus on the story when in every single panel these women look more like porn stars than heroes. It's sad that so many men ignore the fact that women are not sex objects but real people. These men continue to draw Batgirl and Wonder Women and Power Girl with huge breasts and almost no clothing. It would be nice to see a comic book super heroine taken seriously for once. Why are men not degraded like this? I don't see Batman in a speedo or Superman with his costume being torn off to bits. I would love to see a great comic about a fully clothed Huntress or Electra. I love these characters but sadly I cannot bring myself to purchase anymore of this crap. How can anyone take these women seriously? Yes, they are powerful and smart but they look like Penthouse centerfolds. Its distasteful and disrespectful. Thank God for Joss Whedon. If not for Buffy I would have nothing to read. And I love comics. The story in this book is not good enough to overlook the way these women are portrayed."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"If you love the art of Ed Benes then this comic TPB is for you... as long as you can put-up with all of the girl-to-girl talk, gourmet food eating, baby-hugging, gourmet food eating, conversations about boys, gourmet food eating, conversations about PMS and all the other garbage that Gail Simone put into this comic. The Birds of Prey are great characters and a lot can be done with them; I really mean that. So, to watch any satisfying potential journey they could be sent on be relegated down to this cookie-cutter, selfish trash is very disappointing. The story was somewhat clever and showed astute thinking and awareness yet just as left-brained, animalistic, macho nonsense can and should be transcended to a higher form of art (in film, comics, daily life, etc.) so should the type of \\"feel-good,\\" blanket-cuddling, effeminate self-indulgence found within this story. What a let-down. Next time, make the story genuinely fun and accurate to the DC world of comics; that's what it should be grounded in. Not mere usage of several DC heroes thrown into a day-time soap opera. The story doesn't have to be a Jeph Loeb or Bob Harras rip-off, but the journey the reader is taken on should be satisfying and grounded in the accurate personas of the characters, as if in a story that really is taking place somewhere involving the Heroes we love."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"The quality of paper is very bad, artwork of ed benes is very ordinary and nothing special.

There are better old and new DCs like Superman: Man of Steel one and two , but this is Gail Simone's work you NEED to have to read Sensei and Student."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"A strong first outing for Gail Simone and Ed Benes on this title. Simone injects a wry sense of humor and everyday, real-life details (like where to eat dinner) into a skillfully plotted and BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN book. The twists of story are compelling but character-driven, like how far Oracle is willing to go to protect Black Canary from further harm. I especially enjoyed the way Simone brought Huntress--the Bat family's resident outsider--into the fold and gave readers some wonderful and unexpected moments where we see her as more than just a callous enforcer.The book also includes some brief but illuminating appearances by Nightwing and Batgirl, and though you never see him, the shadow of Batman looms large over this book, which is I think an appropriate homage to the character, but also reveals how central to the lives of all his allies he must be.The villain Savant is an excellent foil for both the brains (Oracle) and the brawn (Black Canary and Huntress) of the Birds of Prey. His sociopathy and short-term memory loss make him unpredicatble enough to be scary, though I would like to know more about his past--which I assume will be revealed in subsequent books.My one complaint is not specific to this book but rather the Bat-world in general: why do they bother to put people in Arkham Asylum if they ALWAYS escape?A great read. BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"Birds of Prey are a team of women who prove that they are just as good, if not better, than the male superheroes of the DC universe.Gail Simone, the genius writer of BoP, writes these three woman (Oracle, Huntress and Black Canary) as not just a team of superheroes but as real women. While these women can kick all kinds of supervillian ass, they also come across as real women because they joke, laugh, talk about guys, fall in and out of love and discuss their feelings. It's a refreshing change from the majority of women superheroes who are drawn with large breasts and very little emotion. The story arc in this TPB is also very gripping as Black Canary is captured by an insane information broker (and blackmailer) named Savant while Oracle and Huntress do whatever they can possibly do to rescue her.If you're looking for a fun and entertaining read, Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds is the book for you."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"Never read a BoP before but I'm hooked now! The story was engaging and fast paced (it does taper off a little towards the end). The art was good - Huntress was especially well drawn, though unfortunately, the book really isn't about her.The concept for the villian was cool. I instantly liked and despised him and that, really, is the most important part of any good superhero story....The story also raises moral/ethical issues that are relevent to our time. It doesn't beat you over the head with them and it doesn't preach - nice balance there.All in all, a good, fun read. I just ordered the next BoP tpb..."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"I'm currently reving up for a review of the recently released DVD set of thetelevision seriesof this extremely underrated DC comic property and I thought I'd share my thoughts on the source material first. \\"Birds of Prey\\" follows the post-Killing Jokeexploits of Barbara Gordon: former Batgirl and current paraplegic. Most crimefighters would slow down after receiving a bullet in the spine. Babs kicked it up about ten notches. Commissioner Jim Gordon's daughter became The Oracle, the world's most powerful hacker able to bend nearly every electrical system and network on Earth to her will. She's the go-to girl for any number of superheroes and vigilantes -including The Dark Knight himself- when they need an all-seeing eye for backup. Justice League co-founder Dinah Lance aka The Black Canary was down on her luck and aimless until she got a special delivery in the form of a pair of earrings. These put her in contact with Oracle and the two have been partners ever since. Canary does the legwork and travels around the world performing acts of espionage and rescue while Oracle runs the show. The two never even met face-to-face for a very long time. Those were the old days. Now, Dinah and Barbara are close friends and the danger is right in their own backyard. Gotham's got a new player who fancies he can out-think The Oracle and out-fight The Black Canary and he's got a grudge that needs serving.Contrary to the \\"Volume 1\\" title, this is not even close to the beginning of the BOP storyline (it compiles issues 56-59 of the series and there were several stand-alones prior to issue 1), but this the best that I've read so far and a fantastic place to start for anybody who's curious about DC's finest superheroine team. The art is beautiful, the writing top-notch with loads of humor and a whole heap of bada$z on top of it. Women will enjoy the quippy girl-talk and female independence theme and men will love the violence and gorgeous character art. The villain in this arc is Savant, an incredibly talented wannabe vigilante inspired by Batman who -after being severely reprimanded by The Caped Crusader in an inspired moment that flawlessly illustrates the difference between a true hero and a self-absorbed attention hound- decides to take his frustrations out on the one person who knows everything, The Oracle. Having captured Black Canary after a hell of a fight that leaves Dinah without her powerful sonic Canary Cry, Savant offers Barbara a deal: her partner for Batman's identity. Entering the storyline at this point is hot-headed Gotham loose cannon The Huntress, daughter of a slain mob boss and crimefighter extraordinaire. Barbara has always had an odd dislike for Huntress, but she's forced to put that aside and invite her into the fold for Dinah's sake. Savant does have one weakness: a kind of time dyslexia where he knows what has happened, but he has no idea WHEN. An interesting trait. So in addition to great art and fantastic dialogue the story is strong and the cast of characters is great. Sold yet?There are also strong political overtones in this story that were echoed inThe Dark Knightmovie about the danger of one person having unlimited power to intrude on other people's privacy. Barbara and Dinah clash over this as Oracle seeks to dispense her own justice using files on corruption in high places that she stole from Savant's blackmailing operation. Due process or swift justice? It's a great debate and one more thing I love about this book. Black Canary is my favorite comic superheroine, Oracle is a truly unique and powerful character in ways Batgirl could never be, and Huntress is just hardcore. The Birds of Prey make for a great team-up comic and I strongly recommend \\"Of Like Minds\\" to anybody who isn't opposed to the notion of girls who kick tail. This is as good as comic books get."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"This volume is the start of writer Gail Simone's long run on the Birds of Prey. She picks an interesting way to start, veteran heroine Black Canary is beaten, kidnapped and handcuffed to a bed so a psychotic villain can blackmail her partner the computer expert Oracle. Initially it sounds like the sort of misogynistic plot she once mocked with her famous 'Women in Refrigerators' essay.But she inverts the cliches, Black Canary, Oracle and their new partner Huntress eventually manage to turn the table on their foes. But it's not that easy, there are tense fights, scary threats and an interesting new foe -- Savant. Savant is more interesting than the usual villain, his mental problems are written more realistically than the usual psycho and his origins are a bit more three-dimensional.Artist Ed Benes has some problems, he basically draws one face for men, one for women and reuses them throughout the book. Black Canary and Huntress are saddled with some of the most impractical and ridiculous costumes in comics and Benes' love of T&A; doesn't help. But he does good action, decent expressions and keeps the book moving.It's worth a read."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"The star of the show is certainly Gail Simones writing, there is nobody working in US comics today who writes better female characters and more enjoyable dialog in general. The artwork is very capable and slick, though tending towards the cheesecake poses rather too often.If you like well made US superhero comics then you will like this."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"This should collect issues 56 through 59 of Birds of Prey, and that being the case, this doesn't cover the story where Huntress investigates the religious cult and meets Vixen (that would be Between Dark & Dawn). Instead, it deals with blackmail and intrigue.These are the first issues of BOP in which Gail Simone has taking over writing duties and served as a jumping-on point for many readers, including me. The book has never been this good. Whereas the series meandered before, it has now become an ongoing story. There is action, humor, great characters, and usually great art (there have been a few filler artists during Gail's run which is still ongoing in issues numbered in the 90s). Gail has also taken steps to add Huntress to the regular cast. She is a favorite of mine, and I'm glad she's here.This is the first two graphic novels to feature art primarily by Ed Benes. Few people draw the female form as well as Benes. You'll either love him or hate him, depending on your feelings for \\"good girl\\" art."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"I am an avid collector of comics and have always been a fan of Birds Of Prey. Currently their New 52 reboot is rubbish, mostly due to sub-par artwork. The team of Gail Simone on writing and Ed Benes on pencils is a dream, say what you will about Benes, but his women are anatomically correct (even though a bit exaggerated). This type of artwork is dying in the comic book industry today, due to feminist ideals. I wont go into it, but if you want LBGT and androgynous females in your comics, then run off and buy Batwoman. However, if you want the older stuff, that wasn't afraid to show females looking like females (whilst still being empowered and strong), and men looking looking like men, then this is as perfect as it gets."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"Women and comics don't exactly go well together. The first iconic male character was probably Superman, while the first iconic female character was probably Lois Lane (at least until Wonder Woman showed up). Personally, I prefer avoiding mainstream comics about female characters. Not because I can't relate to women, or I think that women can't kick ass as well as men can, because anyone who believes either of those needs to grow up. I avoid them because usually their written by people who do believe those two things. Despite stereotypes dying out quickly, a lot of comic readers have been, at some point or another, lonely male teenagers (including myself in those years). As a result, they often grow up to write comics and usually never grow out of that trait. So, when I'm looking at a book about female characters, chances are its going to be written by someone who barely knows what he's doing.Thank the Lord we have Gail Simone. Her knack for character development and dense plotting make Birds of Prey an excellent series that proves that female characters can be written well, and be as effective as any male team. This is a must read for fans of superhero comics.Birds of Prey operates mostly as co-vert, almost Charlie's Angels-esque team set-up, with ring leader and information broker, Oracle (the former Batgirl, Barbara Gordon), uses her knowledge of computers and hacking to deploy various agents across the DC universe, but mostly dealing with JSA member Black Canary, and rogue Gotham vigilante, the Huntress. All pillars of the ideal three person team are represented, but never come across as stereotypes or even archetypes. They come across as real people. Oracle is the de facto leader with an excellent knack for strategy and planning, in addition to anxiety issues of her own, given her long history and personal feelings about being in a wheelchair while her friends go out fight. Black Canary is the confident, daring, always prepared field agent, who doubles as supportive friend to Oracle. Huntress is the impulsive, hard-boiled badass, who definitely is the odd woman out on the team, but senses a belonging that is mutual with the other members. The team dynamic is nailed perfectly.Also helping is Simone's dialogue, which is lively and clever without being forced or bizarre (most of the time anyway). While there are occasional clunky lines, most of it really does come through. Simone was a hairdresser before she was a writer, and it actually shows as she has a perfect understanding of how people (especially women) talk to each other casually. It's the quiet moments that really make the book work. They serve as excellent moments of character development, as opposed to forced drama that comes from lame plot contrivances.And so we finally come to the art. Oh boy... Remember when I said I greatly admired the book for having strong, intelligent, independent female characters, who didn't fall victim to stereotypes, or rely to heavily on sex appeal to make male readers notice them. That is kind of undercut once we get to the art. The artist is Ed Benes. His style is something I have a number of problems with, including bizarre anatomy, clunky transitions, and a few of moments of lazy attention to detail. But no, the real problem is that comics are a collaborative form for the most part, and while Gail Simone may understand that this is a book about strong female characters, Ed Benes still thinks it's a pin-up catalogue. He fortunately doesn't go too overboard with the poses, but he is very careful about making you take the extra minute to admire Black Canary's rump, or Hunterss's chest. I guess the mentality of having a book with strong female characters, who additionally look like waitresses at Hooters is a solid enough settlement, but I still groan after people who see me reading give me a face like I'm a pig, and I have to explain that I'm reading for the characters.Despite the flaws with artwork, Birds of Prey is still worth your money. Its plots are engaging, and its characters are always a pleasure to read, whether they be kicking cyperterrorist ass, or eating Chinese food so amazing a whole page is dedicated to eat.- A Review by Jay Shapiro"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey, Vol. 1: Of Like Minds","review":"People were not kidding when they told me how great Gail Simone's writing is.

It is written in a very easy going style, like one of the authors was standing behind you as you tackled the next phase of your project, which I myself appreciated. With the aid of this book, I finished the new trunk and was happy with the outcome.

The translation from the Italian is brilliant and the photographs, illustration and drawings really augment the fine text. We read about the start of modern science, how the great minds created experiments, what they thought, what they did and how their discoveries affected both them and future generations.This work and its companion (&quot;From X-Rays to Quarks&quot;) should be required reading for all high-school science students. They learn that science is not some theoretical exercise but involves working with the materials of the Earth. One of the fortunate accidental consequences of science is that we have discovered that by using matter and energy in unique ways, our lives can be more abundant and easier.ALl the great names are here - Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Watts, Helmholtz. More and more emphasis is given over to science and its meaning in society. The philosophy of science and its practices are debated even as research and experimentation continue unabated. The pace at which science advanced - from dropping balls from a tower to theorizing on the nature of matter and gravity itself - was contained within a relatively short period. And, as we now see, that pace only increases in time."},{"Title":"From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves","review":"Covering the lives of all the great physicists, from Galileo and Newton to Helmholtz, this book is an excelent read for students and any just interested.

This 1942 book introduces readers to the new chemical called a detergent. It can affect the oil on a duck's feathers so a duck will no longer float on the water. Perry Mason and Della Street are on a vacation in Palm Springs when John L. Witherspoon asks for advice regarding his daughter Lois. Mr. Witherspoon disapproves of his daughter's boyfriend Marvin, and wants to end their romance. This requires Mason to re-investigate the trial of Marvin's father. Another private detective had done this; but he is found dead by poison. Mr. Witherspoon has visitors at his ranch. Later the bedridden Mr. Burr is found dead by the same poison. There are complications arising from that 18-year old murder trial, and the unknown \\"Miss X\\" of that time. Coincidences pop up among the characters in this story.Chapter 17 points out the fickleness of public opinion. Marvin was president of his class, editor of the school paper. Popular and successful in college, and well-liked. But if they find out his father was a convicted murderer, what then? John L. Witherspoon retained the best local trial lawyer in the valley. The Preliminary Hearing in Chapter 19 presents a \\"locked room murder\\" of Mr. Burr. Paul Drake's investigations reveal new facts. Mason is hired by Witherspoon and begins cross-examining witnesses. In a meeting in the Judge's chambers Mason draws the connections from the known facts to point to a solution of the murders. Perry and Della continue their vacation at a new location.

I was not disappointed ! Greg Harvey has taken a very complex trilogy, and along with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, managed to put together an enjoyable and easily readable book which explores all the many facets of Tolkien's world and the characters in it. In the humorous and entertaining style of all the &quot;Dummies&quot; books, we are treated to detailed explanations of the places, beings, and beasts which inhabit the very imaginative mind of the greatest author of the 20th century. If this wasn't enough, Mr. Harvey goes into great detail about the underlying themes in the books, the motivations of the characters, and how the story is relative to our modern world. Touching on philosophy and religion, themes of friendship, good vs. evil, love and loyalty, human frailty, lust for greed and power --- it's all here, and in an intelligent, unbiased presentation. Not too hard to understand or follow, and not &quot;dumbed down&quot; for the lowest common denominator. A superb book that will entertain and provoke you to think. Not at all for dummies ! You'll be glad you bought a copy --- you won't be disappointed. Money well spent for the Tolkien fan !!!"},{"Title":"The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies (For Dummies (Lifestyles Paperback))","review":"The well-established Dummies format, with its lists and charts and boxed tips, is fine for negotiating your way around a computer program, but to treat Tolkien this way makes his work as bloodless as a computer program. It also falsifies Tolkien's subcreation to treat it so dogmatically. This book, like Michael Perry's \\"Untangling Tolkien\\" and Michael Stanton's \\"Hobbits, Elves and Wizards\\" before it, is all \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and a little \\"Silmarillion\\"; it doesn't engage with \\"The History of Middle-earth\\" at all. The obligatory cartoons by Rich Tennant are amusing, though Patrick Wynne could have done much better, both in art and humor.Fortunately Harvey has a better grip on the internal facts of Middle-earth than either Perry or Stanton, his speculations though somewhat wayward are less voluminous than Perry's, and he's also by far the best writer of the three. So this book will do the reader very little harm, especially as nobody to whom its facts would be plot spoilers could possibly get through its doggedness. Harvey does shine in his final chapter, where he lists ten differences between the book and the first two Jackson films, astutely noting how these affect characterization and plot emphasis."},{"Title":"The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies (For Dummies (Lifestyles Paperback))","review":"If you have read and thoroughly understood *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Silmarillion* and have already delved into the origins of Tolkien's world, then you probably won't find this book very helpful. However, if you are fairly new to Tolkien's world and are looking to get deeper into the mythology of Middle-earth, this is a great place to begin. Greg Harvey brings his own background as a scholar of language and myth to provide the reader with a solid (if somewhat sketchy) look at how Middle-earth came into being as well as a handy guide to places, characters, races, and events.I did find a few errors along the way, and some of the author's interpretations may surprise you as they conflict with what other Tolkien scholars have written over the years. At any rate, contrary to what some might feel, there is a lot to know about Tolkien's creation that can't be gleaned from \\"just reading the books.\\" A basic grasp of the story's real-world mythological and historical roots is endlessly valuable if you want to increase your enjoyment of the novels.Buy this book if A) you loved the movies and are getting ready to read the novels, B) you've read the books and were confused by some of Tolkien's literary and mythological allusions, or C) you own a copy of *The Silmarillion* and couldn't get past the first twenty or so pages."},{"Title":"The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies (For Dummies (Lifestyles Paperback))","review":"I agree with the various reviewers below who say this a wonderful book, especially for beginners. It has been very useful to me in a number of ways. However, I have a major caveat:THERE ARE ERRORS IN THIS BOOK. Just one example, to keep this review short: Harvey says on page 92 that the name &quot;Aragorn&quot; means &quot;Lord of the Trees&quot; when Tolkien's letter #347 says specifically that it does NOT. (Similarly, on Harvey's website, he also says that the sword &quot;Narsil&quot; means &quot;Red Flame,&quot; when in the same letter Tolkien says that while &quot;nar&quot; is fire, the &quot;sil&quot; refers to a white light). When I find a very obvious error like this, I worry about how many more there might be and indeed there are other mistakes as well.I feel sad about this criticism, because Harvey is such an open, generous writer, completely respecting Tolkien's Catholic faith (and any reader of the whole corpus, including the Silmarillion, letters, etc. will see how deeply Catholic the work itself is) while not holding it himself - very refreshing.So three stars for being an awesome resource for beginners, but for those care deeply about Tolkien and are looking for accuracy, readers need to know that they need to double-check the facts before taking anything Harvey says as &quot;gospel.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies (For Dummies (Lifestyles Paperback))","review":"What a fascinating approach to the great depth of Tolkien's wonderful world! I grew up reading and rereading Lord of the Rings. His works inspired me to a great love of the Histories and Mythologies of Great Britain. But it has been many years since I have had the leisure to pour over his detailed histories, and indeed, some of the Lost and Unfinished Tales can be heavy reading. Therefore, I was intrigued to find a quick reference book in the familiar \\"dummies\\" format. And after reading through it, I am pleased to find any concerns that this might trivialize Tolkien's books were unfounded. On the contrary, Mr. Harvey approaches these works with great knowledge and respect. His observations are often informative and open more doors of ideas and learning. Yet all of this is presented lightly with deceptive ease and humor.

There are tons of editing mistakes. In one chapter about the Vala, the author refers to a section about Melkor repeatedly. When one seeks out this section it is nowhere to be found.

How can we write an accurate book about the origins of Middle-Earth and completely ignore Tolkien's opinions and thoughts?

Even as a committed Buddhist the author without a hint of any skepticism reveals the central role of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection to not only the life outlook of Tolkien but to the world view of the inhabitants of middle earth. I think his best verse that describes the common angst shared by the people of middle earth and us can be found on pg. 231 of Chapter 16: \\"Tolkien may be trying to give us a way to hear the Music of Creation and thereby know its Composer.

It made clear some things I was fuzzy about, such as why the three Elven rings are not evil. It is flawed only by the author's pathetic political correctness.

Other authors using Tolkien's works as a springboard for religious conversation entitle their books accordingly. If I buy a book called, 'Finding God in the Lord of the Rings,' I know what to expect. Not so with Harvey. Better to call the book, 'Finding Comparative Religion and Philosophy in Tolkien's Middle-earth.' Harvey calls his approach 'hermeneutics', which is as useful to the analysis of Middle-earth themes as a bicycle is to a fish and serves to tarnish the bright silver themes Tolkien wove into the narrative.To better understand Tolkien's themes, read Tolkien's letters. Harvey drops hints throughout the book, reaching his thematic climax on pg. 232, second paragraph. In trying to write an essay open to all, he dilutes his argument fatally.Buy this book for the evocative cover, or the well-written and valuable arrangement of information about Tolkien's people, places, and things. The charts and illustrations will illuminate the character relationships and Middle-earth geography. It does all that VERY VERY WELL!!!

There are tons of great books about Tolkien and Middle-Earth. Don't resort to this one.The author has a fascination for comparing Tolkien's work to myths, legends, and Greek tragedies. I mean, can't Tolkien's writing stand on its own? Do you really have to compare it to something else to appreciate its deep meaning? This author isn't very free-thinking. Well, there is a lot of what-do-you-think-this-means-to-you, but too much of to-me-this-means-this. I want to hear more Tolkien's point of view, why he wrote this, what it means to HIM not to the author. Write about the characters themselves, and leave out your own opinions.The view he takes of some of the characters is plainly uneducated. Take Eowyn, for example. He basically says he wishes she had stayed \\"with the guys\\" instead of responding to her beautiful calling as a healer and lover of all growing things. And Faramir: he says he's feminine just because he's a very sensitive person and says thought-provoking things. C'mon! THIS GUY IS NOT FEMININE! He refused the Ring, for starters, and rides off to war all the time as a leader of men. Faramir is one of the greatest, most noble characters in the book.So if you're new to LOTR, do not buy this book. You won't have to look far to find better commentaries on Tolkien's work. If you're a long time LOTR fan, know the books like the back of your hand, and have all your ideas concerning it straight, buy this book only to criticize it.

The Eagles Brood, the third of the series is a wonderful 300 page book - padded into a 600 page book.The story line follows the previous books, but it is too much of a good thing. The details of life during that time were well and exhustingly explained in the first two books. We don't need the detail all over again. The book is over populated with insidental characters that are presented as major figures who then are quickly killed off or just left out of the ensueing narrative.

Without their law and their trading network, towns crumble, and people war on their neighbors just to stay alive. Through this difficult time, Merlyn and his cousin Uther reach maturity, as defenders of Camulod and as leaders of their people. Uther eventually loses sight of what's best for Camulod, and loses most of his men in one massacre after another. Meanwhile, Merlyn recovers his memory after having had amnesia for two years, and discovers that the common people now regard Uther as little more than another villain. Merlyn tracks Uther down, only to find he and Ygraine are dead, and he senses their child Arthur will become the great unifying leader his people need. During the book, an interesting means is found to have King Vortigern of Northumbria relate his rationale for inviting Saxons to defend his holdings, a fact which will doubtless lead to difficulties in the next volume. The author also creates a couple of ! ! the most uniquely drawn and oily villians I have ever encountered...their specialty is assasination, and their skills are simply amazing. On the minus side, I found some of the coincidences a bit of a stretch (Lady Ygraine turns out to be the sister of a man Merlyn has taken captive, who turns out to be the brother of the mute girl Merlyn has married, and they are all the children of the High King of Ireland, etc.) There are also a couple of continuity lapses, but they don't affect the storyline.

I do feel that one should read the series in order to get the full impact of the story. It does, after all, begin with SKYSTONE. This book kept me up late several nights simply because I couldn't leave it alone. The plot is rich with history and details that make you want to read more about the time this occurred. The characters are fully developed and have personalities (seen through the eyes of the storyteller) that are colorful and have a depth that makes them real people: you know them. You care for them and what happens to them. This is a magnificent saga. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys history, historical fiction, or just a real good story."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Jack Whyte achieves a mildly unsatisfying semi-closure in The Eagle's Brood. In an apparent attempt to tidy up the landscape before Arthur's arrival, he manages to kill off most of the characters from the first three books, including a sexually perverted Uther. At least, I hope Uther is dead. On the positive side, The Eagle's Brood is fast-paced and entertaining, and it promises more of the same in subsequent books. However, Whyte is beginning to demonstrate that he is assuredly not Mary Stewart, Parke Godwin, Stephen Lawhead, or Bernard Cornwell. If he wishes to join such august company, he needs to do a better job with continuity and cut down on the sordid sex and violence. The Arthurian legend is a more than adequate vehicle to propel a good writer like Whyte in to a truly exceptional author. So, Jack, get with it! Let's see a compelling and exciting transition to the life of Arthur. And please, no psychological baggage!"},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"This is one of my brother's favorite authors. He was thrilled that we got this for him.

If you are planning to read the entire series,this is an important bridge between the earlier times of the Roman occupation and the first emergence of Arthur,as a baby.Now for number four-The Saxon Shore."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Enjoyable reading.

I thought the balance between tender romance, gory battle, and perperual tragedy was wonderful."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"This book (#3) in the series is a good tie in from the Roman occupation of Britian and the establishment of all characters that lead the factions to gain control of it. The fictional story examines the origins of Camelot, Merlyn and eventually Arthur. It does it with a realism without magic and sorcery that makes the story possible. A very good series and a good book."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"I forget how I came upon this series of books but I can tell you that once you start you will not be able to put the books down. This Canadian author must have travelled back in time to be able to write so discriptively and knowledgeably. The series begins just shortly after the Romans leave Great Britain and continues on through the life of Merlin and on through the early years of young Arthur. I cannot begin to tell you how enjoyable this series of books are....a must read."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"This is the third in the series of novels called the Camulod Chronicles. If this is your introduction to the series, you will benefit from taking them in order, beginning with 'The Skystone,' although the books will stand alone.This book introduces us to a young Caius Merlyn Britannicus and the adventures he has growing up. The plot is complex, one adventure leading to another. The characterization is excellent, and the book held me enthralled. In the end, of course, since this is the story of Merlyn and Arthur, he meets his ward.Jack Whyte, like Mary Stewart and Bernard Cornwell, has done his research well--such research as is available. Each wrote a fascinating series, and each approached their subjects from a different viewpoint, of course. It is, after all, fiction. John Steinbeck also wrote a book on the subject: The 'Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights,' deriving his material from one of the earliest sources, Thomas Mallory.All are worthy and entertaining. My advice would be to read and enjoy all of them, which I have.Joseph Pierre,Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Jack Whyte is a master at imparting historical data in gut-gripping fiction, even if you're not a fan of King Arthur. I loved this entire series, and have purchased it for several of my family members and friends. The whole series is an \\"I can't put it down\\" one. You'll be captivated!"},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Jack Whyte has written another extrordinary book. The Camulod Chronicals is an asome serious and each book in it keeps getting better. With death of of Uther and the birth of Arthur, Merlyn needs to keep high hopes for his coloney. This book was hard to put down because of the vision of action. Jack whyte is a genious."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"This is the third volume of a superb series about the life and times of King Arthur from a historical perspective.Whyte's narration and writing style continue to be excellent. Was this the way things really happened? Did Merlyn (using Whyte's spelling) and Uther actually exist, and really live their lives as Whyte describes? We'll probably never know for sure, but Whyte certainly made me believe they could have. All of his characters are three-dimensional, flesh-and-blood people - and though I know how the story had to turn out (this is, after all, the story of Arthur), there were quite a few moments in this volume that took my breath away. At some points I honestly believed that Whyte was going to play some kind of dirty trick on me and veer off into an alternate universe.Along the way Whyte gives us several lessons in history and the religion of the time. I'm not enough of a scholar to know whether or not a debate such as the one he describes actually took place, but I certainly believed in his description of it. And he presents both sides of several religious arguments in a way such that any layman could understand them, without his (Whyte's) obviously taking one side or the other.My only complaint with this particular entry in the series is that Whyte doesn't really dig into the life, history, or personality of Lot of Cornwall. What little description he does give makes Lot out to be evil personified, but I really would have liked to learn more about what made this man tick.Unlike the first two, there is a little bit of &quot;magic&quot; in this volume, if you can call dreams magic. It seems that Whyte's Merlyn has a bit of precognition - his dreams accurately predict several events in the story. But there is no overt magic - nobody turns into a newt or anything else.I'm eagerly looking forward to volume four."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"I read the second book first, not realizing this was a series, and liked it enough to purchase the others. Reading them one after another, I see a marked dropoff in quality with this installment. Never strong on character, the plotting gets weaker and a lot reads like filler. If I didn't have the remaining volumes already I would not buy them. I recommend the Skystone and Singing Sword and stop there."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Jack Whyte seems to be one of the few myth/fantasy writers who has been able to so comfortably (and successfully)co-mingle the traditional Arthurian legends with historical facts and actual geographic locations. I have been following him since I (quite by accident) purchased &quot;The Singing Sword&quot;. I anxiously await his next release. In two words: GOOD READ!"},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"This is a very interesting mix of historical facts and legend. Both combined fire the imagination. You follow Britain emerging from the ruins of the Roman Empire to find a unique identity. Characters that we are familiar with gain a depth before unknown. Jack Whyte is a superb writer that creates a world that very well could have been 1500 years ago. And you feel like you are there! Another fine addition to the Camulod Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"This book is enjoyable for the same reason that Mary Stewart's _Crystal Cave_ was. It presents Merlin as a real person, not a shadowy magician, and explores an estimation of the _real_ environment of King Arthur's world from Merlin's perspective. The first person narrative copies Stewart's approach, and works as well. Impressive historical setting and the rich description of late Roman Britain gives the story a depth not often found in the fantasy genre. The detailed ironmongery and militarist/feudal bent of the era are well captured, though a sense of how an agrarian economy supported all of these horsemen and warriors is missing.The book's major shortcoming is the pornographic detail of some wenching scenes. It is one thing to explain how carnal appetites were approached with both pre-Christian casualness and great gusto by young Brito-Roman aristocrats-- it is entirely unnecessary to the story to go into genital approach angles and a detailed accounting of who was licking whom. In contrast, a very tender erotic scene was drawn where Merlin and Cassandra first become intimate, and it was done without using pornographic detail. Perhaps by using the extreme contrast Whyte was illustrating with heavy quill the difference between lust and love. And there was a bit of psychobabble thrown in where Merlin goes into a four page digression that amounts to measuring manhood, literally, with Uther. Again, a far too heavy handed, and basically unnecessary tool for showing the differences in temperament between Uther and Merlin.Those weaknesses aside, the story is very readable, though only suitable for adult readers, due to the adult content of about fifteen pages of material. Better editing and less graphic language woud have made this a four or five star book. Of course, I will contiue enjoying the series, because old Britain fairly jumps off of the page and into my living room when I read it."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Once again, Whyte digs deeper into the mythos of king Arthur. This chapter focuses primarily on Merlyn as well as Uther, Varrus's son and Merlyn's Cousin.Jack Whyte can get a little wordy when it comes to describing some things, especially battle scenes and military tactics so at times, the book seems like it may drag a little bit. That's pretty much my only complaint about this installment and his style in general.It's still a great chapter in an extremely epic tale of the forging of a country and a legend."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Exciting, fast paced action, difficult to put down."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Reading Whyte's work at this point is like watching a train wreck -- you can't turn your eyes away even when you want to. Continuing in his &quot;one crisis after another&quot; school of writing, nothing makes sense if one sits back and thinks about it for any length of time. The characters are dull and monolithic; the setting forced; the events contrived. His obsession with sex scenes that the characters detest is getting on my nerves. If his characters hate these events so much, why do they keep appearing? There are so many points where logic would demand that his whole colony fall apart due to internal disorder (not to mention woefully inadequate resources and manpower) that the mind fails to comprehend how it could possibly survive. History and historicity are thrown out the window; the basis of the legends is forgotten. Whyte fails in these books on all counts and yet, like the Mack Bolan books, will continue to be popular with those who only want impossible adventure and pointless escapades. Expect to turn your mind off when you read these books -- it will be safer for you."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"When I was a student at Birmingham-Southern College, I had a friend who was (and I presume still is) a great guy. We were both science fiction readers. But there the similarity ended. I waxed enthusiastic about Robert A. Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon, Fritz Leiber, Poul Anderson, and James Blish. Harry* shamelessly read Perry Rhodan, Captain Future reprints, early space operas by Fletcher Pratt, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. \\"They really aren't so bad,\\" he would say. I would sadly shake my head. But now I find myself reviewing some of those very books more than I would like to admit.Edmond Hamilton's _Planets in Peril_ is one of his Captain Future space operas. _Captain Future_ was a magazine that ran for 17 issues, from Winter 1940 to Spring 1944. Each issue featured a complete short novel about the adventures of Curt Newton, aka Captain Future, who battles interplanetary skulduggerers with an assortment of colorful sidekicks known as Futuremen. After the demise of the magazine, more CF novels continued to appear in _Startling Stories_ from time to time. Edmond Hamilton wrote all but four of these novels. (Of these four, three were written by Joseph Samachson and one was by Manly Wade Wellman.) Some, but not all, of the Hamilton Captain Future stories were reprinted in the late sixties._Planets in Peril_ (_Captain Future_, 1942; 1969) is, I would argue, an average entry in the series. It is more smoothly written than Hamilton's space operas of the thirties, and the science is clearly better. Hamilton here seems to know what a \\"universe\\" is, and he writes knowingly about relativistic notions of curved space and the nature of time. But _Planets in Peril_ is written to a formula, with a somewhat homogenized style. It is, let us face it, juvenile, and it doesn't have the splash and color of some of his earlier stories. So you pays your money and takes your chances.Ah, yes. The story. Well, it seems that the Martian scientist Tiko Thrin has established contact with beings in what he believes is another spacial universe (or \\"universal bubble\\") from our own. With a cheerful disregard for the safety of our own universe, Tiko Thrin invites his contact to visit Mars via a matter transmitter. (Martian scientists are like that, I guess.) Two visitors arrive and reveal that their universe is dying and that it is being invaded by the Cold Ones. But they are convinced that Captain Future might be able to impersonate a long-dead hero in their own universe long enough to inspire their scientists to find a way to \\"reverse entropy\\". There are further twists to the plot that only a cad would reveal, so I will say no more.Hamilton's involvement with the Captain Future stories caused a great many readers to grossly underestimate his abilities. Gradually, he began to write less and polish more. Novels like _City on the Edge of Time_, _The Star Kings_, and _The Haunted Stars_ began to improve his reputation. Hamilton was too good a writer to make a complete hash of this novel. But I'm afraid that it must still be considered minor fare.* Not his real name."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"Good book, but as with rest of series, characters have a plastic, comic-book superhero machismo about them that comes across as...well, comic-book-like. However, this series does satisfy urges for Arthurian/dark age historical fiction. Parke Godwin and Bernard Cornwell do *much* better jobs of re-telling the Arthurian tales from a quasi-historical perspective."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"When women write stories about mute girls who are saved by big, strong men who teach them to be sexually aware, that is considered Romance fiction and is looked down upon. But here we have the same formula: a mysterious young girl, beautiful and abused, unable to speak. A hero of mythical proportions comes to her rescue. Cassandra never felt real to me, because the author never lets her speak -- just another female character to manipulate and show the hero off to advantage.Historical fiction and historical detail are good things, when there are real characters to hold them up, and a real story to listen to. This book seesaws between long and tedious discussions of theology and Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"A wonderful series with outstanding military and historical foundation and detail, gone bad. The writer doesn't even seem to know his own characters anymore. The sex scenes seem like they were written by a 14 year old kid. When I began to get the distinct impression that the author had lost his way, I put the book down. As a historian, I'm disappointed that Whyte has chosen to sell out with this drivel."},{"Title":"The Eagles' Brood (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 3)","review":"However, one big problem does prevent it from deserving a 5 star rating.The problem has to do with the ending and Merlyn's &quot;illness&quot; which causes the ending to seem somewhat... intangible? Merlyn's &quot;illness&quot; causes him and the reader to miss out on alot of important and major happenings that we learn later. Fans and readers of this series (I have read the first 3 books, including &quot;Eagles Brood&quot;) may feel disoriented by a sudden lack of knowledge of what is going on in the world of Camulod, especially concerning Uther. Up until the point of the &quot;illness&quot;, the main character of the stories/series has always been a vocal point of major events. Simply put, the reader feels left out, not knowing what to believe or think.I believe that what happened with Merlyn's &quot;illness&quot; hurt the story in a way that could have been avoided. I also felt bothered by Merlyn's apparent lack of faith in this cousin and best friend, Uther. I feel that Uther was innocent of the crime stated on the book's back cover.Fortunately, the author's next book &quot;Uther&quot; is looking to cast away these problems by focusing on the events that took place away from Merlyn's eyes. That book should definitely be read WITH &quot;Eagles Brood&quot; for the whole story.All said, this is still a good book and a great series. I'm certainly looking forward to new books in the series. The author has a way of making the story feel very real.

Maybe the subdued colors (reminding me of my own youthful efforts in colored pencil), and the gently expressionistic art work, failed to attract the reviewers' eyes.To me, these subtleties are strengths, because I can take renewed interest in the book each time I read it to my toddler son. &quot;Big Red Truck&quot; has grown on me, my son, and my wife over the course of several months of library checkouts. I look forward no less to reading it to my daughter when she's old enough.This book has the same kind of humor (a refrigerator with a giant &quot;Behemoth&quot; logo, for example), nostalgia, and straightforward mystery that makes &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot; so charming. Unlike that acknowledged classic of dream-time, though, &quot;Big Red Truck&quot; is a carefull! y controlled daydream. It's an outdoor story, set in a recognizable American landscape on the border between the rural and the suburban. A musical analogue would be the sophisticated simplicity of Pat Metheny's dreamier music.And, unlike &quot;Night Kitchen&quot; -- but like Maurice Sendak's superb earlier work -- at the heart of &quot;Big Red Truck&quot; there is an honest, significant, even dramatic interaction between parents and child."},{"Title":"The Big Red Truck","review":"A Walter Mitty-like toddler drives a big red tractor trailer, lunches at a diner, overturns his rig, and gets pulled over by a police car.

He was a Chaplin in WW I, and was wounded. He was elected Superior of the Catholic Missionary society in 1933. His experience was wide and vast. He wrote some novels, perhaps the best of which was The Masterful Monk, but this book is not a novel.This book was written after: the war to end all wars (WW I); the horror of WW II--including the nuclear bomb; and the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe. The book starts off as a meditation about how science has brought us the ability to destroy but not the ability to control destruction: this may seem dated, since the fear of nuclear war has abated considerably in recent years, although neither the bombs nor the danger has not gone away.It the goes on to primarily address those who are not hostile to God, but those who have \\"that unthinking vagueness which drifts on the general tide of indifference until suddenly confronted with what compels recognition of God.\\"A note at the beginning states: \\"If certain things I shall say are resented, please believe me that it is not my intention to hurt, but only to draw attention to the truth. A quality of truth is that it hurts when refused; when accepted it no longer hurts.\\"I found it to be a beautiful series of meditations, but spiritual writing is highly individual in its appeal: no book can be all things to all people. For one thing, there is the law of gradualness: you can't understand \\"B\\" until you first understand \\"A.\\" And then you can't understand \\"C\\" without understanding both \\"A\\" and \\"B.\\" And so on. Another problem is that in only 157 pages NOTHING can be FULLY explained: you have to be willing to let somethings pass. Finally, this was written in a more direct, honest, authentic, masculine, unapologetic, and sincere time in the Church (speaking in generalities): the style is surprising in some ways.When you read books from this period--and even earlier--it is surprising to what degree the basic terms of the debate--the basic issues--were the same back then. We are still dealing with the fragmenting, reductionist concepts of the 18th Century. It is also surprising how modern Catholic writing is often so...convoluted or sometimes even whimpy?...in contrasts.My wife and I both loved it."},{"Title":"A tour on the prairies","review":"This short travelogue is amazing -- not just for what was seen and written down, but because this is one of the early American publications that fashioned our ideas about the American West. The writing is easy to read and doesn't use too many archaic words. Read it, revisit the source for early West experiences, and see how its ideas have continued to influence literature, Hollywood, and our own deeply embedded understanding."},{"Title":"A tour on the prairies","review":"My review is of the Kindle version of this book, and the low rating applies solely to that. While the book itself provides a fascinating look at what life was like in the 1830s in the undeveloped area that is now Oklahoma -- where I live -- this conversion to an e-book is completely unacceptable. The reader has to take everything in context and consider the basic shapes of words rather than individual letters in words to make sense of each sentence. My best guess is that someone scanned the pages of the actual book into a program that read them as digital images and then tried to convert them back into words. It failed horribly.But because I was so interested in the topic and was about to attend the \\"A Day with Washington Irving\\" re-enactment at the Keystone Ancient Forest near Sand Springs, Okla. -- an area through which the group documented in this book traveled -- I plowed through the text anyway. Having the background was a great help to me as I walked through the Cross Timbers forest and witnessed re-enactors discussing the events and personalities of the trip.I found it especially enlightening to read how Irving described and referred to Indians -- those traveling with his group and those who lived in the territory his group was crossing. He routinely talked about them as \\"savages\\" and \\"half-breeds,\\" even as he talked admiringly of their skills and knowledge. I imagine that the widespread reading of his book by Americans of his day contributed greatly to the stereotypes of and prejudices against American Indians that were perpetuated in this country.Irving spends a great deal of time in the book relating the hunts -- of deer, buffalo, turkeys and even wild horses -- that his group pursued. I'm a wildlife rehabber and a soft-hearted vegetarian, so these depictions were not easy to read. At one point Irving even expressed remorse himself at having shot a buffalo. It was severely wounded but not dead, and before he put it out of its misery, he felt guilty for having harmed the animal, which he considered magnificent in its size, strength and majesty.If you're going to read the book, go ahead and get the print version -- not this e-edition. The mangled text makes it too hard to read."},{"Title":"A tour on the prairies","review":"I have read this book before and it is excellent.

The 335 page book read great with no boring parts.We see Irving and a group on a 10 week excursion into the far mid west then ( Oklahoma). We see the vivid description of rivers, plains and forests. Also great descriptions of life of US Army rangers who traveled with the group. We see an inexperienced young count who gets temporarily lost, a half breed, and a boastful little Frenchman. The reader learns about the Indians, hunting especially Buffalo hunting in the region.This book became an ultimate classic of the Old West and further propelled Irving as one of America's great writers. Anyone interest in life on the prairie in the Old West, Indians, wildlife and great scenery description will like this book. 5 stars"},{"Title":"HTML in action","review":"This book was published before HTML 3.0 was in wide use whereas all good HTML books today are written specifically for version 4.0.

He supposes that in that world of Criticism a public sphere was created in which rational discourse was the central element. He suggests that in contemporary times Criticism has been reduced to being a form of public relations for publishers, and an internal academic affair in which a few experts write for a few more experts.

I'll be grabbing up her backlist asap!The previous reviews already provide the background for this book... I'll just add that this is an edgy, fast-paced, action-packed novel. I wouldn't limit it to a \\"medical thriller\\".Calista St. James is a smart, strong, capable woman and sparks fly when she is with Damian De Luna, a smart, sexy, capable man. The author not only writes intelligent 3-D characters, but she knows how to turn up the heat between these two.I think this book can be read as a stand-alone book, but I have already placed my order for Strong Medicine."},{"Title":"Radical Cure","review":"Following the Russian incident, Calista St. James vowed never again to depend on Damien DeLuna who swears he loves her and acted out of her best interests; she thinks he chose the mission over her and can live with that, but not his method. However, Calista has a new problem when her medical team devastates her team sending kind hearted people like Jake into a rage.She needs to find the cure to an illness whose symptoms defy medical knowledge as the indications behave contradictory. Calista learns that a potential elixir is in a dangerous part of South America so she enlists the only man she believes can get them in and out, Damien who will lead her. Damien agrees, though he has some safety stipulations, as he will do anything to prove his love to his cherished Calista.RADICAL CURE is an exciting medical thriller with a touch of romance. The story line starts at a fast-paced speed with Calista and her team trying to free a girl from white slave traders, shifts into a higher gear with Jakes turning into a lunatic, and finally accelerates even more as the lead couple goes to South America. Fans will feel the sexual tension between Calista and Damien who, if they survive this mission, still have plenty to overcome as love is not enough as she trusts him with her life but not her heart.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Radical Cure","review":"Radical Cure is the perfect book to follow Strong Medicine.

C4)","review":"Hudson was such a wonderful pastoral writer (although his novel 'A Crystal Age' pushes well passed the pastoral), full of sensitive observations of nature - geography, buildings (yes, they are part of nature too), people (usually humble people) and especially birds. His childhood took place in Argentina but he always had a yearning for England. He did write about that other world too. At the start of 'Afoot in England' it appears he was undertaking his walks - free of guide books quite deliberately - with his wife. But she disappears midway through this book, is not refered too - not even obliquely - any more and I wonder what sort of tragedy might have marked his life at the time of writing. But whatever might have happened it didn't impair his ability to continue observing and reporting in a down-to-earth way (in comparison to, say, the somewhat aloof short stories of Rabindranath Tagore).Other recommendations:W H Hudson novels - 'A Crystal Age', 'Green Mansions'W H Hudson non-fiction - 'A Shepherd's Life', 'Idle Days in Patagonia'W H Hudson autobiography 'Far Away and Long Ago'Rabindranath Tagore - selected short stories"},{"Title":"Afoot in England (Guild books ; no. C4)","review":"\\"Afoot in England\\" by W. H. Hudson (the initials standing for William Henry) is certainly NOT a guide book - something the author explicitly wants the reader to understand from the first page on.Originally written in 1909, Mr. Hudson describes walks, buildings, people, villages, paths, trees, animals - most of all birds - he saw, observed or met during the early 1900s.There is mention of places we can actually see for ourselves, such as Calleva (now Silchester), which at the time of the author's visits was just beginning to attract public interest and a lonely place free of tourists, or Stonehenge, where he spends some very cold, dark hours along with several hundred men wanting to observe the sunrise, only to go back at a later date to repeat the experience on his own, which he then finds very rewarding.Some rivers and villages are named, but by no means all of them, and so it would be quite a difficult undertaking if anyone wished to walk on Hudson's traces.At one point, he despairs of the weather - \\"has there ever been a June as cold and wet as that of 1906?\\" - something that made me think of what I have been hearing from my relatives and friends in England as well as reading on some of the blogs I follow.Everything he writes about is neatly wrapped up into a chapter; some chapters talk about a particular place (such as Salisbury Cathedral) or a particular person (such as an elderly lady who told him the story of his life over the weeks he stayed at her cottage), while there is another chapter entirely dedicated to Robert Bloomfield's novel-length poem \\"The Famer's Boy\\", with many quotations.As an ornithologist, the author knows and writes a great deal about the birds he observes during his walks, but this is never boring. The book does have its lengths (for instance, the aforementioned chapter about \\"The Famer's Boy\\"), but it is entertaining, interesting and not without humour. If nothing else, it shows how more than a 100 years ago, people dealt with early forms of tourism, from the mass to the individual kind.Some of the words the author uses are naturally different to how a writer would express similar ideas now, but that only adds to the charm of this book.From the variety of topics Mr. Hudson covers in the 25 chapters, I guess he'd be a well-read blogger if he lived today."},{"Title":"Afoot in England (Guild books ; no.

Cindy is, of course, mind numbingly and jaw droppingly beautiful, and reveals more here than she ever has before. As this will probably be the last nude pictorial she will ever do, it is a must have for her fans, and not to be missed.

Cole has the ability to officially change his racial status from black to colored, due to ambiguities in the government's methods of documenting and systematizing racial identification, in order to gain access to broader strata of society for his photographic project. Cole's black-and-white photographs depict passbook arrests, police inspections, dehumanizing conditions in the diamond mines, &quot;white only&quot; signage in the city--images that would have been subject to censoring.Cole, when stopped and questioned by authorities, masqueraded his photographs as documents of youth crime rather than as records of the violence of institutional apartheid policy. In this way, Cole's negatives passed archivally. Presenting his work in the guise of documentary visual policing, Cole was able to leave South Africa with his negatives and go to the United States, where House of Bondage was published. This operation of critical camouflaging, of archival mimicry as a critical practice in the realm of photographic production, will fuel this examination of the ways in which the body is represented archivally in contemporary photography from South Africa."},{"Title":"House of bondage,","review":"This is an unbelievable documentation of the horrors of aparthaid that will leave you breathless. It is so hard to believe that this status was ongoing in South Africa up until the 1990's. I had no idea that the severe discrimination wasn't even in place until early in the 20th century. The indignities and oppressive status of blacks in South Africa during this time period, shown in pictures by Ernest Cole should be understood by blacks and whites alike. It makes much of the discrimination that occured here in the US pale by comparison. I thank God that things are improving in South Africa.

His parents are both obsessed with fruits (they have a farm), and have some serious issues. Nona Swope, the boys brother, is a twenty year old wild child with a serious act to grind with her parents. Then there is The Touch, a cult like group who operates a commune in the same town as the Swope family. And although they preach that they are sincere, and are just trying to get away from the rat race and get back to nature, it becomes more than obvious that they are not what they claim to be.Although this book has a good bit of drama and suspense, it loses its punch because basically every character in the story besides Alex Delaware, his gay detective friend Milo, and the sick boy, everyone else is a complete deviant. When you have basically every person, either being a child molester, drug dealer or killer, it lacks any real sense of believability or credibility. After a while, it's hard not to lose interest after yet another character is revealed to be an evil fiend. It just becomes too much. This is definitely a case where more is less.

Kellerman creates an interesting mystery here, but doesn't do a very good job resolving it. There are a lot of big revelations at the end of his novel, but I found most of them over-the-top, lurid and rather silly. This book also contains a divorce subplot that ends rather abruptly, without any sense of closure provided for the reader.This book is readable, and I do enjoy Kellerman's prose style.

Named for an apple, Annona Blossom Swope is described in almost feral terms.Matters come to a painful head when Woody is kidnapped from the hospital. The boy's parents and sister also disappear, and Dr. Alex Delaware is immediately in pursuit of this mysterious family.Dr. Delaware and his long time friend, Officer Milo Sturgis travel down some very seedy and unsavory roads in Southern California. A cult called the Touch is high on the list of suspects. Members of the cult would visit Woody's family in the hospital and were bringing fresh, organic fruits. A doctor who sympathized with the Touch was high on the list of suspects as were a disgruntled male model/escort who worked with Nona at a messenger/escort service.The clever detective work and the chapters detailing Dr. Delaware's expose of the Touch and their compound, a converted monastery in the fictitious border town of La Vista make for very compelling reading. The theme of bearing fruit is rampant throughout the book and is very effectively used. Dr. Delaware's live in girlfriend, the selfish and tiresome Robin is barely mentioned in this story, which is also good. I never cared for her.Questions still abound. Where are the Swopes?

It seems as if Kellerman was still practicing then. He did not create the convincing characters we can find in his later novels when he wrote this book. And the plot is a little heavy, too. The climax is somewhat forced and improbable and comes before the actual ending, which is too transparent and obvious. We know exactly what is coming. Nevertheless, the book is quite a good read, a simple thriller, not too demanding, and it cannot cope with later novels by Kellerman."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"Child abuse, juvenile cancer, drugs, prostitution, and a quasi-religious cult built on perverse notions of sexual liberation make up the plot of Jonathan Kellerman's second novel, Blood Test. Despite the dark subject matter, this second book to feature child psychologist turned part-time criminal investigator Alex Delaware is as well written and enjoyable as the first.When Alex Delaware agrees to assist a former colleague in convincing an angry family not to remove their cancer-stricken child from hospital care, he quickly discovers that all is not as it appears. When the patient disappears, Alex is quickly swept up in a complex web of conspiracy and deceit ultimately leading to a showdown with a cult guru and a fight to the death with an ax-wielding maniac.If the plot sounds a tad far-flung, that's because it is. Yet Kellerman's deft first-person narrative style and tight prose tie the various story threads together into a suspense-filled and surprisingly emotional tale about the misuse of power and the unintended effects of so-called victimless crimes. Basically, though the author probably didn't intend this, it's a story about the far-reaching consequences of sin.As a psychological thriller, Blood Test succeeds. It is exciting and creepy and satisfying. Readers should be aware, however, that it contains rather graphic depictions of the evil acts carried out by some of the characters, including drug use, prostitution, and physical and emotional abuse, along with one very disturbing description of a sex ritual. It should also be noted that Alex Delaware's best friend is gay, though the author primarily uses this very likeable character not to promote a homosexual lifestyle but as a means of exploring prejudice and social injustice.Though it not a \\"issue book,\\" Blood Test certainly tackles several issues that are if anything more prevalent today than when the book was written over two decades ago. The disturbing elements of the story may offend some readers, and certainly caution should be exercised in reading, but Alex Delaware's heroism and Kellerman's eminently readable writing make this book worthwhile for those who are able to stomach some of the nastier parts and grasp the story's message that good--at least \\"good\\" as seen from a purely secular perspective--ultimately triumphs over evil."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"Shakespeare's suggestion regarding the legal profession doesn't fare much better under the early scrutiny of Jonathan Kellerman. He paints the 'good' lawyers as shallow, amoral, money chasing, well dressed bottom dwellers and the bad lawyers . . . . well, far worse.Here a younger Alex Delaware is asked to address the parents of a 5 year old cancer sufferer whom they are trying to remove from medical care stating that they can treat the child better on their own. Of course the idiocy of the parents lets us know within a chapter that there is a horrid evil lurking close to the surface and indeed there is. Dr. delaware must address murder, sex, evil lawyers and misleading police professionals. But his love for Robyn, who gratefully does not make an appearance here (sorry folks; tired of the super hero having the normal relationship in the face of unspeakable evil) remains unabated, and his closest friend Detective Milo Sturgis, remain anchors for what he must face.A few sketchy scenes but enough to know that Kellerman and Delaware were going to be moving forces for the next two decades. There is a scene in the last third where Dr. D sneaks into an abandoned house that will leave you on the edge of your seat. And there are a number of twists I never saw coming.

Before he can meet with the parents, however, the boy is taken from the hospital.

I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"I love these books. This is the second in the Alex Delaware series, but I haven't read them in order and I've already read a half dozen or so. I love Alex, but sometimes he's so infuriating! He's completely incapable of minding his own business and he seems to think he's indestructible. Poor Milo tries to reign him in, but it's a losing battle. Alex walks - or skulks - right into these things knowing full well that if he's caught, he's dead, but he does it anyway without bothering to wait for professional help. If you're going to walk into a dangerous situation, bring the big burly guy with the gun along with you! Still, it's exciting, and, of course, there'd be no story if Alex was cautious.Psychologist Alex Delaware gets involved in this situation because his old boss, Dr. Raoul Melendez-Lynch, calls him in to help with a particularly sad case. Five year old Woody Swope has a cancer that was caught early enough it could be completely cured, but his backwoods family are refusing treatment and the gruff head of the Oncology Department is losing his cool. Alex agrees and meets with the bright young boy, but before he can meet with the family, Woody is spiritied away and they have all disappeared.Alex goes digging. At first because he is genuinely concerned for the boy, but also because he hates to leave something unfinished. His girlfriend Robin is away in Japan, so he has nothing better to do anyway, and when someone tries to kill him, it becomes personal. His pal, LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, is away in Washington, DC, so Alex has a flimsy excuse for going it alone, but you know he would have gone snooping alone anyway even if Milo was around. Once again, he almost gets himself killed. You'd think he would have learned after spending months with his jaw wired shut last time, but the man has an insatiable curiosity and a penchant for breaking and entering. (Have to wonder why he isn't arrested himself for that).It's a pretty dark and twisted tale of cults and drugs and rare fruits and I couldn't put it down till I'd read the last page. I only wish Milo had been around more.One thing I'm kind of curious about - just how is it that Alex can recognize such substances as Mexican heroin, raw opium and hashish when he sees it? I mean, that wasn't taught at my grad school. Then again - UCLA in the 70's ... Yeah, maybe it's not so unusual after all."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"This novel starts with some interesting characters and twists but I found that the last few chapters sent Alex Delaware into some situations that seemed unbelievable and unreal.

Jonathan Kellerman has a way of offering entertaining stories that keep your attention throughout the novel. HIGHLY Recommend."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"I did enjoy Blood Test- one of my favorite authors. Alex Delaware has never let me down. His story is always fascinating and clever, very well understood and he always takes time to show his love and his dedication to Robin. He is so smooth and his friendship with Milo is true and steady. I think Jonathan Kellerman will forever be top notch."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"Jonathan Kellerman is one of the best authors I know of when it comes to plotting story and sufficiently developing characters. The answer to the big mystery was right there in front of your eyes, but I never saw it. In fact, I was positive I had the book figured out completely a hundred pages before finishing it, and thought that this was one of the weakers mystery novels I'd read, but then the answer came and it blew me out of the water, but it made perfect sense and I couldn't believe I didn't think of it before.

This one piqued my interest in the beginning, but then it lost me somewhere in the middle, altho it had the usual dramatic end common of Kellerman! I just love his main character, Alex Delaware, and he is believable and funny and great in all of the books.The plot in this one just wasn't all that great, in my humble opinion. It definitely put a new twist on the age-old \\"missing child\\" story, with the child having cancer and needing treatment in a germ-free, bubble-type world. That put more of an urgency to the issue of finding him. The \\"jungle\\" and other odd surprises toward the end of the book made it a worthwhile read for me. As I said in my last review, I have acquired a pile of Jonathan Kellerman books and am really excited to get through them all. In general, Kellerman uses so much imagery that you feel like you are right there with Alex as he makes his discovery. Altho not the best, this is a worthwhile read for anyone who likes a good thriller or just wants a new experience. Experience Kellerman!"},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"This is my first exposure to JK...I am going to go back and start from the beginning of the Alex Delaware series. The beginning of the book was a bit slow (which could be because I didn't read the series in order). However, once I got to know that main characters, the book was clipped along at a fast pace. The last part of the book has many twists and keeps you wondering how it will all be resolved. The last 100 pages go very quickly."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"I think that this book has less of a psychological aspect. I like mysteries/suspense that deal with positive relationships. I missed Robin in this book. and if you are a Delaware reader, then you know who I am talking about.

Not too bad overall though. quick and easy to read"},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"I was enthralled by the writing style of Kellerman in his previous book, When the Bough Breaks. I was completely let down by this one. I wanted so much for him to stick to the primary storyline with Woody, but instead, he concentrated on Woody and the Moodys. I hope the next one is better."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"I find myself loathing the Delaware series and I only read this book after the urging of a close friend.Thank God I did.This book is great throughout with the best ending I have ever read.So shocking and unpredictable.Usually in reviews I give a quick synopsis of the plot.However I feel anyone giving the plot of this book away is a fool.Its superb.Buy this and ignore the rest of the rather disappointing Delaware series...oh and also buy the Butchers Theater.Its another superb book from Kellerman and is a little better than Blood Test."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"I absolutely loved WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, so I was naturally eager to pursue more of Jonathan Kellerman's books. BLOOD TEST is good, but not as good as its predecessor. JK's ability to draw interesting characters is intact: the doctors and cult members in this book are memorable, and the resolution is thrilling. He really knows how to get the reader's adrenaline pumping! However, I thought the side plot regarding the divorce case was somewhat of a fifth wheel. It didn't seem to have anything to do with the main action, so why include it? Overall, though, I found myself wishing I lived a few more bus-stops away from work so that I could finish reading it before walking home from the corner, and am looking forward to reading OVER THE EDGE.

I'm skeptical after this one, but I'll give a try."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"There are many good things about this novel, the second book in the Alex Delaware series. For starters, the reader really gets to know Alex better in this book and he's beginning to grow on me. The core plot is dandy and the resolution is a page turner. And, while Alex is based in Los Angeles, much of the action takes place near the Mexican border in an interestingly twisted imaginary town called La Vista.The weakest point of the book is an virtually unrelated divorce plot which absorbs way too much of the first half of the book. Likewise, the horticulture sections needed some serious editing.Bottom-line: A solid entry in the Delaware series, which in turn is a solid but not spectacular series. After two books, Alex has yet to break new frontiers or do anything that hasn't been done before. Maybe in the next book...."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"I have read all of Kellerman's novels which feature Alex Delaware.This is by far the weakest entry in this series. I found it har dto believe it was written by the same author.The unsympathetic characters are so cartoonish it is hard to develop any sort of empahty for them. The plot plods alonglike a bad \\"b\\" nmovie from the 1930s.

Keeps you coming back and looking forward to the next books!"},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"In this second novel by Jonathan Kellerman featuring Dr. Alex Delaware, the good doctor finds himself drawn into the midst of a mystery involving a horribly sick child, a strangely shut-off family, a reclusive religious cult, and a whole town that seems to have a pall cast over it. When five-year- old Woody Swope disappears from the hospital where he is being treated for life-threatening cancer, Dr. Alex Delaware does everything in his power to find the missing child. Can he dig up the truth behind the mysteries surrounding Woody before it's too late for the boy?While Dr. Delaware and his LAPD Homicide detective friend Milo Sturgis continue to be interesting and compelling characters, I found that I didn't enjoy Blood Test as much as I did the first of Kellerman's Delaware novels, When the Bough Breaks. I didn't feel that the supporting characters were as well fleshed out as they could have been, and that many of them were in the story simply to fit an archetype or to neatly be a necessary foil for some aspect of the plot. This isn't to say that the book wasn't enjoy, but it simply didn't feel as natural as When the Bough Breaks. I will certainly continue reading the Kellerman series, and hope that this book's lack of polish is the exception to the rule."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"This was my second Kellerman novel. I bought it after reading the more recent Billy Straight, which I really enjoyed. And I was disappointed. It's an okay story, Kellerman does a good job of creating suspense, but I still felt that this was vastly inferior to Billy Straight. The characters aren't nearly as interesting, and there seem to be a lot of subplots that are pointless and don't really go anywhere. And the &quot;Hollywood blockbuster&quot; ending borders on the ridiculous. It's still an okay read and I'll probably buy another Kellerman book. But read Billy Straight instead if you want more interesting characters and a less far-fetched plot."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"This was the first kellerman novel I read.

NO Book has done that to me in a long time."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"Jonathan Kellerman's Blood Test held me until the very end. Through the plot he told me enough to keep me holding on without spoiling the ending. The plot twisted and turned until I wasn't sure which way he was going next. He used the character Alex Delaware to the fullest in this book. Unlike some suspense novels that feed you the ending throughout the book, Kellerman eases the reader into the ending and unravels it all at once at the end. This is an aspect that makes Kellerman and Blood Test a different kind of reading experience all together. GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"Jonathan Kellerman, Blood Test (Signet, 1986)I spent most of this book waiting for that proverbial other shoe. Kellerman, in my mind, has always been one of those Andrew Vachss-style one-trick ponies who blames all of the world's problems on one narrow, and possibly specious, band of the psychotherapeutic spectrum. I hasten to add that I based that opinion on reviews and a cursory reading of Kellerman's first Alex Delaware novel, When the Bough Breaks, a few years back (I read it in tandem with one of Vachss' books, which may have further colored my thinking). Removed from both Vachss and the rather amateurish effort of Kellerman's first novel, I picked up Blood Test more as a way to pad the numbers for 2001-- skim fifty pages, dump it, chalk up another book in the it's-been-read pile. Blood Test, however, surprised me.Alex Delaware returns, this time to try and hunt down a kidnapped cancer patient. The list of suspects isn't too long, but it's certainly juicy-- the kid's parents (who have also gone missing), an alternative-medicine-loving pot-smoking ex-hippie doctor, and an organically-minded SoCal cult founded by an ex-Beverly Hills lawyer who got shot in the head. Oh, yeah, and the everpresent &quot;random crime&quot; theory. Add to this Delaware's being stalked by the extremely angry husband in a recently-finished child custody case who lost and lost big (and blames Delaware, of course), and you get 400 pages of pretty-durn-good mystery.The shoe does drop, of course. What makes Kellerman predictable isn't whodunit, but whytheydunit. In relation to many mystery writers, this is quite the handicap, because knowing the why before you open the cover will certainly narrow the playing field (and anyone with a passing acquaintance with Alex Delaware will know the why of it at that point). On the up side, though, Kellerman's one-man crusade isn't nearly the week-old scrod that Andrew Vachss' one-man crusade is, and that makes Kellerman a whole lot more readable. Standard mystery fare, but easy reading and compelling enough to keep the pages turning. ** 1/2"},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult. It gets a little tiresome. The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are. But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"This is Kellerman's interpretation of the California Hardboiled Detective novel as pioneered by Dashiell Hammett. All of the usual elements from that style ranging from a MESSED UP CHICK to a DARK FAMILY SECRET to GANDIOSE DESIGNS are dutifully included in this episode, plus the usual elements of Kellerman's writings. Kellerman's ghoulies aside, he fails to offer any fresh insights or do anything interesting with the new types of charcaters that this genre brings. This would have been more enjoyable if he made major events less dramatic and more probable."},{"Title":"Blood Test (Signet)","review":"His books are always gripping and timeless.

Unfortunately when the landing party attempts to beam back up to the Enterprise they are unable to as the transporter biofilters detect a deadly and highly contagious virus. The same virus that decimated the Kalandan colony that once inhabited the engineered planetoid. Stranded on the planet until a cure is found, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sulu decide to put the time to good use and explore the base of what was obviously a technologically advanced society.Meanwhile the huge power surge given off by the planet when its defenses were activated has attracted the attention of both a Klingon Captain spoiling for a fight and a scout ship from a previously unknown alien race, the Petraw. The Petraw are a race that seemingly attain their technology by tricking others out of theirs. They are able to intercept and decode all messages that they intercept and gain the knowledge they need to plan a strategy that allows them to obtain covertly any technology and information they think will be useful to their race. In this case, the detection by the Petraw's ships sensors of the power surge leads then to intercept the messages sent by Kirk to Starfleet command and his report of the advanced and powerful technology they have stumbled upon.Sufficiently intrigued by the possible opportunities the alien planetoid might hold, the Petraw leader Tasm plans her teams tactics and decides the best way to obtain access to the technology on the planet is to impersonate the decedents of the Kalandans and claim the base and technology herself. To this end the Petraw surgically alter themselves to appear as much like the Kalandans as possible. They successfully synthesis a cure for the virus to offer to the Enterprise crew and time their arrival at the planet to aid the Enterprise which has come under attack from the Klingon ship.Kirk is skeptical of Tasm's claims but decides to cooperate to a point with the 'Kalandans'. Under orders to learn all he can about the interstellar transporter, this allows the Enterprise crew to continue to investigate the alien technology but also enables the Petraw to realize that within the base lies a Gateway that will bring unimaginable power to whomever learns its secrets. A technology they are as determined to obtain as Kirk is resolved to keep out of anyone else's hands. Working together the two crews are able to reactive the portal which brings matters to a climax. The story ends in a cliffhanger of sorts as the Petraw's plans suddenly go awry.&quot;One Small Step&quot; was a disappoinment to me. I had two main problems with the book. The first and most important to me were the characterizations of established characters. I did not like the way the author portrayed the TOS crew. This is highly subjective I know, everyone who reads the books envisions the characters their own way. But for me Susan Wright just didn't acurately portray the TOS characters. It was if she didn't really know the characters she was writing. I did however like the Petraw crew. I thought the race was very interesting indeed and those characters pretty well done.The other major problem I had with the story was that it was downright tedious at times. I got tired of reading about Spock or Scotty or one of the Petraw tracing filaments etc. I was hoping for a little more action. The plot was very slow. Every time the story began to pick up it seemed to suddenly drop off again. Perhaps I've been spoilt by the quality of other recent Star Trek novels but &quot;One Small Step&quot; is a book I would call mediocre at best."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"This novel is based on the Original Series episode which had Lee Merriwhether as the guest star. To briefly recap the story: The Enterprise crew discovers a long deserted planetoid/space station. A landing party explores. The group runs into a holographic projection of a beautiful woman that is able to kill with a touch. Capt. Kirk and company find a solution. The computer projection is a relic of a long lost civiliztion. They were the Kaladans.\\"One Small Step\\" picks up where this installment ended. The Enterprise crew members are doing clean up operations. While exploring, the Enterprise is attacked by Klingons. They are almost defeated and destroyed by them. At the last minute they are saved by a small ship, coming out of nowhere, that blows the Klingon vessel to smithereens. The saviors claim to be the descendants of the Kaladans. Kirk is skeptical of this assertion.What was best about the novel? The author did not depart from the characterizations of the first series. It's very annoying when a writer tries to make Spock fall in love or have Captain Kirk not pay attention to the ladies. This is not done. The plot had the linear progression that is expected of Star Trek novels. The ending had a believable cliffhanger.What did I like least about the novel? There is a trend in Trek writing to have novels chopped up into as many as six different books. In many cases two novels could be combined as one. Gateways is the latest series to be chopped up into sequels. This is a rip off. The author did depart in one sense from the Original Series. It seemed the Enterprise Crew were viewing the Klingons with Next Generation sensibilities. In the Original Series they probably would have been estatic that someone saved them from being target practice. Instead they are puzzled and a little contrite. They hadn't yet given Kahless a second look. As far as Jim Kirk was concerned, Kahless was another Genghis Khan.I was able to finish the book within the week. There's nothing I hate worse than reading in a ST novel, the aliens are going to take over the universe, but due to plodding prose and silly tangents, you really don't care. You don't mind getting back to it the next year.A key reason \\"One Small Step\\" doesn't get a lot of stars is that this is not a stand alone novel. You will have to shell out more money for part 2 or hope your public library has it. Overall, this was an OK read."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"This is a tolerably well-written book; contrary to at least one of the other reviewers here, I feel that the author did a fine job of portraying the established characters, and the story fit well as a continuation of the original series episode, &quot;That Which Survives&quot;. Also, the new race, the Petraw, seem plausible and moderately interesting, kind of a cross between the Ferrengi and Harry Mudd. (Although I must say, I found the motivations for the &quot;deviant&quot; member of the alien crew a bit opaque, and since the actions of that character have a very major effect on the plot, that's a rather large caveat.) Also, as has been mentioned by other reviewers, this story was somewhat lacking in action; not as much as has been suggested elsewhere, but enough that if you read Star Trek for the fast action and gripping adventure, you're likely to be disappointed.But the real flaw in this book (and the reason I gave it 3 rather than 4 stars) is that it has no satisfactory ending; it is simply &quot;Book 1&quot; of a series, and cannot stand on its own. The &quot;Section 31&quot; series demonstrated that that is not a neccessary flaw in a series; &quot;Cloak&quot;, at least, (the only one of that series that I've yet read) is a complete story in and of itself, in spite of being part of a series. That is the way a series SHOULD be put together; it is dishonest to write a story that has no ending, simply to attempt to bully the reader into buying the next book in the series. If the writing is good, the reader will do so without that gimmick, and if it isn't, the gimmick won't help.If you like Star Trek, and are willing to put up with having to follow the story line into the next book (and the five after that one, probably) there's no reason not to get this book. If you don't or aren't, there's no reason to do so."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"First about this story -- not bad despite having less action and romance than most Trek books. The plot has some mystery, but doesn't really get you lost or confused.But once again Pocket Books has come up with another way to dupe us out of our money rather than just giving us a good product so that we keep coming back. The entire first 6 books of the series have very little interaction with each other, except that you must get the seventh to have a conclusion. And the seventh is only available, at this date, in hardback. I was more than slightly annoyed by the Rihannsu ploy where no indication was given of a continuing series and the conclusion is still not out after more than a year. This ploy is another of the same character (or lack thereof). If you like stories contained in a series of books, that's fine. I sometimes enjoy them. But tell us what we are getting. Don't hide it.I've read book four (DS9) also. I found it even better than this one."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"First off I have to say that I am a bit biased as &quot;That Which Survives&quot;, the episode that this is a sequel to, was one of my favourite shows. Having said that this is yet another recent Star Trek novel that continues the downward slide in the quality of story telling. Here we have a novel that takes 230 plus pages to tell a story that could have been told in 150. It is full of redundant padding, it has one of the most overused Star Trek cliches in the form of the interstellar transporter, the Klingon involvement is an utter waste of time, and the regular Enterprise crew seem to spend much of their time doing nothing. As for the ending it's just another attempt to improve sales by getting people to buy more than one book, but of course if the writing quality of recent Star Trek novels was any good there wouldn't be the problem of falling sales in the first place. Personally this novel, which seems aptly named, is another one that rather than being written seems to have been created by a replicator !!!"},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"This is the only book I've purchased in years that I was unwilling to finish. It's boring beyond belief. And it's poorly written. It reads like a transcript of a role playing game session. Not a very well-moderated rpg, either. At one point, we are told of a grid that measures three point nine four meters by two meters. That's exactly how it's written, too. And at no point do we get to see why the dimensions of the grid make the slightest bit of difference to the players ... oh, characters. The e-book was good for the excerpt of Sir Apropos of Nothing by Peter David, which *sparkles* in comparison to the turgid prose inflicted on an unwitting readership by Ms. Wright."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"I am a loooong time fan of ST. However, I never forayed into reading any of the books, beacause the couple of times I picked one up, the writing [was bad]- effectively turning me off to furhter attempts for a very long time...One day I sat down and started reading this book for the heck of it and was immediately drawn in. All the wonderful cheesiness and derring do! of TOS was perfectly captured in this book. I felt just like I was watching an episode of the series - I could even hear the overblown music and see the wonderfully overdawn and totally sixties costumes on the alien women...I was excited when the ending left me hanging for more...I eagerly picked up the next book....and that's where everything went wrong.... Unlike one of the previous reviewers I don't mind going through a series of books...I love it...I personally prefer \\"Neverending Stories\\" - but the next book is just awful! The writing is reprehensible at best! The characters are just caricatures of people...I can't say enough about how awful it is...I still haven't forced myself to finish the second book...Eventually I suppose I will because I want to know what happens to Capt. Kirk...but oohhhhh - how painful it isRead and love the first book...but be prepared for a massive let down with the second....(I've subsequently started to read some other Trek books and I can't recommend Sarek by A.C. Crispin highly enough...WOW!!!)"},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"The storyline of this book is well documented in other reviews, so I won't rehash it here.The strength of this book is the new alien race introduced. I feel that they were well thought out and executed. Their motives were not at cross purposes to intelligent plotting, and you wound up with a legitimate question as to whether one of the alien crew is a heroic visionary or just psychotic ... and that was very interesting.However, the book was not completed. The cliff hanger at the end is unnecessary and very frustrating. We didn't find out the answer about the alien crew member, nor the consequences of her actions. I've just started reading this series, and I have no idea where to go for the rest of the story, nor even if there IS anywhere to go for it.Most of the actions and thoughts of the Enterprise crew made sense. However, after the aliens destroyed a Klingon ship that was about to destroy the Enterprise, I think the author had the Enterprise officers doing a bit too much hand wringing about why the aliens finished off the ship. That motif is much more appropriate in the Next Gen setting than a TOS setting.Another quibble is that the author has Spock figuring out the coordinates of Starfleet HQ to \\"set\\" the gateway to open to it. Considering that Starfleet HQ is on a planet that is rotating about its axis, and is revolving around a star which is constantly in motion relative to the rest of the galaxy (at 132 miles per second), having even Spock do this \\"in his head\\" is more than a reach.Finally, the author placed the Enterprise crew in the midst of a fascinating setting. However, their interactions and discoveries in that setting were decidedly pedestrian. A little more imagination and fun factor was needed there.The book is well worth a read for a TOS fan. However, I don't recommend reading it unless you already know where to go to finish the storyline.Note: With some research after writing the above, I found that all of the Gateways books have cliff hanger endings. The endings are all wrapped up in the 7th book. Essentially this was a scam to keep everyone hooked on the series, and in the end to buy an extra book that you shouldn't really need to. The 7th book is essentially the last chapter(s) of each of the first six. So you can safely read this book if you also have book 7, and go directly from the last page of this book to the concluding installment of it in book 7, without reading books 2 through 6 first.Sadly, the climax of the story in Gateways 7 was not as well thought out as the first of the story here in Book 1. Kirk's ultimate escape makes little sense. It seems that an alien civilization that has been spacefaring for generations, at least, does not possess hand weapons or emergency internal communications in their most important city. They also somehow made an unconscious decision to begin communicating in English, a language unknown to all but one of them, the moment Kirk became a fugitive on their planet.This is what often happens when an author writes themself into a corner and lacks the originality, energy, or wit to make sure that their finale makes sense."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"This is getting totally pitiful. The mini-series junk trying to span stories through all the different genres of StarTrek in my opinion belongs in the trash. Pocket Books is making a big mistake. I for one only care for the original cast books. I buy one to read (which I've read them all) and I get no ending unless I go read Next Generation and then the next genre and the next and the one after that.YUCK!!"},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"When I bought the book I had pretty high expectations. I was a little disappointed with the book. Like some people have pointed out it had little action. At the end I got plenty interested but then it leaves you hanging. The characters for me were pretty accurate, (Kirk, Spock, Scotty, etc.) but the Petraw really didn't intrigued me that much since there was so little about them and pretty similar except for one major character. The book is pretty much an introduction into the series. Hopefully the other five books have more action and the 7th one should tie everything together."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"One of the worst ST novels I have ever read. It is a simple idea drawn out to 200+ pages, and the characters basically do nothing. I will not be reading any of the other six in the &quot;mini-series.&quot; I actually yawned while I was reading it. If you're looking for some good ST novels, check out those by Peter David. In my opinion, he never misses the mark."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"This whole book is essentially an epilogue to the TOS episode \\"That Which Survives.\\" So if you've always wanted to see what happens immediately after the events of that episode, then this is the book for you. But if not, then you might want to skip it.The characterization is OK, and obviously Wright has been watching her TOS videos. In fact, that's part of the problem for me. This book is a by-the-numbers pastiche. The characters all say and do what they would in a TV episode, but who cares? There's no real story. It's all a matter of tying up loose ends from the TV episode and creating some new loose ends for the other 6 books in this Gateway series. This book owes its existence to a marketing strategy, not to artistic inspiration. It exists only to fill the TOS slot in the Gateway series.And be warned: this book ends in a cliffhanger that you have to buy the hardcover book to resolve."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"I thought that this was a very fun book to read. It was a little slow at times as some of mechanics of the computers were being explained in detail, but it was well worth the read. I especially liked how it is based at the end of a previous Star Trek episode, and how the author took it even further. This would have made a great 2nd part of the episode. The characters, both old and new, were portrayed well. I would recommend this book as well as the next book in the Gateways series."},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"I enjoyed the book and was excited about the hung ending.I jumped to read the second book to find out it had nothing to do with book one.

Editor John Ordover has been doing wonders with Pocket's entire &quot;Star Trek&quot; line, and I especially appreciate these event storylines that never seem too forced while they jump between the various incarnations of the franchise. Susan Wright's opener to the &quot;Gateways&quot; storyline sees her in fine form. I'm an avid reader of these books, and quite frankly nobody catches the voices and mannerisms of these time-honored characters better than she. In &quot;Gateways&quot; Ms. Wright keeps Kirk, Spock and McCoy's motivations &quot;pure&quot; to each character, meaning that I never hear the author editorializing through them, nor do I catch her manipulating them in order to forward the storyline. Finally, Ms. Wright deftly retrofits &quot;Trek&quot; continuity that we might have learned in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; or even in &quot;Voyager&quot; back into the time of the original series (e.g. Klingon references to Kahless) without distracting &quot;in-your-face&quot; bravado. I'm looking forward to seeing how she helps wrap up the storyline in the final &quot;Gateways&quot; jam session!"},{"Title":"Gateways #1: One Small Step (Star Trek)","review":"I've noticed that we are now getting TV episodes and to continue the story in novelizations. &quot;One Which Survives&quot; is the TV episode and &quot;One Small Step&quot; is the continuation of the story.Now, I did like both of the above, but I believe that we need a little more originality. Not that combining both is a bad idea. But new stories need to be written in single complete books. I am not fond of the trend of &quot;Mini-series in the Star trek genre. This tends to lead the reader on like a marketing trick.But enough of this, now the book itself is inself a good read fast and about James T. Kirk et.al stranded on a planetoid. Ancient in build and far far advanced of anything known to the Federation.The planetoid defense system tranported the Enterprise to an unheard of distance from it. Now Scotty has to bring in back. Kirk, McCoy and Sulu can not get back to the Enterprise when it does arrive due to and infection that can't clear the biofilters of the Enterprise's transporters.Now, comes another alien race claiming the planetoid as their own left by their ancesters. Kirk explores the planetoid and wehave Spock trying to figure out how things work.The aliens work out the problem with the infection, Kirk doesn't trust them. We meet Losira even though she has passed long ago, but her presence is preserved in the computer of the planetiod.A gateway is found, not unlike the &quot;Guardian of Forever&quot; and the aliens want the technology to transport across large distances of space.The book ends as a cliffhanger.

This book is full of adventure. It's definately a must read."},{"Title":"Exiled from Eden","review":"WHY LIFE?What a fascinating and thought provoking novel! Readers of the Bible tend to forget that its record is grossly condensed. This story gave me an opportunity to think more deeply about the real challenges faced by our first parents when they left the Garden of Eden. Where did they sleep that first night? What did they eat? How did they establish a viable society?When our first parents first left the Garden everything in their world changed dramatically. Animals that had been friendly, and responded to their wishes suddenly became vicious or obstinate. The weather changed spectacularly, introducing storms and problems to which they had never been exposed. Where they had always been able to eat simply by picking fruit that grew spontaneously, they now had to find food with which they were unfamiliar in an alien world filled with danger. They had no shelter, no hardware store, no community midwife. Everything they did was without precedent.They were the first ones who had to experiment with raising teenagers. As their children came, as is obvious from the scriptural account, they encountered severe conflicts. These became more severe and diverse as their family grew. Adam was faced with the challenge of establishing the first government. While this started out simply enough it grew with the family until it became a basis for conflict and even war.The story deals primarily with the first 150 years of Adam's 930 years of life. During this time, since the normal life span and child bearing period was much longer that now, and since everyone in the beginning was young, the population exploded into thousands. Groups gradually separated into different geographic areas that developed different traditions and interests. The climactic focus of the book deals with the conflict between Cain and Abel. How did it develop? Where did it lead? What were the implications of the things each of them did?The Fall and expulsion from Eden obviously had a purpose, which was well known and anticipated by the Lord. In preparation, Adam and Eve must have had some significant training and preparation, or they could never have survived for long in the alien world into which they were thrust. Even with this, however, many of their challenges were almost insurmountable, and all of them were new experiences.I have encountered those who feel Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden because they did something that upset the Lord's plan, that, except for them, we would all have lived in the peace and tranquility of Eden. That idea does not make any sense when we look at what happened as a result. The author of this fictional account has shown how much both they and we benefit from the challenges our present world imposes upon us. They had to learn their purpose in life, as we do, and achieve it. Following them through some of the problems they faced, even in fiction, helped me see how the challenges of my own life have purpose as well.The book is very well written. It flows fast with enough tension and adventure to keep me reading into the night. I found that each crisis they faced had some application in my own life, so I was ever feeling I was living through their problems with them. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Story of Atonement","review":"Many stumble to describe or explain atonement, a subject that mystifies many.

The book is the result of years of observation and interviews and provides a framework by which you can assess your organization, and create an action plan for yourself and your workplace.What I liked about the book was the way it organized a way of thinking about what makes for a workplace that works for the people that inhabit it, and respects us as individuals. In that organization is both a teaching tool and a way of doing assessment that leads to action. For you quality professionals, it's a way of doing \\"Plan-Do-Study-Act\\" around the topic of workplace environment.

I expected to read yet another business book directed solely toward owners, executives, and managers. This specialized audience will gain quite a lot from this book, but so will &quot;ordinary employees.&quot; 22 Keys is an Everyman's book, written in a tone that encourages focused initiative by all sorts of readers. Not only does this approach add value to the book, it makes it much more salable in bulk to companies interested in changing their work environment.Corporate culture has been defined as &quot;what it feels like to work here.&quot; Terez has captured what people are looking for in today's work environment in his exploration of what it takes to create a meaningful workplace. Before going any further, it's important to list the 22 Keys. As you read this list, pause at each one and think about how it relates to your personal situation. Purpose, Direction, Relevance, Validation, Respect, Equality, Informality, Flexibility, Ownership, Challenge, Invention, Support, Personal Development, Dialogue, Relationship Building, Service, Acknowledgement, Oneness, Self-Identity, Fit, Balance, and Worth.Each key is presented in a chapter heavily seasoned with vignettes that hold the reader's attention. Not all the stories have happy endings, making this book even more valuable. It's not a quick-and-easy-guide-to-Nirvana, but is a realistic presentation. Questions challenge the reader's thinking and, hopefully, stimulate behavior. Actions by others are described to build a sense of confidence that the reader can also do these things and make a difference.The book has a number of features that increase its readability and usefulness. Reality checks at the end of each chapter focus the reader's attention. Did you get the message? Quotations, liberally sprinkled throughout the book, stimulate thought. I felt the author could have done with a few less quotes, but that's a very minor issue. One of the pages I turned down (there were many) marks a quote by Albert Einstein: &quot;Not everything that can be counted counts, but not everything that counts can be counted.&quot; When we're all looking to measure our performance, yet at the same time achieve life-work balance, the quote is meaningful. Ah! Meaningful. The objective of the book: well-achieved. The action plans will help you get started to make a difference in your organization.This book will be around for a while. It fits comfortably with what needs to be done in the world of work-in the private sector, in government, in non-profits, in education.

Although it appears Grayson's mother committed suicide, the clue and her intuition lead her to believe otherwise.At the same time she must fight her own fears that perhaps she, like her mother, is suffering from paranoia and may have inherited some of her mother's mental problems.Given this, Grayson, must examine her past life with her father and mother and her present relationships with her fiance. We are left to wonder if Grayson could be wrong in her suspicions.Although the ending is somewhat predictable, we are led there by captivating monologue which will raise questions about family,love and most of all loyalty. Along the way we are treated to a nice taste of New Orleans and Mardi Gras."},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"Upon being dragged, by my husband, to a book reading for Ms. Dewberry's husband, Robert Olen Butler, I surprisingly found myself purchasing Elizebeth Dewberry's novel, Sacrement of Lies.I suppose I was intrigued, since the novel's backdrop is based in my hometown, New Orleans. Whatever the reason, I am thouroughly pleased with my purchase as I was unable to put the book down. Ms. Dewberry tells a fascinating murder mystery through the mind and encounters of her protagonist, Grayson Giullory. Using analogies which are clever and easy to relate to, her writing style is refreshingly different. Truly a pageturner, Sacrament of Lies, is now one of my top ten favorite reads. I look forward to reading her other works!"},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"Dewberry's heroine, Grayson, is the daughter of an imaginary governor of Louisiana. We meet her as she begins to wonder if her father killed her mentally-disturbed mother -- or if her speculations are merely the product of her own disturbed mind.It is a gripping idea. Imagine that you're related to a powerful governor: to whom do you relate your suspicions? The troopers are sworn to guard the governor, not question his behavior. And as another politician notes, this governor is good for the state. His rival would actually do harm.Following a divorce, Grayson now lives with a man who works for her father. She herself does some unspecified work for the family. She's truly surrounded.As other reviewers note, the ending is disappointing: it depends on coincidence and not on the heroine's own cleverness. Yet even earlier, I began to wonder: How realistic is this situation? And I began to get impatient with Grayson. Why doesn't this smart, well-educated, reasonably well-off woman get herself some good professional psychotherapy? She doesn't have to go to her mother's psychiatrist: Tulane boasts a first-rate medical school. Her most pressing problem, of course, is \\"Did father kill mother?\\" But long ago she should have faced a longer-term issue: life without father. She needs to grow up and find her own place in life, make friends with people who don't know her father, and find something to do with herself.The New Orleans background was well-done. It helps if you've read Julie Smith's Skip Landon series. Skip broke away from the unique social pressures of the city. Grayson needs to do the same."},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"\\"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you...\\" A mentally ill woman in her thirties unravels, then unravels the truth. If you loved A Thousand Acres as a retelling of Lear, you will enjoy this book as a modern retelling of Hamlet, replete with visits from beyond the grave and a male Ophelia who meets a watery death. The writing is fantastic, and the story is a maze, winding tighter and tighter until the center is reached. Readers looking for a standard psychological thriller might want to keep looking, as there's not much sleuthing here. What the book does show, and show perfectly, is the effect of fear and depression on a person's ability to function on even the basic level. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"Great premise and a very involving plotline. Nicely done (and accurate) description of depression and its influence on one's reality. For once, the old phrase, \\"couldn't put it down\\" is true; I literally did not put it down until the end...and that involved toting it to meals, too!"},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"I found this paperback in a bookstore bargain bin yesterday for fifty cents. I grabbed it because I had to take my employer-owned SUV to one place for annual inspection, and another place for thorough washing, and I knew both places would have long waits. Ms. Dewberry has created a wonderfully sexy, sanity-doubting heroine one roots for all the way. Big-time political corruption and ambition is the central evil here, a cancer that threatens her parents and her marriage. Once I started, I was reluctant to put it down, and I made the time needed to finish it by bedtime. The only weak spot, unfortunately, is that the climatic confrontation with the real villain seems to get off to too leisurely a start, then too frenetic an end. That is normally a big flaw in a book that spends 220 pages getting to the final scenes, but the ride to that moment was so enjoyable for me that I forgive it. Would I have liked it this much if I had paid the original cover price? Honestly, probably not, but I'm a cheapskate. I would have only knocked one star off had this been a larger investment, or a half-star. And if I find other Dewberry novels for affordable prices, I will happily grab them. She has a knack for apt and brief descriptions of the environment trapping her characters, and I enjoyed her Baton Rouge and New Orleans settings very much."},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"As the daughter of the Governor of Louisiana one would think that Grayson had everything. However, she is reeling from the shock of her mother's apparent suicide and her father's reaction ofthe death. Governor Guillory immediately cremates his spouse. Not long afterward, he remarries his sister-in-law knowing he needs a stable steady wife for his bid to gain the White House. Meanwhile Grayson remains grieving her mom's death, but as her mind clears she begins to wonder if her father had her mother murdered.As Grayson relooks what she knows about that terrible night, she contemplates whether she is insane having inherited her mother's mental problems or is she the daughter of a matricide killer. Grayson concludes with a strong certainty that her father is capable of removing a wife by homicide that would derail his presidency run. Still she questions her paranoia speculating the role her husband played in the death of her mother and whether the two males will remove her too if she makes waves that threaten to flood the presidential run.As Blue Hen advertises, SACRAMENT OF LIES modernizes Hamlet with a gender-changing lead role. The story line is superb due to Grayson with her doubts about her mind and the men in her life. This serves to make her plight feel real, while leaving the audience to speculate on the truth. Fans of taut psychological thrillers will fully relish her quandary and want to read more tales by Elizabeth Dewberry.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"i've read and enjoyed ms. dewberry's other books but found this one disappointing. the character development wasn't much but the ending didn't work at all. i wish she'd taken time to develop this more because it's a wonderful idea and could've been a great book."},{"Title":"Sacrament of Lies","review":"What was touted as a murder mystery was in truth a uneven monologue by the suspicious daughter of a power hungry politician.

It's amazing to see all the different types of nests that birds make. These creatures have true workmanship. It must have been a great challenge for the photographer(s) to find and photograph all the different nests throughout this fascinating book. You don't see many books out there on the market like this, so I recommend it."},{"Title":"Peterson Field Guide: Eastern Birds' Nests","review":"This book has information which to my knowledge cannot be found anywhere else.

I wanted people to be able to see the difference between the nests built by bluebirds as compared to house sparrows, for instance. Also, I needed to show the different colors of eggs.This book was absolutely essential for this. Once examining the photos in the book and reading the text, people were easily able to identify the different kinds of nests that had been built in the boxes we were monitoring."},{"Title":"Peterson Field Guide: Eastern Birds' Nests","review":"I discovered this book while doing coursework at a teacher institute in northern Wisconsin. Like many amateur naturalists, finding an egg that has fallen from a nest is a momentous event, but I wasn't always sure of the bird that laid that egg. While I still might need to actually connect the actual bird with the egg visually, this guide goes a long way toward narrowing my choices.A list of characteristics, such as oval, long and short pyriform shape, is clearly illustrated in a chart on the endpaper, accompanied by a ruler for measuring in the field. Most incredible to me are the photographs of bird nests in site containing typical egg clutches. Anyone who is a birder knows that these nests are very often difficult to access, as high as 80 feet up a tree! For the photographers to have not only located, but photographed, all these nests is nothing short of remarkable--and helpful. Detailed descriptions accompany the photos. The book is arranged in taxonomic order, making it easy for those of us used to this arrangement.The average birdwatcher will probably be happy with a basic field guide to identify birds by sight. For those of us who always need \\"just one more field guide,\\" this guide to nests is a unique addition to that ever-growing library."},{"Title":"Peterson Field Guide: Eastern Birds' Nests","review":"We used this book as part of a homeschool/4H project to identify nests that we had found on our property.

This book soon solved the problem!It is a fairly recent update of a classic Peterson guide although having seen the original, the plates and text haven't actually changed very much (photos a little brighter perhaps, and stronger paper).The format is very simple with each species having its own page. This page contains a colour plate of a typical nest with eggs, then a written description of a typical nest site (habitat, type of tree the nest is usually found in, nest materials etc) and nest height, plus the appearance of the eggs and their average size and number. There is also a paragraph on the species' nesting range and sometimes a snippet of interesting information (these little tid-bits make interesting reading, usually referring to a species peculiar nesting habits or unusual examples of nesting). I like to have this book in the field as a reference because it is small and slim and fits easily into a back pack but I also enjoy just dipping into it at home when I see a particular (regardless of whether I find its nest or not).It's a really sweet book and not very expensive, and I think many people would enjoy having this on their shelves for reference as well as general reading.

It is not a textbook. It is for the thirty or forty million people who want very valuable, applicable working knowledge and prefer to spend five hours a week in the field rather than in a classroom."},{"Title":"Peterson Field Guide: Eastern Birds' Nests","review":"For me, the Holy Grail of nests is that of the ruby-throated hummingbird. (This is the only species native to the Chicago area.) But I appreciate the insights into the natural world any bird's nest can offer: the materials they use, the intricacies of construction, etc. Sometimes I find remnants of an egg or a whole nest blown from a tree, or I see an actual nest in a tree or a bush, and this book helps me to pretty accurately identify the bird that hatched from the egg or built the nest.The photographs in this book are good: taken from above, looking down into the nest, and featuring eggs. A description of the species, the nest itself, and the eggs follows, and there's also a little illustration of the adult bird.Unfortunately, it's rare that you come upon a nest that is below eye-level, so the photos are not always useful. It would be great if the author included another picture, even a sketch, of the nest as it would appear in situ. For example, the Baltimore Oriole has a beautifully woven nest that hangs from a branch of a tall tree. Experienced birders have pointed these nests out to me, so I know how to identify them, but I would not have known from the written description in the book. Now that I've seen the oriole's nest, the description seems accurate, but I would not have really known what to look for out in the field.I hope a future edition of this book includes thumbnails of the nest \\"in profile.\\"Every birder (and nature lover) should include this book in his or her personal library.

If you are an experienced enterprise application developer working on the .NET platform and interested in what WMI can do to replace legacy solutions such as SNMP, this book is an excellent choice. Just enough attention is given to the history of WBEM, the overview of the WMI/CIM environment, the elements of the SDK, and the query methodologies of WMI, before spending the remainder of the book creating a solution to an example scenario, that anyone ready to \\"take the plunge\\" will not be disappointed.Another quote on the back cover, as well as within the introduction section, states that \\"...[this book] is an essential companion for network administrators, software developers and team leaders looking to become proficient with WMI\\". Well, one third of that is true. I can't image what network administrator would find this title beneficial, as network administrators leverage WMI in automation and data gathering scripts or within applications such as SMS 2003. This title is not only not a traditional reference for the individual elements of WMI, nowhere in the title does it even cover the scriptable aspects of WMI. As for team leaders, if the team leader needs and introduction and administrative overview of what WMI is and what WMI's capabilities are, again, this is not the right title. For those two users I would recommend starting with Microsoft's free on-line WMI Scripting Primer (Microsoft Windows 2000 Scripting Guide) as it is straightforward, uncomplicated, and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Developing WMI Solutions: A Guide to Windows Management Instrumentation","review":"A significant component of the Total Cost of Ownership of a network of personal computers is due to the myriad different pieces of hardware and software that these can contain; invariably from a slew of vendors. Integrating and managing the totality can be quite labour intensive for the systems administrator. Also too for the developer; whether she is writing the interface for a piece of software that others will use or if she is on the other side, and has to write code that runs that package and others.Accordingly, Microsoft has pushed forward Windows Management Instrumentation. The book describes how to use WMI straightforwardly. You do need to know C++, COM and Active Template Library. No surprise there. Several sections also describe using the still new C# and .NET to write OO applications that easily connect to WMI. If you have not used C# and .NET, the book's coverage is concise enough to get you started. The authors treat a minimal subset that is enough for you to do useful work vis-a-vis WMI.On the scripting aspect, the authors rightly give this careful coverage. Scripting files may not have the sexy appeal of a GUI-driven methodology. But in fact, for automated systems administration of many machines, they are usually far more important. Veterans of DOS and Unix batch file writing will see much of familiar approaches here.Part of Microsoft's incentive for promoting WMI is to help it stay ahead of linux. The basic functionality of a browser and Microsoft Office are already in various linux applications. So at least in the network sphere, WMI helps Microsoft hold off linux. The authors do not discuss this, but if you read this book, you should keep it in mind; in the broader context of where the PC market is going."},{"Title":"Developing WMI Solutions: A Guide to Windows Management Instrumentation","review":"It still remains possible that this is the best book out there on WMI - the other reviews like it and the alternatives do not seem inspiring.

This is a nice tutorial for developers.Chapter 5 introduces the user to the creation of CIM class schemas. The CIM model presented is a bit outdated as the DMTF CIM model is constantly changing.

Yes, I laughed many times while reading The Mysterious Mr. I, but I was also riveted with fascination as the layers of confusion and lies unfolded. Every chapter would seem to wrap things up in a deceptively simple way, only to peel away another layer of amazing intricacy. The ways in which the myriad sub-plots all mesh together is nothing short of miraculous.I read the sequel, \\"The Chameleon,\\" immediately after finishing \\"The Mysterious Mr. I\\". They were bound together in a single volume in my edition, and I think this helped the flow a great deal, since they were written at the same time, as a single manuscript, then separated by the publisher. Indeed, \\"The Mysterious Mr. I\\" ends fairly abruptly before more than a few hours have passed since the beginning. The whole story covers a full day from 4AM until midnight, and while the first book feels distinctly unfinished, the two together come to a wonderfully tight conclusion that holds pressure until the very last page."},{"Title":"Atheism in Christianity;: The religion of the Exodus and the Kingdom","review":"Bloch, as most people know, is an &quot;esoteric marxist&quot;, like Luk&aacute;cs and Korsch. Esoteric marxism is a reaction against the official leninist-stalinist interpretation of Marx. In Bloch's view, the marxists have to re-interprete the religious phenomenon. Bloch says that inside christianism there is a feeling that also -in his view, I remark- informs marxist philosophy: hope. Both phenomenons, marxism and christianism, believe in a utopia that will become true in the future. &quot;Where is religion, there is hope&quot;, says Bloch. This feeling can unite marxists ans christians, and has to be the base for a new dialogue. I have to say that Bloch vision of christianism, like the vision of any other functionalist, is reductionist. In his conception, christianism looses all trascendence. It is a &quot;phenomenon&quot;, like any other. He says that religion is an expresion of protest, which every marxist has to respect -typical marxist interpretation-, but religion is much more than just a protest against the statu quo, and being religious means much more than just believing in a &quot;utopia&quot;, that in the future will become true. Religion means to believe in God. Of course, Bloch doesn't believe in God, or in the inmortality of the soul. He only appreciates the external manifestation of faith, but the most important part -God, eternal life, holyness- are nonsense for him. Bloch vision of religion is the stereotype of functionalism."},{"Title":"Jem, secret star","review":"The book was in perfect condition and took less time to ship than the computer predicted!!

I learned more about the life of Emily Dickinson in just half an hour than I had ever known about her. It certainly shows that Dickinson wasn't the lonely recluse that I had always heard her to be. In addition to photographs, there are many facsimile reprints of letters written both by Emily Dickinson and to her. I believe this book will be very helpful to future biographers and historians."},{"Title":"The World of Emily Dickinson","review":"You can never go wrong buying a book by Polly Longsworth. Especially if it is about enigmatic,obstinate Emily Dickinson. Ms. Longsworth knows her subject as well as, or better than, any other active ED author. She has a common-sense approach to the famous ED obscurities and mysteries, born of decades of study and the influence of Richard Benson Sewall, Yale professor and creator of the Pulitzer-prize winning \\"Life of Emily Dickinson\\" in l974. That's the best biography of the poet we have or are ever likely to have. Polly writes well and this book shows off the Amherst of ED's era in ways that nicely complement the text and the poetry. She's also a nice person, kind to other ED researchers, both professional and amateur. Not everyone in that specialty qualifies for such a compliment. As a person who has written a play about Emily's survivors and how they struggled to get her poems published, I have had reason to correspond with lots of Dickinson buffs over a 20-year period. Polly and Sewall and William Luce, author of the play \\"Belle of Amherst\\" made room in their lives for letters from an unknown. Many others did not.

It can also be used as a guide book for leading a life promoting innovation through creativity.The book has three distinct but closely related parts: The Creative Mind, The Ethics of Creativity and The Politics of Innovation, explaining how the building blocks of creativity - inspiration, imagination, sense of beauty, integrity, persistence, vision and learning - all lead to innovation. While one could use this as a resource for inspiration and as a guidebook for practicing and promoting creativity in everyday life, the author makes no efforts to sell the book as such. Instead, he has opted for a conversational style that aids critical reading, and inspires further thinking. This helps to frequently stop and think about the material, and to inquire the logic. The language is very crisp and to the point. The editing is very sharp. One could read the book just for the anecdotes, both historic and the contemporary ones, which are plentiful in the book. The notes at the end is really an annotated bibliography, which can also be very useful.This is a great antidote for the current day world where success is often wrongly equated with &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;immediate&quot;, &quot;creating powerpoint slides&quot;, ... and the likes; where, the examination of things is becoming increasingly superficial, and the critical evaluations are frequently regarded as a hindrance to &quot;productivity&quot;, and where the incompetence is frequently promoted for the resulting political expediencies. Dr Grudin explains why some people despise the concept of &quot;working the system&quot; to your advantage, and why they often take routes that look more elaborate and longer. He explains what is it that some people who get paid for forty-hours but seem to be always at work, are seeking and what drives them to voluntarily opt for such practices of hardwork and dedication. He explains why some people seem to take so much interest in every project around them, and seem to bounce back to success and happiness, from every failure they encounter. And, finally, he convinces us how creative work, even at the modest levels, can be the key to happiness.By not casting its title with something like &quot;N-practices of super-creative people&quot; or something akin to that, and instead giving it the current title, and thus choosing honesty and class over marketing, Dr Grudin has put to practice what he preaches in the book. But if that makes you not consider this book, it's your loss!A great baedeker for people and organizations wanting to promote creativity, and through creativity, innovation."},{"Title":"The Grace of Great Things: Creativity and Innovation","review":"The topic sentence of this book is &quot;We see human civilization as having risen to eminence among other species through political, scientific, and technological innnovation.&quot; This sets the tone for a humanistic course the the forms of creativity through history.

In comes through in the sense of reflection, and the connection to great humanists through time.A note of caution. The wordsmithing in this book is tight. While not a bad thing, that may lesson the appeal of this book for some. Also, the title doesn't exactly reasonate, since the theme of &quot;grace&quot; is never dealt with, and while Creativity is one of the great natures, it seems a stretch.Had I not met the author in person, I would have never considered reading this book; Now, I wonder if it would be possible to take a class from him.If you are looking for an exceptional find, this is one."},{"Title":"The Grace of Great Things: Creativity and Innovation","review":"My twin brother Peter and I read this book aloud to eachother on a car trip from Boston to CT. -- and back again.

He writes with a clarity and wit that is all to rare these days, and this is his best book."},{"Title":"The Grace of Great Things: Creativity and Innovation","review":"This book has the widest girth and the steeliest breadth in ideas since Ayn Rand's philosophy emerged back in the 1960s or since Gilbert Highet's publication of \\"The Golden Age,\\" in the 1940s. Gruden touches on the idea of freedom as a key word in liberal ideology but whose substance is non-existent or is completely contradictory. Gruden gives this concept substance by defining it in terms of creativity, creativity being a subversive act that reinvents traditional notions of reality.Creativity then for Gruden is the only freedom offered to social human beings. His ideas on innovation and diplomacy presume a benevolence that is definitely arguable against the facts of social reality and its institutions. If a John Galt or a Hank Reardon would follow Robert Gruden's advice, either of these two heroes from Ayn Rand's novels would appear as mincing yes-men, not the antithesis of altruistic compromise their very natures compel them to be. This chapter and his ideas in it were the weakest aspects of Gruden's entire body of thought.But Gruden's invocations to and evocations of greatness vis a vis the great arc of creativity which spans from time past to time present by virtue of discovering what is permanent in the life of man was absolutely breathtaking and commanded my respect.I enjoyed Gruden's references to Montaigne and his selective handling of Plato's philosophy. Gruden's ideas of beauty are implicitly Platonic but with some special difference. His ideas on beauty are not \\"purely ideal.\\" The beauty inherent in, say, an idea, while appearing to be abstract, must be rooted in the concrete of man's daily life, not merely adhering to some other abstract theory or standard of beauty taking from the World of Forms. I also liked Gruden's analysis of the definition and concept of analysis. It was in this chapter that I was able to see Gruden's great respect for the human mind and for human creativity as well as his criticism of objectivity and definitions.I think Gruden might well be classified as a Platonic Empiricist.243 pages"},{"Title":"The Grace of Great Things: Creativity and Innovation","review":"I stumbled onto Robert Grudin's book on creativity and innovation over a decade ago, and have turned to it at least a half dozen times each year since. This is a scholarly and passionate effort -- one that encourages (and explains) ideas people, and gets the reader to think deeper about inhabiting and nurturing that role in society, business and life.I find it an agreeable companion to works such as Seth Godin's 'Linchpin,' Robert McKee's 'Story,' Jack Foster's 'How To Get Ideas,' Anne Lamott's 'Bird By Bird,' Stephen King's 'On Writing,' Luke Sullivan's 'Hey Whipple,' Chip and Dan Heath's 'Made to Stick,' and The Book of Gossage. It will inspire writers, designers, scientists, theologians. I think it can help managers and bureaucrats understand the volatility and importance of ideas and idea people.The Grace of Great Things offers keen insights into the inception of ideas across numerous fields (akin to and taken further than Rollo May's 'The Courage to Create'). I especially enjoy Grudin's efforts in clarifying the politics and responsibilities of being an ideas person as well as his solutions for the challenges facing those who aspire to bring ideas into the world.I've made this book required reading in several marketing and advertising courses I've taught. Too bad it's out of print (hello, Ticknor & Fields?). And the (red/brown and black) cover image shown on Amazon is likely for the hard cover edition. (I've never owned one, only softcover.) The softcover copies all use a white wrap with calligraphy title text and artwork of two white pencils facing each other underneath a white cloud. Some softcover wraps include bio and description info on the inside folds, while other copies are blank on the inside -- seems like every third copy I acquire has blank inside folds. And at times the softcover title text includes additional color (hot pink, purple) behind the words &#34;Grace&#34; as well as the &#34;G&#34; of &#34;great&#34; and &#34;T&#34; of &#34;things.&#34; Chalk it up to different printing editions.All in all, a must-read for anyone who creates and nurtures ideas for a living."},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"\\"The Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam\\" translated by Peter Avery and John Heath-Stubbs is available in two Penguin editions. This edition (ISBN 01400595447) comes in a larger format with 32 beautiful colored illustrations of Persian miniature paintings from the 16th and 17th century, and an essay on the history of the miniatures that points out the influence of Chinese painting on Persian graphic arts (an interesting subject in itself). The other edition is the Penguin Classics edition (ISBN 0140443843), which is identical to this edition but lacks the illustrations and the essay on Persian graphic arts. The illustrated, larger sized edition is definitely worth the slightly higher price, in my opinion.A reader who is familiar with FitzGerald's classic \\"re-creation\\" - \\"translation\\" is a term that is too weak in this context - will be surprised at the defiant materialism of Omar Khayyam's quatrains in Avery's literal translation stripped of the poetic spark of FitzGerald's work.For example, while the Victorian gentleman Edward FitzGerald chose to translate Omar Khayyam's praise of simple joys and poetry in his famous \\"A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, / A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread - and Thou / Beside me singing in the Wilderness - / Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!\\", Peter Avery gives us not only a more literal translation (#98) but also a much more worldly (and spicy) version of the same theme:If chance supplied a loaf of white bread,Two casks of wine and a leg of mutton,In the corner of a garden with a tulip-cheeked girlThere'd be enjoyment no Sultan could outdo. (#234)In his introduction, Peter Avery points out that the ruba'i (quatrain) was the favorite verse form among intellectuals, \\"those philosophers and mystics in eleventh- and twelfth-century Persia who were in some degree non-conformists opposed to religious fanatism, so that they have often been called Islam's free-thinkers.\\" And a free-thinker Omar Khayyam was. He did not believe in the cardinal Muslim tenet of the resurrection of the body after death, and he suggested that drinking wine was better than worrying about abstruse religious theories and dogmas. In an instance that must have been particularly enraging for orthodox Muslims he turned the argument for future rewards in paradise on its head by thinking it through to its logical end:They promise there will be Paradise and the houri-eyed,Where clear wine and honey will flow:Should we prefer wine and a lover, what's the harm?Are not these the final recompense? (#88)(the \\"houri-eyed\\" are beautiful girls, by the way)In another slyly funny (and self-critical) quatrain, Omar Khayyam pushes his skepticism and blunt honesty even further:A religious man said to a whore, \\"You're drunk,Caught every moment in a different snare.\\"She replied, \\"Oh Shaikh, I am what you say,Are you what you seem?\\"(#86)Peter Avery's translations stress the worldly, materialistic side of Omar Khayyam, which is rooted in his conviction that nothing lasts but the joys experienced in the present moment. What I missed in Peter Avery's translations, though, was the joy Omar Khayyam must have felt when he created a new quatrain to remind himself to seize the day, to change his state of mind (that's a polite way of describing \\"to get drunk\\") or just to invent a polished metaphor or rhyme. FitzGerald captured this redeeming poetic beauty of Omar Khayyam's work so well that his rendition of the Rubaiyat remains a benchmark true to the spirit if not the letter of the Persian poet:And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky,Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die,Lift not your hands to It for help - for ItAs impotently moves as you or I.(while Avery translates with the intention \\"to give as literal an English version of the Persian originals as readability and intelligibility permit\\":)The good and evil that are in man's heart,The joy and sorrow that are our fortune and destiny,Do not impute them to the wheel of heaven because, in the light of reason,The wheel is a thousand times more helpless than you. (#34)Buy this edition for the invaluable introduction, for the contrast to FitzGerald's rendition, and quite simply to get a feeling for Omar Khayyam's blunt honesty; but do buy a book with FitzGerald's version, preferably the out-of-print edition with English novelist A.S. Byatt's introduction (\\"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\\", ASIN 0965231240).And lest anyone should think Omar Khayyam was only a frivolous, inebriated hedonist, here are two of my favorite quatrains from Peter Avery's and John Heath-Stubbs's book:If the heart could grasp the meaning of life,In death it would know the mystery of God;Today when you are in possession of yourself, you know nothing.Tomorrow when you leave yourself behind, what will you know? (#5)It is we who are the source of our own happiness, the mine of our own sorrow,The repository of justice and foundation of iniquity;We who are cast down and exalted, perfect and defective,At once the rusted mirror and Jamshid's all-seeing cup. (#211)(Avery explains that to the Persian culture hero Jamshid or Jam was attributed a magic cup in which he could see time past, present and future and all the world, and by which like Joseph with his silver cup, he could divine (Genesis xliv, 4-5).)"},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"I first read this work of art a month ago, and many times after that. My parents were surprised that I, being 14 years of age, liked it, although I think anyone with a bit of an understanding towards life would enjoy it. Being Persian myslef, and knowledgable towards the history of Omar Khayyam and his time,I read this book in Persian, English and French. Although I think that without doubt anyone who is able to should read the Persian edition, the English translation did not lose the touch and certain charm of the works. Don't underestimate your children either. I mean hey, give it a shot, they might like it!"},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"It is somewhat ironic (one might say \\"tragic\\") that Amazon chooses to lump reviews of multiple translations into each version of a book; in the case of the Rubaiyat, the two prevailing translations--FitzGerald's, and Avery and Heath-Stubbs'--could not be more different. As a general reader not terribly knowledgeable about Persian literature, I struggled before deciding on which version to read; influenced by the leading reviewer on this page, I read theFitzGerald versionwith illustrations by Dulac and the introduction by Byatt.As a reader and occasional translator of a foreign language myself (although Japanese, not Persian) I was hesitant to read a version (one hesitates to call it a \\"translation\\") this old and this famously derided for its looseness with the original work by Omar Khayyam. And yet after comparing the two translations, I am glad that I read FitzGerald, for two main reasons.First, true to his intention, FitzGerald accentuated the spirit of the original over the literal translation/transliteration of the original. The delightful impishness of Khayyam and the melancholy ephemerality of his Rubaiyat is wonderfully captured. FitzGerald made this artistic choice consciously, stating that \\"better a live sparrow than a stuffed eagle\\" ... although this modesty downplays the beautiful lyricism and Victorian elegance of his version.Second, for better or for worse, this is the version that most captivated--and influenced--the world outside of Persia, including writers from Browning and Tennyson to O. Henry and Borges to Agatha Christie and Stephen King. Even the person who has not heard of Khayyam or the Rubaiyat and could not even locate Iran on a map has heard of \\"a jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou\\". It is hardly an overstatement to credit FitzGerald for this.That said, I completely sympathize with those who view FitzGerald as an unfaithful artist unworthy of the title 'translator' and who view his version of the Rubaiyat as an abomination. Indeed, it is advisable to read his version in concert with a more faithful translation such as Avery and Heath-Stubbs'. That said, for the general reader with an open mind, FitzGerald's version is more likely to be the more captivating, the more likely to tickle the imagination and captivate the spirit. Warts and all, FitzGerald's \\"live sparrow\\" has survived the generations for a reason."},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"Checking out of a supermarket recently with only a newspaper, a bottle of wine, and a long loaf of French bread, I remarked to the clerk, &quot;All we need is thou sitting beside me in the wilderness.&quot; She looked at me as if I had either lost my mind or was suggesting an indecent proposal.

The various translations are VERY different. They are based on different original manuscripts, which do not contain exactly the same material. The FitzGerald translation is much more of an interpretation of Khayyam than a translation, although it is a wonderful piece of work in and of itself, it is victorian baroque romanticism not Sufism. From my own personal experience (I've read much of three of the translations, the ones by FitzGerald in the 1850s, by a professor from Cambridge made in the mid 1900s, and by Robert Graves in the 1960s) I would suggest that you go with the most modern translation (which is no longer the translation by Graves). The Graves translation definately is a work of both deep philosophical ideas and of beautiful poetry."},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is a classic poem, which sings to the better angels of the human spirit. Far from a paen to drinking, the poem is a deep spiritual meditation.

The second edition is mature and somewhat darker than the first. I highly recommend this poem to anyone open to beautiful poetry and Truth."},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"These verses, which we anglophones have come to intone as though they were scripture, are not those of Omar Khayyam (meaning Omar the tentmaker in Farsi), but those of a less celebrated Victorian poet, Edward FitzGerald. Our affection for the rhyme scheme, the aliteration, the meter, the very image the words evoke, is not for Omar, but for his tranlator, Edward FitzGerald. It was not Omar who wrote, \\"oh, but the long, long while the world shall last,\\" but FitzGerald. FitzGerald translated this Twelfth Century poetry in the very early years of the Nineteenth Century, seven hundred years after Omar. It is FitzGerald to whom we should be grateful.FitzGerald's verse is literally accurate only to the extent of its a, a, b, a rhyme scheme; and even so, the final combination of phonics comprising the cadence in each line is constructed in our language, not in Omar's. Only in the figurative meaning of the verse is the translation from Farsi accurate. What we anglophones think of as Omar's verse is not at all Farsi and not at all Twelfth Century. It sounds much more familiar to our ears because FitzGerald has cut the time gap by seven centuries and the language barrier to nothing.But don't take my word for it; speak to any Iranian (if you permit them to speak for their ancestral Persians) and they will tell you that Omar is known principally for astrology and alchemy. Some will say he was a mathmetician, but no evidence remains to support that claim. Omar is never quoted as a poet by his ancestral Iranians. I have asked a dozen university-educated Iranians to recite a single verse of Khayyam and none have been able to do so. Not one.One explanation for this omission is Omar's obsession with hedonism in general and wine in particular, which is now so stridently verboten by his militantly muslim ancestors. FitzGerald drew inspiration only from Omar, and that inspiration has positioned him in an orbit around Omar's star. Our current affection for Omar Khayyam's verse is not remotely due to the accuracy of FitzGerald's translation, but rather to his own creativity and originality.The reason for the historical coincidence making blood-brothers of Omar and FitzGerald is the shocking nature of their verses. Omar's rebellion against the muslim propriety of his age paralleled FitzGerald's rebellion against the Elizabethian propriety of his age. Yet even to us these verses still sounds racy, and as long as they do they'll titillate our sensibilities, irrespective of their authorship.\\"Perplext no more with human or divine,Tomorrow's tangle to the winds resign,And lose your fingers in the tresses ofThe cypress-slender minister of wine.\\""},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) was a Persian mathematician whom we in the West know primarily as the poet of the Rubaiyat (literally: quatrains). In fact most people only know Omar Khayyam for the 101 individual quatrains translated and arranged by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859. Fitzgerald's work was more than an ordinary translation, one critic wrote, it was so inspired that some people believed it was an English poem with Persian allusions.Omar Khayyam writes about the fragility and transience of life,Oh threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!One thing at least is certain - this Life flies;One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;The Flower that once has blown for ever dies. (#63)and about the inspiration to be found in wine and friendship:A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread - and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness -Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow! (#12)In his best moments he rises above what some critics saw as cynical lament and reaches an appealing state of amused resignation:Myself when young did eagerly frequentDoctor and Saint, and heard great ArgumentAbout it and about: but evermoreCame out by the same Door where in I went. (#27)The world of Omar Khayyam - Islamic Persia in the eleventh century - demands some explanation to fully appreciate the poetry. Unfortunately, my edition (Peter Pauper Press, White Plains, NY, 1991) did not contain footnotes to the quatrains and only the shortest of introductions. Scholarly comment is often indicated for key words in poetry. Take the word &quot;wine&quot;, for example. It is interesting to be reminded that the subject of wine was inflammable because wine and drunkenness were prohibited by the principles of Islamic law. However, &quot;wine&quot; can also be interpreted as a metaphor referring to spiritual or romantic intoxication.Bottom-line: I recommend to enjoy this book with a glass of full-bodied Italian red wine of the sort the Italians like to call &quot;wine for meditation.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"Many people accuse the Fitzgerald translation of deviating too much from the Persian original. Personally, I don't like to see poetry translated from one language to another in verse either, because I will always feel that something has been missed.However, if it is not translated in verse, then it is no longer has the quality of the original poetry. So what shall we do here?I think that Fitzgerald has done an excellent job in translating Khayyum. It is said that good poetry has a balance of two things - beautiful language and meaning. Ftizgerald has achieved this.If you are looking for a more &quot;literal&quot; translation, to get exactly what Khayyum said and thought, then you are better to look to a word for word, unrhyming translation, that has taken care to keep the authentic quatrains only - not all the ones ascribed to him. The &quot;Persian Heritage Series&quot; has produced a good translation like this.Also beware of &quot;commentaries&quot; telling you that Omar Khayyum was a sufi, mystic, or whatever... and that his verses have special meanings outside of the literal interpretation. It is true that poets in Persia used such imagery as &quot;may&quot; (wine), &quot;maykhana&quot; (tavern), &quot;saqi&quot; (cup-bearer), &quot;yar-e nazanin&quot; (lovely maiden) etc. etc. to bring across meanings of God, and heaven, though this doesn't mean that these things are always implied.One of the qualities of poetry is that it is ambiguous. It must be recognised that people like Omar Khayyum and Hafez were living in times of religious persecution. If you said something against the established sect, then you could be accused of &quot;kufr&quot; (blasphemy) and punished accordingly. Khayyum himself was accused of kufr, as was Hafez in his time through a line of poetry he had written. Hafez protected himself through the ingenious adding of another line of poetry, clearing his name. Khayyum protected himself because he was a guest at the royal court.:)"},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"There are so many editions of Fitzgerald's Rubaiyat translations that have been published, with many being limited editions. Several of these rose to highly collectible status, especially those with tipped-in color plates by Dulac, Pogany or Arthur Szyk. These necessarily set them apart from other more textual editions.This review has specifically to do with the Illustrated Editions Company 1938 printing. Physically, at 11 1/2\\" x 8\\" it is rather long and wide, almost completely black, except for a red illustration of a mosque on the cover, and thin.I give 4 Stars only because it is not the first Fitzgerald edition, but a 20th century reprint. Beyond that, this is the most excellent of editions. The Illustrated Editions Company version has the first and last Fitzgerald translations.This book is powerful and sacred. Reading it will invoke a shamanic experience-- you will be there, as Omar uses the wine metaphor to teach the value and ephemeral substance of life. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is essential metaphysics. The note and comment that open this edition are key to understanding why the Illustrated Editions Company is above all the rest, even other collector editions, of which I own several. It is the care and quality of the edition that sets it apart, certainly not anything distinguished about its content. This is my favorite edition of all. The tipped in color plates by Hamzeh Abd-ullah Kar are authentic Persian fantasy, and reading each carefully printed verse on the heavy, slightly glossy parchment is a religious experience. There is something qualitatively different about reading the Illustrated Editions Company version.I can't find much else about this copy on the net, but there is one site that shows a copy remarkably similar to the one which I am using to base this review. I see no evidence that the title letters were ever gilt, although whenever the book goes up for auction the owners usually say the gilt is worn from the letters. This can't be true of all these copies, especially for a printing as late as '38, so I'm inclined to believe there never was any gilt lettering. I have seen other far less well preserved editions from earlier periods that have almost fully retained their gilt. The gems are between the boards, in this case.The comment by Edward Heron-Allen is itself a collectible piece of literature, though he wrote only one paragraph.

Khayyam offers the most brilliant truths in the condensed form of poetry. This is actually a scientific text, but easy to understand without mind numbing jargon. If one carefully studies this text you can come upon deep insights into the nature of the universe. The poem begins with a woman awaking from sleep and shows that life is to be enjoyed before one goes back to the eternal shores of nothingness. The searcher of truth, as shown here, goes to scholars who argue one position against another. He goes out the same way he came in; without truth. The rich man gains and gains and ends up dead with nothing to show for it. Life as Kayyam demonstrates is a magic show. It is the eternal forms taking an incarnation in this life. A show without beginning or end. A show that has its actors of genius and fool, rich man and poor man, saint and sinner, but a show nonetheless. What then does one do? Enjoy life writes Kayyam, taste the wine of life, but in a rational manner. Then when life is over one takes the camel caravan back to eternal nothingness and freedom from suffering. A most excellent and wise book. Another book I would recommend that is similar is; On the nature of the universe by Lucretius, which is outstanding and logical. These two books do not go into the endless and futile arguments of theists and atheists, but take the smatterings of truth in them. That is there is a God, but the God of the ancient philosphers ie, the unmoved mover of Aristotle.

It is the only non-western piece of literature that I was required to read when in high school and I recently re-read this version. Like most historical pieces, it is difficult to understand without additional knowledge of the historical context. Khayyam was a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer, which means he was as educated as the times allowed. The Rubaiyat was written in about 1120 C. E. and is in the form of quatrains or four-line rhymes.As a poem, the flow is smooth and the imagery deals with the lot of what human life is. The fourteenth quatrain is:Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,Before we too into the Dust descend;Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lieSans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and--sans End!with clear imagery regarding death, which is a consistent theme throughout.

Why he is still considered a competent - even brilliant - translator of this work of Persian poetry is a bit of a mystery to me. Omar Khayyam's work is a multidimensional set of meditations on many topics, most notably the impermanence of all things, and is admittedly a hard nut to crack for any translator due to the amount of controversy around which manuscripts are genuine and how many quatrains Omar Khayyam actually wrote (various editions run from just over one hundred to well over one thousand). As a result, even a serious poet like Robert GravesThe Original Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayyamand a serious Orientalist like A.J. ArberryOmar Khayyam: a New Version Based Upon Discoverieshave been taken in by forgeries or frauds. I very much like the Friedrich Rosen translationQuatrains of Omar Khayyam, which is unfortunately out of print and can only be had for a great deal of money on Amazon.

These poems, all confined in the structured little form known as the rubaiyat, are simple enough to be grasped on a first reading, and yet, like a rare gem held against sunlight, they sparkle at each new perusal and reveal some new facet and ray of inner light.Ah, Beloved, fill the Cup that clearsToday of past regrets and future fears:Tomorrow? Why tomorrow I may beMyself with yesterday's seven-thousand years!Omar was a man who loved above all else wine. (A forbidden drug in Islamic cultures, usually consumed among those with a certain rebellious status in society.) He lived within each moment and advised his readers to grasp at whatever pleasures the moment afforded within this physical life, and let those who wished to gamble on eternity in realms unseen do so at their discretion. Omar cared nothing about the world of the future, only what made the here and now as fun as possible. He was a sensualist and a man of sensuous tastes. We can imagine him reclining against a colorfully woven rug, flask of blood-red wine in one hand, a voluptuous courtesan on his lap, sheaf of papers containing his poetry lying beside him, his spirit drunk on all the excesses money could buy him. Omar Khayyam was an agreeable man little given to conflict, though he did sometimes tease the devout in his world. He offered down to earth wit and practical suggestions for us all. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is well translated here, perhaps even better than the more famous nineteenth century versions of Edward FitzGerald. I think nearly anyone will find something in this small body of poems to make them smile and see that this long-ago wine-lover's point of view contained much merit.Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,Before we too into the dust descend;Dust into dust, and under dust to lie,Sans wine, sans song, sans singer, and sans end!(PS: Yes, that's it exactly.)"},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"These reflective,honest and wholly recitable poems are an endless delight.Who can argue with their truths?Maybe the brothersjuddot.com moral prig who will be a millennia dead and forgotten while the eternal Omar shines a light of realness and honesty in a world full of flowers and forests loving nitwit poets and poeple like juddot who insist that life only be seen through the view of his religion.Go read the nonsensical,idiotic,mystical blather of Rumi if you want your poets &quot;spiritual&quot;.If you have taste and a brain, read Khayyam.

This work would be perfect for a collegiate literary course emphasizing multi-cultural aspects in classic world writings. Thispoetry traverses many different culturalperspectives. Here are some tantalizing samples:\\"Now the New Year reviving old Desires,The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,Where the White Hand of Moses on the BoughPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.\\"Alongside these lines is a picture of a young lady strollingin the countryside ostensibly searching for something orsomeone in vain. The combination of the poetry and thedrawing provide the reader with much to ponder. Surprisingly,the musings of a Persian writer make reference to Jesusin a work written in the 12th century or thereabouts.Let's look at another quatrain.\\"And this I know: whether the one True Light,Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite,One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caughtBetter than in the Temple lost outright.\\"The writer praises the act of coming to the truth. Apparently,he doesn't care whether or not it is arrived at in the Tavern.Alongside is a penciled drawing of a drunk man raising aglass of wine to the heavens.Another quatrain addresses our futile attempts to change fate:\\"Ah, Love! could thou and I with Fate conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would not we shatter it to bits-and thenRe-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire! \\"The lines describe changing the scheme of things. If we couldchange things, what would we put in place of the old and whosedesires would be placated? G-d gave us free will and theindividual and collective control over destiny. When thingsgo wrong, how can we blame G-d for the fateful turn. It isman (person) who controls destiny through free will.When free will goes awry, it is not G-d's fault. Rather,unintended twists in the road are consequences of our ownchoices devoid of influences by G-d or any deity.Let's look at one final quatrain-just for measure:\\"Ah, fill the Cup:- what boots it to repeatHow Time is slipping underneath our Feet:Unborn To-Morrow and dead YESTERDAY,Why fret about them if To-Day be sweet! \\"The author conveys the importance of enjoying a good day.He asks that we not spoil celebration with worries aboutthe morrow or regrets about things that are done and cannotbe changed in any event. Relish the present-especially if itis an enjoyable present because tomorrow is yet unborn,uncontrollable and maybe irrelevant.This work has stood the scrutiny of 800 or so years.

After meager initial sales, the poems were passed around by such figures as Richard Burton, Dante Gabriel Rosetti, Robert Browning, William Morris &amp; Swinburne and the praise from these men lead to it's becoming a bestseller.FitzGerald, was born on March 31, 1809 in Suffolk. He married unhappily and escaped from his marriage by devoting himself to translating Omar Kayyam's poetry. Kayyam was a Persian mathematician and astronomer, born in Persia on May 18, 1048. The rubaiyat are sort of like haiku in that they were not really the product of poets, they were mostly written by Persian intellectuals.. They are two line stanzas, split in two again. The first, second and last lines rhyme; the third is unrhymed. FitzGerald was captivated by Kayyam's work, but in translating them, he made them very much his own, rather than slavishly reproducing them word for word:VII25 Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring 26 The Winter Garment of Repentance fling: 27 The Bird of Time has but a little way 28 To fly--and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.XI41 Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough, 42 A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse--and Thou 43 Beside me singing in the Wilderness-- 44 And Wilderness is Paradise enow.XXIII89 Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend, 90 Before we too into the Dust descend; 91 Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie, 92 Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and--sans End!XXVI101 Oh, come with old Khayy&aacute;m, and leave the Wise 102 To talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies; 103 One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies; 104 The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.XXXIV133 Then to this earthen Bowl did I adjourn 134 My Lip the secret Well of Life to learn: 135 And Lip to Lip it murmur'd--&quot;While you live 136 Drink!--for once dead you never shall return.&quot;XXXVII145 Ah, fill the Cup:--what boots it to repeat 146 How Time is slipping underneath our Feet: 147 Unborn TO-MORROW, and dead YESTERDAY,148 Why fret about them if TO-DAY be sweet!XXXIX153 How long, how long, in infinite Pursuit 154 Of This and That endeavour and dispute? 155 Better be merry with the fruitful Grape 156 Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.XLIX193 'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days 194 Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays: 195 Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays, 196 And one by one back in the Closet lays.LI201 The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, 202 Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit 203 Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, 204 Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.These resulting poems reflect the atheism of the two men and are pretty much nihilist, existential and decadent. But they struck an immediate chord with the dissipated intellectuals of FitzGerald's time and have naturally retained their appeal in our Godless age. Moreover, as A.S. Byatt writes, &quot;FitzGerald's verse is insidiously memorable. It sings in the mind, controlled by its steady rapid rhythm and its strong, emphatic, reiterated rhyme, which in turn is made mysteriously open by the one unrhymed line in each verse.&quot; The end product is some of the most memorable poetry of all time. And the final one reproduced above, &quot;The Moving Finger writes&quot;, is one of the most quoted poems in the English language.This is a work worth knowing, both for its beauty and because of the influence of the malignant message it conveys, which sadly has become the ethos of the age--Carpe Diem!GRADE: C"},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"Don't waste your time with this trite collection of vapid, paganistic, intellectually lazy and self-indulgent quatrains.

Omar (known also as Omar the Tent-maker) was a Persian poet who lived in the 13th century, which was a golden age for the Arabs, who conquered Persian [now called Iran.] The poem pretends to be in praise of drinking (wine), and one of its most famous stanzas is: \\"A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou, beside me in the wilderness: Ah, wilderness is paradise enou.\\" One of my favorite stanzas is: \\"I studied with the philosophers, about it, and about; but, evermore, by the same door that in I went, came out.\\" A very interesting thing about this edition is that it gives two translations; the famous Fitzgerald one, and another, with discussions of the differences, and information about Khayyam's life and beliefs. I have also frequently quoted: \\"I wonder what the vinters buy, one-half so precious as the stuff they sell?\\" The philosophy expressed is that of a live-for-today hedonist - or alchoholic - but there are hints that he is being ironic, and means just the opposite. My father always believed that this poem is the result of an assignment from Khayyam's Sufi mentor [the Sufis didn't drink alchohol]; the comments in this edition have an interesting different angle on that.This is a poem you will read and re-read for its beauty and cleverness, and then go back to it for its deep and deeper thought and meaning."},{"Title":"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam","review":"Sufi universalism is needed theme for these times.

Through an outstanding development of the personal and religious lives of her characters, the author weaves a captivating tale of love and the search for personal peace. Christine's excellent command of the history of this time period enables the reader to walk alongside the characters as they toil under the shadow of the church and the ruling classes. Characters of both low and lofty social status struggle in their efforts to obtain healing and atonement from the church. As their guilt prods them to undertake religious works and discipline, they are confronted with choices that will not only dictate their lot in life, but also the eternal destiny of their souls. The author's ingenuity in developing an unpredictable plot makes this novel a captivating and inspiring read."},{"Title":"The Blanket Of The Dark","review":"This was an enjoyable read for anyone who appreciates the older style of true English writing.

Most historical novels of Henry VIII's time, not to mention the movies and the TV shows, pander to the wives and the whoopee. Buchan's story goes in a completely different direction: no wives, no beheadings, but a rich and fast-moving story of life and politics in Tudor England.Underneath the story is a whole supporting structure of history: but (and this is part of what makes the book so good, and reflects Buchan's skill so clearly) you don't need to know any of that to enjoy the book fully.The book isn't perfect: like other Buchan books I've read, he isn't afraid of setting a story in motion with a wildly implausible premise or motivation (see theThe Four Adventures of Richard Hannay: The Thirty-Nine Steps/Greenmantle/Mr. Standfast/the Three Hostages, orThe Island of Sheep); this is no different. This isn't Patrick O'Brian, who always grounds his books in entirely-credible situations and characters; his improbabilities (like a sloop capturing a line-of-battle warship inMaster and Commander) are worked up to, and only seem incredible until you remember that they actually happened. If you can't get over that it might limit your enjoyment of The Blanket of The Dark. But you should get over it, because the rewards are so great."},{"Title":"The Blanket Of The Dark","review":"This was a dull book. It told the story of Peter and his farming life.

Shannon, is in order before getting to the content. In addition to being a professor emeritus of religious studies, Shannon is the founding president of the International Thomas Merton Society, general editor of Merton's published letters, and author of numerous books on spirituality. So, one finds the expected level of expertise and objectivity on all things Merton, but also a taste of Fr. Shannon's own spirituality. In the introduction the author enumerates a three-pronged purpose in writing this book: showing that Merton's message is meaningful for current readers, presenting major themes that flow through Merton's enormous body of work, and recommending an order for reading Merton's books.The organization and writing style make this my current favorite among books about Thomas Merton. The gifts of Merton and Shannon seem to combine to bring something fresh and inspiring to every page. The biography is a true introduction. The section on themes is a useful synthesis of Merton's spiritual growth, always with undertones showing how others can follow his path. And the recommendations for reading Merton are way beyond a book list: Shannon devotes 12 pages to Merton's most popular book, Seven Storey Mountain, giving its history and a section-by-section reading guide. Other major works are treated in similar style with similar detail."},{"Title":"Thomas Merton: An Introduction","review":"This is an excellent overview of Thomas Merton and his life, writings and spirituality. Years ago I read \\"Seven Story Mountain\\" which I enjoyed tremendously, even though I wasn't a Catholic, but I didn't know where to go from there. I subsequently dabbled in other books of Merton's but could never get into them because it seemed that Merton was going off in all sorts of different directions. According to Shannon he was going off in different directions - like many of us Merton's thinking and spirituality evolved as he matured. Shannon does an excellent job of showing this, and suggests a plan whereby you can follow the arc of that evolution. I have started a Google group with several friends who are interested in tracing this, and we are using Shannon's reading plan as a guide. Shannon addresses, in various chapters: Merton's life story, why Merton is still relevant today, themes in Merton's writing, and he suggests a reading plan and takes you on a tour of some of Merton's most important writings with brief reviews on each of the books. One of the things I love about this book is that it is brief, clear, direct and well structured and that he doesn't try to tell you everything (which, for Merton, would take volumes). It is truly an introduction; it is enough but not too much. I don't agree with everything Shannon has to say but he is balanced, and his purpose is to get you excited about reading Merton - a purpose at which he succeeds admirably. It would be great to have a guide like this for other writers; a tour guide, if you will, with guideposts so you can figure out what you want to see without having to stop everywhere and/or getting lost on the path. I have seen others try this, but this book seems to be one of the rare instances that really works. Thank you, William Shannon, for providing this service."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens Pressure Cooker Cookbook","review":"My mom had a pressure cooker when I was growing up in the '50s, and because she worked and had to get dinner on the table pretty fast, a large percentage of our meals were prepared in the pressure cooker. I particularly remember goulash and stews. And Mom's warnings about using it correctly so it wouldn't explode.I got one many years ago, but was always intimidated by it so rarely used it as anything other than a cooking pot. Recently, though, I decided to start experimenting. I'd bought this recipe book - how can you go wrong with BH&amp;G? - so I hauled it out and waded in.The recipes are pretty basic - stews, pot roasts, variations on the chicken theme, some soups, and so on. I was looking for a pot roast, so I selected that recipe as my first. And immediately discovered a MAJOR goof in the recipe: It tells you to brown the meat in oil and then remove it before adding the vegetables and seasonings. Then it tells you to put the top back on and cook it under pressure for eight minutes. But it never tells you when to put the meat back into the pot! If I hadn't studied it carefully before I began cooking, I would have cooked the veggies without the meat and the meat would never have cooked. So I improvised and put the meat back in on top of the veggies before securing the lid.I'm an experienced cook, and I know that it's always a good idea to read a recipe through first. For newcomers, though, a mistake like this could spoil the experience for them.

I had seen a few of Patricia Neal's movies, but was not a fan, and expected to skim through the book; instead I found myself savoring every word. What a life she's had, full of dramatic highs and lows. She found early success on Broadway and won an Oscar during her long Hollywood career, and is known for her love affair with Gary Cooper (she details many other affairs, as well) and her strokes, when she was 39 and pregnant, which left her unable to speak and walk.Her turbulent marriage to eccentric writer Roald Dahl, the death of a child, the accident that left another child brain-damaged, and her relationships with a who's-who list of show biz greats combine to make this a book that is very hard to put down. It is written with so much energy and determination that I became fascinated with Patricia Neal. She is known publicly for her great personal strength, but honestly reveals her weaknesses and fears as well. Highly recommended as an outstanding Hollywood autobiography.Kona"},{"Title":"AS I AM","review":"As a Cooper fan, I only honestly bought the book to read about Pat's side of her affair with Gary. To my delightful surprise the book from the first page was enthralling and it took no time at all to finish. Her candor, her details of other affairs and her honesty and openess make this a truly impressive read and you soon think of her as a person rather than an actress or someone that had an affair with the famous Gary Cooper.Definitely worth the money but more importantly, worth your time. Buy it and buy it NOW!!!"},{"Title":"AS I AM","review":"roald dahl said it best, \\"pat is the most honest person ever!\\" she certainly is, i read the book in one day and as the other reviewer stated, i was sad to see it end, her book was so inspirational that i find myself turning to it in my times of darkness, i think every young woman should read this book, it's like having that mother daughter talk with your mom- great read!!!1million stars!!!!"},{"Title":"AS I AM","review":"Patricia explains in detail the ups and downs that have occurred in her fruitful life. The strength she showed after her near fatal stroke is a true inspiration to not only other strike victims but to all of us. She totally exposes her feelings regarding her relationship with Gary Cooper, the subsequent abortion and the animosity she received from his daughter. What a beautiful and sad love they shared. I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Patricia Neal the actress but also anyone who is inspired by a very brave woman. Also anyone who like myself are fans of Gary Cooper will be very interested in the personal side of this man and the huge part he played in Patricia's life."},{"Title":"AS I AM","review":"Flew through this book. It was so well-written, honest and interesting, I could hardly put it down.Although I couldn't understand her behavior when she was younger, being a well brought up woman, she seemed pretty loose, I do admire her courage and ability to cope through all her tragedies. I can even kind of understand her marrying someone she didn't really love because she knew she'd never find another true love because she had already found him, and she wanted to start a family. Her husband did a lot to help her and she acknowledges that, said she wouldn't have survived if it weren't for him, but he seemed cruel and rude to most everyone, she went along with whatever he said, even cutting her mother out of her life at one point. In fact, I never realized she had so many tragedies in her life.But throughout, she didn't try to excuse her behavior or choices and I found that really refreshing. She was a very talented actress, I enjoyed her in \\"Hud\\" and the episode on \\"Little House on the Prairie\\", especially and she certainly had to cope with more than most people.Was inspirational, sad and interesting all at the same time.Anyone who has had to deal with someone who had a stroke will learn a lot from this book."},{"Title":"AS I AM","review":"My mother loved the book and was very pleased with condition of the book It was just like it was statedon the internet."},{"Title":"AS I AM","review":"This book has just about stopped me cold from reading any more autobiographies (Ok, I'm lying, but at least I'll take a break). It was recommended by a friend, I didn't know that terribly much about Patricia Neal but remembered that she was in \\"A Face In The Crowd\\" and \\"Hud\\" (both great movies) and I was always slightly afraid of her husky voice onscreen as a child! Well, after you read this book, you'll know more than you ever dreamed about one person. Ad infinitum. The quick 4-1-1: Neal was from Kentucky, her Dad was a mine supervisor. They had money when she grew up. She had an older sister and a younger brother. Her Dad died when she was before eighteen. Her parents supposed her desire to act/perform during high school. She was a well-known beauty in her area.She went to Notrthwestern. She dropped out after two years and moved to New York to be on the stage. Eventually won a Tony award and got a 7-year contract in Hollywood. Fell in love with Gary Cooper during timing of \\"The Fountainhead,\\" they had a multi-year affair. First marriage to Roald Dahl (author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). That's about half the book. I could tell you about her first daughter's death from measles, her son's accident that caused major head injuries, her cerebral aneurysm, her years recovering from a massive series of strokes, her life in England, but you can just read the book yourself. I have simply never read an autobiography that was filled with both mundane and profane details, and endless emotional self-examination. Enough already! This was a woman who was a gifted performer, came from a privileged background, and lived a life filled with major peaks and valleys. At the end, her inordinate self-absorption made any overriding message of the book unreachable to me."},{"Title":"AS I AM","review":".....So Neal describes the begining of her six year affair with Gary Cooper......I bought this book because Cooper had been one of my boyhood movie idols and I was interested in learning more about him. After reading this book however, my opinion of Cooper turned from admiration and respect to disappointment and disgust. The \\"Coop\\", as he liked to be called, was a dandy and a ladies man who enjoyed having affairs with his leading ladies. Usually these ended shortly after the movie was in the can. In Patricia Neals case however, a star struck young actress young enough to be his daughter, Coop kept her on the hook for six years knowing full well that he would never marry her. When she got pregnant he arranged for her to have an abortion, \\"to save his career\\", and he hid in a car in an alley while she faced this gruesome ordeal alone. Cooper was the adult, after he added her scalp to his belt he should have broken it off for her sake but like a selfish lecherous old man he strung her along to the bitter end in the name of love......My opinion of Neal is a little bit more conflicted. When reading an autobiography, the reader tries to get into the skin of the author and to understand the motives that drove her. I couldn't do this with Neal. I didn't understand how a well brought up Southern girl would allow her self to be seduced by a man who used her as a sex object while saving himself for marriage to another and then, after the marriage have the nerve to ask Pat for one last fling in the hay to remember her by. Instead of indignantly throwing him out on his ear, her attidude was \\"why not\\" and she began unbuttoning her blouse. I am sorry Pat but I cannot empathize with this behavior ...it seems slutty to me......Perhaps a psychiatrist could have helped her understand her penchant for having affairs with much older men but I don't know if they could have cracked the puzzle of why she married Roald Dahl, a man she admitted she didn't love but one that she vowed to never divorce, although she did divorce him finally after years of abusive treatment. If Dahl was anything like the way she described him in her book I don't think I could have spent more than five minutes in the same room with the man. If I had been Pat's brother I think I would have taken him behind the woodshed with a baseball bat......I am really sorry that Patricia Neal had such a hard life but except for the death of her daughter, her son's disability and her own stroke she brought most of her problems upon herself with extremely bad judgement and poor choices. Toward the end, after being abandoned by the \\"monster\\" she married of her own free will she descended into a whiney harpy that even her own children couldn't tolerate. I am sorry Pat but I think you could have shown more class."},{"Title":"Beads: Make Your Own Unique Jewelery","review":"Ms. Tomalin provides some beautiful projects to complete for the more advanced beader. However, there are several technical flaws in the book worth mentioning because they can confuse the reader. There are typographical errors, British- English terms (which might be foreign to the American-English reader), and references that appear in the text but do not appear in the illustrations. In several instances Ms. Tomalin refers the reader in the text to see illustrations labelled &quot;(a)&quot;, &quot;(b)&quot;, &quot;(c)&quot;, etc. but the illustrations are not labeled as such so the reader does not know which one is &quot;(a)&quot;, &quot;(b)&quot; or &quot;(c)&quot;, etc. I also found the instructions for the knotting projects fairly difficult to follow. (I read one set of instructions several times and could not understand them). Bead thread measurements specified for certain projects are incorrect or disproportionate to the finished project. In one project Ms. Tomalin instructs the reader to use 6 strands (3 doubled stands) of 60&quot; thread for a knotted choker measuring 18&quot; when completed.

The variety of glasswork is so amazing on these bobbin beads which helped lace weavers to remember the order of their threads.I have Stefany to thank for two awards I won for two necklaces, both made with beads I crafted using the papier roule' technique she shows on page 73. A long, narrow triangle of paper is rolled with glue with the long point on the outside of the bead and the short base on the inside.

In their accessible text, Ander and Stern manage to distill complex and constantly-evolving retail concepts into an intuitive model that will guide readers who need to quickly and intelligently assess how successfully a retail concept delivers value to customers.If you're seeking an outline for the particulars of cash-flow management, marketshare, procurement strategies etc., this book won't satisfy. Stern and Ander don't excavate details. Instead, they hover at a conceptual level and methodically reduce high-achieving retailers' major differentiating factors to a workable, comprehensible 5-point \\"EST-model\\". The authors concede immediately that no retailer can (or ought to) be strong on all points of their model, since vigor on one axis may preclude a company from muscle on another. They argue that a retail concept must prevail on at least one or two points on the EST model to secure a place among the top three retailers in a segment (which, the authors say, is how to prevent consumer neglect and ultimately, the company's failure). The strengths of the EST model are both its intuitiveness to the reader and its simple construction.The tome is pithy and easy to read. Stern and Ander sustained my attention throughout by using a familiar -- yet diverse -- set of retailers to illustrate the models. I encourage any reader who wants to appreciate what differentiates compelling retailers that stay relevant to consumers from the many that end their days in \\"the black hole of retail\\" to read Winning at Retail immediately."},{"Title":"Winning At Retail: Developing a Sustained Model for Retail Success","review":"Montgomery Ward, Woolworth's and Pets.com stumbled into irrelevancy before they knew what hit them. Authors and retail consultants Willard Ander and Neil Stern explain what went wrong and tell retailers how to stay alive and thrive. They prescribe their theory, called \\"Est,\\" as in the superlative suffix. Be the best, they say, in assortment (biggest), price (cheapest), customer service (easiest), speed of service (quickest) or fashion (hottest). Being \\"pretty good\\" at everything no longer works. The abundance of choices in today's transparent, digital marketplace has spawned information-overloaded, fickle, demanding customers. The authors tend to generalize about what good companies are doing right rather than describing how also-ran retailers might turn things around, but there is plenty of advice here for those who are willing to take it. We recommend this glib pep talk of a book - if for no other reason than to jolt retailers out of believing they're doing everything possible to keep customers coming back."},{"Title":"Winning At Retail: Developing a Sustained Model for Retail Success","review":"The same retailers win year after year, Wal-mart, Target, Home Depot,Amazon while the rest barely hang on.

A lot of time is spent building up the concept and helping the retailer understand why EST is so important, which was a bit over-kill for me as I could see the logic immediately, but I think it would be helpful to a lot of people.

For two years Michael had no memory of the life he left behind in America, and the woman who had asked him for a divorce. Then he saw the photograph of is wife engaged to another man and carrying his son.With Michael's reported death, Tara Connelly Paige lost her spunk. Compliancy replaced zeal, surface calm replaced passion. Indeed, the only thing that still brings sparkle to her days is the son conceived on the eve of his father's departure. Then suddenly, Michael reappears, and Tara is terrified of allowing the tumultuous emotions of the past to sweep her away for fear of being destroyed...again.THE SECRET BABY BOND, book nine of the continuity Dynasties: The Connellys. Author Cindy Gerard successfully pens a novel that functions as well as a standalone as it does within the scope of the series. Michael's disappearance and subsequent reappearance is both convincing and poignant. Tara's emotional shutdown seems equally appropriate in light of her feelings of guilt, love, and grief. Her fear of reawakening old passions threatens to paralyze her, forcing her to reject second chances despite her desires.

Such is the case with The Connelleys series. Some of the books have been very good and some have been so-so as the author for that particular book was working with a storyline/history, etc. that they didn't create and are not comfortable writing in and therefore the stories come off as missing something. This is definitely the case with this book.I normally very much enjoy Cindy Gerard's books. Her heroes are normally excellent with complimentary heroines. Unfortunately with this book, while the hero is indeed a very good one, the heroine is one of the weakest and most spineless I've seen in some time.The book does move the plot along in The Connelleys storyline but does not leave you with a good impression of the heroine until the end.

This book takes a look at the dataset and reanalyzes much of what Herrnstein and Murry had looked at.Though it brings more perspectives on the subject, and takes issue with much of what TBC concluded, it does vindicate that TBC is now a serious beginning look at intelligence, genetics, and its impact on the nation. This book says, as so many other researchers have contended, &quot;The Bell Curve is a serious book and is not to be ignored.&quot;However, when reading the book, which I recommend for anyone that is very familiar with the subject, remember that of the 25 contributors, only John B. Carroll was also a signatory to &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence: 52 scientists respond to The Bell Curve (12/13/1994) in the Wall Street Journal.&quot; This book is put together primarily by left-leaning academics. To balance its message, I would strongly recommend reading Arthur Jensen's book The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability. So again, read this book but keep in mind it is highly biased."},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Silver Burdett Professional Publications)","review":"This book was written as a response to the 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; by Herrnstein and Murray. But unlike several other books that condemned TBC without any empirical data, this book actually does expand the issue of racial differences intelligence and is well worth reading by any one interested in this ongoing debate. At least in this book, while still motivated by an egalitarian goal to deny racial differences in intelligence, the authors do give TBC credit for being essentially a very sound book empirically, while picking away at some of the issues at its periphery. But as they do this, they also make many fundamental errors and omissions. This is to be expected however because TBC is very hard to refute on empirical grounds alone.As an example, the authors take TBC to task for using heritability in the broad sense rather in the narrow sense like breeders do, which reduces the heritability between races supposedly by about 20% or so. The problem is, as shown by Jensen in &quot;The g Factor&quot;, heritability in the broad sense should be used in comparing group averages, while heritability in the narrow sense should be used in predicting the expected intelligence of one's children. TBC was not a book on how to have smart kids or breeding cows for higher butter fat production. So the argument was a feeble attempt at obfuscation.Later in the book they admit that Blacks almost make as much money as Whites when wages are adjusted for the average difference in intelligence between the two groups. But they go on to say that &quot;almost&quot; is not good enough. The error here of course, as even they argue in this book, is that earnings are not just a matter of intelligence. It is the most important trait with regards to wages, but other traits are also important. Research has shown that conscientiousness is the second most important behavioral trait after intelligence in occupational success, and one would have to assume that conscientiousness would vary among racial groups as easily as intelligence due to evolutionary forces on selection under different ecological conditions. And Rushton has shown that many behavioral differences exist between Whites and Blacks on average, including conscientiousness.So this book is a mixed bag on not denying that there are differences in the average intelligence between Blacks and Whites while trying at the same time to ameliorate the damage that recent research has produced showing that the differences are in fact real and persistent. But the funding for this book was such that the authors had no choice but to use some very fancy footwork to dance around the primary issue and try to diffuse its impact with regards to education and equality. Politics always comes into play, depending on who is paying the piper."},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Silver Burdett Professional Publications)","review":"This book is heavy stuff. It was written in a style similar to articles published in scientific journals. The opinions and views are drawn based on science and prior studies with thorough references.

Now I'm even more convinced. In fact, nothing could possibly better confirm the essential validity of the Bell Curve's claims than the fact, behind all the self-fueling sound and fury it provoked, and behind the holier-than-thou pretentions to be &quot;debunking,&quot; &quot;refuting,&quot; and &quot;flattening&quot; the Bell Curve, the careful reader cannot help but notice a striking absence of real, substantive objections to it. Instead, the supposed objections are either opposed to something the Bell Curve never said (and indeed, explicitly denied), or else they tend to try to nit-pick without actually disagreeing. Indeed, with Cafalli-Sforza's lead, we see a new formula emerging. If you are involved in writing up some potentially politically incorrect scientific research, here is what to do. First, write up the research, which, of course, largely confirms the hereditarian heresy (which most people have always known, or secretly suspected, anyway). Then, decorate the outside of the package with a lot of ostentatious window dressing which, ingenuously, implies that your book &quot;flattens&quot; the evil heresy. That ought to keep YOUR head out of the noose! Besides, it makes the reviewers much more likely praise you, and sells more copies too. If your conscience bothers you, you can salve it with the thought that there is surely SOME version of the evil heresy which your arguments really DO oppose, even if this is just a straw man, i.e., some 100% hereditarian determinism which nobody, and certainly not the (&quot;40-60%&quot;) Bell Curve authors, has ever actually held. The only thing that surprises me is the fact that the media and publishing world falls for this sham. I guess the relatively moderate Murray and Herrnstein have simply been designated the official targets of popular wrath, if only because they came out FIRST. And perhaps everybody else, from the most heretical hereditarian to the most orthodox Marxist, has an interst in keeping it that way."},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Silver Burdett Professional Publications)","review":"We are all taught as little children to make a distinction between two fundamental issues.#1.

Here's a little example that everyone ought to understand.My aunt and uncle have a mixed-breed dog: a chihuahua crossed with a dachshund. This dog has a dachshund-like body and a chihuahua-like face, and is very nervous and skittish like a chihuahua. Does the fact that this dog is a mixed breed, keep us from concluding that there does in fact exist the breed &quot;chihuahua&quot; and the breed &quot;dachshund&quot;, each of which has its own distinctive shape, coloring, and personality traits?This is what people are claiming: that because there are lots of mixed-race people in America, then race doesn't exist. This has got to be the dumbest argument I've ever heard. And &quot;no biological basis for race&quot; -- so, I guess that melanin all comes from one's environment? These arguments are so dumb, it's no wonder that regular people never question them.

These authors evince clearly that there is no biological concept of race. Any effort to compare races is simply false beacause even anthropolgists and biologists cannot decide the cutoff point in races.So why do psychologists put people in categories that do not even exist? Ideology.The authors of the Bell Curve have no way to define the boundaries of race- even so there is no such thing as racial purity. In America 20% of whites have black ancestry.

There are a few things wrong right off the bat with the book: the employee manual is not just one page anymore. Second, the book only examines the pros of Nordstrom. There are a few notations of \\"competition\\" but Spector and McCarthy do not examine the reality of cut throat competition on the sales floor. Depending on the management of the store, it can be either harnessed or turned negative. Some of the team examples no longer exist (like nominating employees for recognition). Too much is left to independent departmen managers: and many lack formal training. A good manager may or may not be a good sales person but that is how Nordstrom promotes. I do agree that customer service (be it the sales staff, the buyers, or actual cutomers) is critical in any role but there is little examination of the culture of Nordstrom that can make it a good learning experience but not a good career trajectory.Spector and McCarthy seem a bit reluctant to take of some of the shine of the silver bagged company: it's too bad. There is a lot of good information for early career types or sales managers but there is a lot of Kool Aid. And don't believe all the heroic tales in the book: it's a problem for Nordstrom employees. They are 100% commissioned and expected to do some of these crazy stunts which is time off the floor and thus out of his/her pocket.

The main characters are Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and Gandalf. Pippin, Sam , Merry , and Frodo are hobbits. Legolas is an Elf, Gimli is a Dwarf, Aragorn is a Man, and Gandalf is a Wizard. My favorite part of the book is Pelennor Fields. Frodo is taken to the tower of Cirth Ungol and is saved by Sam. Then they move closer the fires of Mount Doom. While Frodo and Sam are moving towards Mt. Doom the rest of the fellowship is creating a war a a diversion. Will they trick Sauron or will he get the Ring? To find out read this book.I liked this book because my favorite genre has always been fantasies.

The story in THE TWO TOWERS is tremendous, creative and truly profound. And don't make the mistake of thinking that this book or any of the others from Tolkein are children's books.I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Watch the extended version of the movie? Yes, but READ THE BOOK first. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. There are also some unnecessary twists taken by Jackson and his crew that are simple and beautiful in the book.THE TWO TOWERS wonderfully takes up where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS leaves off and continues to follow the progress of The Fellowship as they continue their quest to overcome the powers of Sauron as he tries to regain the great ring and to dominate Middle Earth.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE TWO TOWERS you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and then wrapping up with THE RETURN OF THE KING. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there. And if you haven't read THE HOBBIT yet you will likely be adding that one to your library as well.The GOOD NEWS is that you will not regret a single moment!I could go on and on. No shame to the movies.

The \\"Two Towers\\" is the second part of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Reading this book without having read (or seen the movie) the first part, The Fellowship of the Ring, this book does not make any sense. This book has 398 pages and is printed pretty small. Even though the book was written for adults, many kids and teens (like me) read it. It has a 6.3 reading level.J.R.R. Tolkien describes Middle Earth in the book series \\"The History of Middle Earth\\" the book \\"The Hobbit\\" and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. The Lord of the Rings really has six books, each of the three books has two books. In the first book Frodo, a hobbit (small human-like creature) gets the Ruling Ring. He and the fellowship ride for a few months and have many adventures. The fellowship's goal is to destroy the ring. At the end the fellowship scatters. In the first part of the two towers most of the fellowship (except Frodo) fight the traitor Saruman and have adventures of their own. In the second part Frodo and his servant Samwise go to the borders of the dark land, Mordor. There they get attacked by a monster.After all I would recommend this book to adult and teens who read or saw the first book.

Fortunately, The Return of the King is as good as or better than its companion books.The book opens (unlike the also excellent Peter Jackson movie) with Pippin and Gandalf riding to Minas Tirith, Aragorn &amp; Co. In Rohan pondering their next move, and Sam trying to rescue Frodo from the orcs of Cirith Ungol - granted, you don't pick up this final thread until over halfway through the main text (a synchronized version of events appears in Appendix B). If your only interest is in seeing the Ring destroyed, skip directly to Chapter 3 of Book VI. If you can stand some \\"irrelevant information and/or dialogue,\\" go ahead and read Book V and see if Gondor can be saved from Sauron's minions.Don't stop reading at the end of the main text, though. The Appendices contain a wealth of information including the history, calendars, and languages of Middle-Earth. While not required reading, they really add to one's appreciation of Tolkien's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, is the perfect ending to this wonderful Fantasy Fiction series. This book has amazing descriptive writing by J.R.R. Tolkien about the lands of Middle Earth. He describes the vast landscapes of Rohan where the book starts with Gandalf, Aragorn, Pippin, Merry, Legolas and Gimli in service to the king. From how he describes it, the land is gorgeous and mountainous. Like Gondor, the lands are grassy and vast. It reminds me of the mountains of Switzerland or Australian plains. In the beginning, when he describes all the work they're doing for the king, he talks and rambles on a little, but after you get through that, it's all good from there. .. There are many battle scenes here, where the orcs come from Mordor, and Tolkien has good descriptions of it, so it seems like you're almost there, in a land that doesn't exist.After all the fighting scenes and the battles are over, Tolkien begins to describe Frodo, Sam, and Gollum's quest to destroy the Ring. Of .. .. The ending is stupendous, and it's worth reading the first two just to get to the ending of this book. It's really touching and it may draw a few tears.Tolkien had the writing style of explaining things that may not be very significant at the time, but he does explain things very well enough so you can fully understand what's going on. For characters, he may go on about their heritage a little too long, but he does explain very well what their certain quest is to do and how they can do it. He may put a little too much talking in there, so much that you could become confused as to what is really going on, but you can get the main concept.The readers who would enjoy this book the most would be probably teens because the vocabulary is really expanded, but that can never be bad. It is a harder level, but I wouldn't even bother reading it if you haven't read the first two, because you would probably become really confused. I definitely recommend this book; it is a must-read. It's full of action and adventure. It also has a love story between Aragorn and Arwen, along with a story of wits and determination of two young hobbits.Tolkien is in my opinion the most brilliant writer of his time. The Lord of the Rings are without a doubt the greatest epic novels of all time, with the amazing characters, landscapes, and story plots. This story has no boring parts; it is filled with excitement and drama. The end will make you feel wonderful and just make your day.

Tolkien, starts to summarize the trilogy about a quest to destroy a dark, powerful ring. This book demonstrates the feelings of love, hate, peril and deception.This fiction book is about a hobbit (halfling) named Frodo and his journey to destroy a weapon of mass destruction, a ring created to rule all the peoples of Middle Earth. This book picks up where the first part of the series, The Fellowship of the Ring, left off, at the watchtower of Amon Hen. This story follows Frodo and Sam all the way to the watchtower of Cirith Ungol. It follows him through his troubles through the darkening lands before Mordor. The book also follows his companions, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas through the Gap of Rohan to their great battle at Helms Deep, and their quest to find two hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by Saruman's Uruk-hai.This book is an outstanding work of literature. It can keep you on your toes through the whole thing. J.R.R. Tolkien was not just a scholar but an amazing linguist. He came up with three languages and expanded them into over five. The story shows that no matter what, you shouldn't trust new people, no matter how trustworthy they seem. Also, no matter what, you will almost always find what you are looking for, even though there may be some unexpected twists along the way.I highly recommend this book. It is an extremely righteous piece of literature. It is a great way to follow the characters through their separate journeys, after their separation, through Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the greatest books I have ever read. This book is the sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R.

I really enjoyed this book because the story line was very well thought out and Tolkien knew exactly how he wanted to put things. I also liked how Tolkien didn't just write a fantasy book that takes place in the places and times that we know. He created his own land and his own time, and this just gave him endless abilities to make the reader get into his book. I also liked how Tolkien described his characters. He didn't just tell us what they were like, but he showed us what they were like through the choices they made. Most authors would have had a tough time trying to show the reader with words what they saw in their minds, but Tolkien using a lot of detail does an excellent job of getting the reader to see what he sees. I also like this book because it really stretches the imagination and makes you think what it would be like if the world was like it was in this book. I have read the entire Lord of the Ring series and this was my favorite by far. I loved how this book sets up the ending in the third book.

This book is another classic in the without a doubt best fantasy series ever written. I hope you enjoy it as much as i did."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers has become one of my favorite literary works. The Fellowship of the Rings left the reader hanging, but this novel builds more anticipation than the first. All I can say is I am glad I already own the Return of the King, so I can begin reading it immediately. I have read other fantasy novels and there is something about Tolkien's work that isn't in other novels. I think it is emotion. I can feel the sadness felt be Gimli when he leaves Lorien. When Aragorn is on the hill in Lorien and it reads, he never came there again as a living man, I am saddened. In the Two Towers, I can feel the emotions of Sam at Cirith Ungol. I guess that is the difference between Tolkien and other fantasy authors. An author can write a great novel, but it may only stimulate anticipation and excitement. Tolkien creates anticipation and excitement while stimulating other emotions.What Happens. It begins at the Rauros. With Sam and Frodo gone, the remaining members of the fellowship seek those taken captive. The pursuers reach Rohan in time of peril and find one they do not expect. They ride with Theoden and Eomer to Helm's Deep to make battle with Sauraman's Orcs. Wormtongue deals a heavy loss to his master. Book four begins with Smeagol joining Sam and Frodo. They journey first to the black gates and then to Cirith Ungol. They meet Faramir along the way, but he does not detour them.Tolkien is the best fantasy author I have read. I encourage you to purchase this book if you liked the movie, because if you read it once, you will probably read it again."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return of the King&quot; completes &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy that began with &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien took Arthurian legends and Norse mythology and recreated the realm of high fantasy in the 1950s that continues to be popular today.That Tolkien was able to forge a bond with &quot;Fellowship&quot; then split up the characters was a masterful stroke. In &quot;Return&quot; we follow Pippin and Gandalf to Minas Tirith, where Pippin becomes part of the tower guard for Denethor, the Steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir. Merry, left behind in Rohan, bonds with King Theoden, and later secretly rides to battle with the mysterious Dernhelm. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli take with paths of the dead to recruit an army that must fulfill its destiny to become free of a curse. We also get the sub-stories of Eowyn and Faramir. And Frodo and Sam don't even appear until the second half of the book!What I liked about &quot;Return&quot; is that Tolkien continued to raise the stakes and throw obstacles in the way of his characters. Merry and Eowyn pay a price during their encounter with the ringwraithes. Frodo gets stabbed, stung and bitten. Yet, each character gets to be a hero in a believable way. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are already larger than life heroes, so the hobbits are really the source of humanity in the story, the observers who rise above their stature and perform great acts of bravery. That Tolkien could show growth in so many characters, and even in Aragorn as he gradually accepts his destiny as the king of his people, was remarkable.The book is filled with excellent detail about the lands and history of the peoples, and I found myself glad that there were handy maps in the back for reference.After the climax, there are another fifty or so pages as the characters make their way homeward and Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin must retake the Shire from the thugs who have assumed control. This would be unheard of in a book today, since the main action has been completed, but Tolkien is going completing the journey by having the characters return as champions. In the &quot;Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter, we see how much the hobbits have truly grown, as they must wage a campaign without their other friends to help them. Finally, &quot;The Grey Havens&quot; draws our story to a close.The appendices are also worthy of perusal, as they are filled with historical details of the world of legend, when Isildur battled Sauron, etc. as well as what happended to the principle characters after Frodo returned to the Shire. By reading these pieces, one glimpses the amazing scope that a writer can undertake to create a world filled with fascinating stories, rich history, multi-dimensional characters, and sweeping landscapes.This series is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord of the Rings reads like one very long book that the reader finds themselves unable to put down. It goes without saying that you must read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; before you read this one. This, the third segment, is the climax to what the other two stories built up. This was astonishingly real for a book about wizards, hobbits and elves and I loved it. It is the only book that I have ever found myself crying when it was over. It was a sad sort of ending, (I won't spoil it), but it wasn't because of that. These vivid characters whom I had come to know and love for the months that it took me to go through &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the other Lord of the Rings books were abandoning me. They would go on with their lives and have glorious new adventures of which I could not be a part of...I miss Sam most of all. The afterward of this book is a gem as well, since you can learn to read and write in Elvish and in runes, and find out histories and afterwards behind the epic. This is a must read for anybody. You are missing out if you do not read this.

Also included is an abandoned review I wrote for \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" all the way back in early 2000 but was never posted on Amazon, explaining how Tolkien's life work of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is NOT a trilogy but rather three parts of one work divided up for publishing purposes]Over the past several decades, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has sold millions of copies and is commonly regarded as one of the most influential fantasy novels ever published. Many first time readers have began their trek into Middle-earth with Frodo and the Company of the Ring in recent years. What they will encounter there has been loved by millions of readers before them, and if they allow themselves to respond to Tolkien and his Myth will doubtless become a loyal and ardent fan of Tolkien and those furry-footed hobbits. What's also notable about THE LORD OF THE RINGS is, for a book as long as it is, many of its readers reread the novel many times over. Yet despite its enduring popularity, Tolkien is often held in complete disregard by the literary establishment.The real question is why? In the literary climate that is characterized by modernism and post-modernism where the twentieth and twenty first century is a wasteland why does a \\"series\\" of fantasy novels become one of the most beloved works in modern times?It's because the power of myth over the human imagination works wonders, creating a longing and a hunger that, Tolkien argues, is met by the Christian religion. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis are the flip-sides of the same coin, with Lewis giving us accounts of the longing and Tolkien providing the books that would create that longing. And what about the longing? It's that longing for Myth, that love for those beauties which Tolkien shows us in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that longing that sets man apart from all other creatures in the universe: a craving for beauty and for joy. The German word for this longing is \\"senhsucht\\". In a time characterized by fast-food, cell-phones, materialism, superficiality, the account of a Hobbit working against all odds in a mythic landscape so captures the human imagination (and this is NOT hype) that an entire genre is created. It is because of how Tolkien so masterfully handles Myth that he has been so highly treasured by such a large fan base.Still, there are a few things to consider when reading Tolkien nowadays. Looking over the reviews, it proved rather shocking to me that people have been complaining that, although it was original when it was published, much of what Tolkien has done has become cliche and that other writers are much better working with these cliches and making them more exciting than Tolkien. They complain about his \\"endless descriptions\\" of the natural world, very detailed accounts of geography and not enough \\"characterization.\\" The characters are unrealistic: the \\"human drama\\" required by the book's very nature is beyond Tolkien's scope as a writer. THE FELLOWSHIP is both uneven and very weak in pacing, with so much invested in the world and its history Tolkien forgets to make us care about the characters themselves. Another fault oft cited against Tolkien is the lack of \\"female characters,\\" and there have been accusations that Tolkien is racist; one of my favorite misconceptions is that Frodo and Sam are homosexuals.Academia has no time for Tolkien, and many of our key critics have denounced Tolkien as ill-written or escapist (Harold Bloom said that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a period piece which will simply not die but just keeps lingering on long after its relevance. This is the stance taken by a lot of professional critics with a grudge against Tolkien, and wonderfully have been proven wrong). To this day, while not nearly as openly hostile as previous decades, academia in general harbors resentment against Tolkien and everything he's done. As far as they're concerned, he's done something that is actually popular and therefore unworthy of study. It's one of those \\"high-brow vs. low-brow\\" situations, and instead of producing \\"worthwhile\\" academic research, Tolkien instead writes a \\"series\\" of novels which become one of the most established authors of this century. In recent years, academic support has grown tremendously for Tolkien, but he is still a very hotly contested modern writer, unlike some other \\"academically undeniable\\" classics such as James Joyce. Unlike the academic favorites, Tolkien highly polarizes the professional literary establishment. Fortunately he has gained some ground here though.Much of the complaints voiced against THE LORD OF THE RINGS are both unimportant and irrelevant. Tolkien is working with literary traditions not in-tune with the modern mind, but is instead handling narrative threads of Myth. Tolkien gives us solid archetypes to work with, bringing out the very qualities of masculinity and the beauties and stark wonders of femininty, but all expressed in mythological terminology. The idea of Sam and Frodo as homosexual is both ridiculous and totally unfounded. In Myth, good is characterized and seen as \\"White,\\" and the evil is dark and perverted. Those who say Tolkien is racist approach him from the wrong standpoint.As for the modern fantasy reader, those who complain about Tolkien's originality (while acknowledging it, but that later writers do a much better job with it) is like saying Shakespeare, while a good dramatist, is not that good because other people take his principals and make them more exciting, etc. I heard a story once about a person who went to see a Shakespeare play and went away complaining there were too many quotes in the play to make it any good. Shakespeare is the source of these quotes and he did not even realise it.Most people know that Tolkien founded modern fantasy. Tolkien laid down the template for the fantasy genre in general, and anyone who reads fantasy has been touched, directly or indirectly, by Tolkien's work. Almost all of the major fantasy authors have acknowledge their debt to Tolkien, and the shadow Tolkien casts over fantasy literature is very long indeed. Because there is fifty years separating us from the original publication, it is much harder to approach THE LORD OF THE RINGS as those first reviewers, for those who have grown up reading fantasy literature are now accustomed to Dwarves and Elves and Dark Lords and Epic Quests, but when it was issued THE LORD OF THE RINGS transformed and invented an entire new genre. It is not Tolkien's fault that his vision of a mythology was so successful that everyone else decided they would try their hand at fantasy and work within Tolkien's templates. The main problem with fantasy authors in general are they are more interested in emulation than they are in true \\"myth-making.\\" Much like early rock and roll, which, because rock was not an established form of music, the early musicians relied on other forms to create a new genre, Tolkien did not have this tradition to fall back on so instead he used various literatures and epic poems to create his own vision of myth. A lot of fantasy writers do not work in the context of myth any more, but rather rely on genre stereotypes which are generally found in Tolkien. Many readers who are interested in \\"pulp\\" fantasy get bogged down in Tolkien because he takes the time to fully explain his world and its cultures, because his goal is different. There is plenty of action in LORD OF THE RINGS, but those raised on the pulp fantasy will not care for it.Ultimately, THE LORD OF THE RINGS's criticism has shown itself to be of little important on its durability as a major text. Ever since its publication in 1954, 1955, and 1956, LOTR has become one of the most important literary works our era has produced, highly regarded and passionately loved by an enormous amount of people. Despite the very vocal minority who despise Tolkien and his work, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has consistently topped the polls for the best book of the last one hundred years. Whatever the critics say, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is here to stay because popular imagination has grabbed hold of Tolkien's vision and ran with it. Tolkien and Lewis have been wonderfully vindicated in their belief that there is an enormous adult appetite for Myth and fantasy literature.For many, it's more than a mere novel. It's a glimpse of the divine.It is like water in a dry place...-----THE LORD OF THE RINGS is NOT a trilogyI have been looking over the reviews THE LORD OF THE RINGS. There is one consistent problem that keeps jumping to my attention: the reviewers keep talking as if each volume in \\"the trilogy\\" is a self-contained novel. They are not actual novels. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy - it's a single novel divided into three parts for publication purposes. That's why they're published Part I, Part II, and Part III instead of Book I, etc.When Tolkien wrote it and had it published by Allen & Unwin, Sir Stanley Unwin had doubts about its size and the market (remember, this was back in the 50s, and THE HOBBIT had been a book for children - now they have this book that has all the hall marks of a publishing nightmare). Instead of publishing it as a whole, they decided to divide the novel* into three parts. Because there were six subdivisions therein (although I might be mistaken, and these Books I-VI might also be publication impositions), they chose to publish THE LORD OF THE RINGS in three books. One purpose for this was to hide the sheer size of the book. The second reason for doing so was to get three reviews instead of one. Tolkien himself, however, always made it a point to tell people that it is not a trilogy but a single, unified work.Although THE LORD OF THE RINGS basically invented the fantasy genre, from a publisher's standpoint, it was a dangerous gamble. It had to be sold at a high cost (21 shillings) to the reader, but Rayner Unwin (Sir Stanley's son) thought it a \`work of genius', so they published it. Instead of usual royalty payments, Tolkien got half of all profits, which meant that if the book flopped (most probable) he wouldn't get anything, because the book had to pay for itself before either the author OR the publisher got profits. Obviously Tolkien came out far ahead on that deal than had he gone with a more traditional publishing arrangement with Stanley Unwin."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second Lord of the Rings novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. A truly enthralling experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It is not really appropriate to rate this book as a standalone volume, as it is really just a third of a greater story. Nonetheless, this rates a full five stars as the loose ends from the first two parts are tied up.The way things are resolved are both brilliant and follow from what is hinted at before. From the final fate of the Ring to the problems in the Shire, it all fits. In addition, the appendices add a richness to the world of Middle-Earth, giving it a depth in history and language that is incredible.Books have been written about this trilogy, and hundreds of books have tried to imitate it, so it is obviously not a small task to praise it appropriately in this small area. It is sufficient to give it five stars and let it speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers follows the lives of the Fellowship, shortly after they broke up. Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and our beloved dwarf friend Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.For any fan of fantasy or fan of great writing, this is the book for you. A great sequel to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and an excellent read.Three words: Read it now"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This was a wonderful tale that I read after the 2001 Movie. I recommend it! Lots of surprising turns."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkein is a genius. I have never been soo inspired by any other author. I'm not finished with this book yet, but I am soo into it. They just keep getting better and better, and this one seems to be the darkest one yet. The introduction to Gandalf &quot;the White&quot;, and the Ents left me with awe. I have never read such a dramatic book, it is soo POWERFUL."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this life, all good things must come to an end and so must all journeys. THE RETURN OF THE KING is the third and final part of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. This final climatic chapter in Tolkien's masterpiece brings not only the War of the Ring to a close, but it tells of the final days of Middle Earth as well and the beginning of the Fourth Age, the Age of Man.Sam is left to rescue Frodo from the Dark Tower while Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf wage war in defense of Gondor. Meanwhile Aragorn has gone with a small host, including Gimli and Legolas, to fufill a prophecy and pay an old debt. The days were never darker and Sauron's power grows even admist the victories of light. Still all have a role to play (even Gollum) and things aren't always what they seem.THE RETURN OF THE KING ends bittersweetly as one parts with the companions they have traveled with so long. Yet, life goes on and so must we all. Though this journey ends, there is another waiting to begin just around the corner."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second book of The Lord of The Rings, The Two Towers is superior, in my opinion, to The Fellowship of The Ring - a fine book in its own right. This picks up right where that book left off (on a semi-cliffhanger.) The book is broken up into two parts (arguably not the best way to tell the story): the first part concerns the exploits of Aragorn, Legolas and the rest of the Party (sans Frodo and Sam.) This is a fast-moving and exciting part of the book that sets up some important events that come to fruition in The Return of The King. There are several important plot point (and surprises) in this section that would alter the course of the series. The second part concerns Frodo and Sam, and their journey to Mordor with Gollum (!) as their guide. This is a very exciting and dramatic section of the book, and it moves very fast and is a joy to read. I think it's overall better than The Fellowship of The Ring, as it is a great joy to read and very fast-paced - much tighter than The Fellowship, which could move slowly at times. But, of course, the entire series is a masterpiece, and should be read. This book ends on an extreme cliffhanger, so you will want to pick up The Return of The King right after finishing this. The Lord of The Rings is one of the true masterpieces of recent literature, and deserves to be read by everybody. No matter what kind of books you like to read, it is a masterpiece that everyone should be able to say that they've read. And this is perhaps the best overall installment in the series, though they are all essential. Read this masterpiece; it will enrich your life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I like this book for many reasons; adventure, excitement, and a well developed plot all work together to form an excellent book.Some of the parts that I liked were in the beginning, on the trip towards Isengaurd. I also liked the journey with Gollum torads the Black Gate, although it didn't end once they reached it. This book is perfect for readers ages twelve and up. I would also reccomend the other books by J.R.R. Tolkien. They all are full of everything that anyone could want."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Sometimes the middle of a long story is accused of being boring or, at least, inferior to the story's beginning and end. This is not the case with \\"The Two Towers,\\" which lives up to its status as the second of the three volumes of J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by being the true heart of the entire work.After the death of a major character (an event depicted at the end of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"), Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Orcs. The Three Hunters, as they call themselves, encounter a major plot surprise, meet several new characters and take part in an enormous battle before finding their friends, who have escaped their captors and encountered Treebeard, a kindly Ent, or \\"tree-herd,\\" who looks something like a walking, talking tree. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are joined on their journey to Mordor by the sinister, conflicted Gollum, a background presence in \\"Fellowship\\" who now steps into the spotlight.The scenes in the first half of the book with the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli develop their characters and their unlikely friendship to an extent not found in \\"Fellowship.\\" Tall and short, pointy-eared and gruffly emotional, Legolas and Gimli are both the C3PO and R2D2 and the Spock and McCoy of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"; their contest to see who can kill the most Orcs during the Battle of Helm's Deep is gruesome yet delightful. The star of the second half of the book, however, is Gollum, and his interactions with Frodo and Sam serve to define their characters more strongly than before. Imagine that you and your best friend are on a long, dangerous journey with a disgusting, dangerous creature who desperately wants something your friend has and would kill to get it. All your life you have heard the story of how your friend's uncle got this object from the creature and barely escaped from him alive. You never expected to meet or even see the creature yourself, but here he is in the wilderness with you, having sworn to serve your friend. Now you wish the two of you could get rid of the creature -- but you need his help to reach your destination and thus save the entire world. That's the situation Sam Gamgee finds himself in, and the resulting interplay between Sam, Frodo and Gollum makes for great drama. In the book version of \\"Fellowship\\" Gandalf tells Frodo that Gollum both hates and loves himself; readers of \\"The Two Towers\\" will come both to love and hate Gollum. It's no wonder that when the Beatles were planning to make a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie starring themselves, John Lennon apparently desired the role of Gollum, considering it the starring role of the whole story.If you've enjoyed the book or the movie of \\"Fellowship,\\" you should enjoy reading \\"The Two Towers\\" and finding out what happens next. Even if it were not the central third of one of the great novels of the twentieth century, \\"The Two Towers\\" would be one of the world's greatest fantasies in its own right. However, be sure to have a copy of \\"The Return of the King\\" handy when you finish \\"The Two Towers,\\" which, unlike \\"Fellowship,\\" ends with a fairly spectacular cliffhanger..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Two towers is a story when the earth was young and good battled evil for dominent power. Aragorn the man, Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf have done all they can to destroy the evil ring of power. While they are searching for their hobbit companions(kidnapped by orcs) Pippen and Merry, hobbits Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum to Mordor and Sauron's dwelling in an attempt to destroy the ring...The Two Towers is a book that would be properly enjoyed by older, more mature children. Tolkien uses an endless supply of powerful adjectives and description. The story is written with complex sentences and is full of emotion. Aaragorn, Gimli, and Legolas alley with the Riders of Rohan, Riders of the Mark, Gandalf the wizard, and the ents of Fanghorn to fight against Saurumon and his horde of orcs and wild men at Isenguard. The companions share both happy and terrible times with each other. Sometimes in songs and poetry or anger and harsh words.The Two Towers is written in third person point of view. There are two books or sections in The Two Towers. It is like the book is divided up into two parts. Then those parts are divided up into several chapters. The first book is about our companions fighting Saurumon then going there own seperate ways. The sceond half describes more about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum on their way to Mordor.The Two Towers is an extremely well written fantasy. There are orcs, beast, wizards, elfs, dwarfs, and everything else imaginable blended in with race of men. The Two Towers is the second book published in 1956 in the trilogy The Lord of the Rings.This brilliant written fantasy novel, The Two Towers is for the young adult or mature child reader. \\"There are very few works of genius in recent literature. This is one,\\" quoted Michael Straight."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think The Two Towers is a lot better than the Fellowship of the Ring because it has more action. It is also better than the Return of the King because it has an action packed beginning that blew me away.Some of my favorite characters are Treebeard, and Gandalf because he is magical. I also like Saruman even though he is evil.I think it is cool how J. R. R. Tolkien made up his own language. I wonder how the publishers wrote the elvish writing on the ring.I saw the Fellowship of the Rings movie the day it came out and I was amazed at the graphics.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It followsThe Fellowship of the RingandThe Two Towers. Be sure to read both of them first.In the final volume the two main story lines reach their common end. The hobbits Frodo and Sam have been slowly working their way toward the volcano deep in Mordor where the ring can be destroyed. The other main characters and their allies converge by diverse paths on the city Gondor, where they will stand without hope against Sauron's invading armies. No matter what the outcome, there will be some who will not see each other again.This book is necessary if you have read the first two volumes. In fact, it would take tremendous will power not to read it to see how the story ends. A warning if this is your first time through the trilogy. After finishing this book many readers experience a lingering melancholy, a sense of loss for a time. This seems to be only partially due to the story's events. Having traveled, suffered, and grown with the characters, you may miss them. There isn't any easy way to dispel this feeling. In time it will fade."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I really liked this book, even though there were parts of the story that slowed down too much. I liked how this book jumped straight into action where the first book left off. If you haven't read the first book I advise that you do read it before reading this one, or at least read the summary that is found in this book. I enjoyed the first half of the book where you are with Aragorn and his half of the company, but the second half with Frodo and Sam wasn't as exciting. The story kind of lagged and became a little boring. I had already seen the movies and that helped me to stay interested through the slower story line. However, I kept pushing through to the end and I was not disappointed. The ending leaves you wanting more.J. R. R. Tolkien did a great job of creating and illustrating Middle Earth. I feel like I'm living the legend with the main characters. Tolkien did a great job of illustrating the characters. All of their personalities made me feel like I was with them. Here is one of my favorite examples of imagery: \\"Disturbed as if out of a gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away her claw.\\" This is in the part where Sam fights Shelob, but I won't spoil anymore of the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a war like this, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Frodo and Sam are stuck in the vividly horrific Mordor, while the city of Minas Tirith is on the verge of completely crumbling. Tolkien does a phenomenal job of exploring the madness, despair, rage and sorrow that accompany a war, and the way it can affect even the idyllic Shire. And he doesn't forget the slow period of healing that follows -- for people, for civilizations, and even for nature.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Speaking of Frodo, this trilogy's hero is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down to a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.And the supporting characters are not neglected either, with the younger hobbits being exposed to the horrors of war, Aragorn breaking fully into his role as the future king of Gondor, and passionate war-maiden Eowyn affecting the war as nobody else could. Some much-loved characters are lost, and others will be permanently changed.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of this book can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following \\"Return of the King.\\"It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants.

A truly enthralling experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a war like this, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Frodo and Sam are stuck in the vividly horrific Mordor, while the city of Minas Tirith is on the verge of completely crumbling. Tolkien does a phenomenal job of exploring the madness, despair, rage and sorrow that accompany a war, and the way it can affect even the idyllic Shire. And he doesn't forget the slow period of healing that follows -- for people, for civilizations, and even for nature.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Speaking of Frodo, this trilogy's hero is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down to a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.And the supporting characters are not neglected either, with the younger hobbits being exposed to the horrors of war, Aragorn breaking fully into his role as the future king of Gondor, and passionate war-maiden Eowyn affecting the war as nobody else could. Some much-loved characters are lost, and others will be permanently changed.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of this book can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following \\"Return of the King.\\"It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second Lord of the Rings novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. A truly enthralling experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Easily my favorite of all Tolkein's books. He really expands Middle Earth as he follows the stories of each group of the fragmented Fellowship.As to this audio edition, Rob Inglis's narration is quite good---I enjoyed listening to his characterizations and performances of the songs and so forth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There is much to love in Tolkein, and also a lot that is seriously annoying. But the thing I always hated most about this story, and which is even worse in the book than in the movie versions, is how Frodo makes it all the way to the Crack of Doom only to fail in his resolve to destroy the ring, which is only accomplished by Gollum biting off his finger and then accidentally falling in with it. In the crucial moment, the story is ultimately about original sin and redemption by some ineffable \\"higher\\" power. This seriously undercuts the story's drama and heroism.Rob Inglis's narration is quite good---I enjoyed listening to his characterizations and performances of the songs and so forth. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"With the Fellowship broken Sam and Frodo set off to fulfill their destiny alone, following the path into the fires of Mordor while Aragon, Legolas and Gimli set out in pursuit of their captured hobbit comrades, Merry and Pippin. The novel is split into two parts consisting of the friends' separate adventures as the tale of Middle Earth continues to unfold. The world teeters toward the brink of dark destruction with its fate resting squarely on Frodo's shoulders.Tolkien's second installment in the beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy captivates the reader with the same magical gravity and mystical allure as the Fellowship of the Ring and its predecessor, The Hobbit. However, this book did not seem to posses the same depth of substance. As a bridge between the beginning and end of the series it had more of a transient feel; a piece rather than a whole.As always Tolkien writes lyrical flowing prose which captures the very spirit and dark majesty of Middle Earth. He paints vivid pictures of fanciful landscapes, gruesome battles and creatures both terrifying and beautiful. Though the story does tend to drag at several points it never truly grows boring; Tolkien's masterful storytelling and flowery descriptive language is enough to compensate for lags in action. In the end Tolkien leaves another nail biting cliffhanger that will have you clambering for the next part of this epic adventure!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My favorite book series of all time is the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. As a side note, it is also my favorite movies series. My favorite book of the trilogy is probably the third one, \\"The Return of the King\\". It ended the series on an excellent note. I personally identified with many of the characters, particularly Sam, Aragorn, and Eowyn.Here is a summary of the book. The first half of the book chronicles the attack on Minas Tirith, the capital city of the country Gondor. The book opens with the wizard Gandalf and the hobbit Pippin arriving at Minas Tirith. The city is preparing for war, and they have lit their signal beacons to call for help. They go into the city and meet Denethor, the Steward of Gondor. Denethor is nowhere near the moron that the movie version makes him out to be. However, he is starting to go crazy as he uses dark magic to discover just how powerful Sauron is. He is mourning the death of his oldest son, Boromir. Boromir died in the previous book, in an attempt to protect Pippin and his friend Merry from the Orcs, or Goblins. Pippin tells Denethor this, and offers himself into Denethor's service. Pippin becomes part of the tower guard. Sauron's Orcs invade Gondor. In the battle, Faramir, Denethor's youngest son, is seriously wounded. Denethor, thinking Faramir is beyond saving, gets ready to burn himself and Faramir together. Meanwhile, in Rohan, king Theoden is rallying his armies to come and help Gondor. Aragorn, a Ranger, decides to go to enlist the aid of a group of undead traitors who live in the Paths of the Dead. He is accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and a group of Rangers. Back at Gondor, Sauron's armies have surrounded Minas Tirith. They are led by the Witch-King, the king of the Nazgul. However, Sauron's army is defeated by Theoden and the Rohirrim, who arrive just in time. The Nazgul king is killed by Eowyn, with the help of the hobbit Merry. The attacking fleet of Corsair ships arrives, but is revealed to have been taken over by Aragorn, the rangers, and the army of the undead. Sauron's army is crushed. Denethor burns himself to death, but Faramir is saved by Gandalf, Pippin, and the guard Beregond. Gandalf and Aragorn decide to march on Mordor, Sauron's country. They want to create a diversion to allow Sam and Frodo a chance to get through Mordor unseen. Frodo has Sauron's ring. If the ring is destroyed, then Sauron will likewise be destroyed. A battle ensues in front of the gates of Mordor.The second half of the book chronicles the journey of Frodo and Sam. And the end of the previous book, Frodo was captured by a group of Orcs, and imprisoned in a tower. Sam enters the tower in and recues him. The two of them then continue their journey through Mordor. The ring, possessing it's own conciousness, weighs heavy on Frodo in an attempt to wear him down. After several adventures and narrow escapes, Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom, where they hope to destroy the ring. Frodo has the chance to destroy the Ring, but at the last minute is corrupted by it's power. Just then, Gollum appears. Gollum is a creature who possessed the ring for five hundred years. It drove him insane, and now he wants to have it back. He attacks Frodo, and bites off Frodo's finger in his determination. Gollum jumps up and down in his joy at possessing the ring once again, and accidentally loses his balance and falls into the fire. He is destroyed, along with the ring. He has unintentionally done Frodo's job for him. Sauron is destroyed, and his armies run away. Frodo and Sam are reunnited with Aragorn and the rest of the characters, and the four hobbits are proclaimed heroes. Aragorn is then crowned king of Gondor, and marries the elf Arwen. After many long farewells, the hobbits journey back to the shire. To their surprise, they find it has been taken over by a group of men, working for someone named Snarkey. Using what they have learned in their travels, the hobbits lead a revolt and drive the men out of the Shire. Snarkey is then revealed to be Saruman, a wizard who had allied himself with Sauron. He had lost his powers in the previous book. He is murdered by his servant, Grima Wormtongue. Over time, the Shire is healed. However, Frodo cannot heal from his wounds. He was stabbed by the Witch-King is the first book, poisoned by the spider Shelob in the Second book, and had his finger bitten off by Gollum in the third book. He decides to go to the undying lands with the remnant of the elves.My love of this book has to do with my love of many of the characters. My three favorite characters are Sam, Aragorn, and Eowyn. First of all, Sam. Sam is simple, unintelligent, and loyal. He is much like other hobbits, in that he has never ventured far from the Shire. He decides to become Frodo's servant on the long journey to Mordor. Sam is in my opinion the most important character of the story. His simple love for Frodo is what gives Frodo the strength to carry out his task. Throughout the whole trilogy, but particularly in the third volume, Sam's simple courage is what keeps Frodo going. Towards the end, Frodo is completely worn out from carrying the ring. Sam decides to carry Frodo the last leg of the journey, up until they are just in sight of the doorway to the mountain. Sam's loyalty is what end's up saving Middle earth in the long run.Another good character is Aragorn. He is the heir to the throne of Gondor. For many centuries, the country has been ruled, not by a king, but by a steward. The stewards serve as substitutes for the king, ruling in his absence. By this time, however, many people consider the rule of kings over, chief among them the current steward, Denethor. Aragorn is the last survivng member of his line, and he is the only one who can claim the throne and unite the kingdom. He has no wish to do this. He prefers to live as a ranger, hunting the Nazgul and living in solitude. In the end, though, he accepts his responsibility and puts his personal desires aside. He is descended from a family blessed with long life. He and Arwen rule Gondor for one hundred years, before he finally dies.My last important character is Eowyn. She is the neice of king Theoden, and she wishes to go into battle and earn valor. She falls in love with Aragorn after he helps the wizard Gandalf to heal her uncle. When she asks Aragorn to allow her to go into battle with him, he refuses, saying that she needs to care for her people and rule in place of her uncle. He also tells her that he does not return her love. Crushed, Eowyn says that her greatest fear is \\"a cage\\", and that she fears that she will be forced to \\"stay behind bars until use and old age accept them, and all chance of great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire\\". She fears that she will die of old age before she has the chance to gain valor. She ends up disguising herself as a soldier and rides with the army to the Battle outside Gondor. There, she is able to defeat the King of the Nazgul. Now, the Nazgul king is a very fearful presence. He has the power to cause the bravest, most courageous man to run from him in terror. When the Nazgul is about to kill Theoden, it is her love for her uncle, not her bravery, that allows her to stand and fight against the Nazgul.In conclusion, The Return of the King is my favorite book of all time largely due to my love and admiration for the characters. I admire Sam's strong spirit, which enables Frodo to complete the task set before him. I admire Aragorn's selflessness in taking up the crown when it is the last thing is the world he wishes to do. And I admire Eowyn's love which enables her to kill the Nazgul king and most likely win the battle of the Pelennor Fields."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King by J. R. R.

BRILLIANT. It took me a little adjusting to get into, though, because the pacing is so much slower in \\"The Hobbit\\"--so much more drawn-out, so much more detail--but once I got into it I was hooked, and read all three books straight through. Tolkien creates a magical alternate reality--yet one that applies metaphorically to our modern world. He addresses themes such as good versus evil, the destruction of our planet, personal choice on our life's path, sacrificing comfort for growth, treating life as a journey, the dangers of selfish leaders, the temptations of addiction (The Ring of Power!).I sometimes, felt, though, that he was metaphorically speaking about modern human races--black, white, Asian, etc.--when he spoke of the different \\"races\\" of Middle Earth, and that made me uncomfortable, because I didn't feel the message was that enlightened... But he may not have meant it at all. I don't know if others sensed this.But overall, this series, and particularly \\"The Return of the King,\\" like \\"The Hobbit,\\" is a grand reminder that the little guy can rise above and change the world. And don't we need to hear this message now more than ever?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Nicely done! The book was in very good shape, matched the one I lost, and was shipped and received promptly. Just what I hoped I'd get. Hardly any wear, which is rare in an old paperback; but just as advertised. Good job!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I can't imagine someone getting the first two audiobooks and NOT wanting this last book, too. The reader is up to his usual high quality. It ships with 16 CDs -- but only 12 CDs are associated with this third book. The last 4 CDs are JRRT notes, summaries, background material, etc that only the most diehard fan would appreciate."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This concluding volume includes dramatic war scenes between larger-than-life characters that read like a latter-day Illiad. The climax of the story solves in a dramatic and satisfying matter the riddle of how Frodo can dispense of the ring despite its irresistible power over anyone who bears it. Much of the morality tale consists of the need to abstain from revenge and evil means in dealing with evil, lest one be corrupted by it. It's an ancient theme of many myths, and one that, for example, George Lucas uses to great effect in his Star Wars movies.The final third of the book is post-climactic though not necessarily anti-climactic. There is a great odyssey homeward and the casting out of ruffians and evil pretenders. And there is a sadness to the book's ending given the long-term effects of war and the ring on the heroes.This is a great epic tale. Inglis' reading is very effective and adds to the richness of the work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the final episode of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".

Tolkien, and out of the books I've read by him this definitey is one of the better. It may not be better than the Hobbit (There and Back Again) though I think it is much better than the Fellowship of the Ring. The first hundred pages might be fairly slow but that would be what it would be if it were real life. Also, the pages after the first hundred are more gripping and exciting than almost any section in the entire Fellowship of the Ring. Even after the boring pages it is still a good read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"1) Gollum (Smeagle) is the epitome of the lowest creation. From the beginning when he murdered his best friend for the ring Gollum was doomed. He had the ring, but it possessed him. However, he lost the ring and even though it pained him he still loved and longed for it. It was his own, his precious. Gollum disappears, but then returns during the fellowship. After guiding Frodo and Sam he betrayed them in an effort to seize the ring. In the Return of the King he reappears and shadows Frodo and Sam. He plays an integral role in the completion of the task of the fellowship in Tolkien's ironic way.2) The unconventional way of wizards is an example of Tolkien's creativity. Most wizards have a wand, but Tolkien's wizards, though they are mystifying, seem to be the caretakers and historians of the world and are concerned for the greater well being of the earth and its inhabitants. They also seem to gain power from knowledge. When Gandalf returned as Gandalf the White he speaks of learning much and he has also increased in power. However, wizards are susceptible to the temptation of evil because a dark wizard is more powerful.3) The main object of the epic is the ring. The ring is inanimate yet it can turn anyone who possesses it towards evil even if they wish otherwise. It also could turn those who put it on invisible. The rings main purpose is to return to its master (Sauron). When it was created Sauron put part of him in it, in order to make him more powerful. It was also part of a masterful plan to force every creature under his power.4) Tolkien's depiction of the evil Sauron as a lidless eye that sees all is interesting anthropomorphism because he possesses the attributes of most evil beings, but since he is unable to take physical form he is a mysterious unseen powerful ruler. The Eye of Sauron sees all yet its attention can be focused on an area, allowing things to slip.5) The Ents are a truly original Tolkien conception. They are trees that have been awakened. Though their major role is in the Two Towers they do appear in this novel. They live to be extremely old, and don't like to be hasty. They also can break stone easily.6) Though the title of the book concedes the knowledge of the king's (Aragorn) return, after this event the book unexpectedly continues. After all the hobbit's hardships, when they reach home they still have to deal with an unforeseen difficulty. Saramen, a character who was thought to be out of the book, resurfaces at the head of the conflict. In the chapter the \\"The Scouring of the Shire,\\" Tolkien twists the plot and creates a small climax as the four hobbits rebel against men.7) This book, as with the previous two novels, showcases Tolkien's conceptual world. He masterfully is able to take the reader into this world, as if the story was fact.8) This verse opens the book. &quot;Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his dark throneIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.&quot; It sets the stage for the coming tale and leaves the reader waiting to uncover more9) A skilled linguist, Tolkien's elven language further contributes to the overall sense of reality.10) By focusing on minor characters, such as Merry and Pippin, Tolkien is able to keep the reader from predicting the next event."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King picks up where The Two Towers left off. In this final installment our attention turns to the western part of Middle-earth as the Ring continues its journey toward Mount Doom and Aragorn and Theoden lead their armies toward Minas Tirith.I've read some reviews here that express disappointment with the lack of a final face-to-face conflict with Sauron. They ask &quot;How could he be so dumb?&quot; These people, I think, have missed the point. Just as I think the second book is about the acceptance of destiny, The Return of the King is about the arrogance of Evil. Sauron and his minions never believed they could be defeated. Gandalf said as much when he figured that Sauron couldn't even imagine so simple an assault could be his undoing. Also, I find Sauron more frightening in his non-corporeal form. If he made a physical appearance at the end it would have greatly diminished his ability to frighten.I find that the strange ending with Saruman works. It shows how the Shire can no longer be isolated from the affairs of the world. The Ring Quest dragged the Shire, kicking and screaming, into the Fourth Age all the while seasoning her future leaders for the tasks that lie ahead.The appendices included here are invaluable to anyone who either wants to read more about Middle-earth's past."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am new to the fantasy genre. As I started on the first pages of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (in anticipation of the movie), I did not know exactly what to expect and was initially put off by the many songs and by &quot;Tom Bombadil&quot;. But after that brief state of confusion, I have come to thoroughly enjoy Tolkien's writings, the luscious details of history and geography, and - of course - the characters.In THE TWO TOWERS Tolkien dazzles us with his imagination and continues to bring all the components of Middle Earth to full life, in a description so vivid that one thinks that it must exist. Each half of the book builds up to climactic experiences as we journey through the lands of men and darkness, while the presence of the hobbits - their simplicity and naivete' - anchors us firmly to the human side of the epic. Characters are given more chances to express their individuality and to prove their worth as they face physical demons, and the ones that reside in their heads. The growth in characters such as Samwise Gamgee is very genuine and gripping. We are left at the end with a cliffhanger that compels you to read the last part of the trilogy. (I wonder what Peter Jackson will do about that?)One could argue about the lack of humor and female characters, but ultimately it is the beauty and the sense of purpose behind Middle Earth, its inhabitants and its history that should win over even the most skeptical of readers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Honestly, after finishing Lord of the Rings, I can't help but feel sad because it's over!!!This story is incredible, the characters are profound, and very real, the Middle Earth comes to life in such a way that it becomes impossible to think that it doesn't exist, and there are so many different tales left untold that would be worth telling.There really isn't enough I can say about this books, and especially about the Return of the King. We find each character following his own destiny, and facing his deepest fears, we see inner struggle, a huge war where each piece is as important as the rest and where they all move wisely and bravely into what awaits them, we discover courage in whom we least expect, and above all we find ourselves celebrating with them victory and love.

I like the sense of inclusion and completeness when you finish a great series.Like it or not, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most influential books of the century - it spawned an entire genre in its ideas and precepts. Some people find Tolkien too slow, his ideas to archaic and/or derivative (but since he was in many ways the original, Middle Earth at least is not derivative).This is not an entirely happy ending trilogy - Tolkien did live through the second world war after all. It is high fantasy at its best, glinting, tragic, fighting against evil, the characters larger than life and vulnerable at the same time. I read these books every summer as a treat. Some people find them boring, too slow, too much description (it is a very rich world). All I can say is that if you read fantasy, any fantasy at all, then you should love these books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"...In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.\\" In this second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Frodo, the unwilling heir of the one ring, decides to journey off alone with his servant Samwise Gamgee. He makes his way eastward to Mordor and the fire mountain, Mount Doom. Meanwhile, his friends and companions from the Fellowship are caught in a bloody quarrel with the trader Saroman in his well-guarded fortress, Isengard. Saroman sends his army to destroy the main city of Rohan, but the great army of King Theoden soon beats his bloodthirsty orcs. Saroman is soon attacked by the ents of Fangorn forest, and his putrid fortress is destroyed. The book ends with the coming of the great darkness and a terrible War of the Rings. What happens to Frodo, the ring, and his friends remains to be seen in the next book.When I first picked up this book, Tolkien's marvelous writing compelled me, and made me see the emotions and terrible hardships Frodo and Sam have to endure on their journey, and also let me experience the terrible battles first hand. I recommend this book to people who have wild imaginations and who can stay on topic with the story's crazy names and titles. This book was great and I can't wait to read the final installment!Vince S.Des Plaines, IL"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is the conclusion to Tolkien's epic The Lord of the Rings. We pick up the story from 'The Two Towers'. Frodo and Sam are making their way to Mordor with the help of Gollum/Smeagol. The rest of the fellowship have survived Helm's Deep and Isengard. They again split up as Gandalf and Pippin race to Minas Tirith. Aragorn is charging with gathering an army meet Sauron in battle.This book is divided into two parts. One focuses on Frodo and Sam's journey, the other on the rest of the fellowship. This makes keeping track of the chronology of the story a little difficult, but it avoids jumping back and forth between the various story lines.We follow the story, as the forces for good gather to face the evil Sauron. Aragorn steps out of his role as the ranger from the North and into the true king of Gondor. We watch the Steward of Gondor, Lord Denethor, slip into madness. We see Eowyn rise in battle. This part of the book rises to a fevered pitch culminating in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.The other half of the book follows the journey of Frodo and Sam. This section is harder to read. Frodo changes from the happy hobbit to a darker creature becoming more and more obsessed with the ring. However, as we see Frodo slipping away, Sam steps out of his humble past to carry Frodo towards Mount Doom.After the culmination of the War of the Ring, the book continues the story of the aftermath. We see that the scars of the journey have not gone away.Enjoy this final installment of the LOTR. It will leave you wanting more. Luckily their are several appendices that follow story lines Tolkien couldn't include in the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The beautiful conclusion of the entire trilogy is realized here. This novel is satisfying on many levels and has a complexity and vision that is missing from many of it's imitators.Please be aware though that there is a difference in the pacing of the novel from the films. I read the novel before I saw the film, and it is possible that seeing the film first may distract some readers. This novel is written at a leisurley place, it is not a quick read, but it is a doorway into the authors imagination and philosophy. Definitely worth the trip."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The story of the Lord of the Rings begins with the Hobbit, then the Fellowship of the Ring, next the Two Towers, and is concluded with the Return of the King. I would recommend reading the first three books before reading this one. Frodo and Sam are on the final leg of their journey to Mount Doom, but their resolve is failing. With the Armies of Gondor vastly outnumbered by the Orcs, will it even be in time?This classic book written by JRR Tolkien is sure to be a book you'll remember for a very long time. Each of the books, especially the Return of the King are packed with details. It is easy to visualize everything in your mind. I would encourage everyone to read it!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the Return of the King concludes the exciting story of the fellowship of the ring. It offers more excitement and suspense as well as several surprises. Tolkien consistently stretches the reaches of imagination, and he always provides logic and reason so that his story makes sense and follows a consistent stream of creativity.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion. The Return of the King offers much more than the movie version. There is much more to the story here that the movie did not reveal, so readers will be very pleased to find additional events. Additionally, the book takes different turns than the movie. Tolkien offers characters that inspire, teach, warn, and revulse the reader due to their goodness or evil. This book involves romance as well. One of my favorite characters is Faramir. He is revealed as a warrior and leader possessing great integrity and courage.In this book, Tolkien reveals the true character of the King as a healer as well as a fighter and leader. This book has all of the insight into human behavior and personality as do Shakespeare's plays. I was sorry to reach the end of it. It was as entertaining a book as I have read.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.There is no let up in the action at all in the concluding book and like the others there are surpises around every turn.If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I just finished reading Return of the King, and I thought it was a great book. I'll admit that it took me awhile to get going, but then it started to pick up and I couldn't put it down. I thought the second half of the book, where it follows Frodo and Sam, was more interesting then the battles between the dark forces and the forces of man.I thought all the symbols and foreshawdowing that Tolkien used made the book very interesting. I also really enjoyed the parallels between christianity and the Lord of the Rings Series. I think that this is definantly a good book, and I think that everyone should read the series!This book has gotten me incredibly hyped up for the release of the new movie! I am looking forward to see if Peter can pull off all the things that he needs too!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is the third and final installment of J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Even though the forces of good have one great victories at Helm's Deep and Isengard they are not out of the woods yet. The evil armies of Mordor are coming to attack Gondor, so Gandalf, Aragon and company must hurry to its defense. At the same time Frodo and Sam draw closer to Morder and Mount Doom, but even as they do the Ring becomes more and more of burden on both of them. Will Gandalf, Merry, Pippin and Aragon have enough strength to defend Gondor and drive away the Dark Lord's Armies? Will Frodo and Sam fulfull their quest to destroy the ring? You are just going to have to read the book to find out.Tolkein's trilogy is the father of all modern fantasy series. Before Jordan, before Martin, before Eddings, before Brooks there was Tolkein. Every single fantasy author that comes along owes a debt to the work of Tolkein - because not only did Tolkein do it first, he did it better. His characters and settings seem to leap off the page and you find yourself reading with bated breath to find out what happens next. His world is in depth, colorful and unforgettable. Most important Tolkein understands the need to have a beginning, a middle and an end to his series (this is directed at you Robert Jordan). His series tells the story it set out to tell and reaches the end of its tale. So many more recent writers have their series stretching on and on for no apparent reason.(Side note: Has anyone ever noticed how the first few chapters of Robert Jordan's &quot;Eye of the World&quot; are almost a direct lift from Fellowship of the Ring? Boys (hobbits) living in a remote village (the shire) are visited by a mysterious Aes Sedai (Gandolf) who alerts them to a growing danger (The ring). They are then forced to flee from the Myradraal (the Ringwraiths) with the help of the Aes Sedai and her warder (Strider). I actually read Jordan first and have since read Tolkein and trust me Jordan just re-wrote the first part of Fellowship)If you want to read how great epic fantasy can be the only place to start is with Tolkein. Tolkein's work puts all of the others to shame in its story, its characters..everything. The movies that go along with the books are good too, but I always read the book before I see the movie; otherwise the movie kills what ever ideas I had in my head beforehand. Before you read Jordan, Brooks, or Martin - read Tolkein. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Return of the King by J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo continues his quest to destroy the one ring. This book grabs the reader's attention and doesn't let go.In the novel, Frodo continues his quest to destroy the one ring, with the ring always weighing heavily upon him. He must destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, a mountain deep within Mordor, the realm of the dark lord Sauron. In the meantime, Pippen and Gandalf make their way to Gondor, where they face perils of their own. While Merry, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Riders of Rohan travel back towards Rohan to gather their strength and ride also to Gondor, to aid in fighting against the siege that was inevitably about to hit. Later Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and some of the others split from the group and take another route to get there even faster. Throughout the book all of the characters go through many perils, even those not going straight into Mordor.This book grabs your attention and doesn't let go. It doesn't have a dull moment in it. Even in the few moments of quiet, it still has something interesting going on. It is extremely creative and inventive. It has many unexpected events and twists. I recommend that you read this book, but it is very important to read the first two books of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, before you read this one to avoid a great deal of confusion. I also recommend that if you enjoy these books you should read the prequel, The Hobbit.The Return of the King was a captivating, creative and thrilling book. It keeps the reader guessing until the very end and even then it has an unexpected twist. The novel has a range of emotions from joy to fear to sadness, often all at once. Though each character has a different job, each has their own significance."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This third installment in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is a worthy successor to the previous two books. Tolkien wraps up all the loose ends with a wonderful, almost poetic, style.Saruman has been defeated, and now the armies of good must race to the city of Minas Tirith to stave off the assault of Sauron's forces. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam must continue their quest through Mordor to destroy the Ring. Battles rage and wills are tested as the forces of evil bring seemingly overwhelming force to bear on the defenders of Middle-Earth. It is in this fury that Tolkien allows his characters to become their true selves: majestic personalities of great strength and courage. Even the small hobbits rise to great things. Frodo's struggle with the Ring continues, while Sam first fights to save him, and then fights to keep him moving on his quest. As the quest comes to an end, the reader gets to see most of the characters from the previous books one more time, and watch as the hobbits return to the Shire, discovering the effect the conflict has had on their home.Tolkien truly wrote a great story in this book. He not only has a great skill for description of situations, but also for human personality and emotion. This is evident first at the battle for Minas Tirith, where varying personalities shape the conflict, and then with Frodo and Sam in Mordor, which makes for the most compelling reading in the book. Sam's concern for his master and Frodo's struggle with his burden are detailed masterfully.This book is a great ending to this wonderful trilogy. It really is a quick read, and lacks some of the slower parts of the previous two books. The whole trilogy is great, and this final installment makes the time spent reading the trilogy more than worth the effort. This is just a fantastic ending to a great story of strength, courage, love and loyalty."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Return of the King, Frodo and Sam continue their perilous journey to destroy the Ring of Power in the fires of Mt. Doom. Throughout the book there are many exciting battles and scenes, and the end of the book is worth reading all of the books just to see how it ends. I have seen and loved the first two movies, and this book is far better than both of those. I strongly recommend reading The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I loved this book.This is my favorite book out of the three (or two, I have not yet read &quot;The Return of the King&quot;) because it really focused on the characters that in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; were just the supporting characters. The character development in this book was incredible. You start the book not really knowing anything at all about these people and end it knowing so much. I think Tolkien was able to do this because the book did not entirely focus on Frodo.My favorite part in the book is Golem. I really liked the little part he played in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; but I liked him the best in this book. It's really cool how Tolkien showed him as he loved and hated the ring and also how he had this strange affection for Frodo.This book is amazing. I loved everything about it from the way it was written to the art on the cover. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read this book after seeing the first movie. It is extremely well written, thorough storytelling. The adventures in this book are at least as exciting-if not more than-the first movie. (I say movie because I did not read the first book yet, I only saw the movie.) The characters become more interesting, more three dimensional in this second book. And the settings are spectacular. I was moved to draw several of the places mentioned in this book. I found myself wishing to visit an Ent-hall, to explore beautiful hidden caverns, to look out upon an ancient city. Absolutely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well, if you liked The Fellowship of the Ring of The Lord of the Rings series, then you'll have a ball with The Two Towers. In the second part of this story, it continues off with the scattered fellowship looking for their ring-bearer, Frodo, who somehow disappeared along with Samwise. Along with that, the quest continues with Frodo continuing his quest of destroying the ring of all evil in Mordor.J.R.R. Tolkien is a tremendous writer. Besides The Lord of the Rings, others stories like The Silmarillion is a great example of his work. This book is like an introduction of Middle-Earth, which is where The Lord of the Rings series take place. If Tolkien hadn't existed in his time, then how would fans of the him be able to live without his stories? Without J.R.R. Tolkien, then his stories wouldn't exist and how could we live with that? He also uses great imagery in his stories, which is a great asset to the series.For the fans of Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings is highly recommended, for it is written by a great author. Not only that, you don't even have to be a fan of the author. If you love stories with magic, friendship, and a fight between good and evil, then this series is a perfect match for you. For friendship, both Frodo and Sam will go far beyond the dangers of Middle-Earth to destroy that ring. If one falls, then the other falls also. That's how friendships work between Frodo and Sam. Their bond is their courage to continue on to Mordor. For me, this is why I love this story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In my review of his reading of the Fellowship of the Ring, I gave poor old Rob Inglis a bit of a drubbing (rated three stars). And, in my review of the second set, I am going to give him a bit of a break.My general comments about Inglis stand. He is a bit one paced. Because of the nature of his voice he is limited as to the range of voices he can adopt. And he as a tendency to read in an arch, almost pretentious manner which does the book and many of the characters something of a disservice. I think that because of his own age, Inglis has a tendency to make his characters sound older than they should. The best example of this is Aragorn and it was my wife who made this point first. I have always seen him as a young, vigorous man - early thirties. This is how Peter Jackson also saw him if his casting is any judge. But Inglis' rendering suggests a middle-aged man - in his mid fifties.However, my recommendation, then, as now, is to buy this version as it is the only extant unabridged version of Lord of the Rings that is available.Having said that, he seems appreciably better in his rendering of the characters in this volume of the trilogy - perhaps he grew into the reading as he went along - this often happens. There are certain characters which he has \\"nailed\\" - among them Tree Beard and most importantly of all, Gollum. Inglis' rendering of Gollum is near letter-perfect.For all my quibbles, I was completely addicted to this reading. I drive about 30 minutes to and from work each day - and have a 2 hour drive to and from our farm on weekends. If I ever found myself in the car at the end of a set of CDs, with a long drive ahead of me, I almost went stir crazy. I should also say that my brother, also a LoTR aficionado does not have the same problem with Inglis - he even likes listening to the songs! - which I still find un-listenable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"One of the most astounding traits of Tolkein's writing is his uncanny ability to create different races that are unique in their ownright but altogether familiar to us personally. Tolkein seems to have taken a very personal vision and expressed it in a universal way. The characters are easy to relate to and the adventure is captivating...5 stars for Mr. Tolkein ..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"this is the best book for you if you liked there and back again"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It is not really appropriate to rate this book as a standalone volume, as it is really just a third of a greater story. Nonetheless, this rates a full five stars as the loose ends from the first two parts are tied up.The way things are resolved are both brilliant and follow from what is hinted at before. From the final fate of the Ring to the problems in the Shire, it all fits. In addition, the appendices add a richness to the world of Middle-Earth, giving it a depth in history and language that is incredible.Books have been written about this trilogy, and hundreds of books have tried to imitate it, so it is obviously not a small task to praise it appropriately in this small area. It is sufficient to give it five stars and let it speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers has always been my favorite book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy because there is no introductory material as in Fellowship of the Ring or winding-down material as in Return of the King. It is instead the heart of the story.Divided into two halves, the first half follows the majority of the Fellowship as they contend with the secondary but still very dangerous villain, Saruman. The second half follows the hobbits Frodo and Sam as they are forced into an uneasy alliance with the weasely Gollum and approach the hellish land of Mordor.Since this is the middle part of a larger story, few things are resolved. This is fine, as this is not meant to be read as a standalone book. It does, however, represent great storytelling, with rich detail and characters.Many have tried to imitate this trilogy and few have come even close to being near Tolkien's level. This story is not only one of the greatest fantasy stories ever, it is one of the great fictional works of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers follows the lives of the Fellowship, shortly after they broke up. Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and our beloved dwarf friend Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.For any fan of fantasy or fan of great writing, this is the book for you. A great sequel to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and an excellent read.Three words: Read it now"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although it is not light reading it is really a great book. It is part of a series and is the second one in the series. If you have not read the first one (which is called The Fellowship of the Ring ) you will not understand this book at all.The most common good races that you see in this book are: elves, dwarfs, men, and hobbits.Hobbits are very short and have curly hair. They dislike adventures, ( And in this book there are four hobbits having adventures.)This book is a great one and I hope you will read it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, readers will wonder if he can actually give it up.Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching.As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Two Towers&quot; opens with the dispersal of the Fellowship Of The Ring. Boromir, eldest son of the Steward of Gondor, is killed by marauding Orcs intent on capturing Merry and Pippin. In a sense, his heroic death is an act of redemption on his part, after trying to seize the Ring from Frodo. Merry and Pippin are carried off by these Orcs, servants of the corrupt wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas begin their trek towards Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, hoping to overtake Saruman's Orcs. And Frodo and Samwise proceed towards Mordor and Mount Doom.This second installment of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; is in two parts; the first deals with the exploits of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The second recounts Frodo's and Samwise's perilous journey to Mordor. Without a doubt, this is the most character driven installment of the entire &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; saga. Without giving away the plot, the book is an insightful survey of the main characters and their motivations. Suffice it to say that their interactions amongst themselves as well as with important minor characters such as Fangorn, the chief of the Ents, play an important part in determining the outcome of the war of the Ring.Much of Tolkien's best writing can be found in this book. I found &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as engrossing as either &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; or &quot;The Return Of The King&quot;, the third book in the trilogy. Incidentally, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; refers to Saruman's tower, Orthanc, at Isengard, and the Dark Lord Sauron's tower in Mordor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"...that the Kindle store has The Fellowship Of The Ring and The Return Of The King but not The Twin Towers?

I had read LOTR several times before, but I enjoyed this reading almost more than the original books.The only thing I missed was a list of the tracks.

I highly recommend it for audio book lovers and lovers of the series.This makes for a great cd set to keep at your work desk or in the car..or even, like me, in your collection for listening to while exercising or doing chores around the house!A little pricey but you definitely get your money's worth!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Return of the King' marks the conclusion of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Actually, the story really begins in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit,' but that book is not necessarily needed in order to understand 'The Lord of the Rings.' The story began in 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' in which the wizard Gandalf learns of the return of Sauron, a being of great evil, and discovers that Bilbo Baggins possesses the one thing that will make Sauron's return complete: the 'one' ring.The 'one' ring was discovered by Bilbo in 'The Hobbit.' He relieved its original owner, Gollum (a cave dwelling creature with multiple personalities), while on an adventure with Gandalf and a platoon of dwarves out to destroy a dragon, recover the dwarven king's treasure, and the dwarves' home. The ring will make it's wearer invisible, and in the right hands, will give it's bearer incredible power. However, the ring is evil and seeks to bend the will of those who wear it to conquest.In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' Gandalf decided that Bilbo was no longer fit to wear the ring and sent him off to see the elves. Frodo, Bilbo's nephew, was Gandalf's hand picked successor to carry the ring, and was sent off with a few friends on an adventure to ultimately destroy the ring in the one place it can actually be destroyed: the home of Sauron and actual forging place of the ring known as Mount Doom.Bilbo, accompanied by Samwise, Merry, and Pippin (three other hobbits), and eventually Gimli (a grumbling axe carrying dwarf), Legolas (the bow weilding elf), the Ranger Strider (also known as Aragon), and other along the way set off to carry the ring to Mount Doom. Along the way, they encounter Ring Wraiths and other perils.The story continued in 'The Two Towers,' in which the Fellowship was split. Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli set off to help fight the coming war while Merry and Pippin are carried off to other battlefields. Fearing for his friend's safety, Frodo set off on his own with the ring, and was followed by Sam and the creature Gollum.The story finally concludes in 'The Return of the King.' The Orcish armies of Sauron have massed to attack Gondor. Strider must rally the armies of Middle Earth to fight against Sauron's dark forces. He must also make a decision as to whether he should reveal his true identity as the true King of Gondor. In the meantime, Frodo and Sam seek to complete the final stage of their journey to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring.Anyone who has read a great deal of fantasy literature will see Tolkien's influence. The power of the ring is mimiced in other fantasy novels, such as R.A. Salvatore's 'The Crystal Shard,' the races of elves, dwarves, and orcs are oft repeated my dozens upon dozens of fantasy authors, and the other magical items and treasures are now commonplace in fantasy literature. His description of the ring wraiths is the model by which all other undead creatures are compared against. Tolkien's work was obviously influenced by ancient mythology from the Norse to the Romans and perhaps by such novels as Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' with his portrayal of the undead.Tolkien accomplished his goal of writing a long sustained narrative. Depending on which version of the trilogy the reader gets, he is likely facing 1,000 pages of fine print text. At times, the reader will likely think Tolkien was either being paid by the word, or that he just wanted to write as long a story as possible. While the rich detail Tolkien provides is artful, it can be a bit tedious.For instance, the opening chapters of 'The Return of the King' detail the march of the armies to Gondor in minute detail. This goes on for dozens of pages. Bye the end of it, the reader feels like they have marched to Gondor across mountains and miles of fields. Perhaps that was Tolkien's goal, but it does make the book discouraging to read at times. A similar effect happens as Tolkien details Frodo and Sam's weariness as the approach Mount Doom. Also, nobody in the trilogy appears to be able to say 'goodbye' in under the space of three to five pages.The novel does have a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy that is entirely appropriate. The final chapters only relate to the larger story in a remote fashion, but they are a fun read. Sam, in my opinion the true hero of the final volume of the trilogy, steals the spotlight from Frodo, the protagonist of much of the trilogy. His actions, will, and resolve allow Frodo to see his quest to an end (whether that be good or bad, you'll have to read the novel to find out). Yet, Sam is one of the least celebrated characters in the trilogy compared to Frodo, Aragon, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf.I enjoyed reading the trilogy. Anyone who has seen Peter Jackson's recent movie treatments of the trilogy will probably enjoy these books as well. If you haven't seen the movies yet, I recommend reading each novel first before viewing the movie. This was the plan I used, and it made the movies immensely enjoyable. It is a rare incident when the movie turns out to be better than the book, but Jackson's movies so far have been better than Tolkien's novel, at least in my opinion. General fans of fantasy literature will enjoy this trilogy, if for nothing more than they will recognize Tolkien's influence in the works they are already familiar with."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Ring:The Return of the KingBy: J.R.R. TolkienThe Return of the King is the third book in a three bookSeries. The Return of the King is a exhilarating conclusion ofFrodo Baggins and his Fellowship of eight that accompany himacross Middle Earth to Mordor to destroy the one ring. The storystarts out with the fellowship separated. Frodo and Sam are atShelob&#65533;s lair. Sam thinks that Frodo is dead and leaves him,he takes the ring and sets out to mordor alone. Aragorn,Legolas, and Gimli are setting out to Gondor to reveal thatAragorn as the heir to the throne of Gondor. Find outmore you have to read this book I ensure you that you willlove it!This book is my absolute favorite. The characters were soBelivable that it felt like they was real. I was very emotionallyinvolved with this book and always wanted to read it.The book didn&#65533;t say any thing important but was still very good.The plot kept me interested the whole time and was alwaysExciting. At a rating of 1 to 4 I would give this book a 4!I loved this book sooooo much !!! The book reminded meof The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien because of all of theadventure and also because it is the prelude to the Lordof the Ring. I felt excitement every time I read the bookand I would recommend this book to anyone who likesfantasy, adventures. A book like this only comes out oncein a life time so you should definitely read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you have read the other 2 books in this series, then this book is a must. To begin with, the ending of The Two Towers leaves you hanging so much that you need to go to a bookstore immediatly to find out what happens. Of course, instead of telling what happens to Frodo and Sam first, you hear about Legolas, Aragorn, Pippin, Merry and company. This part of the book is one that you cant skip, otherwise you wont understand the plot. I would give details of what happens, but that is for you to find out!If you haven't read The Two Towers, but have seen the movie, you need to read The Two Towers first. At the end of the movie they leave out about 100 pages of the book. If you haven't read the Fellowship of the Ring, i suggest that you read that also, as it includes many characters that you don't hear about in the movie, and is more fulfilling than the movie is.In all, I suggest that you read this book, and stop questioning whether you should or not. If you haven't read the series, read that first. The Hobbit is a very good book to start off with, so that would be good to read first. Go on, click on the buy it now button!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am not a big book person so when I say this book was awesome it really is awesome. I actually doubted that the ring would be destroyed. I thought Sam and Frodo were going to die before they reached Mt. Doom if not from lack of water, than certainly from the Orcs camped all around it.The book was also outstanding in the way it was written. I liked how Tolkien put the climax of the whole series right in the middle of the third book, as opposed to the end like people would normally do. It made you think that life would go on happily ever after but, as you find out, there was still a challenge waiting for the hobbits at the end of the book.It was also great the part Gollum played in this whole series. He went from ultimate savior, to ultimate traitor, back to the savior all in two books. I knew that he would have something to do with destroying the ring, because that's what Gandalf said, but I didn't think that he would actually be the one the destroy it.I also thought it was great how Tolkien portrayed the effects of the ring on Frodo. How just hanging the ring around his neck and only putting it on a couple times made him slave to it. I thought that would happen though because you get the feeling from the book that nothing is as easy as it seems. I knew that it would take more than just dropping the ring into the fire for Frodo to relinquish it.In conclusion this book is the best book in the best series of books that I have ever read. I highly recommend that you check it out. It will be well worth your time. I am sorry if I gave away to much of the story for you but I had to."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Why is this book not available on American Kindle yet? This book will definitely get 5 stars when I can read it again. I've read this series so often, I've had to replace my books. I've even watched the movie version ( which I rarely do as they never compete with the books. I got my Kindle for Christmas this year and wanted to place this series on it just to find I couldn't. what's the deal?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"NOTE: This review contains major spoilers. So if you haven't read the book or haven't seen the film, then don't read what's below this sentence.-----------------------------------------It's fairly obvious that there are differences between the film and the book. And it's safe to say that there are some (but not all) improvements that were made for the film.First off, this second volume of Lord of the Rings contains two parts. The Fellowship of the Ring has separated: the first part deals with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, the return of Gandalf, and the people of Rohan. It also contains Merry and Pippin finding themselves in Fangorn Forest, home of the ancient Ents. These two plots are connected with Isengard in both its rise and fall from grace. Then the second part deals with Frodo, Sam, and the creature Gollum as they journey to the land of Mordor, where Mount Doom and Barad-Dur stand with the shadows. Before I read Two Towers, I knew that this book separated Frodo and Sam's adventures away from the Rohan/Isengard storyline. And having watched the (Extended) film many times, I went ahead and read the book as if I watched the film. For example, I read the chapter \\"The Black Gate is Closed\\" as soon as I finished reading \\"Treebeard\\" and \\"The White Rider\\". It may not be what Tolkien intended, but I enjoyed it this way. I still don't understand why Tolkien didn't have all three main adventures integrated in with each other, instead of segregating Frodo/Sam's adventures away from the journeys of Pippin/Merry & Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas/Rohan. Maybe in the 50's, that way of storytelling never occured to anybody. Oh well.Anyway, \\"The Two Towers\\" is far more exciting than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\". For one thing, you have The people of Rohan. Their bonding with horses fascinates me: they're vikings, but with mammals instead of ships. Then, you have the Dead Marshes, which is probably THE scariest setting in the fantasy genre. You also have the dark and gloomy lair of Shelob: the sequence is so intense that the goosebumps are a must. Now in the film, I found Gollum to be a bit too exaggerated and very annoying at times. But in the book, his schizophrenic personality really works. And finally, it's nice to see a completely different Faramir in the book, though the film version is much better: Denethor wanting the Ring makes for a big motive when you really want to impress your father.But of course, this book does have its disadvantages. Having Boromir die in the very first chapter seems a bit too improper. The son of Denethor dies and it all turns exciting, but then in the next chapter, all Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli do are run across the river Entwash and in the fields of Rohan. That slows the whole book down, unfortunately. SEcondly, the return of Gandalf wasn't really at all shocking: when you bring back a character that's presumed dead, that's more like a typical Hollywood moment. Maybe it's just me and that I've seen way too much mature films and TV shows.Then, we have Eowyn. To tell you the truth, I have to thank P. Jackson, F. Walsh, and P. Boyens for making her more of a central supporting character in the film. In the book, she's almost pushed aside (though, in \\"Return of the King,\\" she gets her chance with what she has to say and do). It's arguable whether Tolkien was a sexist (or even a racist), because there are hardly any female characters about. The Fellowship is consisted of only males. I know that LOTR is a trilogy for males, but the author could've at least make one of the four hobbits female, or maybe Legolas. Luckily, Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series gets a point for giving females a chance at breaking the female cliche found in fantasy.Theodin as the good and noble king is also a tired old cliche. The character's way too nice; again, the film version improves on this very greatly. Here, he's much praised by his people and he makes all the right decisions and yadda yadda yadda. Makes me want to read George R.R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series immediately after finishing LOTR.With all the things that got me down while reading \\"Towers\\", I still enjoyed the book nonetheless. There are plenty of action, humor, drama, thrills, chills, and huge spiders. Memorable characters and interesting races make it all the more compelling.And I have to give credit to Tolkien and his LOTR trilogy, because without LOTR, there wouldn't have been The Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Farseer Trilogy, etc.Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Chad RodgersThe Return of the KingThe Return of the King, part three of The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of thebest books I have read in quite a while. In this book Frodo and Sam are approaching theconclusion of their long and exhausting quest, but Gollum is tight on their trail. Merryand Pippin have been estranged into two different kingdoms. Pippin is a warrior, whoserves to king Th&eacute;oden. Merry is a servant to the steward of Gondor. Aragorn has amajor decision to make, and is on his perilous journey back to Rivendell, because ofArwen.I think that this book is very well written, and has a lot of complex words that canimprove the readers vocabulary. The Return of the King is the third in its trilogy, and Ithink it would be allot easier for the reader if he or she read the first two Lord of theRings books before reading on to the third. This book was very exciting and I think thatit is one of the greatest epics of our time. I also think that this is the best book out of thethree Lord of the Rings books. Over all this is a really great book.This book took me quite some time to read and I think that a more skilled readerwould be able to go through it and enjoy it more resourcefully. I also think that guyswould be more interested in this book because there is a lot of fighting and warfareinvolved in it. I would recommend it to high school aged people because it is really acomplicated book to read. Anyone who has enjoyed books about warfare or fantasywould take pleasure in reading this book a great deal."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Brilliant. Awe-inspiring. Masterfully written.J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.THE TWO TOWERS, the second part of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy, takes the reader on a remarkable, almost breathless journey: chasing orcs who have captured Merry and Pippen; galloping across the plains of Rohan with Riders of the Rohirrim; the bloody battle of Helm's Deep; the vast wasteland of Isengard; the perilous journey of Frodo and Sam to the borders of Mordor, accompanied by a most unlikely ally. Unlike \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" Tolkien's first installment, which at times was compelled to slow to a snail's pace to patiently set up the story, THE TWO TOWERS moves the reader along at a rapid clip, from the first page to the last.Here we are also introduced to a rich variety of new characters: Eomer, King Theoden, the evil Wormtongue, Treebeard the Ent, Faramir of Gondor, and a nasty assortment of snarling orcs. Tolkien's mastery of the written word brings these characters, and the places of Middle-earth they inhabit--to colorful life. The rich imagery he creates is unsurpassed; THE TWO TOWERS is storytelling unsurpassed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The fact that US customers can buy Kindle versions of Fellowship, Return Of The King, The Hobbit and even The Silmarillion but NOT The Two Towers is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!! What possible reason could there be for excluding just the middle volume of a trilogy???"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Is it okay that I didn't really like The Return of the King, or the entire Lord of the Ring Trilogy for that matter? I feel like a fantasy fan failure admitting that, but just put the pitchforks down and hear me out.The Fellowship of the Ring was just okay for me. The Two Towers was difficult to get through and The Return of the King was pretty much the same. I had to force myself to finish. I'm something of a completist. I had already put the time and effort into reading the first two and people kept telling me was that I had to read the last one, so I really tried to like it.The story is great. The characters, fantastic. I truly loved the movies. The books were something akin to torture, though. The names, the places and the descriptions were all lost on me. I would have needed a large cheat sheet to keep track of everyone and everything I was supposed to remember to follow the story. I constantly had to backtrack to figure who was who and to what they were referring. Strangely enough, the only thing I could keep track of was the different races of people. I suppose I could have gotten really into it had I read the trilogy as if it was a textbook, but this was supposed to be leisurely reading.The Return of the King dragged on and on with no end in sight. 85 pages of saying goodbye to one another is just overkill. The last many pages, on returning to the Shire, was the highlight of the entire trilogy for me, but couldn't help overcome my distaste for the rest of the book.I know people love this trilogy and this book specifically. It's constantly mentioned on favorite book lists and must read lists. I even understand how and why people like it (thanks to the movies). Reading the books just did not work for me. At all. I think it may have hurt my brain."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is excellent! If you haven't read The Hobbit, you'll understand the first one a little better. Only one problem, but it has nothing to do with the way the book is written. Now, most people who read this book says that Shelob the spider is right from Harry Potter. EXCUSE ME, BUT THIS BOOK HAPPENED TO BE WRITTEN PRACTICALLY 50 YEARS BEFORE THE HARRY POTTER SERIES(around 1955). WHAT I THINK IS HARRY POTTER'S SPIDERS ARE FROM LOTR. TOLKIEN IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AND I'M SURE HE'D BE INSULTED THAT SOME PEOPLE ACCUSE HIM OF COPYING A MUNDANE BOOK CALLED HARRY POTTER, WHERE KIDS LEARN MAGIC TRICKS THAT HAVE PEOPLE \\"FLINCH\\" AT A SINGLE, PATHETIC NAME, \\"VOLDEMORT\\", AND ALSO THE LOTR MOVIES ARE BETTER THAN HARRY POTTER, WHERE EVERYTHING IS MADE OF COTTON,AND PLASTIC."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this book, the last of the Lord of the Rings series, was a slight disappointment. I had been reading the LoTR from the Hobbit onward and I thought the climax was rather anticlimatical. It was too quick, too &quot;easy&quot;. We readers suffered the anquish of transporting the Ring from the Shire all the way to Mount Doom. But I think the Mount Doom episode was too hasty. I was expecting a final showdown - perhaps a greuling battle - that did not occur. The chapter left me very hollow. &quot;What? That's it? The deed is done and there's over a hundred pages left?&quot; No doubt, Tolkien was tiring from writing this massive epic and it seems he cut a few corners at the end. Perhaps some Tolkienophiles take this as blasphemy, but nonetheless, I was very capitivated by the LoTR epic and I feel the book could have received a better climax. Of course, if you've read the first two books in the triology, no doubt you'll want to read the finale. Perhaps my opinion! will change when I inevitably reread the series in the future."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"People have a love affair with Tolkien. People I admire and respect, not just bozos either, people who know good books and good writing and who say Tolkien works are the be-all and end-all of fantasy. Open your eyes.That might have been true when his works were first published. Tolkien deserves all the credit for putting fantasy on the map, for legitimizing the epic quest subgenre. But today, his books fall short when compared to contemporary works in the field.I think the reason for all the love is that people read The Lord of the Rings when they were young, and therefore look back at Tolkien with longing and nostalgia of better days. I read The Fellowship of the Ring when I was twenty-three, and The Two Towers when I was twenty-five, after having received a BA in English and beginning an MFA in Creative Writing. I can't, in good concious, say that any of his works match up with the powerful stories of George R. R. Marting and Terry Goodkind.Let's look at this book specifically. The one thing I liked were the Ents. Aside from that, the structure of the book is all whacked. The first half is spent entirely with Aragorn and his crew. Frodo doesn't even make it on stage until close to the last third of the book. Is this considered good, when your main character is not even present for the majority of the book? The effect of Tolkiens structure is disorienting. Once getting to a certain point in time with one group of characters, he moves to the next group and recounts what happened to them through the same period of time. Why not intersperse their chapters and weave the events together?Once we finally do get to Frodo, the same problem persists as did in Fellowship: Frodo can't really do anything. He takes one significant action, and that's to spare Gollum and bring the little runt with him and Sam. Sam does more than Frodo, saving him from a huge spider-demon. That was a great scene, by the way, but scenes like that are few and far between in this and the previous book.To sum up, after reading Fellowship, I swore off all Tolkien's books, but the movie got me excited again. I thought, well, maybe I was wrong, let's give it another shot. I did, and struggle mightily to finish this book. The only thing that will get me to read the final book is if the second movie rocks. Now, I know many of you will consider this review blasphemy, so go ahead and bash me. But before you do, pick up the book again, and read it with open eyes."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Frodo wasn't the only one asleep!! Well written but definitely not half as good as the hobbit one of tolkiens earlier novels."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring has broken up. Although they banded together to protect Frodo and the One Ring to Rule Them All in the first book of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, at the end they were going three different directions. Frodo and Sam snuck off to Mordor so the others could not follow them. Merry and Pippin were taken by the Orcs. The remaining human, elf, and dwarf know they cannot follow Frodo. Instead they attempt to rescue the kidnapped hobbits.They get involved with more Men, warriors, and the Riders of Rohan. They have to abandon their quest and go with the Riders. Mordor is growing stronger. The Orc armies are attacking further into Middle Earth and all are in danger. Merry and Pippin find themselves in strange company. The Orcs want them alive. They want to escape. Pippin is able to use his wits to prepare for that chance. He also is able to leave a message for the others in their group that he and Merry are alive. One battle kills off almost all the Orcs with them. He and Merry escape and meet the Ents. Treebeard is probably the oldest, and oddest, being in Middle Earth. Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli find unexpected help from an old friend. They then band together with the armies of Men to fight the beings from Mordor. The war will not be easy, but must be fought. Frodo and Sam discover it is no easier getting into Mordor than it is getting out. The dark land is well guarded. They gain an unexpected companion and guide, Gollum. Gollum wants the ring. Frodo has it. He promises not to hurt Frodo; he doesn't give up his dream of owning the ring. Sam doesn't trust Gollum. Gollum hates Sam. The trio have an uneasy truce as Gollum leads them through hidden paths into the Dark Lord's lands.This middle book of the trilogy is filled with lengthy battles and wars. The Ents help make this book lighter, but this is the darkest third of the trilogy. It is difficult whether to feel sorry for Gollum or to despise him for what he has become. Everything that happens in this book is needed to bridge the beginning and the end in The Return of the King. Although only my second favorite of the three books so far, the description of Middle Earth, the characters, and the battles are outstanding."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Never in recent memory have I been so enthralled by a fantasy epic. I was aware of The Hobbit, but never read it until recently. Then I absolutely devoured the following trilogy. I won't go into detail here regarding the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, BUT THIS STORY IS THE GREATEST, MOST MAGNIFICENT AND THOUGHT PROVOKING work of fiction I have read in a long, long time. Frodo and Sam, making their way across the desert to Mt. Doom, was agonizing. Being able to witness the personal, not to mention physical, maturity of Merry and especially Pippin, was gratifying. I got choked up when Aragorn was coronated, and also when King Theoden died. But most touching to me was the deep love, devotion and affection shared between Frodo and Samwise, a gem of a hobbit if ever there was one. The parting of Frodo and Sam at the Grey Havens absolutely broke my heart - I sobbed so much I couldn't believe it! It takes a truly genuine work of literary art to wring such an emotional response from me. One last aspect of the story, that certainly rings true today, is the devastating effect of evil and cruelty that survives in the world. And that if it endures unchallenged, how very important it is for each of us, no matter our station in life, our size, or belief that one person cannot make a difference to change things for the better, is to stand up for what is right and good. YOU CAN and you MUST.So, if you enjoy the movies, please read the books. They are wonderful beyond compare."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I hadn't read this book since the eighth grade and wanted to re-visit it before seeing the movie. I should say that I am not a Lord of the Rings afficianado, nor do I want to be. The book moves a bit faster than Fellowship and doesn't have quite as many long poems to disrupt its flow. It is interesting to read this book from a geopolitical perspective to see how the themes that Tolkien touches on get played out in todays world, probably one reason for the book's lasting appeal. Once you get used to Tolkien's somewhat annoying style of writing and into the tale, the story really moves along."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was a great book. The book was full of action, suspense, and a great thriller. Aragorn is my favorite character. He leads the battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn is very brave and heroic. Frodo is the ring-bearer. He is the one who must toss the ring into the fires of Mordor. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves action and suspense."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Two Towers continues the delightful adventures of the now-divided Fellowship. The story moves at a faster clip than the first book with action bouncing through the story of Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn and a terrific sense of suspense crawling and creeping through the story of Frodo and Sam. The emotional resonances among the characters are also much deeper in this volume, particularly in such aspects as the relationship between Sam and Frodo. The two main reasons, though, for this readers' joy are the Ents and Gollum. The ents are the most dazzling creation by the author of Middle Earth and Treebeard should live as one of the most memorable fantasy figures of all time. And as for Gollum, I was pleased to discover how much I liked his prescence. I found him a little trying in The Hobbit but here he works so very well. A rollicking adventure-horror-fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Fellowship is broken and Sam and Frodo are alone in Mordor.

Merry and Pippin manage to escape on their own, and they reach Mirkwood. They then befriend Treebeard who is an ent. Treebeard and his fellow Ents thenn storm and invade Isengaurd which is where Saruman was hiding. Meanwhile, in Mordor, Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, who Frodos uncle Bilbo took the ring from.

Tolkien is about the tower of Orthanc in Isengard and the tower of Baradur in Mordor. After Boromir is slain, and Marry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli begin a desperate chase after the orcs to save them. Their journey takes them to the land of Rohan were they launch an attack against Isengard.

There they team up with the ever treacherous Gollum, and attempt to enter the dark land without being seen by the ever watchful eye of Sauron atop the tower of Baradur.This is a great book that makes you want to keep on reading it. It is of course a continuation of the first book The Fellowship of the Ring and it is recommended that you read it first. This book develops the characters from the first book more deeply and is where the war for Middle-Earth begins.

Having enjoyed the movie version of part one with its abrupt ending... I picked up this book to ease my curious mind.I have been warned by some that Tolkien's writing is long and boring, but I did not find it to be that way at all. The book is much more detailed than I anticipated and sometimes the story goes off on tangents, but I always found them interesting.Mostly, I like this book, and the entire three part story, becuase it is filled with so many mythological symbols and lessons. I am a huge fan of Joseph Campbell and his writings on &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;.

It has found itself into the collective memory of the European Mind and has become a firm part of Western culture.However, this should not misguide away from the fact that popularity does not stand for quality. Tolkiens imagination was unlimited, his passion unequaled, yet he was not a proffessionel Author and therefore his Books often suffer from a lack of Character description, depth, and descriptive climax. This is obvious in the Final Chapter of &quot;The Lord of The Rings Trilogy&quot;.It seems like Tolkien was so impassioned and involved in the Rising Climax that he forgot the basic pillars of creative writing. There is an interesting analogy between Biblical text and Tolkien narrative. For example all through the first half of his Novel Tolkien uses phrases such as &quot;Lo&quot; and &quot;they were amazed&quot; and &quot;he appeared unto them&quot;. These phraes used in the current context do not fit the particular storyline and narrative and slow it down, without adding suspense or depth to the story. Whole Chapters are filled with such writing and the reader often feels that he is attending a Bible session not a Fantasy story.The second Half of the story does not use this type of story telling and is therefore more involved with the reader yet it is lacking action, not depth. The End sequence where Saruman seems to have ensnared Hobbiton seems unnessesary and overstretched. Yet the conclusion of the Novel is mystical and somehow powerfull.Somehow Tolkien did not know how to add up all the pieces and this wasted a lot of imagination put to paper, cutting away most of the suspense and serioulsy harming the Readers involvement."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I did not like this book, it seems as though Tolkien ran out of words, so he started describing things that didn't need describing. The whole boook was good till the middle, it started slowing down, till it became boring. I read the first book in the Lord of the Rings series, and I liked it. But it seems as if Tolkien lost all sense of anything interesting. Don't bother to read this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"No, this book warrants more than 1 star, but this is to get the attention of anyone who's getting ready to dive into this voluminous book and wants to know what to really expect (It seems most of the reviews here are written by people so captivated by Middle Earth, they don't talk about this book based on its literary merits.)In a Nutshell:Pros:1. This one reads a lot faster than \\"Fellowship\\", in which it takes half the book to get to the Prancing Pony. Good plot twists and turns.2. Incredible storytelling, character development, and background history to the legends and mythos of middle earth.3. Not as many songs as \\"Fellowship\\"...good thing Peter Jackson exercised artistic license, or the movies would have been musicals.Cons1. Sorry, lightning might strike me, but Tolkien is no Joseph Conrad...the writing is stilted throughout...but with a storyline this great, who cares.2. If you are a hardcore fan of the movies there is some silliness throughout Jackson wisely removed from the movies. (Treebeard lives in a house and sleeps on a bed, and don't forget the gay ranger, yellow jacket wearin' Tom Bombadil from \\"Fellowship.\\")Tolkien said it took him 7 years to write the trilogy, and when he finished, there was nothing more to tell...an absolute masterpiece.

My mind kept screaming for them to die, but they never did.Tolkein is the most depressing autor ive ever read. Every character he makes me fall in love with he has killed by every character he makes me hate. Sauron, Sarumon, Durins-Bane (the Bolrog), The Witch King, and not to mention all the Orcs. I remember crying after the Hobbit because Smaug and all the Orcs died in the last battle.One of my biggest complants about this book was how he portrayed the battles. He spent a good twenty pages describing the all mighty power of the Witch king, and then had him die in five seconds at the hand of a woman. That, and his descriptions of the battle was very generalized. He basicaly said, that the good guys won and that the Evil was very strong.It would have been so great if Sauron could have gotten the Ring and taken over middle Earth, the story would have been much more interesting. The hobbits were just annoying.Tolkein's book had so much potential, sure its a classic and will be popular even another 50 years from now. But it will never be as great as it could have been."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read all three of the trilogy and a great number of other fantasy works. I have no choice but to say that while Tolkien made a indepth backrgound for his story that was all he did. Tolkien built a world, but he never wrote a story. I have never read a fantasy book less entertaining than these. He bores you with the details. Textbooks have fewer appendixes than his books. The only two redeming bits are the symbolism and world building. However, he missed one main concept, its all as borring as can be. Only a few obsessed people out there learn to speak elvish, for the rest of us he could have spent some time on an action scene and just written gibberish because thats all it is. His symbolism is certainly not deep enough to make the books worth reading either. The first and foremost reasons to write any book thats not a textbook is to entertain or make a point. He makes a simplistic point and keeps you saying, 'This sucks!'."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would encourage this book for people with high reading ability, to read this book. Two Towers' is a very action packed book with lots of emotion and glory. Before you read this book you should be sure to read the book The Fellowship of The Ring or watch the movie so you can get some background information. I like this book because it shows the friendship of each other and their willingness to stay together. The hardships that they are faced with are very trying and testing of themselves. \\"But if we hold true to each other we will do what needs to be done.\\" This is a quote from the book.

This is what Frodo Baggins had to do. This story is about a struggle for a ring of power in a place called middle earth. The two sides of the struggle are the free peoples and the forces of the dark lord called Sauron. Characters in the story are Frodo (a Hobbit), Sam (also a Hobbit), Legolas (an Elf), Gimli (a Dwarf), and Borimer, Arogon, Gandalf, Saruman, and Theoden (all Men). The setting takes place in a place called middle earth. In middle earth there are many regions were these different people live. Like the Shire (where the Hobbits live), Rivendel (where the Elves live), Gondor, Rohan, and Isengard (where the Men live), and all in the mountains live the Dwarfs and the Goblins (part of the evil side), and finely where the Orcs (evil) live in Mordor. The plot of the story is that a dark lord called Sauron, a spirit, has his minion's try to take the ring from Frodo. While he is doing that, armies of Sarumans from Isengard attack the people of Rohan. This is where the struggle of Rohan to survive comes in. Now the heroes have to split up.First, My over all opinion of this book is that it was a good adventure book but too many details. This book is a Fantasy book. The only way that this was a page turner book is because of the action.Last This book was Fantasy because none of the book was true. The book is part of a 3-book series, and this is the second one of the series. In conclusion, I recommend this book to people who can remember things."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is so good!

This is because the book is good with all the twists and turns, you don't know what's going to happen next. But the book is so long that the author spends too much time trying to describe places or towns that the book starts to get boring. I couldn't say that I was surprised at most of the events that happened in this book.He should of put a few random twists and turns. So this book is ok.The book starts in a place called Middle-Earth, a dark lord called Sauron created a ring, which had the power to destroy the world. Now Frodo and Sam have that ring and are on a quest to destroy that ring.This book was created by a man named J.R.R. Tolkien. He was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa in 1892.

Tolkien is an amazing book. Tolkien tied up all the lose ends that were left from the other two books very eloquently. He doses a great job of not leaving out to much information. Closure is brought to almost everything in a detailed manner so that just enough is left to the imagination. Just when you think the book is getting dull or boring Tolkien throws in a few small plot twists to keep your attention. On the way home from there adventures the group which you come to know very well though out the series says its good byes. These are very touching and heart felt. As the book nears its ending you think everything is calming down and going to be peaceful. There is yet another surprise awaiting the hobbits when they get back to town.

Tolkein, is the middle book in his science-fiction trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. This book takes place at the end of the third age in Middle Earth. Frodo the Hobbit had set out from his home in the Shire located in western Middle Earth. At the start of this book he has just broken up from the rest of his fellowship, which set out from Rivendell, an Elvish town. Frodo and his servant Sam head off to destroy the dark lord, Sauren's, ring. Elsewhere, Two other Hobbits, Maryodock Brandybuck and Paregrin Took, have been captured by Orks. Trying to defend the Hobbits, Boromir, the ere to the thrown of Gondor, was killed. Now trying to rescue the Hobbits are Aragorn, who descends from the line of Isildur (an ancient king of Gondor), Gimli the Dwarf, who comes from the lonely mountain, and Legolas the Elf, who dwelles in Mirkwood. The final member of the fellowship is thought to have been killed, in the mines of Moria. He is Gandalf the Wizard. The first half of this thrilling novel is the quest of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas to find the two captive Hobbits. As it turns out the Hobbits escaped from their captors when a battle between the Orks and the riders of Rohan occurred. The Hobbits head to the dark forrest, Fangorn. Their they meet the the Ints, a peaceful treelike people. The ints head off to destroy the citidel of Saurumen the wizard, Orthanc, who betrayed Middle Earth. The three warriors find the Riders of Rohan and go with them to battle the Orks who escaped from Orthanc. The last part of the novel tells of the journey of the ring barrer. Frodo and Sam head towards Mordor, the land of Sauren, to destroy the one ring. The two Hobbits meat Gollum, a creature who once possessed the ring. Together they head to Mordor.

I didn't even know that it was the second book in a series of three. I had just picked it at random from a row of library books.When I started to look at it I was disappointed to see that it was the sequel to a book I hadn't read. I persevered for a few pages - and I was hooked!It was the character of Aragorn that drew me in. In other fantasies that I had read human beings were dupes or pupils of supernatural creatures. Yet here was a man to whom an elf and a dwarf deferred. The action was non-stop. I didn't know what had happened but I could empathise with the choices that Aragorn had to make and with his worries that his choices were going awry.At the half way stage when the action turned to Frodo and Samwise I was disappointed. But soon I was engrossed again.When I finished the book I went onto TRoTK to see what happened in the end, and only went back to TFoTR and The Hobbit after that.I still think that's quite a good order. TFoTR contains a lot of stuff that is boring unless you already have an overriding interest in Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings is the best fantasy story of all time! Tolkien is a master storyteller, and his secondary world of Middle Earth is so true, and so beautifully described. The Lord of the Rings is published in three volumes [Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King], but it is really one story told straight through; to appreciate part of it, you must read all three books. The Hobbit is considered a prelude to the trilogy, and is more accessable to younger readers. [It is much lighter in tone, and is of course much shorter, only being 287 pages long.] The Return of the King is wonderful, containing the climax and the end of the Third Age of Middle Earth. While some conclusions are predictable, other twists in the plot are rather unpredictable. If you haven't read these stories, be wary of reviews that reveal the plot. Knowing what happens is empty compared to knowing how it happens, and hearing the story through the words of a master storyteller. The entire work fits together so well, Tolkien's dedication to perfecting the story is evident. For those readers who feel disappointed that the story is ended, and want to read more about Middle Earth, many of Tolkein's writings were published after his death, such as the Silmarillion. One warning though; no hobbits. These stories deal with the First and Second Age, being tales of Valinor, Elven kingdoms [Gondolin, Nargothrond, Doriath] in Middle Earth, and the days of Numenor before its fall. I highly recommend anything Tolkien has written, because his stories have such deep meanings, and his fantasy world is so well developed to make almost any other appear shallow. Because he was writing one story, some readers may find The Fellowship a bit slow in getting started, but The Return of the King more than makes up for it. Stick with it; this is a quest you will never forget, and you may find yourself wishing to visit these enchanted, almost real lands..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"all in all this was a good book, except for the begging.

The return of the king follows the last adventure of the fellowship of the ring, tells of the destruction of the ring of power, and the return of the king of men. Tolkiens long running devotion to mddle earth is unrivaled by any othor author in the history of literature. Some may say that the book isn't as good as some crappy classic that everyone ends up reading, but it is, by all means the best work ever put onto paper. Never eill a book this spectacular be put out again. Tolkien has created a legacy that will still being read and loved over one hundred years from now.

The story in THE RETURN OF THE KING is tremendous, creative and truly profound. And don't make the mistake of thinking that this book or any of the others from Tolkein are children's books. You will be amazed at the depth of story here.I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Watch the extended version of the movie? Yes, but READ THE BOOK first. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. And there are also some unnecessary twists, turns and interpretations taken and made by Jackson and his crew that are established in simplicity and beauty in the book.THE RETURN OF THE KING is an essential sequel to THE TWO TOWERS and is the culmination of the adventures of the The Fellowship, Theoden, and the people of Middle Earth as they continue their quest to overcome the powers of the evil Sauron.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE RETURN OF THE KING first you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and then wrapping up with THE TWO TOWERS. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there. You may even end up reading this one again in proper sequence.

Frodo's one mission: to destroy a small gold ring that will give the Dark lord ultimate power. One small compilcation: the ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the mouth of Mt. Doom, right next to the dark fortress Barad Dur. I thought this was a good book an its one you can read more than once."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The book starts off in a forest where Orcs--evil creatures who act under the direction of Saruman--have been sent to find the Fellowship (which consists of hobbits--Frodo, Pippin, Merry, and Sam; two men--Aragorn and Boromir; an elf--Legolas; and a dwarf--Gimli), kidnap the hobbits, and bring them to Saruman--alive.The main character, Frodo, is the bearer of the One Ring, created by Sauron, which holds an immense amount of power and evil. This is why the Orcs must capture the hobbits. The book had very good imagery included, giving us vibrant descriptions of the characters and scenes.During the battle between the Orcs and the Fellowship, Boromir is shot with arrows while trying to save Merry and Pippin--who get kidnapped by the Orcs--and dies when Aragorn finally makes it to him. This really teaches a moral to the Fellowship, because Boromir had tried to take the ring from Frodo not much earlier.Luckily, Frodo escapes from the Orcs and ends up heading towards Mordor (which is the one place that the ring can be destroyed) alone. That is, until his &quot;loyal servant&quot; Sam catches up and comes along. This splits up the plot, of whole flow of the story, into three different parts--Frodo and Sam trying to make it to Mordor, Merry and Pippin's attempts to escape from the Orcs, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's attempts to track down and find the Orcs to hopefully save Merry and Pippin.Eventually, Frodo and Sam encounter the creature Gollum--or Sm&eacute;agol--who helps lead them to Mordor. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin escape the Orcs, heading off into the Fangorn Forest, where they meet Treebeard and the other Ents (tree-like, living, talking, walking creatures).I like this book because the way J.R.R. Tolkien writes is very creative, as are his ideas. In it a whole new world is created, where there is a seemingly endless war going on. I loved the fantasy elements and the new creatures and places. The whole concept just adds to the great sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I finished this one right around the end of October 2002. I found this installment to be a much easier read than the first, with fewer expository sections. The action was fast-paced and relentless. The detail was outstanding, though I was expecting no less after reading the first part. There was a surprising amount of character development nestled within the combat and plotting. I found myself laughing out loud more than once at the burgeoning friendship between Legolas and Gimli. I also found Tolkien's characterization of Gollum masterful.

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are heading off in search of the captured friends Merry and Pippin.The main conflict in this book is an large advancing army of Uruk-hai, large disgusting beasts bread for the single purpose of destroying life. This army was created by the evil wizard Saruman who is now in alliance with the Dark Lord Sauron, thus the books name, after each of these characters places of residence.The book ends with the army defeated and the country of Rohan saved but with much work still to be done. Sauron's power is still great and Frodo has not yet destroyed the ring.The story continues in the third book, The Return of the King. I reccomend this trilogy to all readers, fantasy lover or not.

Legolas, and Gimli follow Aragorn through dangerous and frightening adventures, and Sam, Frodo, and Gollum make their final journey to the Mountain of Fire.If you enjoy the films, you will adore the books.

Masterfully written.J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.THE RETURN OF THE KING, being the third and final installment of this novel, takes the reader on a magical journey as the Third Age of Middle-earth comes to its dramatic conclusion, as the Fellowship of the Ring confronts for the final time the Dark Lord and his evil minions. The battle is waged on the Pelennor Fields outside of Minas Tirith in Gondor--a battle that is costly, harrowing, intense. . .exhilarating. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue their journey into the heart of Darkness itself--the inhospitable, deadly land of Mordor--to continue Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring in the blazing inferno of Mt. Doom. And as Tolkien pulls all of the wonderful components of his epic story together, one man steps forward to claim the throne of Gondor. . .to bring healing to the war-ravaged lands of Middle-earth.THE RETURN OF THE KING is the pinnacle of storytelling, but in my opinion is the weakest of the trilogy, as Tolkien creates a powerful climax then lingers for almost one hundred pages wrapping up his story. This is augmented by the actions of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, and Pippin upon their return to the Shire; the sudden \\"machismo\\" of these Hobbits as they confront the corruption of their homeland is inconsistent with the inherent vulnerability of the characters as depicted through the books.Despite my slight misgivings, THE RETURN OF THE KING is a marvelous book--an exceptional read. Having read this epic several times, it's always a bit sad to come to the end, to say goodbye to such wonderful characters. Highly recommended.--D.

Part 3 stands out the most because all of the sub-plots are brought full circle and ended in a way that really defies description. Every major character is now a prototype often copied by contemporary writers. In every aspect of the work: style, diction, etc., Tolkien shines masterfully. Not even Chaucer or Shakespeare come close to matching his storytelling. Robert Jordan is a terrific writer in his own right, but &quot;Tolkien&quot; is written over every one of his thousands of pages of WHEEL OF TIME. He is simply a &quot;literary Puff Daddy&quot;. Fantasy writing post-LOTR is for all practical purposes plagiaristic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"more blood and turmoil then the rest of the books combined! this one made this series!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"JRR Tolkien beautifully interweaves the plot in The Two Towers, told from a third person point of view. His bright adjectives are amazing in his descriptions of cities, forests, and characters. In this story, the second part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Tolkien narrates the story of Frodo the Ringbearer and the rest of the Fellowship of the Ring. When Frodo and his servant Sam leave the Fellowship for Mordor, ill things come to the rest of the group. An Orc ambush leaves Boromir dead and the two hobbits Merry and Pippin captives. Ever since the fall of Gandalf, Aragorn the Ranger led the group. Now he leads Legolas the spirited Elf and Gimli the surly Dwarf on the chase of the Orcs. When the Orcs were near their destination of Orthanc, the stronghold of Saruman the traitor, the trio of warriors and the Riders of Rohan that they met with, finally catch up to the Orcs. The five score Riders overcome the vicious army of Orcs in a battle at the break of dawn near the mysterious forest of Fangorn. The hobbits, confused, retreat to Fangorn. After a vicious, bloody battle between the Rohirrim and the thousands of Orcs, Isengard is defeated. But Gandalf had returned, and spurred the King of Rohan to attack Orthanc. Gandalf had broken Saruman's staff and banished him finally after the slow, but vicious Ents had destroyed and flooded Isengard, defeating the traitor ultimately. When all of that is going on, Frodo and Sam journey over a wasteland of hills and rock. The evil character Gollum has caught up to them, and they knew they were being followed. With an ingenious plan Frodo captures Gollum and almost trains him to guide them to Mordor. As he writes, JRR Tolkien intricately describes the places that the hobbits pass through, the setting almost telling the future of the story. As the hobbits journey with Gollum as their guide, they meet Faramir and the soldiers of Gondor, and end up befriending the proud warriors. Later Gollum leads them to Mordor, and to an unknown resolve to the story... One of the best parts of the book to my opinion was when Tolkien told of the soldiers of Gondor as though he personally knew them. He closely detailed their clothing, weapons, armor and gear as though he was one of them. The second part of my favorite scene is when the soldiers are fighting the evil men under Sauron's control. Tolkien consistently describes everything going on around, from individual men to how the setting affects the battle. \\"Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their own height, and great quivers of long green- feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and bright.\\" This book is masterfully crafted by Tolkien's genius, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure or fantasy or both. The beginning was slow, maybe the first 40 pages or so, but it is a wonderful tale. I really loved it and I'm going to also read the final book to find out the ending. I think you should find out what happens too..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book has to be one of the best books ever written.

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli try to rescue them but are soon caught up in their own problems; defending the people of Rohan and fighting Saruman. This half is mostly told by Aragorn and Pippin while the second part is seen from Sam's point of view.In the later half Frodo and Sam try to get into Mordor and the only one to lead them is Gollum, former owner of the ring.I highly recommend this book, don't leave it unread."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I spent alot of time finding the right version of this book so that it would match the other ones that I had.

It is a good book for kids ten and up. It starts off with Gandalf riding with Merry to Minas Tirith, a city in Middle Earth (Middle Earth is the land were all this happens) but far away Sam, who is a Hobbit from the shire (the shire is a peaceful place were Hobbits live) is trying to make up his mind to save Frodo from Orcs (Orcs are creatures who were mutated by evil) who have captured him. Frodo is another Hobbit from the shire. The other option for Sam is to keep going and destroy the ring of power so that evil will be gone forever. Will the ring be destroyed or will darkness rule, it all depends on two hobbits? Meanwhile back in Minas, Tirith the armies of Mordor have gone to destroy Gondor (the main land of men). Will Aragorn and his company Legalas Greenleaf, the Elf and Gimli, the Dwarf save the day once again and will Arogorn take his place as the rightful king of men? Aragorn is the heir to Gondor and a ranger in Rivendale. I recommend that you should read the first two books first. At the beginning of the trilogy the Hobbits thought they were going on a small journey but in the middle of the trilogy they were gloomy and had hardly any hope and at the end they pushed and resisted evil and they were glad. I learned that if you want something hard enough you can achieve it. At first the book is confusing because it is switching from Frodo and Sam to Aragorn and his companions. What I really liked was the detail he put into the world were the books take place.Books also written by Tolkien: The Silmarilian (the book of the beginning of Middle Earth), The Hobbit (prelude to The Lord of the Rings), The Fellowship of the Ring (book one in the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and The Two Towers (the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the greatest book ever.

It is called the Two Towers because each evil sorcerer has a tower, Saruman has Orthanc and Sauron has Barad Dur. I think when you read this book you should be about ten to fifteen years old because it gets really complicated at parts. This thrilling, action-packed fantasy takes place long ago and starts with Boromir, a man of Gondor, getting shot with arrows by orcs (creatures who are like evil men) who capture Merry and Pippen, two little hobbits. Two other brave hobbits, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, who have the Ring, are journeying to Mordor, the one place the Ring may be destroyed, because that is where it was created, in the fires of Mount Doom. Mordor is the land where the wicked lord Sauron lives. The Ring is a power that is beyond any others. It can drive a man mad and, if in Sauron's hands, it could end the world. In it is his hatred and power. A curious creature named Smeagol or Gollum later joins them and acts as a guide to Mordor. Meanwhile the rest of the company, Aragorn, the son of Arathorn a ranger and leader, Gimli, son of Gloin the dwarf, Legolas, a greenleaf elf and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard are battling Saruman the White and his grand orc army the Uruk-hai. Other creatures help like ents and huorns. This is a book where characters learn bravery and loyalty. Will Middle Earth survive? J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantastic author who loves action. You will learn much about warfare and hope because many times there are huge battles and there are some very despairing times. I thought it was good because it is a fantastic plot and has a whole world of its own. This is by the author of The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers by J.R. Tolkein is the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It begins right after the end of the first novel. Frodo and Sam have left the group in order to journey undetected. As Aragorn searches for Frodo, he finds Boromir mortally wounded by arrows. Before Boromir dies, he tells Aragon that Merry and Pippin were kidnapped by Saruman's Uruk-hai. With Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf, he begins follow the Uruk-hai captors. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin escape from the Uruk-hai into the nearby Fangorn Forest, where they encounter Treebeard, the leader of the Ents. Aragorn is able to track their prints that lead into Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf, whom they thought had died in the mines of Moria. The four ride to Rohan where Gandalf warns King Thoeden of Saruman's growing army.While all this is going on, Frodo and Sam continue on their journey towards Mordor. They discover that Gollum has been following them for several days. They capture him when Gollum attempts to steal the Ring from Frodo. Gollum promises to lead the pair to the Black Gate in exchange for his life. He leads them through the Dead Marshes in order to avoid being spied by Orcs. Upon reaching the Black Gate, Gollum stops them as the way is guarded to heavily. Gollum tells them of a secret entrance to Mordor. They head south into Gondor, where they are captured by a group of rangers led by Faramir, the brother of Boromir.J.R. Tolkein's use of language in describing Middle Earth is astonishing. Every scene of the book is described in extensive detail, not to mention the history. Tolkein has created a world, a world of men and elves, that has such a detailed history that it feels like it could exist. With it's legends, history, geography, and language, Middle Earth is quite a place. Personally I feel this book is the best out of the three, with its extensive plot and characters.

I will read book three again."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This has been my favorite out of all the Lord of the Rings novels. They seemed to get progressively better, of which I'm glad because I wanted to know what all the hype was about since this was my first time reading the series. For those who have never read any of the books as well, don't start at this book, start at the beginning or you can be completely lost in Tolkien's rather largish world.In this we have two different story lines. One is of Frodo and Sam. When we last left poor Frodo he had been captured by Orcs and taken to a tower as prisoner. Sam has to rescue him, and even when he does, they are left deep behind enemy lines and must make their way to the mountain where the ring can be destroyed. Meanwhile, the rest of the characters are at war. Each has his own place in the war and they must defend Gondor and break the Black Gates of Mordor to survive. But even if they do win, they don't have any idea of what is waiting for them at home after so long a journey.There is a second part to this book in the appendices. They are filled with lore, language, and history of Middle Earth. While I enjoyed the language section it is interesting to note that history for Middle Earth seems to be written like history in real life, and as such, was kind of boring for me. Despite that though I will not be including this section in my rating of the book as I believe that a good portion of the people will buy the book for the story and find the appendices a bonus.The characters are better developed and really start coming into their own in this novel. Even the language is more unique to each of them, especially the hobbits. I was sad to see that while Gollum played an important role in this book, it wasn't a very large one. I also still thank that Sam is the best of the hobbits on the journey.The writing is still very descriptive but doesn't bog down the story quite as much as it does in the others. Towards the end they do seem to make a big deal of names and this can get tedious at points. There is some violence, but that part isn't as descriptive and nothing is really too offensive in this book. Most importantly, since this is the end book, there is a sense of closure.I'm glad to have finally read all of this series for the first time and mostly enjoyed it. While I don't see myself rereading near in the future, I suspect that I will return to it someday. Its a great fantasy for lovers of the genre.Return of the KingCopyright 1955340 pages, with appendices 470 pagesReview by M.

Granted, it is not for the fainthearted or the disinterested, but like many great novels requires a certain commitment in order to experience the many benefits that it affords. Tolkien's world is fascinating, his characters resonant, and the narrative... epic at the least. For the beginner I would recommend either a guide to middle earth, which can be found on the web or on amazon, or to use wikipedia, this may help with some of the frustration that can come with not knowing the names and places. Tolkien provides a map, and with these tools the reader can begin to appreciate some of the more difficult sections. For those rereading the books this is less of an issue and the reader is able to take in a deeper world with exciting secondary narratives supporting the grand narrative. I could go on, but read this book, and then reread it, and then reread it again, it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a war like this, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Frodo and Sam are stuck in the vividly horrific Mordor, while the city of Minas Tirith is on the verge of completely crumbling. Tolkien does a phenomenal job of exploring the madness, despair, rage and sorrow that accompany a war, and the way it can affect even the idyllic Shire. And he doesn't forget the slow period of healing that follows -- for people, for civilizations, and even for nature.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Speaking of Frodo, this trilogy's hero is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down to a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.And the supporting characters are not neglected either, with the younger hobbits being exposed to the horrors of war, Aragorn breaking fully into his role as the future king of Gondor, and passionate war-maiden Eowyn affecting the war as nobody else could. Some much-loved characters are lost, and others will be permanently changed.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of this book can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following \\"Return of the King.\\"It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The middle novel of the Rings trilogy opens with the tragic (though decidedly heroic) death of a second member of the Company, and sees the small band that stands in opposition to Sauron entering its darkest hour. Gandalf, the Company's leader, has at the end of the last novel, fallen in combat with the dreaded balrog; Bormoir has been slain at the start of this book, in desperate battle with a group of orks; the Company is diminished by losses, its members scattered, and Aragorn feels himself a failure in the face of the backsets that have been delivered upon him and his comrades. Where many might abandon a mission that surely seems lost, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas continue on in pursuit of the hobbits Merry and Pippin, captured by Orks in service to the traitorous wizard Saruman, while Frodo and Sam push on into the foul land of Mordor, home of the Dark Lord and location of the volcanic Mt. Doom, into whose fires the pair intend to cast the One Ring, which has brought so much misery onto Middle Earth. In this oft-disrespected second volume, a reader comes to understand the full depth of Saruman's enslavement by Sauron, recoils as Frodo allows the despicable Smeagol to travel along on his journey, comes to meet the ancient ents, and delves full-force into the battle of Helm's Deep, a conflict which stands to decide nothing less than the fate of the world."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\`The Return of the King', the third of the three volume novel, \`Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.Like the movie version of \`The Fellowship of the Ring', the \`Return of the King' movie leaves off one important chapter. And, unlike the Tom Bombadil / Barrow Wight episodes in the first volume, the deleted \`Scouring of the Shire' chapter in \`Return of the King' created what was virtually the only real criticism of the movie, because the drama of \`the scouring' was left out of the events between the celebrations in Gondor over the defeat of Sauron and the departures at the Gray Havens. So, we get a half-hour of celebrating and saying good-bye. Not too much in relation to the previous nine and a half hours, but a bit tedious in the context of a three hour movie. So, for the three of you who are reading the books for the first time, you have a great \`lost' event to look forward to in reading \`The Fellowship of the King'.One of the easily most important parts of this third volume is the very long historical appendix which lays out the major events of the first three ages of Middle Earth. One of the most satisfying aspects of both \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is the sense of the great depth of history. The appendices show that the history of the One Ring just scratches the surface, as Isildur wrested the ring from Sauron (see the opening scene of \`Fellowship of the Rings') at the beginning of the Third Age. There are two earlier ages of Middle Earth from the time of the birth of the elves to the end of the first war with Sauron. It is a knowledge of this history which tells us why a ranger from the distant north is an heir to the throne of Gondor and why Denethor, the Steward cannot be King. One thing which amazes me is that no reviewer has noted is wondering about the fact that Arwen and Aragorn are very, very, very distantly removed cousins, since it is quite possible that Elrond was the brother of Aragorn's great,....great grandfather. This is because Elrond and brother Elros Tar-Minyatar were given the choice of immortality as a half-elf or very long life and a homestead on the island of Numenor, removed from the sorrows of Middle Earth. Elrond chose immortality and \`exile' to Middle Earth'. Elros chose long life on the Eden-like island.This appendix contains a great many other bits of miscellany. The most important for those who have seen the movie is the story of the love between Arwen and Aragorn, which is not in the main narrative. This history is easily one of the most elaborate fictional histories created to date. Other fantasy histories such as Robert E. Heinlein's future history (in which he predicts the turmoil of the 1960's with amazing accuracy) is tiny in comparison. And, according to Tolkien's own writings, almost all this history was created before he began writing \`The Lord of the Rings'. For those of us who get pleasure from such invented worlds, these appendices were just a little amuse-bouche. Enough to give us a taste of how deep this history went, without giving us many details of the great events of the first and second ages. It was this hunger which created such demand for \`The Silmarillion', the last complete (posthumous) work by Tolkien, assembled by son Christopher Tolkien.If you have not read \`The Hobbit', I strongly recommend reading that before picking up \`The Lord of the Rings'. And, I suggest you read or at least browse the appendices at the end of this volume before starting \`The Fellowship of the Ring'. I am almost inclined to suggest you read \`The Silmarillion' before reading \`The Hobbit', but \`The Silmarillion' reads a lot more like history than like dramatic fiction. It is a much poorer novel than either \`The Hobbit' or \`The Lord of the Rings'.Truly great ending to the greatest fantasy novel, ever."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers is the second book of the epic adventure of the series of the Lord of theRings based in Tolkien's tale The Hobbit. This story takes place in the Middle- Earthduring the Third Age just after the Fellowship of the Ring separate in the Shores ofBurien River and Boromir's death. In this book J.J.Tolkien explored different aspects andcharacteristics of its characters Where the Ents, the elves, the dwarves, the mans ofGondor and the Rohan raiders have their own perspective of the battle. Also emphasizeddeeply the struggle of Frodo's attempt to destroy the one ring of the Dark Lord Sauron.When I read this book about three weeks ago, it helped me to understand that I didn't know anything about the true meaning of fantasy and epic adventure until I read aboutTolkien's Middle- Earth. A place where the fantasy materialize in form of a fantasticnarrative that satisfies the most demanding readers. Also it is important to consider that the book contain magnificent poems ,songs ,verses and tales that contribute in thedevelopment of a clear image about the character, the Middle Earth and the battle for thering.In this book you can explore the epic land of the Middle -Earth, the setting of the battlefor the one ring. A setting that changed constantly, from the Burien River to the forest ofFangor and from there to Rohan and then to Helm's Deep. In those chapters in the TwoTowers the main characters Aragorn the future King of Gondor,Gilmi the dwarf andLegolas the elf attempt to rescue Meriadoc and Peregrin. Then they met once again withGandalf in Fangor forest, after he finally defeated Balrog in the Moria mines. Then together they went to Rohan to adverse King Theoden about Saruman's intentions.In Rohan appeared an important character, Wrima Wormtongue ,whose dark speech powerstransformed King Theoden into a Saruman mind slave. For that reason WrimaWormtongue was expelled from Rahan.Then Rohan was evacuated to Helm's Deepfortress where the orcs of Isengar will attempt to destroy Rohan's future. MeanwhileMeriadoc and Peregrin were capture by the orcs of Huru-kai and later met withTreebeard and the council of Ents in Fangor and together destroyed Isengar and defeatSaruman .However Frodo and Samwise attempted to enter to Mordor the Dark Land, todestroy the one ring in the crater of Doom Mountain guided by Smeagol through thisdangerous path . But instead of entering through the dark gate, they decided to take a safeway through the ruins of the ancient city of Osgilath. But they were captured byFamamir's army .In Osgilath Faramir was commanded by his father Derethor to stop theorcs army before they take Minas Tirith.But in this way they will be betrayed byGollum's will. Then later Legolas,Aragorn ,Gandalf and Gimli will met with Sarumanonce again, where they will discuss about Sauron and his betrayed and corruption againstthe human kind and will.If you are interesting in Tolkien's Hobbit or any other stories of epic adventure .TheTwo Towers will not disillusion you, especially the chapters Roads of Isengar ,Thevoice of Saruman ,Helm's Deep and Treebeard. Those will keep the reader in suspenseand deep fascination until the end of every chapter with a marvelous narrative. But firstyou must successfully read The Fellowship of the Ring ."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think Tolkien envisioned the trilogy not as three separate books but one gigantic novel (along the lines maybe of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, except you know, with Balrogs and stuff) which might be why people who treat the series as three separate novels tend to get bored early on, while the rest of us are urging them to keep going. Because the series as a whole does follow the classical arc of a novel, with the first book consisting of the exposition and setup, the second book the rising action and this last portion being the climax (or climaxes, as it turns out) so that when read straight through the structure makes a whole lot more sense. Tolkien does epic like no one else had done before, thrusting the heroes into impossible situations and making the whole affair so epic that it hurts. Immortal people and run of the mill working class folk mingle and fight and die together, while the fate of everything hangs in the balance. My favorite type of epic fantasy is the kind where the heroes are essentially running for their lives throughout the whole story and there's a palpable sense of \\"Geez if we screw this up everyone dies\\" permeating every page . . . Tolkien pulls this off masterfully, all the while retaining a sense of wonder and an eye for humor at the small things that leads you to believe that these are just regular people involved in extraordinary events. Thus, the third novel wraps up the final plots, with Aragorn and company fighting off Sauron's hordes, all the while having no idea where Frodo and Sam are, or if they're even still alive, waiting for a sign that the Ring is either destroyed or that Sauron has it and they should start looking for other lines of work very quickly. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue the longest walk ever in epic fantasy (really, when you look at the map and the scale, that was a haul they made, on foot!), with an untrustworthy guide and the evilest inanimate object ever created. The grandeur and despair practically leap off the page, with the heroes literally dragging their way to the end of the quests and when the truimph eventually comes, it's more than earned. But even after the celebrations are finished and it's time to go home, there's still one more task left to complete, with a key scene left out of the movie but utterly familar to those who have read the book, and a chilling fate for the last remaining villain in the series. If Tolkien did one thing, he brought a sense of humanity to epic fantasy and successfully captured the feeling of little ordinary people caught up in great things. None of this would have worked half as well if he hadn't constructed a ridiculously detailed history of everything and it's the weight of that prior history that informs the novel, even though only like a tenth of it is actually referenced in the story, it hovers there and acts as a living force on the narrative itself, so that the reader really gets the impression than an Age of the world is passing into history. The ending gets me every time and I can't imagine how it could be anymore perfect, bringing home the point that after all the epic stuff is done, the monsters are vanquished and the kings are brought high, everyday life goes on, beautiful in its simplicity. After the main story is over, there's a slew of appendices, for those not convinced how much crazy detail Tolkien went into to give himself a firm foundation to base the story on. The first few are the most interesting, one for giving us a fairly good history of the Ages and the events that led up to the War of the Ring, as well as what was going on while the narrative focused on the characters. Even better there's a chronology of what happened after Aragorn became king and the events of his reign, detailing the fates of everyone in the Fellowship. It has the feel of real history and it's just as fascinating in its own way as this world. Not perfect, this series is the closest we've gotten to a perfect epic fantasy in terms of emotional scope and historical feel, mixing the high and the mundane and it goes to show that the majority of epic fantasy has only been a pale shadow of what Tolkien did here, so great was his influence (granted there's bit a lot of entertaining shadows, but nothing I've read has surpassed it yet). So you can like or dislike this all you want, but if you're at all interested in fantasy you can't risk ignoring it. Probably going down as one of the greatest novels of the last century (if there's any justice) this was well worth the time to reread and I'm certainly glad I did. The memories of a ten year old just don't do it justice. People who have only seen the movie, by all means, don't stop there. The real heart of the story is here."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There are many opinions and discussions that one could have on Tolkien's great epic, but one thing is for certain: he saved the best for last. Even Peter Jackson, the director of the film trilogy was heard to say: \\"I made the first two movies so that I could make the third.\\" Everything that has been building in the first two installments now explodes across the pages: battles, intrigues, madness, escapes, disguises, rescues, chases - it's all here as the allied forces of Middle-Earth (Hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves and Ents) make their last desperate stand against the converging forces of evil.Like the previous volumes, \\"The Return of the King\\" is divided into two books: Book Five and Book Six. Book Five concerns the reunion of most of the Fellowship and the lengths they take in order to draw the Dark Lord Sauron's eye away from Frodo and Sam. But this togetherness is not to last - soon Gandalf whisks Pippin away to the white city of Gondor in order to stir the city up for battle, whilst Merry swears fealty to King Theoden of Rohan and attempts to find a way to follow him into battle. In even more peril is Aragorn, who decides to take the dread Paths of Dead in order to muster the ghoulish allies that may be found there - with Legolas and Gimli at his side.They will all converge once more in Gondor, (along with Faramir, Eomer, Eowyn and Denethor, the grim Stewart of the King) where the battle of their time will take place outside the walls...In Book Six, Sam finds himself alone in the terrible realm of Mordor after realising that Frodo is not dead, but now captured by the Enemy. After Gollum's betrayal, Sam has nothing left to do but sneak his way into the very fortress of the Dark Lord in the attempt to find Frodo and continue their journey to Mount Doom. But with the Ring now in his keeping, he becomes aware for the first time of its terrible lure...Everything that Tolkien has set up in the previous books come to fruition and is dealt with in its proper time and place - not always to happy endings, but to satisfactory and bittersweet ones: the fading of the elves, the cost of battle, the return of the king, and even Tolkien's subtle but vitally important Christian resonances in the course of the story. To point them out directly would be to take away your opportunity to discover them yourself, but keep in mind the triad role of Frodo, Gollum and the Ring: Frodo's continual mercy toward him, Gandalf's past words that \\"he has yet a part to play, for good or for evil,\\" and the divine grace that seems to intercede at a crucial moment, where the fate of the entire world seems to hang in the balance.At the end of the day, credit must be given where credit is due, and in many ways the hero of the piece is Samwise Gamgee. By the time we reach Book Six most of the journey is seen through Sam's point of view in order to better witness Frodo's decline and the intense devotion that Sam bestows on him. Perhaps my favourite part of the book is Sam's epiphany, when he gazes up at a lonely star in the sky - but again, I'll let you discover that for yourself.Reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is an amazing experience. By this stage, you'll probably be intensely invested in these characters and their situations, as well as enveloped in the detailed and three dimensional realm of Middle-Earth, the most vivid and realistic sub-creation that the literary world has ever seen, bar none. From the movement of armies to the pitiful sight of two tiny hobbits crawling up the side of a mountain; Tolkien can effortlessly describe both epic and intimate moments. In fact, in this contrast lies one of his most tear-stirring ideas - the careful and deliberate decision on the part of Aragorn, Gandalf and their allies use themselves as bait in the hope of the barest possible chance that Frodo will be able to complete his mission. The display of such enormous self-sacrifice is just...well, I'm lost for words to describe it.Just as Peter Jackson made the first two movies in order to make the last one, reading the first two books definitely has its payoff in this magnificent conclusion."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Two Towers brings this fantasy world of the Middle Earth to life, with his vivid description of the land around. Tolkien's epic adventure takes you on the ride right along with the characters. Though at times the tale is tedious, it is as a journey over valleys and mountains would be. If you choose to read this book, I would definitely recommend reading The Fellowship of the Ring first, it being the first book of the trilogy. That would then allow you to understand much more of the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The highest I can give this is 5 stars?! That's all I can give it?! If you love mideval fantasy with extremely suspensful battle sequences, then don't pass over this book. Any of the people who give this bad ratings don't know wht they are talking about. The plot is awesome! The coolest character is Legolas, he is like the best elven archer in Middle-earth. Elves are the best archers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This inspiring story and epic adventure was basically trying to destroy the one ring that ruled them all. What does that mean? Sauron the dark lord crafted three rings that where then given to the elven kings under the sky, seven to the dwarf lords, and nine to the mortal men. He then in secret crafted the one ring that literally controlled the other rings. Sauron wanted to control the world. Amazingly, King Isildur who is Aragorn's ascendant severed the one ring from Sauron's hand. The dark lord was defeated. The one ring could have been destroyed that day, but greed of power drove Isildur. Aragorn didn't want to be like him so he left the throne to the steward of Gondor and rode out with the elven rangers. The great council of Elrond lord of Rivendell decided that Frodo, a hobbit, would be the ring bearer. Soon, they set off on a journey to destroy the one ring and soon discover the great city of Minas Tirith of Gondor. Sauron's hordes and the armies of the Haradrim mass attack the capital city of Minas Tirith. In the nick of time Rohan, an ally of Gondor comes and defends the city. After they defeated the countless hordes, the mixed armies venture to the Black Gates, which is the entrance to Mordor. After the ring gets thrown into the fires of Mount Doom Mordor collapses. Then, Aragorn marries Arwen, an elf; daughter of Elrond and becomes king. He feels it is only right to take the responsibility and become king. That's basically the summary of the entire story of this superb novel.I really enjoyed this book. This book has taught me many ideas and functions of life. For one thing, even the littlest of people can change the world. This sentence helped me achieve everything I do. For instance, like playing basketball. If Frodo can destroy the ring, then how hard is it to do this task? Then, the job won't be that challenging.&quot;...We might as well give ourselves up...&quot;said Sam. The characters in the book had a chance to give up and go back, but they didn't. They kept going. Another great moral from this book is never give up. Never give up no matter what the circumstances are.I really liked this book. It was interesting because of all the sophisticated words J.R.R. Tolkien put into this astounding master piece. &quot;Behold the Sun setting in a great fire!&quot; The author uses a prominent amount of metaphors and great invigorating speech. It is really descriptive and in a way it is like a mastery of art floating in mid air. I love the way he writes. It is definitely the best book I have read in my entire life.My favorite part of the book is the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Riders of Rohan arrive in the exact time of the vanquishing at Minas Tirith. The Riders bravely charge into the thousands of orcs and trolls. They stood strong and brave there. Shields were shattered and swords were broken. I liked this part mainly because of the action. It probably had the most action and fighting sequence throughout the entire book. I really enjoyed this book. I would think that this book is the best book I would ever have read in my entire life. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves to read action books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"How would you like to grow up as an ordinary person in a world full of danger knowing that you are the true king of the greatest city in all of Middle-earth? Sounds cool, right? Well, to Aragorn it did not. Aragorn was a descendant of the king Isildur. However, he had not taken charge of the kingdom of Gondor because he fears that he will have the same weakness that Isildur had; falling to the temptation of the One Ring.On the other hand, how would you like to be a hobbit, only about three feet tall with all of Middle-earth depending on you to complete a task that was entrusted to you? How would you like to carry a ring that has the power to destroy all of the good things in the world, but at the same time, it has the ability to destroy all of the evil of your world? Also, the only way to destroy this item is to go into the center of the darkest place on Middle-earth and cast the ring into the fires of a volcano. This is what type of a situation Frodo Baggins was in, if he was going to save Middle-earth.Finally, how would you like to be the person that gets to listen (for 18 and a half hours) to the incredible story of how these two characters must face all the evil imaginable and still complete the task that was given to them for the sake of Middle-earth. Trust me; take the easy path and listen to this awesome conclusion to the great conclusion of this series that is hard to put down.Some of the characters of this story were Frodo, Sam, Legolas, and Gimli, Gandalf the White, Merry, and Pippin. The setting was in Middle-earth. The conflict is that as Frodo travels deeper into Mordor, he begins to fade and weaken. At the same time, Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor launches a full scale assault on the last city of men: Gondor. With no king, Gandalf takes command of the city. However, will the crumbling city be able to survive the full blast of Sauron? Will Frodo fall, the Ring be retaken, the Dark Lord of Mordor rise to defeat the slowly dying race of men? Finally, will Aragorn come to the aid of Gondor, and fulfill his duty as the true king? If Frodo and Sam survive, will their home be the same as they left it? Well, you will just have to listen to the awesome conclusion to this exploding series and see."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"To many people, Tolkien's Return of the King is merely a popular movie in the third installation of Peter Jackson's LOTR theatrical trilogy. Although the movie is wicked awesome, the book is the true source of the adventure and drama that makes the series so great.The Return of the King is the final account in which the remnants of the Fellowship battle and journey their way against the impossible odds of Sauron's malevolent forces to end their path in either victory or in the ruin of Middle Earth. Each and every one the characters know full well that they will most likely not make it through or see one another ever again. Yet despite these dubious chances, they continue to fight on for each other and for the world.I highly recommend Return of the King for those of you who are interested in the final stage of the harrowing journey of Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and the other heroes and heroines of Tolkien's tale. If you have already read the first two books, you'll probably not want to quit here anyway. Although the movie covers many of the major ideas in the book, there are numerous differences, slight and profound, that are very fascinating. There is an entire tale of the Hobbits' return to the Shire that you do not want to miss out on, as well as many explanatory and plot developing instances and structures that the movie just could not cover. Actually, the discrepancies between the book and the film rather resemble two different interpretations of the same story. It almost seems as though, if the tale had been true, one legend had passed down two differing branches in oral tradition until the outcome was essentially the same, but with each telling containing slightly different story elements. Nevertheless, I can honestly say that I like both versions, movie and book, very much.I do have one point of caution. Some of the language, names, and references to Middle Earth history and mythology are hard to understand and remember if you have not read The Silmarillion, the essential Middle Earth equivalent to the Old Testament. But even without the knowledge in that book, these elements add a flavor of authenticity and richness that only Tolkien is able to create. Toilsome? Sometimes yes. Worth reading? Definitely yes."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the Two Towers continues the exciting story of the fellowship of the ring. It offers more excitement and suspense as well as several surprises. Tolkien consistently stretches the reaches of imagination, and he always provides logic and reason so that his story makes sense and follows a consistent stream of creativity.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.This book offers some of the severest character conflicts in the books as the characters must make sharp decisions about their actions and alliances. It introduces new characters and species that offer fresh starts throughout the story. This book of the story in no way serves as a filler or drags on and on. It is filled with action and suspense. There is no let up in the action at all.And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this was a great book. It has a great story. I like the way that he wrote the first story about Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas and then he told the story about Frodo and Sam. I like the second book the best because I was surprised with that part because the movie left alot of things there out. I had seen the movie before I read the book. I liked in the first book when they won the battle of Helm's Deep. I also liked when Gandalf broke Saruman's staff. The book has a great ending even though it is not happy, it leaves you hanging. the movies did a bad job,in my opinion, of illistrating the books. I liked the character Gollum.He was very strange, though. I also like the fearsome Uruk Hai. Very neat charaters. The Ents must have really been hard to make up. They were pretty off the wall. All around I might say this is the best book out of the three in the series."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Have you ever imagined what the battle of Helm's Deep was like? The Bloody swords, Orcs with arrows in them, the dead Rohirrim on the walls? It's just one of the bloody battles in The Lord Of The Rings fantasy by J.R.R. Tolkien. Have you ever imagined what the Shire looks like? If you read this novel, you'll see the Shire in your head because Tolkien is very descriptive of the surroundings.The name of the main character is Frodo Baggins. Frodo is a sixty-year old Hobbit. The setting is Middle Earth in the Third age. The most important conflict is trying to destroy a Mystical ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron. In order to destroy the one ring, a fellowship is made of nine companions, each of a different race. There are Merry, Pippin, Sam, and Frodo, who are Hobbits with swords. Then there are two men, Boromir and Aragorn, who are equipped with bows and swords. There is an Elf, named Legolas, equipped with both swords and a bow and arrow. Then there is Gimli, a Dwarf with a broad battle ax. The last character is a wizard, a supernatural being named Gandalf Greyhame. This Fellowship of the ring is attacked by many agents of the dark lord -- things, like Ringwraiths, Orcs, Uru-kai, and Easterlings.I liked the book. One of the reasons I liked the book was because it had a lot of action and humor, for instance the Battle at Helm's Deep where the action and humor is contained mostly in the book. One example of humor is, and I Quote \\" Twenty-one!\\" cried Gimli. He hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last Orc before his feet. \\"Now my count passes Master Legolas again.\\" An example of the action is when Aragorn and his friend Eomer go to the gate and draw swords together. \\"Aragorn and Eomer ran to the gate. \\"look!\\" Eomer said, pointing to the Causeway. Both Orc and Easterlings ran towards the gate. Two dozen Orcs ran towards Legolas and Gimli, who were following Aragorn and Eomer. When they got to the gate, about three dozen lay slain on the ground. The only problem was that they were not dead. Eomer went to step through them, but two Orcs grabbed his heels, tripping him on the floor. They got up and were about to kill him, when Gimli sliced their heads off, just saving Eomer.\\" I liked the book because of the battles. The final reason I liked it was because in the battles, Legolas and Gimli bet each other on who would kill the most Orcs. On example is, from the text: \\"Twenty-one!\\" said Gimli, patting his axe. \\"Good!\\" said Legolas, whetting his sword. \\" but my count is now Two dozen.\\" \\"It has been real knife-work up here.\\" One reason I disliked the book was because the Fellowship split up in the novel before this one."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ever have had something that many want people want to possess? Try overcoming being chased by nonliving warriors riding dragons. Have you ever felt like the fate of the world hung around your neck? If you have experienced this then you know how Frodo Baggins from the Lord of the Rings felt. Frodo was young hobbit from the Shire who really looked for adventure when ever he could find. He wanted to meet new people and see different creatures he had never seen in his life. But the only reason Frodo got to go on adventures was because his uncle gave him the ring of power. Frodo had to get the ring to Mordor and not let the ring get into the wrong hands. The ring has such power that it could conquer the whole world.I really liked the Two Towers. It is a great fantasy novel because it contains all elements that a good fantasy novel should contain. In my opinion J.R.R Tolkien created the greatest quest in the entire fantasy genre. If you read the story very carefully you can see that Tolkien kept on switching settings between characters. For instance in one chapter Tolkien would focus on Pippin and Merry then in the next chapter he would focus on Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli. The best battle in the book in my opinion was the Battle of Helm's Deep. The only flaw was in the beginning Tolkien only focused on the other three companions that Frodo abandoned. I would highly recommend the Two Towers to any who is a fan of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read this after seeing the movie. There was a lot of action that never made it to the movie. This book is really great, the battle at Helms Deep was a lot different than what they showed in the movie! You have got to read this book, but be prepared it's a long one!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"By the time one gets to The Two Towers, after traveling through The Fellowship of the Ring, one feels quite at home in Middle-earth. Unlike the first novel, where the action is fairly linear, this second installment of The Lord of the Rings is divided into two books. The first chronicles Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they try to rescue Merry and Pippin, meet the king of Rohan, and fight the battle of Helm's Deep. The second half jumps back in time to follow Frodo and Samwise as they try to make their way into Mordor.I enjoyed this book even more than Fellowship - possibly because there is more action in it. Also, the story feels more compressed, as it deals with a relatively short amount time (a month, perhaps?) whereas Fellowship told a leisurely story that occurred over several months. Once again, as I read, I was convinced that the point of these books is not to arrive at the end of the tale, but to simply enjoy the journey. Because Tolkien is so good at his job, and has created a fully-realized world with three-dimensional characters, it is easy to understand how so many readers have come to lose themselves in the books.At this point in time, I cannot not talk about the movies. If one comes to this book AFTER SEEING the films, one will realize that Peter Jackson played around with endings. The beginning of the book The Two Towers is actually the end of the movie The Fellowship of the Ring. Also, the adventures in this book take us far into the movie, The Return of the King. I was pleased to find this out because the Hobbits' encounter with Shelob is one of my favorite parts in the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It was a great book!! Very detailed description of areas and people. The book got me interested in reading again. It had hardcore battles that kept me reading for hours on end. The only problem was that it needed to stay on the subject instead of giving so much information on areas that are not relevant to the story. Other than that it was great book. I recomend this book to everyone that loves Fantisy books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"lord of the ringsThe Two Towers follows the lives of the Fellowship, shortly after they broke up. Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.I would recomend it to any one from 13 above to read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkein wrote one of the greatest trilogies of all time called The Lord of the Rings. My favorite book of them all was the second book called The Two Towers.

Doom, Aragon, Gimli and Legolas risk their lives to save their companions who were captured by a group of orcs. Will Frodo succeed in destroying the ring? Or will it fall into the hands of Sauron? Can Aragon save his friends from torture and death? Find out if greed will destroy them all in this great novel."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this book was great. It was filled with tons of actions. Anyone who picks up this book will not be able to put it down till the end. J.R.R. Tolkien knew what he was doing when he wrote this series. Read this book today I promise you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As the quest against Sauron continues, the Fellowship has split and gone their separate ways. The first half of the book follows the majority of the Fellowship, first as they search for their captured comrades, then as they fight the forces of Saruman. The second part chronicles the voyage of Frodo and Sam (and later Gollum), as they attempt to reach the realm of the enemy.As the book progresses, the reader can really begin to see the development of each character. The long, difficult journey undertaken by Frodo, Sam, and Gollum reveals much about each character: that Frodo is struggling with the burden of the ring, the hastiness of Sam, and the inner conflict and treachery that consumes Gollum.I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre in general, in large part due to the the massive volumes generated by authors chronicling the minute details of every quest. It's tedious to read for all but die-hard fans of the genre. This arises in the Two Towers, but Tolkien's masterful sense of setting and character manage to keep the reader's interest, in spite of the long lulls in the action.This is a wonderful second installment, bridging the gap between the first stage of the quest and the final struggle. The true magnitude of Frodo's burden becomes evident, as does the power agaist which all good must stand or be destroyed."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"RETURN OF THE KING WAS AN EXCELLENT FINISH IN J.R.R.

ALTHOUGH ALL OF THE CHARACTERS ARE SPLIT IN THEIR SEPERATE STORIES THROUGH OUT THE BOOK I FEEL THAT IT ADDED TO THE SUSPENCE. AS A READER I HAD A HARD TIME PULLING MYSELF AWAY. ONCE YOU LEFT ONE OF THE CHARACTERS YOU REALIZE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THEIR STORY BUT THEN YOU GET SUCK RIGHT UP IN THE OTHER ONE.

For years she writes in this diary. When she was 7 she's told that when she's older she is to marry the Dauphine of France (prince). At the age of 13 the official marriage proposal comes from the king. There is much preparation to be done before she is married. When she meets her husband for the first time she is repulsed by him, but later grows to love him.One of the things that I didn't like about Marie and all the royal characters in general was the way they thought of the \\"common\\" people. The rule that they have that common people can not talk to a royal or noble unless spoken to first is ridiculous. though I do know that was just the way it was in the past, I'm glad people don't act like that anymore. I did like how the author made the Dauphin though. How she made Louis \\"repulsive\\" looking but a little more lovable in the end.I would not recommend this book for everyone. I think you would have to be interested in history and the lifestyles of the royals long ago, or how people then dealt with things. Though otherwise I would have to say it's a good book and I would recommend it to quite a few people."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\`The Two Towers', the second of the three volume novel, \`Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.Unlike the movies of the first and third books, almost every major scene of the book \`The Two Towers', is captured in the movie. The chapters of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and the Ents are shortened a bit. Seems as if the Ents are much too slow for 21st century cinema. One thing the movie did get wrong in its promotional artwork is the suggestion that the two towers of the title were Orthanc and Baradur, the fortress of Sauron. Actually, the second tower of the title is Minas Morgul, the city of Gondor, originally named Minas Ithil, but renamed when the Nazgul captured it several years before the start of the events in \`Lord of the Rings'. The only piece of action I really miss is the role of Fangorn in the defeat of the besiegers of the Hornburg. And, in one of the very rare Peter Jackson additions to the story, I thought the skirmish between the Rohrrim / Aragorn and Saruman's warg riders was great cinema action, but just too much of a replay of Gandalf at the bridge in Moria, where a principle character is thought to have been killed and lost.I have read \`The Lord of the Rings' at least 10 times, and the story of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli from the banks of the Anduin to the victory at the Hornburg is by far one of my favorite parts of the novel. Treebeard comes in a close second, as he is a piece of the same ancient history of Middle Earth to which only the faintest hints are given in the stories of Fangorn, The Old Forest by the Shire, and Tom Bombadil. Basically, Bombadil and the Ents stand for what is most worth saving from the evil of Sauron. This innocence is something that is tainted even in the sheltered lives of the Hobbits.In contrast, after about the third or fourth reading, I often became anxious to get through the chapters about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as quickly as possible. One of the greatest of Jackson's accomplishments in the films was to breath life into the characterization of Frodo Baggins, who always seemed to be to be something of a wimp, drawn along by the inexorable hand of fate. Sam, on the other hand, was pursuing the quest entirely out of love and grit. Another great service of the movie was the realization of Gollum. I think that Gollum's implementation may be about as close as we will come for a long time in seeing a computer generated character be nominated for an Academy Award for acting.Even though \`The Two Towers' is the middle third of the complete novel, it really has a much more satisfying ending than \`The Fellowship of the Ring'. One starts to see how it may be possible to defeat the great evil challanging all the good guys in the story, but of course, the difficulty of Saruman's defeat is just a way of showing that defeating Sauron will be just that much more difficult.The second of the great three part classic!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the story Lord of the Ring the Two Towers its about the main character Frodo Baggins from the \\"Shire\\". This story has moral and themes that seem more realistic since the movie came out for it also addresses death, light, purity, hope, and innocence, betrayal, darkness, and redemption. Throughout the book of the Lord of the Ring the Two towers golem is constantly manipulating Frodo's mind into thinking that his friends were against him. This story is a 4 star book because of the way it deals with real life issues, and it also addresses how friendship can come over and triumph over anything because in the story it seem that friendship is the only thing that keeps Frodo pure and uncorrupt in this story friendship, purity, and hope intertwine and overlap into one another. This is why this story derserve a 4 star rating it shows human emotions that can only be brought out through the trial and tribulations of life thorough this story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return Of The King is a very good book.There is a mixture of war, stategy, romance, persistence, reality, fantasy, good, evil, and just about everything else!The main characters consist of small people or hobbits the size of children from a place called the shire, men from most regions, orcs and urk-hai from underground places, elves from woods, dwarves from mountainous regions, and destructive ghosts or nazgul that strike fear into people's hearts.One hobbit called frodo must destroy a ring of power in the realm of a dark lord.

They will always be masterpieces. But \\"The Two Towers\\" stands out as the greatest by far. I admit, the books can get a bit dull, but aside from one or two chapters, \\"The Two Towers\\" never lets up for a moment. It is much more exciting than most of Professor Tolkien's writing (don't get me wrong, I love everything he's ever written) and there's a lot of emotion. I also thought it was easier to read than all of the others. You mustn't go through your life without reading the trilogy, especially this one. I absolutely loved this book cover to cover and it was EVEN better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" is the second half of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and begins right where the previous book left off: the Fellowship has been sundered, with the death of Boromir, the escape of Frodo and Sam, the capture of Merry and Pippen, and the chase that ensues on the part of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Like the other two installments in the series \\"The Two Towers\\" is split into two books, in this case it is Book Three and Book Four.Book Three alternates between the journey of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in their cross country race across forest and plain in order to rescue Merry and Pippen. Their pursuit takes them into Rohan, the province of King Theoden and his people, known as the Horse-Lords due to their skill and affinity with horses.Meanwhile Merry and Pippen are held captive by the terrible orcs as they race their way back to their master, the White Wizard Saruman, who has betrayed his calling and given in to his desire for the Ring. Now he wages war on Rohan, filling the court with his spies, and sends his orcs out on a mission to find the Ring before the Dark Lord himself does.The two stories conjoin when Merry and Pippen are able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they fall into the company of Treebeard - a mighty Ent, a tree-like guardian of the forestlands who is not happy with Saruman's treatment of his land. Likewise, the three hunters also find their way into the forest, only to meet someone that they thought was lost to them...In Book Four we join up again with Frodo and Sam, who are making their lonely way toward the land of Mordor and the volcanic Mount Doom in order to destroy the Ruling One Ring. There the secretive figure that has been trailing them since Moria finally shows itself: it is the twisted creature Gollum, once a hobbit, who fell to the power of the Ring and nursed it for many years. Now Frodo employs him as their guide - despite the mistrust of Sam - to take them into the dangerous lands ahead.But they too have their fair share of danger: as always the agents of the Dark Lord are abroad, and even the \\"good guys\\" can pose a threat, considering the constant lure of the Ring - enter Faramir, Boromir's own brother, who takes the hobbits into his custody.\\"The Two Towers\\" suffers like many 'middle' books do - it inevitably does not start anything, and it does not finish anything. But one must keep in mind that Tolkien hated the idea of his work being separated into three separate volumes; he intended them to be published in a single book. The publishers however had other plans, and since then we have been subject to authors who think their books are not proper books unless they are split into multiple volumes.But \\"The Two Towers\\" continues to expand and enlarge Tolkien's most wonderful creation - Middle-Earth itself. We are introduced to the dank and mysterious depths of Fangorn Forest and the plainlands of Rohan, based on the Nordic and Scandinavian culture that Tolkien was fascinated with. Just exploring these beautiful places is reason enough to read \\"The Two Towers\\".With the release of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the three books, it is always interesting to compare and contrast the two. Often the movies fall short in certain ways - often by reducing the nobility and goodness of several supporting characters, such as Faramir, Theoden and Treebeard, who need more pushing from the likes of Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf to do the right thing rather than reach their own decisions. However, other times Jackson takes the opportunity to divulge further into little subplots and details that Tolkien only briefly touches on - the prime example being the relationship between Eowyn and Wormtongue. In Tolkien's words Wormtongue's lust is only briefly mentioned; but Jackson devotes a fascinating little sequence to it, with Wormtongue attempting to weaken Eowyn to his will.Either way, the movie is as must-see as the book is must-read, though if you have only seen the movie and decide that it's not worth reading the book, I strongly suggest otherwise. Although Jackson creates a near-perfect visual duplicate of Middle-Earth, the book contains details and information that the movie must skim over, or neglect completely. If you want to know where Shadowfax came from, or where Gandalf went after defeating the Balrog, or Shelob's origins, then you'll have to consult the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was a very good book. This book proves that even the smallest of good can overcome evil. Frodo and Sam continue their journey into the depths of Mordor to Mount Doom.While Frodo's burden gets heavier and he gets weaker, he still trudges on. You can find that friends can appear in the most unlikely places, even if you don't expect them to turn up. Sam Gamgee is a good hobbit at heart. He stays true even if Frodo brushes his ideas aside. You can also be powerful without being better then everyone else. Captain Faramir may be powerful, yet he does not take his power to overrule people. You can journey with everyone from Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn to Smeagol, Frodo, and Sam. If you liked Shelob in the Two Towers, you can take off from the tower where the last book was left off at!!!The Lord of the Rings: The return of the King is an excellent book for all occassions! With action- packed and excellent adventures, this book can take you for a ride (I'd suggest a horse, the Oliophaunts are too big)!

The book starts off on the run and stays that way for it's entirity.Tolkien creates a world, Middle Earth, that is so real and so believable, it seems to be an actual place. This makes the book better than most fantasy tales and provides a backdrop which works perfectly for the characters, which are very unique and diverse.

It is a follow up to the Lord of the Rings. The novel is very suspenseful at times, while other times it is more relaxing and simply fun to read. Tolkien does a good job of creating a fantasy world with many interesting characters.The novel picks up with Sam and Frodo. Sam and Frodo are two hobbits that are trying to take the evil ring to the one place that it can be destroyed. Along their journey they are given help by an unlikely character. Golem is a monster that owned the ring many years ago. He is following Sam and Frodo because they have the ring and he wants it back. However, when he meets with the hobbits, he helps them when they aer met with troubles in the swamps along their journey.The novels also picks up with Pippen and Mary, two other members in the fellowship of the ring. Mary and Pippen are first captured by the evil Orcs. They are saved though by my favorite characters, the Imps. Imps are large walking trees that stomp almost anything in their way. One of my favorite parts in the book is when the Imps discuss how all trees are alive and have feelings, even though they do not all speak. I think Tolkien was making an important statement about how the environment was being treated when he wrote the book. Another highlight in the novel is when Gandolf returns. he comes back as Gandolf the White, meaning he has more power than he did in the previous novel.The heroes are faced with many evil and very deceitful enemies, but with help, they are able to continue on their journey. Tolkein does a very good job in continuing his series. I feel this book is very good for most teenagers to read and might even be good for some adults. I recommend this novel if you have first read Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have started reading the Lord of the rings series and greatly enjoyed the first book. Now, coming to a close of the second book in the trilogy, i find myself not as satisfied as i was with the first book. Now, it is an excellent read for fantasy lovers and Tolkien is absolutely amazing at creating these complex cultures of men, elves, dwarves, and hobbits, but by Tolkien measures, i don't believe this was his best book. At this point, he is continuing on the first book and leading into the thrid, making more of a means of connection then an individual story. There is also a lot of walking. A good read nonethless. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I find this the most impressive of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, no mean feat for the middle book-- as the companions are separated, the world grows darker and darker. Tolkein deftly builds a brooding atmosphere that is only deepened by the contrast afforded in the flashes of humor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"1) Gollum (Smeagle) is the epitome of the lowest creation. From the beginning when he murdered his best friend for the ring Gollum was doomed. He had the ring, but it possessed him. However, he lost the ring and even though it pained him he still loved and longed for it. It was his own, his precious. Gollum disappears, but then returns during the fellowship. After guiding Frodo and Sam he betrayed them in an effort to seize the ring. In the Return of the King he reappears and shadows Frodo and Sam. He plays an integral role in the completion of the task of the fellowship in Tolkien's ironic way.2) The unconventional way of wizards is an example of Tolkien's creativity. Most wizards have a wand, but Tolkien's wizards, though they are mystifying, seem to be the caretakers and historians of the world and are concerned for the greater well being of the earth and its inhabitants. They also seem to gain power from knowledge. When Gandalf returned as Gandalf the White he speaks of learning much and he has also increased in power. However, wizards are susceptible to the temptation of evil because a dark wizard is more powerful.3) The main object of the epic is the ring. The ring is inanimate yet it can turn anyone who possesses it towards evil even if they wish otherwise. It also could turn those who put it on invisible. The rings main purpose is to return to its master (Sauron). When it was created Sauron put part of him in it, in order to make him more powerful. It was also part of a masterful plan to force every creature under his power.4) Tolkien's depiction of the evil Sauron as a lidless eye that sees all is interesting anthropomorphism because he possesses the attributes of most evil beings, but since he is unable to take physical form he is a mysterious unseen powerful ruler. The Eye of Sauron sees all yet its attention can be focused on an area, allowing things to slip.5) The Ents are a truly original Tolkien conception. They are trees that have been awakened. Though their major role is in the Two Towers they do appear in this novel. They live to be extremely old, and don't like to be hasty. They also can break stone easily.6) Though the title of the book concedes the knowledge of the king's (Aragorn) return, after this event the book unexpectedly continues. After all the hobbit's hardships, when they reach home they still have to deal with an unforeseen difficulty. Saramen, a character who was thought to be out of the book, resurfaces at the head of the conflict. In the chapter the \\"The Scouring of the Shire,\\" Tolkien twists the plot and creates a small climax as the four hobbits rebel against men.7) This book, as with the previous two novels, showcases Tolkien's conceptual world. He masterfully is able to take the reader into this world, as if the story was fact.8) This verse opens the book. &quot;Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his dark throneIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.&quot; It sets the stage for the coming tale and leaves the reader waiting to uncover more9) A skilled linguist, Tolkien's elven language further contributes to the overall sense of reality.10) By focusing on minor characters, such as Merry and Pippin, Tolkien is able to keep the reader from predicting the next event."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return Of The King&quot; is a rousing conclusion to the &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy. Tolkien weaves a mesmerizing account of the War of the Ring as the Dark Lord Sauron sends his armies against Gondor. With the timely help of the Riders of Rohan, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry and Pippin find themselves preparing for the final battle against Sauron's dark legions during the first part of &quot;The Return Of The King&quot;. The second part chronicles Frod's and Sam's perilous journey through Mordor, followed by Gollum, as they head towards Mount Doom. It also depicts the final battle in defense of Gondor against Sauron's forces. Last, but not least, the tale ends surprisingly where it all began, in the Shire, at Bag's End. I don't know whether Peter Jackson's filmed adaptation of &quot;The Return Of The King&quot; will be as mesmerizing as the book, but judging from his excellent adaptation of &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;, I think it most certainly shall."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My daughter (Age 10) and I just read this series together. We loved it, and will never forget the experience. This book has an underlying value, and quality to it that just is rarer than rare. I am an avid reader of religeous and philosophical writting as well, and in every possible way I consider this book to be holsome, pristine, intense, and entertaining. C. S. Lewis, the great Christian/Children's author is as close as one gets. It is like sitting in the sunshine on a high mountain top. With tears, I would say there will never be another J.R.R. Tolkien. The only hard part of the book, is there is no rushing it without spoiling it. You'll get to the end soon enough. The parts that seem slow are often the most beautifull of all literature when read well. As a youth, I read over a thousdand science fiction / fantsy books.

And all the while the armies of the Dark Lord are massing and the One Ring comes ever closer to the Cracks of Doom. While Gandalf, Aragon and the others from the fellowship fight at the battle for minas tirith. This is the exciting finally of the lord of the rings.

He seems to be able to draw the reader right into the story. His characters have a lot of depth and you can feel their pains, joys and triumphs.

So many bad reviews came in for The Fellowship of the Rings; who would even want to come to this page?! I think this book is AWESOME! Tolkien is a genius. I love how he takes time to develop each persons character. Some say that the characters are flat and two-dimentional, but if you think that, *you're* two-dimentional!! The 'heroes' have flaws (even Aragorn), the antagonists have their good qualities (however few). Particularly, this is where we get some really good insight into the characters of Gimli and Legolas.

I'm reading it again and I'm telling you that no other book(s) can compare to these books. J.R.R. Tolkien is the best book writter that I have ever read books by. Tolkien is an authentic book writer.The main thing about it is about a majical but evil ring that has to be destroyed in the deapths of Mount Doom. The main character is Frodo. He takes the ring to M.D. to be destroyed. My favorite character is Samwise Gamgee (known as Sam). He willingly goes with Frodo on to their quest. Called by Elrond, Sam is the only one doomed to go on this quest. No to mention that it was Sam who took care of the ring when Frodo was kidnapped by the Orcs. My next favorite character is the OLD, WISE,Hobbit, Bilbo. It was because of him that the whole quest started. Bilbo found the ring in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Tolkien must have been a genious to be able to think of a whole new world, including the characters, and still be able to keep the story down to earth.In the beggining of the story Frodo and Sam were not alone on the horrable quest.

Go Tolkien"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this final installment of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" the quest to destroy the One Ring is concluded and the power of the Dark Lord finally defeated. Tolkien's attention to detail shines here, both in his descriptions of the battle scenes, and in the attention to the struggles of Sam and Frodo. In the end, you almost feel as if you've lived through the war yourself.Tolkien has a message here. While he clearly considers war to be an evil, it is equally clear that he feels that it is sometimes necessary for good people to sacrifice everything to fight the forces of evil. Tolkien wrote these books in the aftermath of two World Wars, and that influence is almost palplable in this book. Above all, this is a story of courage and sacrifice, about standing up and fighting for what is good against those that would destroy it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book is great (Read it!), but personally feel Peter Jackson made two major mistakes with this movie and let his viewers down. I still think it's a great movie and probably should get the rewards it will get (and you should see it), but it is not The Return of the King that Tolkien wrote and you need to read the book to fully understand why. Here are the reasons:First, the Scouring of the Shire was completely omitted from the movie. Peter Jackson's claim that this is anticlimactic is far, far from the truth. In fact, it is climatic and that's why Tolkien put it in. There are three basic needs for a man: an adventure to go on, a battle to fight, and a pursuit (of the woman). You see all three of these in movies such as Braveheart. A young man needs to hear from his father that he has strength for the adventure, battle, and pursuit. Without this, a man is serverely wounded. Instead of being a stallion, he becomes a gelding, and one of the key problems of the church today is we have these geldings instead of stallions, and geldings cannot bear fruit.Frodo has these same needs. In the Scouring (the book), we see Frodo returning to his &quot;Place&quot; (Hobbiton) after it has been destroyed by Saruman. Frodo is in a massive depression. He essentially failed his mission (he didn't put the ring in the volcano) and is burdened by his guilt, failure, and physical infirmitiess. On his return to &quot;Place&quot;, however, he takes on his masculinity and leads the hobbits in restoring their community (&quot;Place&quot;). Frodo leaves the story as a true hero. That's climatic, not anticlimactic.Second, the Houses of Healing incident was completely omitted from the movie. In the book story Eowyn, Faramir, and Merry lie dying in the houses of healing. Ioreth, the lady attending them, says their healing is beyond her power. &quot;The hands of the king are the hands of a healer,&quot; she says, &quot; And so shall the rightful king be known.&quot; It is Aragorn, the coming king, that enters and leads all three to their healing. Tolkien pulls a little psychologica trick here in the book. After the healing Ioreth repeats the sentence again, acknowledging her perception of Aragorn as the coming king because he can heal. She seems to repeat this line again and again until Aragorn is crowned as king. She tries to repeat the line again, but fails as the trumpet drowns out her voice. By this time, however, the reader is completing the line; that is, the reader is being forced to take ownership on that statement.Now Tolkien was a devout Christian (Catholic), and was the man that led C.S. Lewis to the Lord. Tolkien is not talking about any earthly king or kingdom here. When I read this in Tolkien's book I wept. I think it's the most important quote in the book, but it's not even in the movie. It is a great movie, but it is not The Return of the King if you can't see why he is king.My guess is that Peter Jackson probably didn't understand the spiritual significance of either of these parts of Tolkien's novel. That's unfortunate, as both are the highest points of Tolkien's story.In all fairness, I think Peter did a more than remarkable job with The Two Towers. I see King Theoden, as he first appears, as the majority of the Church today, captured and powerless and not even knowing what is going on. Our heroes heal him and release his bondage, and his people rejoice to have their king again. Aragorn, knowing war has already started and Theoden's son has died in a battle, tries to encourage him to get ready.Theoden: I will not risk open war.Aragorn: Open war is upon you, whether you risk it or not.That is exactly where the Church is today. Christ said he gave his followers authority and power. To do what? That is what the Gospels are all about. There is a war going on, whether we risk it or not."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Upon rereading 'The Return of the King' 15 years later the book offered a few suprising plot twists, but more importantly recreates and fills out the magical world that Tolkien created. By the time the company reached the Grey Havens, i found myself frantically wondering what i would read next that wouldn't be a total letdown. I dug into the appendices, which i remembered from my childhood as dry and hard to get through, and found them wonderful. They flesh out the beautiful characters of Middle Earth that we've learned so little about in just three books and make me want to start all of the secondary literature that Tolkien and his sons have created (Silmarillion, Lost Tales, Adventures of Tom Bombadil, etc)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"One might well worry that such an epic as The Lord of The Rings, such a universe as Middle Earth, such a wonderful series of books, could not possibly come to a satisfying conclusion. You need not be worried. The Return of The King is a masterpiece, as is the series as a whole. It brings the epic series to a grand, satisfying finale. You will not be disappointed. The prose is so immaculate; it's almost like you're reading poetry. I find that Tolkien is alone with this gift in modern literature. It is one of the many tenents that makes The Lord of The Rings one of the unarguable masterpieces of recent literature. This will be around as long as any book of fiction. The ending is bittersweet, and yet touching. It's perfect. There's simply nothing like this series. It's immaculate literature. It's wonderous writing. It's the best high fantasy ever written, period. I reccommend that you start with The Hobbit, and then definately read the first two books in the series, before reading this one. It's the only logical way to do it; you definately don't want to jump right into this one without reading those, as it will not make any sense to you. Read this masterpiece in chronological order. This is one of the greatest testaments to imagination ever published in any form, and The Return of The King is the series's essential grand finale. Also, very interesting to the LOTR fanatic, it contains a wealth of appendices and indexes of characters and place names. Such chronicles as the events preceding and following the series are included, as are a history of the kings, several dissertations on the various languages of Middle Earth (you can actually learn to write in, say, Elvish.) This shows just what an amazing and almost unbelievably large and complex complete universe Tolkien created with the series. It's a deserved ackwnoledged masterpiece. A must read for anybody, without a doubt. Long after countless other books of the 20th century fictional canon are forgotten, The Lord of The Rings will remain. Mark my words. You owe it to yourself to read this masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I was looking for a review of the Robert Inglis audiobook of Return of the King. I found many reveiws of the book and the Lord Of The Ring trilogy, didn't actually see any for the audiobook. Perhaps they may be there, buried in the hundreds of reviews. Well, anyway, if you find this review attached to the book or movie, sorry, I didn't put it there. Amazon likes to cross post reviews.I wish there was another unabridged version of LOTR. I don't find Robert Inglis a very enjoyable reader. He is a professional actor, but very far from an \\"A-list\\" actor. Both show. Professionally done, for sure, but just not great. I find his characterizations off-putting, and his style in general just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's me. I am guessing that audiobook work doesn't pay very much, nor does producing audiobooks advance one's career. Maybe even hurts it. Too bad, you don't normally get the best talent. Imagine if Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, or other \\"A-list\\" actor would do this book! So, my 3 stars is in no way a review of Tolkien, only my disappointment in the reading given it here. The best selling fictional work of the 20th century absolutely should have had a world class audiobook. This was recorded about 1990, when nothing in particular was happening to create excitement about LOTR. If only there was a fresh, bigger budget production when the movie trilogy was released. (By the way, I'm sure the costs of production have been recouped over the 20+ years since the initial release of these CDs. Mr. Publisher, why not lower the price? Way too high. Here's an idea: Release it as MP3s for 1/2 the price of the CDs. Your per unit cost is almost zero, you would sell a bunch more units at the lower price, and still have a higher profit.)I wanted to read the negative reviews of the audiobook, to see if I was off-base, or if others wished for a better reading. Instead, I found the negative reviews were for The Lord of the Rings itself. There were a couple of types. First, the language in the 3rd book got thick, and Beowolfish. This wasn't because Tolkien \\"lost it\\" or got sloppy or unimaginative. It was deliberate, to convey that the people in the East were speaking an old-fasioned dialect of the language of Middle Earth. This was the English simulation of that dialect. That's why the characters say things like \\"Aragorn has become fey.\\" If it doesn't appeal to you, fair enough. But before you get to preachy about it's awfulness, consider that (as I write this) 5/6s of the reviews are 5 stars. Most people get it. The second type of negative review includes no reason, just \\"the books are over rated and terrible!\\" OK, again, look at the 5 star ratings. I don't happen to enjoy chocolate ice cream. Doesn't make chocolate ice cream over rated or awful. Sometimes, its just you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a stellar sequel to the Lord of the Rings series. Set in a land of spectacular, grandiose adventure, the Fellowship of the Ring has been split up, with Boromir's death, the capture of Merry and Pippin, and the departure of Frodo and Sam, on their way to decimate the One Ring created by Sauron, the Dark Lord. Tolkien's story of Middle-Earth is bamboozling in how a writer can accomplish so much in such a small package, with so much adventure, emotion, and tragedy! While Gandalf is lost since Moria, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are looking for the captured Merry and Pippin.Saruman is still after the Ring, Sauron is also searching for his own creation of evil. Will they find it, read and find out!Alright, so what is Middle-Earth? Middle-Earth is a magical place with wizards, Men, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits. Wait, hold on, What are hobbits?Hobbits, more formally named as halflings, are gentle folk, about as tall as your waist, and have a taste for comfort. It just so happens that Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are hobbits, hobbits with a mission. Okay, back to the subject.Middle-Earth is a land in peril, unbeknownst to most hobbits, but known to some. Sauron has found the Ring, and plans to catch it. If he does, the entire world of Middle-Earth will be under his evil rule. This is why the Fellowship is their only hope of winning against Sauron. And the fate of the Fellowship lies in the hands of their leader, Frodo Baggins, the Ringbearer.That is the story of Middle-Earth. But now to my review. This book is an absolute ten out of ten. I mean it is a book for readers of all kinds! Out of the myriad of books I have read, Tolkiens are the best!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you haven't read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and are even remotely interested, please do. I won't waste time extolling the trilogy's virtues as a piece of fantasy. Suffice it to say that Tolkien crafted an incredibly believable fantasy world. Each time I read the series I become (almost) convinced that Middle Earth does indeed exist. The story, land, and characters feed the imagination and envelope the mind.With a work that's so highly regarded, it's always a bit dangerous to offer a negative criticism. I do have a (dare I say) problem with &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. I'll call it a problem of pacing. The novel is divided into two books. The first book details the adventures of all the members of the fellowship except Frodo and Sam. The second book concerns only Sam and Frodo. The narratives in both books cover roughly the same time frame. While the first book is fairly fast paced, the second book (with a few notable exceptions) moves along slowly. In the second book, Tolkien recounts how Sam and Frodo make their way into Mordor. To be honest, not much happens. Much of the text is devoted to them walking from place to place, camping along the way. The story is never boring, and I would never suggest removing a word of it. However, I can't help but wonder if it might have worked better if the two books had been intermingled. Not only would the reader get a better sense of the chronology but it would have broken up Sam and Frodo's travels with the adventures of the rest.This is really just a very small complaint I have. It should never stop someone from reading the the trilogy. Keep in mind that, at his worst, Tolkien wrote better books than 95% of fantasy writers before or after him."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second part to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. In this action-filled book Tolkien is able to use the astounding characters that he developed in the first part of the trilogy.

Two of these characters must go into Mordor the land of the dark lord to destroy the ring of power.The turmoil starts early in the book and keeps on coming with new twists and new unimaginable danger. Some of the new characters that come in to this book are quick to develop and quick to go into action. Tolkien creates this strongly weaved tale that will come to life before your very eyes.The Two Towers is a heart-stopping book and will keep you stuck to the pages and then make you come back for more of this epic tale.

Tolkien is an epic tale about two courageous hobbits. Their fate separates them from the rest of the Fellowship when attacked by a group of orcs. In the attack, Boromir is slain and the hobbits Pippin and Merry are taken captive. The other two hobbits, Frodo the ring bearer and Samwise his trusty servant, leave during the attack on a quest to destroy the evil Ring of Power in the feared land of Mordor.

Frodo and Sam meet untold perils on their trek to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli take part in an epic battle that leads to a turning point in the war against Sauron, and begins Pippin and Merry on their road to fame and glory.I recommend this book to people who like action, drama and fantsy. Before you read this book you should read two other books written by J.R.R. Tolkien.

I have to admit, I was a &quot;late bloomer&quot; when it came to reading these books, but now that I am done, i wish i had done it a long time ago!&quot;The Two Towers&quot; might possibly be overlooked (being the one in the middle), if it wasn't for the story (i know what you're thinking--and you're right). &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is absolutely vital to the whole picture. While the really important stuff happens mostly in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, the pieces in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; will help you understand all that has happened and all that will happen (or the things that have not yet come to pass--if you will--hahaha). Anyway, BUY THIS BOOK! But make sure that you read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first, otherwise, you're not going to know what the heck is going on. And don't rely solely on the movie, there is sooooo much more in the book that they left out (for obvious reasons). AND don't read &quot;The Return of the King&quot; UNTIL you have read this one. Fair enough?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this , the second volume of Tolkein's classic trilogy , the pace of the action really picks up! After a modestly slow start in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; , all of the major characters are in place and an action filled epic unfolds in a magical world best viewed in the marvelous images created by the author in one's own mind. Each reader has his own mental image of Frodo--of Gandalf--and of the despicable orcs.After the fall into the abyss of Gandalf the Grey with the Balrog in &quot;The Fellowship&quot;, we see a new and awesomely powerful Gandalf the White emerge (an almost Biblical resurrection , to make a comparison).In this volume Treebeard the Ent is introduced , and the episodes of Merry and Pippin with the Ents are marvelously entertaining. The little folk , the Hobbits , show an unforseen inner strength that is one of the things I enjoy most in this tale.The strength of will and devotion of Samwise Gamgee to Frodo is heartwarming. The segement &quot;In Shelob's Lair&quot; is one of the more genuinely scary parts of the book.I probably shouldn't reveal too much more about what transpires in the story and spoil it for a first-time reader ; of the three volumes in the trilogy this is probably the most action filled and fun reading one , and is therefore my favorite.If you haven't read it yet--what are you waiting for?! Five stars don't do it justice!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Frodo is presumed dead. Pippin is in trouble with the Nazgul. And Sauron is gaining power. This is the amazing conclusion to J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary trilogy. Merry becomes a soldier of Rohan, and Pippin becomes one of Gondor, Boromir's home town. Both of these armies prepare for an upcoming battle with Sauron's army of orcs and Ringwraiths. Along with them are Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf. Meanwhile, in Mordor, Frodo and Sam have been betrayed by Gollum, and Frodo is in the hands of Orcs. But soon Sam frees him, and they are off again to Mount Doom to toss the Ring into the magma and destroy it. Gollum makes one more appearance, but what happens I'll let you find out. But is the ordeal in Mordor really the end? What has happened to Saruman? What's going on back in the Shire?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King has very detailed and interesting characters. Aragorn used to be a Ranger and roam around the wild land. But now he is leading the offensive against Sauron, but there is more to the offensive than meets the eye. It is a diversion to get Sauron's troops to move away from somewhere else where something much bigger, and important will happen.This is a very good book. The characters are very unique, and interesting. Especially Aragorn he is my favorite character because he is mysterious and intriguing. Aragorn was raised by Elves and is Elvish himself, he is mostly solitary unless his own people are present. He is very powerful, and dangerous in battle. But in peace times he is gentle and a healer. The Return of the King is just as good if not better than the rest of the books in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I strongly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Here we find it to be the concluding book of a trilogy. The tension of the book is still building while we find the characters excately were we left them in the TWO TOWERS. A fight for the whole of Middle-Earth. As we get into the book we find that the shaky allience between sam, frodo, and gollum is crumpling fast. We also see that the rest of the middle-earth hero's are on the way to help were it is necissary. In this book there is a great deal of passion, pain, loss, and love.This book is the reason why so many readers have come back to this book over and over again. WE find that the ending is rightly built up and that the characters finally come together. A great story that anyone and everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am a senior in high school, and usually don't enjoy reading that much, because it is hard for me to find a book to get in to. I read The Lord of the Ring The Return of the King by J.R.R Tolkien, I read this book for the sole purpose to have something to read for class. I picked it because it was the only book in the library I recognized. I saw the movies so I thought it would be an easy read. But I read the book, I saw that it had more in it and was much better than any movie.Well as most of you know, The Return of the King is the last chapter in one of the best trilogies ever made. This is an excellent book to read, so if you loved the movie you will love this book too. It better than the movie because it is more in-depth on what the other characters are doing. Like showing what Marry and Pippin where doing during their time as loyal followers of Denethor lord of Gondor and Theoden lord of Rohan. It also shows a little more to what everyone else was doing during their journey. The one thing I didn't like was lines of dialogues which got boring sometimes. Overall, I liked the book and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"People who complain about the slow pacing of the books probably haven't made it past Fellowship of the Ring. That book, for all its merits (and it has many) could have been called \\"LOTR: The Onset of Exposition\\" at times, so heavy does the weight of backstory fall on the reader. However, I like the backstory and find that it makes Middle-Earth richer and more realistic, knowing that for every offhand reference to some hill that the characters walk past, Tolkien came up with an entire history for that very hill and we're only hearing a tiny bit of it. I have no choice but to admire that. The other hurdle for readers of the first book was that the plot was resolutely linear in nature, since all the companions were together you basically have Point A to Point B stuff, first they walk \\"here\\" and then they go \\"here\\" and things happen and so on. Two Towers fixes those problems with style. With the Fellowship split, Tolkien divides the plot into Frodo/Sam and everyone else. Having already dealt with setting up the premise (ring=bad) he can go to town on the plot itself and it's amazing how breakneck things are, considering this is coming from a mild mannered Oxford professor. Aragorn and company range across Rohan trying to find the hobbits, trying not to get killed, running into friends and enemies while meanwhile the rest of Middle-Earth is waking up to the fact that Sauron really does want to kill everyone . . . at the same time Frodo and Sam start to realize that they might be on a bit of a suicide mission. Fantastic locations abound and Tolkien's imagination seems endless as he whips out magical setting after magical setting, switching from wondrous to horrifying to just plain beautiful in chapter after chapter. As big and epic as the events of the novels are, he never loses sight of the humanity of his characters and often contrasts the workings of the important immortal characters (Gandalf, the elves, etc) with the regular people who populate Middle-Earth and getting their perspective on things. And he never forgets to include moments of small humor and delight, Merry and Pippen finding a stash of food, Frodo and Sam discussing how people will remember their tale for years after it's over, so that the characters seem like real people who are simply caught up in things beyond their reckoning and just trying to figure out how to make it through alive. Again, it's not perfect but it's as close to the distilled essence of epic fantasy as we're likely to get. One thing I did notice that I didn't remember from my first time reading it is that the novels are almost like musicials, Tolkien must have been a frustrated songwriter because it seems like every few pages (this is more pronounced in the first novel) people stop to sing a song about something, anything. Not saying it's good or bad, just commnenting. And for those coming in from the movies, this book seems most affected by the transition from text to film, with whole sections chopped out to get crammed into the next movie and a lot of stuff simply just changed. So don't think because you've seen the films you've seen it all, the novels are still the first source and still highly preferred for those so inclined. So for all those folks who said \\"all they do is walk around!\\" this is where they start to get proven wrong."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This book continues the journey of the fellowship. Their task is to destroy the ring of power. Unfortunately, the fellowship is broken up. The hobbits, Frodo and Sam, continue on towards Mount Doom. The rest of the group race to save Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Sauruman's troops.This book races through events and follows the two groups as the story unfolds. Where will the fellowship find help? Can Gollum be trusted? We are introduced to the people of Rowhan, Gondor and the wonderful Ents. We witness the first great battles of the war (at Isengard and Helm's Deep). We can feel the tension increase as the hobbits get closer to their goal. However, the closer they get, the harder and harder the road becomes. It is similar to a wave cresting right before crashing into the rocks.This book continues the wonderous tale of the ring. Tolkien's life long work on Middle Earth comes to fruition in these books. Tolkien's focus on the details that back up the story and myths of Middle Earth reaps tremendous rewards to the reader. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third Lord of the Rings was my favorite of all of them. It had so many cool things that they didn't show in the movie. My favorite part was when the hobbits go back to the Shire and they see that Saruman has taken over. Then they gather their friends and family and go to take it back no matter what the consequences. I recommend this book to anyone who can read. It was really one of the greatest!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The conclusion of JRR Tolkien's fantasy epic is nothing short of astounding, and is recommended to all. In the third part of the trilogy, Frodo and Sam get closer to Mount Doom every day, guided by Smeagol. In the mean time what is left of the Fellowship of the Ring head to Minas Tirith, the capital city of Gondor, to fight the forces of the evil Lord Sauron.Tolkien is absolutely one of the greatest writers of all time. And I hope that many more readers will embrace this amazing story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What would you do if the survival of the world was cast upon you in a package that could fit your finger, but at the same time, have the power to destroy the whole of Middle Earth? This is what Frodo Baggins has to suffer through everyday. When you read J.R.R Tolkien's: The Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King, you will be embraced by a story of power, faith, and war. When young Frodo is entrusted with destroying the powerful Ring of Power in the fires of Mt.Doom, where it was first forged, he must accept the quest. Along with the Dwarf Gimli, the Elf Legolas, the Human, Aragorn, and his 3 hobbit friends, Merry, Pippin, and of course, Sam, he will journey to Mt. Doom to undo the evil that has been done. I think the moral of this story is that a small person can do a very big thing. One of the weak points of the book is its length. It will take a day to read each book, and understand them thoroughly. On the other hand, this book's strong point overpowers its weak points completely. It is a book of twists and turns, thrills and chills, which you will remember forever. This book is for people who love spine-tingling adventures. Other books written by this author are, The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the ring, and The Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers continues at the point where the first book ends; Frodo leaves the fellowship to travel to Mordor with only his faithful friend Sam as his companion. Merry and Pippin have been taking captive by orcs sent by Saruman. Aragorn decides to leave Frodo to his quest and to follow the orcs in hopes of rescuing Merry and Pippin. The Two Towers is divided into two parts; the first part tells the tale of Aragorn, Gimly, Legolas, Merry, and Pippin while the second part of the book talks about the journey of Frodo and Sam. I found the first part of the book really enjoyable; this is where most of the action was and where the story became more interesting. I felt the second part of the book was a little dull, mostly consisting of tedious description. It didn't hold my interest as well as the first part of the book.During the first part of the book Aragorn's pursuit of the orcs leads him, Gimly, and Legolas to Fangorn forest where Gandalf makes his triumphant return. The four of them travel to the land of Rohan to speak with King Th&eacute;oden who is currently under the control of Saruman. After Gandalf breaks his Saruman's hold the people of Rohan flee to Helms Deep to prepare a defense against Saruman's army.Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin's encounter an Ent, kind of walking, talking tree, named Treebeard. Merry and Pippin learn of the Ent's hatred of the orcs and Saruman because of the harm that they were bringing to the forest. The Ent's agreed that Saruman must be stopped and they begin their march on Isengard after Saruman has sent his army to attack Helms Deep.There were many exciting and interesting events that happened in the first part of the book. I especially enjoyed Aragorn's pursuit of the orcs; it truly demonstrated his skills as a ranger. He was able to deduce several events that took place by simply analyzing various tracks and imprints on the ground. During this pursuit Tolkien also describes Legolas' keen senses. Legolas was able to see across great distances and make out minor details. Tolkien also mentions the great endurance that Gimly and other dwarves possess. Gimly was able to run for long periods of time without resting or getting short on breath.This was one aspect that I thought Tolkien improved on in his writing. He began to write about some of his characters in greater detail. I've always thought that his characters were interesting and now that I began to learn more about them I've come to like them more. Stories with interesting characters are far more enjoyable than stories that are entirely driven by their plots. When the characters are more interesting I become more concerned with the events surrounding them, making me more interested in the plot.This was on reason that I didn't find the second part of the book as enjoyable as the first. It didn't have the same level of excitement as the first. Much of it was tedious description of every rock and plant Sam and Frodo passed as they continued on their journey. The main reason that I was interested in the second part of the book was because of Gollum, who I thought was another very interesting character.Gollum was in possession of the ring for so long that it gave him an unnaturally long life and corrupted his mind. He practically had split personalities. His \\"better\\" half was Sm&eacute;agol, or who he used to be before he found the ring. His more evil and selfish side was Gollum, one who desired to have the ring above all else. Gollum wasn't a villain when compared to Sauron or Saruman, nor was he a hero. He was a poor twisted soul that had been corrupted by the ring's evil power.Gollum became bound to the ring; it was something that he had to have and he followed Frodo throughout most of his journey just to get it back. When Gollum finally encounters Frodo and Sam they capture Gollum. Like Bilbo, who had encountered him long ago, Frodo couldn't kill Gollum. Instead Frodo spares him. Gollum swears to serve his new master, Frodo, and to guide them to Mordor. Sam is unsuccessful in his attempt to get Frodo to either kill Gollum or leave him behind and shortly after the three continue on their journey.I found their journey dull for the most part because it didn't really compare to the journey that the others experienced in the first part of the book. It wasn't until towards the end of the book did Frodo and Sam's journey become more interesting. Gollum had led the two hobbits to Shelob's liar in an attempt to reclaim the ring. Shelob is a giant spider creature that had existed on Middle Earth since almost the beginning of time. Once Gollum leads them to the lair he leaves the two hobbits in the dark as pray for Shelob. I thought this was an interesting change of pace because it portrayed Sam as a hero and he displayed the same courage that Aragorn and the others displayed in the battle of Helms Deep.Overall I felt that the Two Towers was a good story but I thought it would've been better if Tolkien had made Frodo and Sam's subplot alternate with the subplot of Aragorn and the others instead of separating the book into two sections. It was hard for me to change from the great suspense of Aragorn's pursuit, the battle of Helms Deep, and the Ents siege on Isengard, to a much slower pace story. If they hadn't been done separately the story would've been much better in my opinion because there wouldn't be such a large change of pace between the two parts of the book. However, I still felt that this was a great story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"With the war of middle earth about to start its final hours with Aragorn, Gandalf, Merry, Pippin, Sam, Legolas, Gimli and of course the ring bearing Frodo Baggins. But before that they need to reach the lands around Mt. Doom. Now with this being in J.R.R. Tolkien's three part series, The Two Towers is the second. Along with it being in the Lord of the Rings three part trilogy, this book also has three parts. The first part is Sam and Frodo being led around Mordor to reach the mountain that can destroy the ring, the second part is Merry and Pippin's journey with orcs and ents. Now the final part is Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and Gandalf on what they did to reach Mordor. Now in the book everything seems to be running smoothly for the heroes until Frodo and Sam have a brief running with Gollum... yeah... brief... and that they find a King is possessed. Everything seems to turn around while the ring gets closer to Mt. Doom.Now with the Two Towers being the second part of the trilogy. I find it to be the best. For the reasons that without knowing the journeys to Mordor and what Sam and Frodo ha to go through, it wouldn't be as important of a story. Another reason is that Gollum doesn't get killed so he plays an important role as follow the leader. And the battle of Helms Deep is one of my favorite battles because it shows death with sadness, but soon hope. I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes fantasy, but the series needs to be read in the order of 1 2 3 or else it just won't make sense.No other books in my mind can compare to the legendary Lord of the Rings. From the facts that there are no tag-along for the fun of it characters. They all have a great role and factor to playing out the story. Also, the Lord of the Rings has to be the most serious book I've ever read. Which seems difficult to do when talking about hobbits, elves, dwarves, humans, and the supernatural. But that makes it the interesting story it is today. The Two Towers stacks up to be the best book I've ever read. So read it and be happy. ^^"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"j.r.r tolkein was a brilliant man. his books inspired millions to create and begin writting. this book starts right were the fellowship left off. bomir is dead, mary and pipen have been captured my the uruk-hai, frodo and sam have set off for mordor to destroy the one ring that sauron formed from the evil of his own body. it was the one ring TO RULE THEM ALL! frodo and sam along the way find a unexpected freind golum or also known as smeagol."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well, Tolkien obviously has many many devotees and there are lots of reviews below mine, so I'll keep my comments brief. I like this series a lot and this book is a worthy successor to &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The only additional comment I'll make is that I like this series much more as an adult (I'm almost 30&quot; than I did as a child. There is a lot of interpersonal interaction &amp; emotion and not so much swordplay &amp; action. Consequently this series is certainly acceptable for children but I think it's more geared towards the adult reader."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Im gonna make this short and sweet. I dont like to read much but this book was great and it is the best book i have ever read.

Each small party explores different parts of the land, Middle-Earth created by Tolkien. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimili explore the fields of Rohan, Merry and Pippin befriend a survivor of an ancient race, and Frodo and Sam go straight into Mordor, leaded by the creature, Gollum. This was a great book and keeps you interested all the time. It really is hard to put it down once you start reading it. Afte rteh Fellowship of the Ring, I strongly suggest picking this book up (whether it be from a library or a store) and read it! It will keep you wondering what will happen in the third edition of the series....."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The road may go ever onward but, for us at least, the journey is done. It is difficult not to be emotional arriving at the end of Return of the King after making it through the entire trilogy. The thing about this particular book, for me, is it seems much such shorter than the other two. At least half the number of pages are devoted to the Appendices. The Two Towers had brought us so far that all that remains in Return of the King is climax after climax. Here, Frodo and Samwise's journey through Mordor is much more arduous than in the movie. It is in the third installment I think that we get the despair that Tolkien felt coming home from the Great War. He, like Frodo, must have found it impossible to pick up the threads of his old life.Like the movie, there is a very long denouement after the climax of the story. You may think it is over, but we have to find out what happens to all the characters. Peter Jackson left a lot out of the film - especially what happens to Saruman and the Shire.Now that it is over, I realize who my favorite characters are by who I will miss. Oddly, I don't miss any of the Men. Aragorn, for all we are told we are supposed to love him, falls rather flat on the page. Yeah, he is heroic, but I can't relate to him. I will miss Gandalf - he was fun. Legolas and Gimli are too thinly drawn to have any true love for them. Ultimately, Lord of the Rings is the hobbits story. They have personality. I feel for Frodo and the task that has been thrust upon him. I feel I know him and Samwise. That is the true statement the books have to make about heroism - you don't have to be a super-human like Aragorn. As Gandalf says, \\"you just have to do the most with the time that is given.\\"It's sad to watch your friends sail off into the sunset, but ultimately, that is the only way the book can end."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The conclusion of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is an excellent read, and is only the least of the series when compared with the quality of the first two books. By itself, 'The Return of the King' is a tale for the ages. It ties up nearly every loose end. Readers might wonder why the book does not end where it seems like it should. Not to worry, for it continues because there is still one more adventure... one more challenge waiting for the Hobbits when they return home after completing the Quest. Our heroes are forever changed from the individuals they were back when we first met them in 'Fellowship of the Ring,' as are their surroundings. Such is the nature of the Hero's Quest. As with any good fantasy adventure (though 'Lord of the Rings' can be interpreted as a mythology of sorts), all characters within the story earn what they receive, and those that do evil get what they deserve."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Inevitably, after reading The Fellowship of the Ring, the natural reaction is to reach for The Two Towers. The second part of a classic trilogy, The Two Towers picks up exactly where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. With most of the main characters already established and the main focus of the journey identified, the truly exciting scenes begin to take place. The novel splits up into a pair of books that take the reader through two different adventures based on the now divided characters. The two books take place during the same time line, which I felt was a very interesting way to observe the storylines. Talking about all the amazing qualities of Two Towers might spoil your own experience, but if you are ready to read Two Towers, you are already have an idea of what type of brilliance lies ahead.The imagery laid forth by Tolkien is simply dazzling, he was a master of the written word and this book exemplifies as well as magnifies that fact.Full of excitement and adventure, this continuation of the quest to rid the world from the threat of evil takes the reader right through the heart of one of the most colorful, well known and amazing fantasy adventures of all-time. After being left breathless at the end of this one, the reader will take part in his or her own journey to get their hands on The Return of the King to finish out the trilogy. Simply Spectacular!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think this part of, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" is the grandest part and has an epic ambience to it. In particular, the ascension of Aragorn to the Throne of Gondor and the other events in the south of Middle-Earth are evocative of early Middle Ages (c. 1000 AD) both in the pomp and circumstance of the feasts and ceremonies and in the speech of the characters.Even though, \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" is my favorite part of the story there are certain sections of the part that stand out in my memory. The concluding chapters, which have a royal and somewhat majestic feel, are:The Field of CormallenThe Steward and the KingMany PartingsOne of the most famous chapters in, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" is, \\"The Scouring of the Shire,\\" where the four hobbits; Pippin, Merry, Frodo and Sam, return to the Shire (their homeland) after traveling around for over a year. Many have thought this chapter is some sort of comment on the effects of the industrial revolution on England; Tolkien has consistently denied that any events of the book are based on the real world.One of the most endearing qualities of that chapter is the fact that the brave four hobbits lead a rebellion against Men (who in addition to being twice the height of the average hobbit, are much stronger) and corrupt hobbits. This is such a change from, \\"The Hobbit,\\" and the depiction on the Shire in, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" where the hobbits merely worry about food and live their lives in ease. The fact that their homeland was touched and damaged by the War of the Ring surprises the hobbits; they always expected to come back to find it unchanged.Finally, the Elves, the oldest Race of Middle-Earth, depart and end the Third Age of the World. After the War and the departure of the Elves, the Fourth Age, the Age of Men begins. For those that are interested, there are several appendices at the end of this part that explains some of the background of the history, languages, characters and races of the novel.As for why I love the novel so much, it is difficult to pin it down exactly. The sense of a simpler world without so much technology and bureaucracy, with mysterious forces moving about to do great deeds is part of it. So much of modern fiction is so dreary or mundane, that a bit of fantasy is good. The sense that the novel is a feigned history, almost mythical, is another endearing quality of the book, for I have always enjoyed reading history.If you want to start reading, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" either buy a single volume or buy it in the three parts. The story is continuous and there are not breaks as such between the parts."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The title of Tolkien's third part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is both true and misleading. It points away from the heroism of the minor characters who carry all three parts of the Ring Saga, and it points to the tragic nature of the heroic epic. The dark and hopeless tone of the first two parts of the novel are fully realized and brought to a bright, if overcast conclusion in &quot;The Return of the King.&quot; Despite my bleak overview, the plot and characters are still masterfully rendered as the epic concludes.&quot;The Return of the King&quot; begins, as does its predecessor, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with everything in chaos. Here, the Fellowship of the Ring is further fractured - Merry departs with the newly-resuscitated wizard Gandalf for the beseiged fortress of Minas Tirith (the primary fortress of Gondor) to rejoin the valiant Pippin; Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and the Riders of Rohan pursue supernal aid on the Paths of the Dead; meanwhile, Sam faces despair as Frodo is borne away by a band of Orcs out of the dark maze of Cirith Ungol. Tolkien's plotting is fantastic, even Dickensian, as characters separate, reunite, and coincidences and chance govern the fate of Middle-earth. The action of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; involves Gandalf and Aragorn's attempts to stave off the elimination of their patchwork defense at the hands of Sauron, desperately trying to buy time for Frodo to complete his mission.Unfortunately, for me, the intensity of the denouement necessitates Tolkien to privilege, in the main, plot over character development in &quot;The Return of the King.&quot; Where character does govern the story, as with the first two parts of the Ring Saga, minor characters manage to take precedence over the huge scale of the action in which they move. In this context, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; belongs to two little hobbits, virtually overlooked by everyone in the novel, Merry and Sam - their efforts and concerns make them the most human and fully-realized characters in the third part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;The legacy of &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; is just that - the title - the consolidation of power by Men - as the final confrontations between the forces of good and evil envelop dwarves, elves, and hobbits alike, Men begin to assume a place of leadership and control. Herein is the melancholy of the Ring Saga and of part three in particular - this is what Tolkien offers his readers, 50 years after the epic was first published. As important to-day as it was in the aftermath of World War II, what do we of the 'race of Men' do to make our world habitable? Tolkien's final installment of the Ring Saga implores us, the legatees of a fictional, fantasy world to act, as rather ordinary human beings, to be welcoming and hospitable to each other in this Dark Age; to reconcile our differences and somehow find lasting peace. Whether we are judged as Gandalf or Saruman, as Sam or Gollum is in our hands. It is a heavy burden, but one which Tolkien asks us to embrace."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is one of the best novels I have ever read. This novel is so intense I could feel heart pounding. At the end of book five, where Tolkien returns to Sam and Frodo's journey, I could not put the book down. I read the remainder of the novel that day. Suspense keeps building and building until the very end. I actually find the ending to be sad. The final pages and parts and appendix seem very sad to me. I think the appedix is well worth reading.The story of Gandalf and Pippen sets the stage for the battle before Minas Tirith. The Witch King of Angmar leads his forces to destroy the White City while the men of Umbar sail against the Pelagir. When all seems hopeless, the Riders of Rohan arrive, and Aragorn walks the Path of the Dead. Sam and Frodo travel through Mordor even as the last battle is nearing its beginning. The Nazgul fly from battle as the ring nears its destruction. Will Frodo and Sam finish their quest? The suspense is staggering.The Return of the King is amazing, but if you wish to learn more of Middle Earth, of Beren and Luthien, and of Feanor, read not only the Return of the King, but the Silmarillion as well."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Loved it, the illustrations are like pieces of art!

This book shows that the struggle between good and evil will only end when the mind of the master has run out of words to express it in. I thought that the book began a little slow. When Gondor is preparing for the battle of Pelennor Fields and when the Rohirrim are gathering to go and help Gondor. Also when Aragon is going to raise the Army of the Dead. It begins to pickup when the battle of Pelennor Fields begins. The end of this part of the book happens when they decide to attack the Black Gate to give Frodo and Sam more time to reach Mount Doom and destroy the ring. Then the second part begins while Sam is trying to rescue Frodo from the orcs in The Tower of Cirith Ungol. Then it goes on to conclude Frodo and Sam's Journey across Middle Earth. It also tells of their final battle with Sm&eacute;agol. It then goes on to tell you of the conclusion of the battle before the Back Gate. Then it sums up the end of the story the crowing of Aragon, the return journeys of everyone and the fate of the Shire and how the world has changed. The only thing wrong with this book is that it ends and leaves nothing for a sequel to be made from. All in all I would have to say that I enjoyed the book very much and will read it many more times and enjoy it very much. I would like to thank Mr. J.R.R. Tolkien for this masterpiece in the literary world."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book.

This really is the flagship of LOTR audio recordings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"this is the second book to the lord of the rings. this is a phenomenal series. this is an awesome book. sometimes hard to get into but really good. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second volume of the Lord of the Rings, and like the first, it's divided into two \\"books.\\" Spoilers for the next five paragraphs.The first book covers the further splintering of the fellowship, as Merry and Pippin are carried off by a band of orcs, which have just killed the warrior Boromir. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas pursue them towards Isenguard, but soon discover that all the orcs were killed by the horsemen of Rohan, and the hobbits escaped into Fangorn. They pursue them, but eventually, find Gandalf; alive and dressed in white, who tells them that the hobbits will be fine.Indeed, Merry and Pippin are alright; having befriended a monstrous tree-being named Treebeard; leader of the ents. Soon, the ents are going to war with the wizard Saruman, who sent the orcs into their land.Gandalf and the others, however, travel to Rohan to muster their horsemen against Saruman's remaining forces. There's a battle at Helm's Deep, and a confrontation with the wizard Saruman himself to endure, but ultimately, it's only a foretaste of the tremendous conflict to come; with Sauron, and Mordor.The second book of the Two Towers chronicles the journey of Frodo and Sam across the lands outside of Mordor; the cliffs, the marshes, and the crossroads, where after discovering that traveling through the black gate isn't an option, they meet the Gondor captain Faramir. He finds out about the ring, but refuses to try to claim it, or take it back to Gondor with him. Instead, he lets the hobbits go on their way again, towards Cirith Ungol; where a tremendous spider lays in wait for them.Over the course of this book, the hobbits meet and befriend Gollum, who, for a while, guides them towards Mordor, but ultimately betrays them in the hopes of getting the ring back. The book ends with a climactic fight between the giant spider Shelob and Sam; struggling to protect the life of his best friend Frodo.The themes of good and evil are perhaps a bit less pronounced during the Saruman arc, but not by much. It's pretty clear that he's the bad guy from the start, and this story delves much more into the specific things that evil does to a person who was once good. The face-off scene between Saruman and Gandalf is, in my opinion, quite possibly the most complex and magnificent scene in the entire book; showcasing the true differences between the two, and the difference between minds accustomed to good, and to evil.I also found the first book just a bit more exciting than its predecessors, though I won't say it was perfect. The parts with Treebeard moved rather slowly, and at times, it became difficult to tell who was responsible for what evils. I also found the ents just a tiny bit threatening; not in terms of being scarey, but because they reminded me of modern naturalists.Still, even on those terms, anyone trying to use ents as an analogy for naturalism would be basically shooting themselves in the foot, because there's no serious comparison of the sort that could be made. Ents are intelligent, and trees aren't. If trees were intelligent, they too would have civil rights, and naturalists would be out of a job.I also feel I should say a few words about the battle at Helm's Deep. I really enjoyed reading it, and liked the way it was resolved. In fact, I'm sort of not sure which I like better; the movie version or the book version, and up to now, I've liked the movie version of most Tolkien battles better. Maybe it's just that this is the first battle he actually took time to dwell on and describe.As for the second book, I honestly think that it's the best I've read so far, out of the first four. It has tension, which doesn't really let up at any point during it, and the final battle against Shelob is one of the best in the book series. I was also very impressed with the strong relationships between the characters of Frodo and Sam, and the constant development of the character of Gollum throughout the book. His character in particular is both amusing (at times) and also an interesting illustration of what happens to a person mired in, and addicted to grave evil; how they develop when shown kindness, and how easily they betray when tempted again.I found Faramir to be an interesting character, in a sense, although many of Tolkien's human characters seem to ring a bit hollow to me, perhaps because I personally prefer stories of the fantastic, while he seems enamored with humans (a major thread in LOTR, at any rate, though less in the movies than in the books.) Faramir doesn't really suffer from this, however, because he has the chance to develop relationships with Frodo, Sam and Gollum, and to show what kind of man he is by the choices he makes. Because all this effort was put into him, I find him to be a well fleshed-out character, and a boon to this book, rather than a drag.On the whole, I was very pleased with this book, and like the others, I reccomend it to those with patience and good reading skills. It was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"When I read the first two books and the hobbit I was immensely impressed with the greatness of these novels. But I must say, The Return of the King blew them out of the water, into the air, and flopped them up on shore. The pure literary beauty of this book is stunning. There were several parts in this book where I was covered in chill bumps and and at other times I was close to tears. At Mount Doom when the ring was destroyed and Frodo says to Sam, \\"I'm glad I'm here with you at the end of all things, Sam.\\" It was an emotional roller coaster. Plus the book has a whole chapter that is left out in the movie. So if you think that you know Middle Earth by just seeing the movies you are wrong!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"OK, first of all, \\"The Return of the King\\" is not a stand-alone book. It is the third book in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. And, since that is the case, you should not read it until you have first completed \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers.\\" These books were written as one seamless story by JRR Tolkien, but the manuscript was deemed to long to publish in one volume, so it was originally released as three separate books...and they read that way. The first book ends abruptly, and the second one begins the same way...through the end of \\"The Return of the King.\\" While I'm sure they could be released in one volume, tradition as seen them continuing to be released as three separate books.Another thing you should know about \\"The Return of the King\\" is that this book is noted to be about 550pp long, but the story ends efore you reash page 400. The remaining pages in this volume contain appendices that will be of interst to the more devoted Tolkien fan. Those appendices include the family history and lineages of several of the main characters in the story, some background of Aragorn and Arwen, and similar selections of background material.This is a satisfying conclusion to the longer tale.The main story of the trilogy sees growing darkness and treachery reaching out of Mordor and into the free and happy lands of western Middle Earth followed by the first blows in the battle for control of Middle earth, and finally, the resoluton of the confrontation between good and evil, light and darkness.Some readers may complain that the end is somewhat anticlimactic after the events of the main battle and resolution of the story, but I prefer to view the conclusion of the book as the calm after a storm: a time when people begin to realize the significance of events that have passed and start to adjust to their new reality.I have read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy at least a dozen times, more often in my youth than in recent years, but every time I embark on this literary journey I know that I will be swept away into Middle Earth -- a land that on the one hand presents honor, boldness, faith, and truth, and on the other hand falls to fear, lies, deceit, and evil.This is a classic tale of adventure, battle, romance (a bit), and the significance that even the smallest participant can make.A fine book for readers of ALL ages.5 stars! Thank you Tolkien! Thank you for the adventure!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am not a dedicated \\"fantasy literature\\" fan, but I've been a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fan since I was in college (er...back in the late 1970s - OK, I've dated myself). Anyway, I still remember getting to the end of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (a book assigned in a Reading Lit class), and being left hanging as the fellowship was broken. I finished that book one evening, and I couldn't wait to get to the bookstore the next day to pick up a copy of \\"The Two Towers\\"...which I then proceeded to devour.I've read this entire series several times since those heady college days, and the Lord of the Rings (trilogy) remains one of my favorite stories.What should you know about \\"The Two Towers\\" if you are thinking about picking up a copy?1) Make sure that you buy not only this book, but the other two books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the RingsThe Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings)2) Each of the books in the trilogy do not stand alone. You need to not only read all three, but you need to read them in order. Tolkien wrote the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as one cohesive story, but because of the length of the story it was published in three volumes. The first two books end abruptly, and the story picks right up in each of the following volumes...so you'll want to have all three handy when you start reading.3) The writing and imagery is crisp and vivid. The world Tolkien created and the people and other creatures that live there will draw you in.4) I prefer to read this book in a quiet, somewhat dimly lit room...it adds to the atmosphere.5) There is no foul language in these books. They are a pleasure to read.6) These books work well for readers of many ages - I actually read all of these books to my children when they were still in their elementary school years (years before the movies were produced). They remain favorites of some of my children and got them started on their own adventures in reading.This series is certainly in my top-10 list of books, and depending on the day, almost always falls out near the top of that list.This is not a book to be missed.5 stars, no doubt and no mistake!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the sequel to J.R.R.

Tolkien. This book is the last chapter in the trilogies that is recognized world-wide. The book is entertaining because it has lots of imagery, excitement and foreshadowing, which made it much more exciting then the movie. It had many messages and underlying meanings that added depth and intelligence to the reading, which kept me more involved in the story then the movie. I would rate the book a 4.5 out of 5 stars because the ending was a cliff hanger. I was disappointed that the conclusion did not finalize the series, since this was the last book of the series.This book took place in the Third Age of Middle Earth. Being that it is the third book in the series it starts at the point of Frodo continuing his journey to Mordor. He is still trying to take the One Ring to where it was created in order to stop the antagonist Sauron from regaining his physical form and conquering all of Middle Earth. The first chapter starts with Merry riding with Gandalf on the back of Shadowfax who was charging towards Minas Tirith for the purpose of meeting the Steward of the city. Why is this important? This is important because they needed to notify him that his son was killed after getting hit with seven arrows.There were many main characters, but Frodo, Sam, Gollum, and Sauron in my mind, were some of the most significant characters. Frodo and Sam were protagonists in the story, because they were trying to save the good on Middle Earth. Frodo's responsibility was to carry the One Ring to Mt. Doom in order to toss it in the lava where it was created so that it could be destroyed which would mean that he saved the Middle Earth. By doing this, it would cause Sauron to be weakened beyond recovery. Sauron, who was the main antagonist, was trying to rule the Middle Earth. Sam chose to follow Frodo and assist him in accomplishing this task. Gollum was a trickster; he was another antagonist who wanted the One Ring in order to satisfy greed. Gollum was the navigator around the lands of the east. Gollum was controlled by the One Ring, which made him strangle his best friend, because the One Ring wanted to be found and taken to Sauron. The One Ring took Gollum and twisted him into an evil rotten character with two personalities. He would talk to himself, by looking at his reflection in water. Some people would say that Aragorn and Gandalf would be considered the main characters because they led the attack on the Black Gate of Mordor to distract the Eye of Sauron from spotting Frodo and Sam who were making their way to Mt. Doom. Also, Merry and Pippin followers of Denethor steward of Minas Tirith and Theoden lord of the Mark were key characters because their journey helped to move the story through the different episodes of the book. I also see the One Ring as a character in its own right, it can control others, has much power, and there was a poem written about it in the book that stated, \\"One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to take them into the darkness and bind them.\\" As you can see there are lots of characters that play very important parts to help the story lines in the book.Many conflicts during the plot of the book took place. Some were more significant then others, but all played an important role in moving the story towards the climate. The Battle of the Black Gate of Mordor caught my attention as a reader because it established a distraction as Aragorn and Gandalf tried to distract the Eye of Sauron from spotting Frodo and Sam who were making their way to Mt. Doom. At the same time in the book, Frodo and Sam were having adventures as they scurried toward destroying the One Ring. Another conflict was when the forces of Mordor attacked Minas Tirith, they came by land and sea. These antagonists were made up of Orks and trolls from Minas Morgal, and Corsairs of Umbar. They came to over throw the city of Minas Tirith, but found it too difficult to do so, as the soldiers of Minas Tirith were well prepared for the attack. Aragorn and Gandalf were at this battle and this meant that they were unable to support Frodo and Sam in their current position. The next major conflict was between Eyomer, who was a female warrior and the Witch King. This duel was important because if the Witch King, who was the leader of the Nazgl, was destroyed so would his nine other followers. The Witch King was trying to kill Gandalf and Aragorn which would have made it easy for Sauron to spot Frodo and Sam. Fortunately, Eyomer was able to kill the Witch King by stabbing him in the face even though he has boasted about winning when he said, \\"No man can defeat me.\\" The most important continuing conflict throughout the book was the temptation that Frodo and Gollum shared, because they both wanted control of The One Ring. The One Ring had power over both of the weak minded men; they wanted to keep the ring under their possession. Even though Frodo knew in his heart he had to prevail over this power and throw it into the lava. The ring's power was more then either could overcome. The two men battled each other trying to gain control of the ring, Gollum bit off Frodo's finger and the ring fell into the lava. Gollum jumped into the lava after it and melted. Then the land of Mordor began to crumble under their feet and Frodo realized that he had accomplished his long time mission of destroying Sauron by the melting of The One Ring.The book as compared to the movie described more details of the characters' journeys and episodes. The one thing I really liked were the lines of dialogue because of the type of words the characters used. Overall, I liked the book a lot and I would recommend it to everyone who likes fantasy.Sage Bittner"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings needs no review by me. It is what it is, a timeless classic. This edition is a very high quality paperback, and a big enough format that the book is easy and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I recently reviewed Recorded Books Incorporated's unabridged rendition of Fellowship of the Ring. I return now to review the second installment of the trilogy, The Two Towers. The Two Towers pics up right where Fellowship left off. Frodo and Sam have left to find a way into Mordor, while Merri and Pippin have gone in search of them. Aragorn, drawn away from his search for Frodo by the urgent call of Boromir's horn, finds the man mortally wounded in a clearing, surrounded by the bodies of many Orcs. With his last breath, Boromir confesses his attempt to take the ring from Frodo and warns that Pippin and Merri have been captured by the Orcs. After a simple ceremony in which the body of Boromir is laid to rest in one of the three Elven-made boats in which they travelled and sent down the river to the falls of Rauros, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimley resolve to hunt down the Orcs and rescue the captive Hobbits.Thus begins the second installment of Lord of the Rings. As before Rob Englis delivers a top notch performance. He continues his trend of actually singing the songs in his good tenor rather than just reciting them as other narrators have done. He portrays each new character very well as far as I'm concerned, which makes for a great listen.

Well, by the time \\"The Two Towers\\" starts, the ball is rolling, and fast.I was weary about the decision to split the book into two halves, one half dealing with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, and the other half dealing with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, because I thought it might have been a wiser decision to mix it up a bit; have one chapter deal with Aragorn and company, the next with Frodo and company, and so on. However, the way it is set up is probably for the better. Each half read very well, advancing this classic story in big ways.Again, as I mentioned in my review for \\"Fellowship,\\" Tolkien's work isn't for the impatient reader. His beefy sentences demand that you comb through them, soaking in the language and appreciating the intensely thought-out sub-creation of Tolkien's Middle-earth. Thing is, that kind of writing isn't for everyone. I've read pompous reviewers insulting those who don't appreciate Tolkien's style, but the \\"get on with the story, Tolkien\\" complaints are not without merit. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Two Towers\\" and consider the overall arc ofThe Lord of the Ringsto be a classic and timeless story, but the style of writing can, at times, grate against one's patience.So I'll end my review for this book by including something I said in my review for \\"Fellowship,\\" which very much applies here: \\"Pour a cup of tea. Heck, sit it on a tea cozy. Turn off your phone, and absorb the writing. Visualize the mountains, rivers, all of the scenery. Feel what is happening, don't just read it. True, there is a lot of back story that could have been taken out, but it wasn't. So deal, and read it--most of it, if not all, is interesting.\\"PS: The character arc of Gollum (and his dialogue!) alone is worth reading this book.

It starts when Aragorn(Strider) Legolas and Gimli are alone in the wood, and mourn for their recently lost friend, Boromir. Frodo and Sam have departed the fellowship, and are climbing the Emyn Muil, a cliff, followed by Smeagol-Gollum, the slimy creature enchanted by his 'precious', and is tamed by Frodo and Sam.

There is much more in the story, but if you want to know, read the story, and be enchanted by it's great spell."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Now divided &amp; separated, the surviving members of the fellowship continued on with their individual missions. More characters were introduced (good &amp; bad alike) &amp; more actions were seen on the first half of the book - what with the battle of Orthanc. The second half was quite slow &amp; focused on Frodo &amp; Sam's search of the Tower. What made it a little exciting was the continuous suspicion they had on their newly found ally (GUESS WHO!). I think the saving grace of the second half was its ending (here, I will not divulge any further) which promised a very exciting start for the subsequent book - The Return of the King.I suggest you immediately proceed reading the sequel once you finish this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is very good like the 1st novel, the action and story are top rate, how ever after a while there were so many names of characters to remember. I would often to turn back the pages and even consult an online glossary to keep me in the loop as to who they were. Definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was written with a lot of thought and detail. Each chapter brings you closer to Mordor and the end. I enjoyed the way that Tolkin divided the book into sections, first your on a rescue mission to find Merry and Pippen, only to find out that they can take care of themselves just fine. And then your heading out with Sam and Frodo on a quest to destroy the ring. I enjoyed meeting the new characters like Theoden and Eomer, I didn't really like Eowyn though, she just didn't get through to me. I especailly liked meeting the brother of Boromir and learning more about his past and the people of Gondor. I have read the last book and the character of Faramir and Boromir's father shows through and you begin to see why they were as they were. I also really enjoyed the old characters of Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn. The ending of this book will leave you needing more, thereby forcing you to run out and buy the last one where everything comes to a wonderful close."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"At the end of Fellowship of the Rings, Frodo and Sam have left the fellowship to destroy the ring in Mordor but what happens after that. Divided into two books, (one for Aragorn, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Gimli and everyone else. And one for Sam and Frodo) this story answers that question. The first book (and my preferred part) tells about how Merry and Pippin are captured by Orcs. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must rescue them before it's too late, friends and enemies on the way. But when they reunite with an old friend they learn that they must help to defeat the evil dark wizard Saruman.The second book follows Sam and Frodo on their long journey to destroy the ring. Frodo is weakening slowly under the rings weight and needs help if he wants to finish his quest. But when he receives that help in the shape of Gollum, a dark creature who is more or less a slave to the ring (his \\"precious\\") Sam is less sure than Frodo to accept his help. Gollum may seem harmless but what plans does he have for the two young hobbits? Is he being a faithful guide or leading them into danger?I really enjoyed this book. In my opinion it was even better than the last. The first volume of this book was my favorite due to the extensive presence of my favorite character Aragorn and the creating of a new kind of friend called the Ents. This book was well written and the characters drawn wonderfully. I can't wait to read the next and final book in the trilogy. Just like the last one the end leaves you with quite a cliff hanger."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As the sequel of The Fellowship of the Ring and part two of The Lord of the Rings, this is definetley a page-turner. The strength of Isengard while Saruaman is ruling it has become so great that the great Men of Gondor dont think they have much hope without help. In this amazing book the friendship of the Fellowship and the loyalty that Sam has for Frodo is definetley tested. Gollum is playing a big part in this book also, being Frodo and Sam's guide through the Nameless Land.These hobbits have overcome so much that that as Sam puts it, \\"they should write a song about our adventures\\". This is a wonderful, awe-striking book. READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Perhaps the most accessible of all the Tolkein books, THE TWO TOWERS is the quickest read in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.It is a tale told at a brisk pace, and it is primarily an adventurous narrative with less of the historical 'timeouts' that occasionally plague Tolkein works. Boromir is gone, leaving Merry and Pippin in the hands of the marauding Orc army. They escape, and, with the help of Treebeard, they manage to find their way back to the center thread of the story ... rejoining Gandalf (back from the dead in stellar form), Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in their quest to save all Middle-Earth from the treachery of Sauron. In THE TWO TOWERS, we also see the strong emergence of Aragorn as the 'king figure,' as his heroism and derringdo at Helm's Deep captivates the reader for the better part of two chapters.A must-read for fans of fantasy and science fiction, THE TWO TOWERS shows what a gifted writer can achieve when he lets his imagination loose to wander the hillsides for awhile. Absolutely breathtaking."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE TWO TOWERS is the second part of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. As mentioned elsewhere, it is a shame that THE LORD OF THE RINGS was originally printed in three separate volumes except in the one whole that Tolkien intended because now we constantly have to refer to the three pieces of the whole distinctively. With that said, THE TWO TOWERS is a grand follow up of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.The book begins exactly where THE FELLOWSHIP ended, with Frodo and Sam setting forth together to fufill the grand quest and the remaining members of the fellowship left fighting orcs of Sauron and the Uruk-hai (that develish breeding of orcs and goblins) of Saruman. The book begins on a sour note with the fellowhip tearing asunder and the death of Boromir and ends even more dismal with the separation of Frodo and Sam and Frodo's capture. Nevertheless, there is a great amount of hope in THE TWO TOWERS. Treebeard and the Ents arise from a sleeping living to avenge themselves on their former friend and neighbor, Saruman, and the forces of good win a great victory at Helm's Deep.However, the best part of THE TWO TOWERS are the lessons of friendship, love, and loyalty that it contains. The novel begins with the fellowship torn asunder: Boromir is killed; Merry and Pippin are captured by orcs; and Frodo and Sam leave on their own. Aragorn makes a difficult decision; realizing that Frodo has made his own decision; and attempts a rescue of Merry and Pippin. He would have followed Frodo all the way to Mt. Doom but chose instead to help the companions that could least help themselves.Later in the novel and even greater act of love is displayed by Samwise Gamgee. No spoilers told, but Sam shows in THE TWO TOWERS that the Baggins aren't the only hobbits who can do great deeds (a lesson even illustrated more in THE RETURN OF THE KING by Merry and Pippin) and his devotion to Frodo is the stuff that true friendships are made. Even in the darkest hour things aren't as hopeless as they seem."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Two Towers,&quot; the second part of Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; delivers on the promise and potential of epic-scale action and adventure carried over from the cliffhanger ending of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot; With the dispersal of the Fellowship, Tolkien takes a different narrative tact in the second part of the Ring saga. The Fellowship now in three units - Frodo and Sam; Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas; Merry and Pippin - Tolkien deals with each unit separately, preferring for the sake of unity to relate the fortunes of each unit for long stretches. Herein is the great triumph of Part 2 - the development of character and involvement with each that the segmenting of the Fellowship allows. Here we get depth and feeling, along with high action and truly epic scope.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; begins with the aftermath of Boromir's attack on Frodo in an attempt to wrest the One Ring from him. The Fellowship disbands - Frodo and Sam leave to try to destroy the Ring on their own, Merry and Pippin try to find them, only to be captured by Orcs, and Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn attempt to track down Merry and Pippin. The apparently dead Gandalf reappears to the third party, stronger and more committed to the goal than ever. The split action of the novel, with regard to the title, concerns the ways that the members of the Fellowship deal with the major sources of crisis facing Middle-earth: the ambitious wizard Saruman at the Tower of Orthanc in Isengard and the Dark Lord, Sauron at the Tower of Barad-dur in Mordor.One cannot get too excited about the virtues of &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; The relationships between the characters are so finely rendered - for my part, the job that Tolkien does in developing Merry, Pippin, Gimli, and Legolas is magical in itself. Merry and Pippin are underestimated and undervalued by everyone, including themselves. The illumination and discussions of their doubts, fears, and modest desires against the spectacular backdrop of millennial conflict is so understated, that the two hobbits actually bring a sense of prosaic normalcy to Tolkien's epic fantasy. Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf, members of long-antagonized peoples, thrust together by the common goal of the Fellowship, is another fascinating pairing. The contrast in their characters and the process by which they become bosom friends is lovely to behold and offers one of the great homosocial relationships I've encountered in English literature. In both cases, throughout &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; Tolkien continually privileges the individual over the national, an approach which forces war and conflict to appear as it should, as an unnatural and horrific evil in the world.The minor characters add colour and vibrant life to &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; Good characters, like the melancholy Ents; evil characters, like the eternally-infighting Orcs; and ambivalent characters, like Wormtongue and Smeagol - all contribute to the development of the primary characters, while Tolkien carefully allows these minor figures the dignity of their own histories, actions, conversations, and fleshing out. All of this adds to the complexity of the Ring saga and shows more of the intricate social and even ecological effects that the anticipated War of the Ring will have on Middle-earth.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is literally and figuratively the heart of the Ring saga. Rich in content, detail, and action, here, Tolkien's epic vision is most fully realized. Choice is a major theme of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a whole, and, again, in the many individual, minute choices made by the characters throughout Part 2, Tolkien allows us to see how the fate of people and nations can hang on the most seemingly insignificant choices. In the scope of an epic, Tolkien stresses the importance of the individual and of tolerance and patient judgment in decision making. Overall, my favourite of the three parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In an epic conclusion to the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Return of the King seizes you by the hand and guides you on a mystical journey filled with laughter, sadness, courage and some of the best descriptions ever in a book.As the hobbits Frodo and Sam continue their treacherous journey deep into the foul land of Mordor, their fellow members of the fellowship (of the ring) hasten to aid Minas Tirith, Gondor's chief city and defense against Mordor, from the bound to be invasion by Sauron, the evil Dark Lord of Mordor.Fate seems inevitable for Middle-earth, with Frodo and Sam being the last hope; to destroy the \\"one\\" ring of Sauron's power. To do this they must reach the heart of Morder, Mount Doom, and destroy the ring in the awesome \\"furnace\\" that once had created it, though the closer they get, the more powerful the ring becomes and Frodo's will starts to break down. Frodo and Sam must be wary of their furtive guide Gollum, who is the only one available through which they can find their way.Back in Gondor, things are looking very bleak until Aragorn, the newfound king, returns with an undead army to re-conquer Minas Tirith from Mordor's wicked army. In a last ditch effort to reach Mount Doom, Frodo and Sam stagger to the imposing mountain past orcs, Gollum who betrayed them, and numerous other hurdles in their quest. Gollum plays a vital role in the destruction of the ring in the end, and Sauron falls.In his third book of the series, Tolkien wonderfully concludes this magnificent story of fantasy and wonder. This is a very well written book, and I strongly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I listen to a lot of books on tape. Every once in a while I come across a narrator who is perfectly suited to the work. I don't mean a narrarator who has a good voice, I mean a narrator whose voice brings the story alive. Rob Inglis is such a narrator in all three books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Each character is clearly identifiable by his uncanny ability produce dozens of distinct voices. I've listened to other audio versions of Tolkien's works. Those narrarated by Rob Inglis are the only ones that I've found worth the purchase."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Return of The King', by JRR Tolkien is the continuing adventures of the remaining members of the Fellowship as they draw together to meet the coming of the War of the Ring.

Yet even as those in Minas Tirith struggle to surviv, and Rohan musters for war, Frodo and Sam draw closer and closer to the end of the journey.

There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is an amazing credit to all literature everywhere. The style that Tolkien uses is astounding in detail thus making you feel almost part of this epic adventure. With the twists and turns that heroes take to proceed onward through their journeys. It is astounding how he makes it able to fallow the path of multiple characters at the same time yet keep it from becoming to confusing. The way words are placed in each sentence with extreme care as not to make the plot line any more confusing is very well done, this makes the story well written and an amazing novel. The lord of the rings: the two towers sucks the reader into it's plot and keeps them there until the book is done. This is one of the few books that has actually kept my attention all the way through the book not letting me put it down by any means. The flow of the book makes you want to become one of the races of middle earth and take on the roll as one of the adventurers to fight the evil forces of Mordor and cast away the ring of power. This book is the second one in the trilogy of The Lord of the rings and is the best written of the three. The two towers helps define the meaning of and epic adventure through the hardships and challenges that the characters must face the complete their task at hand and the internal conflicts within them selves."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second installment in teh LOTR trilogy is without a doubt my favorite. Particularly the first part of the book in which Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas track down Merry and Pippin, and the Ents awake to defeat Saruman's orcish forces. This is just top notch fantasy that doesn't slow down much at all from cover to cover, keeping the reader turning pages.While I liked the first movie maybe a little more than the first book, I thought the second book was better than the movie. There are lots of good parts in the book that are left out (Faramir and the elaphaunt) or just changed completely (Sam's use of the ring of power) that change the overall feel of the story in a way that takes away from some of its attactivness. I was actually surprised to find just how much liberty the makers of the movie took in altering the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this trilogy focusing on medieval ages and sorcery,the fellowship has one final battle against Saruman and his massive orc army.Can Aragon,Gimli,and Legolas fend off Saruman's army,while Frodo and Sam,led by Golem,have one final chance to get the ring in Mount Doom,and find out if Golem really has a good side or not?If you like action as much as I do than this is the book for you.It is adventurous as it gets.

In the attack, Boromir is slain and the hobbits Pippin and Merry are taken captive. The other two hobbits, Frodo the ring bearer and Samwise his trusty servant, leave during the attack on a quest to destroy the evil Ring of Power in the feared land of Mordor. The remaining members of the fellowship Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli begin their chase of the orcs to save the captured Pippin and Merry. While Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were hunting the orcs, Frodo and Sam find an unlikely guide who takes them to the gates of Mordor and beyond. Frodo and Sam meet untold perils on their trek to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli take part in an epic battle that leads to a turning point in the war against Sauron, and begins Pippin and Merry on their road to fame and glory.I recommend this book to people who like action, drama and fantsy. Before you read this book you should read two other books written by J.R.R. Tolkien. These are \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", the prologue and first book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, respectively.

The reader meets many new characters, including the Ents and the Riders of Rohan. The Two Towers is about the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. If the dark lord Sauron gets the Ring, all of Middle-earth will be destroyed. The broken fellowship now insists of three groups: Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli, Merry and Pippen, and Frodo and Sam. The novel starts with the death of Boromir, who was taken over by the Ring. Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli immediately set out to find Merry and Pippen. Merry and Pippen have been captured by the enemy and must be rescued. Thisbegins The Two Towers, with many more adventures to come. The Two Towers is a must-read for anyone who likes fantasy and adventure. There are no weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the novel very much. The beginning starts out slow, but things speed up quickly.

The story dives deeper and deeper into hell by putting our heros into the most dreadful positions. Eventually the get brought out through fighting for there lives. I will probibly read this over as there is just so much to absorb . Beautifully developed and wonderfully woven. The first part dives into the battle for Gondor and it is dark.

Eventually Gollum flees in fright of Boromir's brother. Frodo and Sam however stay and get great provisions from him. Then they move on and run into danger witch leads Frodo and Sam to be separated.I have enjoyed the trills of the first two books in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series. I am sure to read the final book soon. Even if you do not enjoy the science fiction genre I still recommend this book. It is a great read and always keeps you interested."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" opens with the dispersal of the Fellowship Of The Ring. Boromir, eldest son of the Steward of Gondor, is killed by marauding Orcs intent on capturing Merry and Pippin. In a sense, his heroic death is an act of redemption on his part, after trying to seize the Ring from Frodo. Merry and Pippin are carried off by these Orcs, servants of the corrupt wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas begin their trek towards Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, hoping to overtake Saruman's Orcs. And Frodo and Samwise proceed towards Mordor and Mount Doom.This second installment of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" is in two parts; the first deals with the exploits of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The second recounts Frodo's and Samwise's perilous journey to Mordor. Without a doubt, this is the most character driven installment of the entire \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" saga. Without giving away the plot, the book is an insightful survey of the main characters and their motivations. Suffice it to say that their interactions amongst themselves as well as with important minor characters such as Fangorn, the chief of the Ents, play an important part in determining the outcome of the war of the Ring.Much of Tolkien's best writing can be found in this book. I found \\"The Two Towers\\" as engrossing as either \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\" or \\"The Return Of The King\\", the third book in the trilogy. Incidentally, \\"The Two Towers\\" refers to Saruman's tower, Orthanc, at Isengard, and the Dark Lord Sauron's tower in Mordor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I was blown away by the excitement and thrills that kept you wanting to turn the page over and over.

The plot keeps you &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; and is filled with wonderment. I strongly reccomend this book to all who havent read it yet, it is a must."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Fantasy tales have long been recognized for their tales of magic, mythical creatures, and far-off lands of make-believe. Magical rings have often been used in such tales of magic to provide an intriguing source of magic and mystery. Most of these rings play important roles in the stories they are found in. Howerver, there is one magical ring whose significance far exceeds the importance of any other magical ring in any other fantasy story so much that it causes an entire trilogy to evolve around it. This ring is known as the Ring of Power. The continuing story of this magical ring and its bearer, Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit of the Shire, is told the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers. The Lord of the Rings tells of the adventures of Frodo Baggins in his quest to destroy the Ring of Power. In the land of Middle-Earth, the trilogy's setting, Frodo, along with his friend, Samwise Gamgee, must take the fated voyage to the land of Mordor. When the two travelling hobbits cross paths with a villain who is having second thoughts about his villainous ways, they must decide how they will get to Mordor. Now it is up to Frodo to decide whether or not it is worth placing the entire fate of Middle-Earth into the hands of a creature that was once a member of the enemy. While reading this book I found myself totally absorbed in the story. In this sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien once again uses vivid descriptions of people, places, battles, and thoughts to captivate his readers. Be it a character or a plain old rock, Tolkien takes the time to describe every detail. Tolkien has written the book so that there is never a dull moment in the story. The battles are so real that the reader feels that they are in the middle of the action. These are only a few of the qualities that made J.R.R. Tolkien such a great author. What lies ahead for Frodo on his journey to Mordor? Frodo and Sam both know that people who achieve something great are remembered in songs. If Frodo can accomplish this task, he could possibly be the subject of a song that will live longer than time itself. How could such a small creature like Frodo accomplish the single greatest challenge that all of Middle-Earth has ever seen? Only time will tell."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers consists of the second part of three in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Itis about a group of people and their quest to destroy the source of all evil in Middle-Earth.At the beginning of the story, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are searching for Pippin andMerry. They find them living with Ents (very big, strong, talking, walking, trees). Theyand the Ents fight a bloody battle with orcs. The action then turns to Frodo and Sam whoseparated from the \\"Fellowship\\". They are led by Gollum to Mordor, where they areattacked by a giant spider. The rest is a mystery for you until you read the book foryourself!One of my Favorite quotes in this story occurs when Gandalf, Aragorn, and therest, find Saruman in his tower and call him out for a chat. \\"Have we ridden fourth tovictory, only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with honey on his forked tongue? Sowould the trapped hound speak to the hounds, if he could.\\" This describes Saruman, avery evil man, trying to sweet-talk his way out of a jam. As you read The Two Towersyou find many unique quotes like this one. It is one of the reasons that I like the book.I would recomed this book to a patient reader who doesn't need non-stop action,and likes vivid descriptions. The author takes so much time describing the events in acertain scene that not many events really take place in the course of the story. This book,and the whole trilogy for that matter, is perfect for someone who enjoys fantasy and usingyour imagination."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is my all time favorite book in the world! This book made me laugh, cry, and really make me think about how amazing the author J.R.R. tolkein is. The stor is a fantasic conclusion to the Lord of the Rings series. The emotion that it has in it is incredible. The plot is amazing with the characters from the past books and some new ones introduced. Tha battles and action are the best and most complete that I have ever read. This book is a must have and the thing is just to hard for me to explain right now. but I can say this. The Lord of the Rings rule!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I became interested in the trilogy when my brother Chris made me read &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; Though many people skip the prequel to the trilogy, it certainly helped me to connect things to all 3 books of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; It took me a total of 5 months to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King.&quot; I loved all of the books, but my all time favorite was &quot;The Return of the King.&quot; I love Aragorn, and this was his book -- well, a part of it was. The first half of the book was a little emotional, but it was worth it. When I finished the book, I was almost torn apart. The ending totally surprised me, not only because it wasn't something that could have been predicted, but because these wonderful characters: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, and Gimli, were ripped away from me. They were my family for 5 months, and now they were gone with not another word. Though saying goodbye to the Trilogy was hard, I would never ever go back on those 5 wonderful months and not read the books. Especially since it's summertime, this is a great time to read these books. A little part of me still believes these wonderful characters are with me, and will never go away."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What is there not to like of J.R.R. Tokien books? It is lots of fun, plenty of adventure, action, battles, humor, hobbits, men, elves, dwarves, et., etc., etc.Book two of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, ends with Gandalf the Wizard and Pippin the hobbit traveling to Minas Tirith. Also Frodo the Ring-bearing hobbit and his faithful friend, Sam, are separated in the land of Mordor, Frodo in the hands of the dreadful orcs.Now we go into book three, &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. It's up to Sam now to save his master Frodo. It's a good thing he has the Ring of Doom with him. When Sam finally is able to free Frodo, they must continue their quest to destroy the Ring, before the evil Sauron uses it to his own purposes, to cover all the lands with his Darkness. But Frodo is starting to weaken with the weight and power of the Ring. Will he be able to complete his quest? Meanwhile, King Theoden and his Rohan forces, along with Merry the hobbit, travel to Minas Tirith to help King Denethor fight off Sauron's forces of Men and Orcs. And Aragorn the Ranger (or is he...?), Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and the Rangers decide to go to Minas Tirith... by the Paths of Dead!A truly great conclustion to such a terrific series. J.R.R. Tolkien certainly made these books so interesting and realistic. You must read the Appendixes at the end of the book, it tells about all of the histories of Men, Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, and more. Also gives timelines of the 2nd Age, 3rd Age, and more.One of my most favorite characters is Legolas the Elf, one important reason is because he is an Elf. Somehow Elves have always fascinated and interested me, with their mysterious, quiet but strong ways. I love how he and Gimli the Dwarf are the best of friends and how they're always together and inseparable. I also love Pippin the Hobbit, he's so cheerful, kind, but always seems to always get into trouble! Also I think that Faramir the Prince is also a good character. Son of the King Denethor, in the eyes of his father is unworthy because he is compared with his brother, Boromir, who had been killed.I can't honestly say which of the three books in the trilogy is the best. I strongly recommend you read all of the books, including the prelude, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. I think that the J.R.R. Tolkiens are mostly for teenager and adults, since younger kids probably would find it a little too complicated and boring for them. Have fun reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy! You'll find it loads of fun and keep you in page-turning excitement!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In an epic conclusion to the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Return of the King seizes you by the hand and guides you on a mystical journey filled with laughter, sadness, courage and some of the best descriptions ever in a book.As the hobbits Frodo and Sam continue their treacherous journey deep into the foul land of Mordor, their fellow members of the fellowship (of the ring) hasten to aid Minas Tirith, Gondor's chief city and defense against Mordor, from the bound to be invasion by Sauron, the evil Dark Lord of Mordor.Fate seems inevitable for Middle-earth, with Frodo and Sam being the last hope; to destroy the \\"one\\" ring of Sauron's power. To do this they must reach the heart of Morder, Mount Doom, and destroy the ring in the awesome \\"furnace\\" that once had created it, though the closer they get, the more powerful the ring becomes and Frodo's will starts to break down. Frodo and Sam must be wary of their furtive guide Gollum, who is the only one available through which they can find their way.Back in Gondor, things are looking very bleak until Aragorn, the newfound king, returns with an undead army to re-conquer Minas Tirith from Mordor's wicked army. In a last ditch effort to reach Mount Doom, Frodo and Sam stagger to the imposing mountain past orcs, Gollum who betrayed them, and numerous other hurdles in their quest. Gollum plays a vital role in the destruction of the ring in the end, and Sauron falls.In his third book of the series, Tolkien wonderfully concludes this magnificent story of fantasy and wonder. This is a very well written book, and I strongly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I guess most of the people reading a review for this book must be LOTR fans; otherwise, why would they have bothered reading the first two? Keeping that in mind, I would say that &quot;Return of the King&quot; might be my favorite of the three. We are introduced to the land of Gondor, the last stronghold against the dark lord Sauron. There is naturally a great battle sequence in this book as the free peoples of the West defend the city of Minas Tirith from the winged Nazgul and Sauron's minions. We are introduced to some new characters, such as Denethor, the aging steward of Gondor, and the King of the Nazgul, who challenges Gandalf to a final dual. I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I do think it's interesting that the fate of the ring is decided with nearly one hundred pages left in the story. The remaining chapters are devoted to following up on the various characters, and Tolkien does this nicely. He does not leave any loose ends; Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Faramir, Eowyn, Arwen, Galadriel, Elrond, Bilbo, all of these characters are firmly situated at the end of the story. I also like how Tolkien follows the four hobbits back to the Shire, where they find out that things are not the same. He could have taken them on an amazing adventure and left it at that, but instead he lets them learn from their adventures to the benefit of the Shire. Although the outcome of the story is good, we are left feeling somewhat despondent, since the elves are departing and the &quot;third age&quot; is coming to an end. All in all, this trilogy is simply one of a kind; I don't think I'll ever again enjoy sci-fi or fantasy that doesn't bear the Tolkien label."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What happens when destiny breaks up the fellowship?You will find out when you read the Two Towers.In this second part, the deeds of all the members of the company after the Fellowship was broken, are told.Frodo and his inseperable Sam sneak away towards Mordor, while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas have to change their plans when they discover that Pippin and Merry have been kidnapped by orcs. These decisions that they make, take each character on its own path and the events that take place in this book really help in developing the complete tale.The whole story really takes shape in it. Loads of things start happening, and many different characters take center stage. There is a lot more action, and the plot takes a few unexpected twists.Unlike the first part (The Fellowship of the Ring), this second book actually does have a season finale ending! so make sure you have the Return of the King (3rd part) close by, because you will want to start reading it straight away!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Someone who has read and been enthralled by the first two volumes of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" might fear that J.R.R. Tolkien could not possibly have written an ending for his great fantasy epic that measures up to what has preceded it. Such a fear would be groundless. \\"The Return of the King\\" is a nearly perfect, fully satisfying conclusion to one of the best-loved stories of the twentieth century.Tolkien has been accused by some of not being good at character development, and yet by the time the reader reaches the opening chapters of \\"The Return of the King\\" he or she loves all the main characters of Tolkien's story and knows them as well as old friends. In my opinion, the explanation of this paradox is that Tolkien, in his presentation of his characters, is the antithesis of a writer like Charles Dickens (whose works I also love). The hobbits, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and the rest of Tolkien's cast of characters do not burst with exaggerated personality the instant we meet them, as do Pecksniff, Scrooge and Micawber. Their personalities are revealed to us slowly and steadily as they experience their adventures, so that we come to know them gradually, as we would come to know real people. A reader glancing at almost any individual page in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" might think Tolkien's characters are not very distinctive or strongly characterized, yet the cumulative effect of the whole long story is to fix an indelible impression of each character in our minds. This process is completed in \\"The Return of the King,\\" in which the characters -- especially the hobbits -- reveal new levels of heroism and wisdom previously unguessed-at.All the themes that Tolkien has raised in the first two installments of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" -- the horror of war balanced against the necessity of just war, the dilemma of capital punishment, the senselessness of environmental destruction, the reality of both evil and good, cruelty and heroism -- are resolved and clarified in \\"The Return of the King\\" in a profound, often heartbreaking, and entirely satisfying way. The marvelous, complicated plot of this epic story is resolved in a powerful, surprising and yet logical climax. This climax is followed by several concluding chapters containing some more surprises -- both pleasant and unpleasant -- and some of the most beautiful writing you'll ever read. Indeed, the final chapter of all, which brings the story to an unforgettably bittersweet conclusion, is so perfectly written that one would not wish to change a single sentence or word.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is undoubtedly one of the best novels in any genre ever written by anyone, and Peter Jackson's adaptation of it into a movie trilogy is to be commended for attracting many new readers to Tolkien's book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"One Ring to find themOne Ring to bring them allAnd in the darkness bind themEach generation of storytellers creates a new myth that grabs hold of the imagination of future generations for decades to come. In 1937, J.R.R Tolkien started such a myth with the publication of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Despite the flaws of their creator and the displays of racial, class, and gender prejudices that is obvious to a modern audience, the books of the trilogy brilliantly recount the tale of Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves and Men and their battle with evil. It is in the portrayal of his heroes struggle against the baser forces that the author transcends his own shortcomings to pen what has become one of the best sagas of courage, nobility of spirit, and raw adventure.Although often referred to as a trilogy Tolkien first wrote &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a single novel consisting of six books plus appendices. Tolkien's publisher divided this massive book into three novels. The first novel, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, was first published 1954. This book continues the story begun in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; when Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, found a shiny ring lost by a creature called Gollum.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; reintroduces the audience to Middle Earth and her occupants. Each of the nine characters that compose the fellowship of the ring represents a different race that lives in Middle Earth. There is Gandalf the gray, a mighty wizard; Legolas the noble elf; the men Aragon a ranger and future king of men and Boromir eldest son of the Stewart of Gondor; Gimli, a dwarf lord; and finally the Hobbits Frodo, the ring bearer; his gardener and friend Sam and his two younger cousins Meriadoc or Merry and Peregrin or Pip.This first book also tells the story of the creation of the Rings of Power by the Elven-smiths and how Sauron the Dark lord of Mordor forged the One Ring filling it with his own power so that he could bind all the other ring wearers to his will. Although defeated centuries ago and his ring lost, Sauron now awakes and seeks it. Bilbo's ring is soon discovered by Gandalf to be the One Ring. Soon it is decided that Frodo and his companions must enter Mordor and cast the ring into the very fires from which it was forged. This is the only way to destroy it.The fellowship ends with the fall of Gandalf to the fiery creature the Balrog, the death of Boromir at the hands of the evil Orcs who kidnap Merry and Pip and the decision of Frodo to continue on with only Sam to Mordor. Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli set of to rescue Merry and Pip from the Orcs.Book two, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; chronicles the separate adventures of Aragon traveling with Legolas and Gimli, Pip and Merry fleeing from the Orcs meeting up with the Ents and reuniting with Gandalf and of Frodo and Sam moving toward Mordor. This book also introduces us to new characters: Faramir, younger brother of Boromir; the Ents, the treelike guardians of the woods; King Theoden of the Rohan, his nephew Eomer and his niece Eowyn. We are also reintroduced to the evil wizard Saruman and his city of Isengard and to the creature Gollum.Book three, &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; is the final novel in the trilogy and by far the best. This is an example of the author surpassing his own limitations as the characters thrive and grow. This novel opens as the shadow of Mordor grows. The companions of the Ring continue to follow separate paths all leading toward the same goal, the overthrow of Sauron. Aragon is now revealed as the heir of the ancient kings of the West. Along with Legolas, Gimli, and Merry, he has joined forces with king Theoden and the riders of Rohan to go to the aid of the mighty city of Gondor. If Gondor falls so will the rest of Middle Earth.Pip is now in the service of Denethor the steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir. He serves this harsh lord while awaiting the coming conflict. Gandalf gathers news and makes his own preparations for battle. Frodo and Sam after escaping the clutches of the giant spider Shelob continue their journey toward the Cracks of Doom and the destruction of the One Ring. All the while, Sauron's forces gather for the great battle for Middle Earth.When I first read these books as a child, they captured my imagination and have not completely let it go yet. Rereading them in my late teens and early twenties I became disappointed by the author's prejudices that marred some of the passages for me. However, as I grew older and reread them again I realized that those things that offended my sensibilities were mere reflections of the age and climate in which the author was raised. They were not essential parts of this tale of the continuing battle between good and evil.Tolkien set out to tell a story about the struggle between the world of nature represented by the Elves and the Hobbits and the age of the machine represented by Sauron and especially Saruman who destroyed entire forests to build his city and war machines. However, these stories transcend mere allegories about the struggle between man and machine or good and evil and become cosmic in their application when speaking of basic concepts such as good, evil, courage, friendship, loyalty and hope.I had first set out only to review the third book &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, because the movie will be out in December. However, I realized that for those of you who have not read the other books that it was essential to give back-story and this resulted in a review of all the books. I hope you find this review helpful and derive as much pleasure from reading these books as I did. The only thing I found confusing in the entire trilogy was the fact that the name of the evil overlord Sauron was so similar to that of Saruman the evil wizard. Fantasy and adventure lovers who have not yet read the books should do so."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, readers will wonder if he can actually give it up.Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching.As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Journey continues... 5 starsThis book starts off exactly where, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; (see my review) ends. The Nine Walkers of Boromir, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, Merry and the Ring-bear Frodo set out from Rivendell. After their leader and guide fell into the abyss in Moria (an ancient palace of the Dwarves in the mountains), Aragorn became their leader.After emerging from the mountains, and passing through the land of Lorien, the Company faced a choice. Should they go to Mordor, where Frodo must go to destroy the Ring, the all-powerful instrument of evil and corruption or travel to Minis Tirith (Tower of the Guard) capital of the Gondor, a nation of Men who are at war with Mordor and its evil ruler Sauron.The Hobbits Sam and Frodo disappear and depart for Mordor. The other two Hobbits (Merry and Pippin) are taken captive by Orcs, despite being defended by Boromir, who is killed in their defence.In the first half of, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; the tale of what happened to Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn is related. In the second half of, \\"The Two Towers,\\" the tale of what happened to Frodo and Sam is related. Within the book, I much prefer the first section of it. The reunion of the Hobbits with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas is one of my favorite moments in the book.In some ways, whenever I undertake to read, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" I dread the second section of, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Personally, I do no appreciate the pain-staking description of every mountain, rock and flower; I keep waiting for some actual dialogue or action to happen. Tolkien obviously had a vivid, EXTREMELY detailed imagination for he invented every single part of his fictional world of Middle-Earth to be believable. There is a history of behind all the races and some of the races have their very own languages.The problem that Tolkien may have run into in his epic work is that he lost something in attempting to achieve the grand scale he sought to produce. His heavy use of allusions to persons and events that the reader knows nothing of start off as evocative and then begins to get annoying. However, in terms of good epic length fantasy literature, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" started it and it is probably one of the best novels of the 20th century. One last note, remember, Tolkien originally wrote the story for his own enjoyment, he did not envision millions of people in dozens of languages reading his work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I don't think that I need to tell anyone out there how amazing Tolkien's tales are. My cup runneth over. My imagination was thoroughly stimulated and I think I may end up reading this again in a few years."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a great and provoctive book, in my mind one of the best books of the century. J.R.R. Tolkien should have recieved a nobel prize for his works. It displays the greatest examples of fantisy and fiction in the modern and ancient world.His creatures have set the stage for all of the current and future storytellers. Tolkiens collection of creatures runs fromkobolds to hobbits he is the epitimy of what all fantisy writers should be like.The Two Towers I believe is his best book in the trilogy and to which all fiction writers should set there compasses. The detail that it includes is amazing. In some parts of the book I feel that Im there. I see what they see and the dialog is absolutly astonishing. So I recomend that this book be read by all."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book has the fellowship scattered in every which way. Frodo is traveling through Mordor with Sam, while Pippin and Merry show incredible inner strength in their encounters with orcs. Gandalf (who is supposedly killed in book 1) resurrects with gallantry as Gandalf the White. The characters begin to take on more and more challenges. Frodo is gettin guided by who but Gollum and a new type of soldier emerges--Ents. Readers are introduced to Faramir, Theoden, Wormtongue, and the Rohirrim. The trail to the final battle between good an evil narrows ever-more as the book draws to a close. Each reader has begun to see each character in a new light, truces are made, blood is shed, and now readers can begin to decide who is the most important character in the book. I personally have never been able, as all characters play such an immense part in the story of the rings. I recommend both the book and the recording (Rob Inglis is the most incredible reader)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"First off, i would like to address some of the faults that others found in this book. I noticed that a lot reviewers, thought the book was too descriptive. Yes, this book is very descriptive, but tolkein was only trying to paint a picture for his readers, and if you can understand the way he described it in, he did a very good job. You have to remember, that this book was written by a genius, and if your looking for an easy book to read, this isn't for you. Others said this book was a bit boring. In my opinion, it was quite the contrary. the book splits up essentially into two different stories, one following aragorn, legolas, gimili, merry, pippin and gandalf, and the other covers frodo and sam. Frodo's adventures are a little boring, but the rest of the fellowship had me on the edge of my seat. You also get to meet the ents, interesting creatures by far. All i can say, is read the book and decide for yourself. This isn't a book to read while your being distracted by something. and of course, make sure to read the first one before this, or you will be lost."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"First of, this is an excellent book. Although not really a life-changer it will probably do a lot to dispel the idea that fantasy books are boring. As a person who isn't a particular fan of the genre, I personally loved this book. The story is a follow up from the first novel in the set, 'The Fellowship Of The Rings'. Split into two sections it mostly concerns the aftermath of the dismemberment of the fellowship. In the first half Merry and Pippin are hobbit-napped by orcs, and Strider, Legolas and Gimli follow in pursuit, on the way meeting battle and an old friend. The second half is mostly taken up by the character Sam, as Frodo feels the weight of his task ever more, becoming ever more weary as they come closer to their destination. On the journey they find help from an unwanted ally - Gollum.Obviously there are several problems with the story, such as characters like Treebeard that are dull and often unneeded. However, despite this it can be very exciting in parts and brings a whole new dimension to the 'journey' story. All of the characters are drawn exceptionally well, even if some are clearly more interesting than others. In addition, the fight scenes are a lot more than the usual hacking and chopping but include some surprising light humour that really helps dispel the possibility of boredom. Even if the homoerotic overtones between Frodo and Sam are a little on-the-nose then at least you've got Shalob the giant spider at the end to give a pounding finale with a great cliffhanger. Plus, it's certainly a plus that Tolkien can write in a giant spider without his reader questioning it for a moment and just enjoying the moment.This is a great book, although I'm worried as to how they'll transfer characters such as Shalob onto the big screen later this year."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Gandalf is gone. Boromir is dying. Frodo and Sam are gone, and the rest of the Fellowship has been disbanded. Things couldn't be worse for the 9. But things eventually begin to go up. Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, the creature that Bilbo took the Ring from, and he promises that he'll help them get to Mordor to destroy the Ring. However, things and people aren't always what or who they seem to be. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin who were captured by Orcs. Gandalf returns to help them in their search, and plans to take on Saruman in a duel to get at least one enemy out of the way. Merry and Pippin meet up with the Ents, a species of talking trees, and they agree to help in the fight against Saruman because of Saruman's tendency to kill trees. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum meet Faramir, Boromir's brother, and then they are off to Mordor. But when they get there, things go horribly wrong... Once again, this is an amazing story, and if you liked Part 1, continue with this one."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All I can say is out or 5 stars it gets a 7. This is the best medival book I have ever read. The word use is a little hard to grsp if you are young but the story plot was outstanding. Tolkien really knew how to write a story.

Don't worry, I won't tell you what that thing is. The Fellowship still remains split up and some things that you wanted to know at the conclusion of the last book are revealed, as said above. That is as much as I'll tell you for this book because if I tell you anymore the book will be ruined for you.As in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien gives you luscious descriptions and phenomonal writing. He goes into some matters that were brought forth in the first book with such skill that only Tolkien could pull off. At the end of this book you will feel a craving to pick up &quot;The Return of the King&quot; right away.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the second book in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the best of the first two volumes. Tolkien brings you into his beautiful world that you won't be able to get enough of. Before delving into this, be sure to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first so you won't feel like you're reading material that makes no sense to you.

Will more of the fellowship perish in the end of this series? Find out by reading the conclusion to the lord of the rings series.The only problem with this book was that J.R.R.

(And yes I know it was written as one novel) But Again we have so many names to remember it was a chore to keep track. Also I thought the end was a tad weak, on Mt Doom, but thats just me.

If you are going to write a book about dwarves, do so. But, to write a book about dwarves, elves, farries, gnomes, wizards, and dozens more creatures is a bad move. The language of this book is excellent. It is very discritve and flows wonderfully, but the differences betwen what an elf is, and what a gnome is, is confusing. The plot I think is predictable. The characters seem to make a long journey through a woods, tunnel, mountain and meet another species in every chapter."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"most boring book ever better of reading song of ice and fire this book is all bout walkin can't believe its so good chuck away its sux"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think , that how his son tried to finish the whole series, is bad and he shouldn't have touched it because it's J.R.R.'s not Christopher's and he should have not killed the Dark Lord [Sauron] because evil must stay in the land of Middle-Earth because thats what gave the book meaning"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is SLOW. The characters aren't real at all, and they each have about 50 names. Take Aragorn for example: Strider Aragorn, Estel, King Ellisar, Plain Ellisar, etc. The names are unoriginal, like Arwen and Eowyn, different by one syllable. The book is rather confusing by itself, then if you read all the appendixes, you don't know who is who. The whole book is simply fighting and killing, with an occasional appearence by Gandalf. Merry and Pippin are the only source of humor, if they ever come up in the book. Did I mention that the characters are totally fake? Their actions are random and unpredictable, even for a fantasy, their speech is ridiculous. The \\"Greatest Fantasy Epic of our time\\" is a silly name for a book this long and boring. Totally overrated, this book stinks. What's worse is that it is the best book out of the series. For once the movies are better than the books. Even if they are saturated with special effects."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All of you who believe that Tolkien's works have any substance could not be more mistaken. The Return of the King is the perfect example of why Tolkien should never have been born. In the history of literature never has there been a book which has recieved more unworthy praise. Everything from its banal and totally meaningless plot to its incredibly idiotic and unimaginative characters miserably fail in masking one of the worst books of all time. Tolkien attemps to hide his lack of substance behind a transparent wall of deplorable descriptions and stupid childish songs. His entire series is a collection of rubbish in need of decomposing much like his reputation. It is about time that we did away with the rediculous notion that Tolkien has written a classic and simply accept that his life's work is worthless nonsense. His work sucks, he sucks, and anyone who admires either is right down there with him. Lord of the Rings should crawl in a hole and die... P.S. ~ This is a joke. LOTR is a master piece."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I came into this book thinking it would be out-of-this world good, only to be disappointed. Maybe I had too high of expectations, or the fact that I had only read the Hobbit and the Two Towers, skipping the Fellowship of the Rings, might've thrown things off. Maybe it was because I knew what was going to happen(destruction of the Ring) and couldn't wait. I couldn't stand the long drawn out fluff details of the book or C.S. Lewis style writing about the \\"color of the landscape\\" for twenty pages. I would give this book .5 stars because I only enjoyed 1/10th of the book(the last part of the book that really didn't have much to do with the earlier portion), but the smallest rating a person can give is one. I would only suggest this book to people that have read the first three books in the series(people that would probably read this book as no matter what...)"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book arrived quickly and it was obvious it was never used. It was also OLD, as the pages are yellowed with age all around the edges. The cover 'cracked' after the first chapter and I'm hoping the book stays intact long enough for my 5th grader to finish it. I did not like that the cover image shown on Amazon (circa 2001 Peter Jackson's movie) was not the version we received. The cover image on our book was a cheesy 70's graphic, which explains why the book is in such brittle condition."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This product came within a reasonable amount of time and as described.

The spine is in perfect shape and so are the pages. The dust cover shows some wear but that is to be expected."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third book of the Lord of the Rings, and like the first two, is divided into two \\"books.\\" Spoilers for the next five paragraphs.The first book chronicles how Pippin and Gandalf ride to Gondor, and Theoden of Rohan does the same with his army, responding to Gondor's call for aid. Aragorn and his friends head for Gondor as well, but they take a different and more dangerous route; known as the Paths of the Dead. Pippin becomes a guardsman of Gondor, and soon finds that Denethor; the steward of Gondor, has gone mad with despair, and ordered the execution of both his son Faramir and himself. With the help of Gandalf, he moves to rescue Faramir from the mad steward.Arriving in time for battle, King Theoden is slain, and his daughter Eowyn; disguised as a horseman, faces off against the Nazgul king; the second in command of Mordor. Aragorn moves in with reinforcements, but even when they win the battle for Gondor's gates, they still have to make one last, suicidal attack against Mordor if they want to distract Sauron from the real prize; the ring of power.The second \\"book\\" of the Return of the King chronicles Frodo and Sam as they complete their journey through Mordor, and bring the ring of power to Mount Doom, where Gollum attacks them again, just as the ring finishes corrupting Frodo. Both Gollum and the ring fall into the fires, but Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and the Eagles, and Aragorn's forces finish mopping up the enemy once the ring is destroyed.After that, there are several subplots involving Eowyn and some of the other minor characters. Eowyn casts aside virtually all of her previous character development, and becomes \\"more of a woman,\\" for Faramir, but I actually consider this a relatively minor fault in the writing, despite Eowyn's large impact on the story so far. Arwen appears again, just in time to marry Aragorn, but barely gets two lines of dialogue in doing so. I much prefer her depiction in the movie, but this isn't really a weakness in the book; she's just a very minor character here.Finally, they all part ways, and before the main characters depart the land forever, there's a plot about a brief war in the shire, between a band of \\"ruffians,\\" commanded by Saruman, and the shire hobbits he's been enslaving with what essentially amounts to socialism.The characters and meanings to be found within the first half of the book are numerous and intriguing. I could spend an hour discussing the meaning of Denethor's madness, Eowyn's motives, Aragorn's plans, Gimli's shame and the role of Gandalf in it all. It's a beautiful story with a lot of very strong plot points. However, for enjoyability, I can't give it a perfect score, and there are two reasons for this.The first is that, as I've said, I'd rather be reading a story about fantastic things and strange beings. The first half of the book is largely concerned with the actions of men and armies, and the deployment of troops, which isn't as much my thing as the battle at Helm's Deep was. This is a purely personal issue, however.The real problem is that the book drops too many names, and uses them too often, not really assigning substantial characters to most of them. Some characters, like Beregond; have interesting stories told about them, but just weren't considered important enough to be in the movie, while others, like Halbarad, Ghan-Buri-Ghan, Imrahil and about a dozen others are essentially names without any clear stories behind them, except to fill up space in lists of names of warriors who defended Gondor valliantly. Certainly, real historical records might take this tack, but in fiction, it's acceptable, and expected, to stick to the story in question. I felt that this weakened the narrative, rather than strengthening it. These are the only reasons, in my mind, for taking issue with the first half of the book, however. On the whole, I really enjoyed it.With respect to the book's second half; in my opinion, the final battle of the book was a bit anticlimactic for a final battle, but not a bad little plotline by itself, and even fairly amusing. I was always somewhat disappointed that the major conflict is resolved a third of the way into this book, after which everything else seems like a step down. Still, it never really upset me all that much. I wasn't really bothered by any of the things I've just described.The only thing about this book, and indeed, this book series that ever really angered me was the message, near the end, of good things passing away and the world moving on without them. Many of the ideas and concepts contained in this book are friendly to the Catholic ear, but this is not. Only evil things will come to an end. Good things continue forever, and without a better understanding of the Gray Havens, and its relationship to Middle Earth, the message of these segments can come off as \\"if you've already done a lot to help people, just go off on a vacation overseas somewhere.\\" For good Christians, the fight doesn't end until you're dead, and even then, it doesn't really END end, it just takes a different form until the final judgment. The ending of the Lord of the Rings always bothered me for this reason, ever since I was a child, and it does to this day.Finally, after finishing the last of the six \\"books\\" of the Lord of the Rings, there is a selection of appendixes at the back. The appendixes provide some backstory for some of the races and characters, some information on the languages, cultures, family trees, etc, of Middle Earth.Unfortunately, this section gets even drier than most of Tolkien's other writing; particularly when he discusses languages and historical records. Still, it's not without it's high points, providing some history for Aragorn and Arwen, as well as some interesting stories about the dwarves and their feud with the orcs, and about the man after whom Helm's Deep was named. There's also a passing reference to the Silmarillion, which I may also undertake one day.Still, many of the characters in these parts of the story are vain, prideful, thirsty for revenge, and generally act out of self-centered motives, but they all suffer losses appropriate to their vices. The only reason I even bother to bring this up is that there's no Gandalf-like central hero in these parts of the story; nobody to show how things should be done right.The points down that I give the appendixes in enjoyability come almost entirely from the fact that they read like an encyclopedia. The content is very entertaining, but the format is not. I don't feel there's any point in disguising that.Still, it's a good book overall, and a very compelling story of trial, danger and loss. It was just as good as I remembered it being, and I hope you'll enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"NOTE: This review contains major spoilers. So if you haven't read the book (or haven't seen the movie) yet, then don't read what I've written below.---------------------------------------------I've just finished \\"The Return of the King\\" (and the entire LOTR trilogy) just two days ago. It was an outstanding conclusion to the epic fantasy. Although there were some things that bothered me a bit, I still found myself satisfied with the third installment.First let me say what I DID like about this book.Tolkien has created so much fantastic details with characters and settings. From Minas Tirith to Barad-dur, from dwarves to orcs, he's basically the Emperor of Fantasy. Indeed, modern fantasy writers such as Terry Brooks, Robin Hobb, and the late Robert Jordan (RIP) have been inspired by LOTR. Works like \\"The Wheel of Time\\" and the \\"Sword of Shannara\\" series contain clear evidence of the Tolkienesque influence. I still prefer \\"Wheel of Time\\" over LOTR, but I do admire LOTR for its fantastic detail, and Tolkien's writing style.Frodo sure has changed. In \\"Fellowship\\" he's just an average guy in Hobbiton who just happens to have a famous (or should I say \\"infamous\\") uncle named Bilbo. When he continues his quest in \\"Towers\\" and \\"Return\\", he completely changes in personality. The Ring becomes a heavy burden, and it tries to consumes him when he comes closer to Mount Doom. What makes the story deeper is that Frodo tries hard to keep the Ring away from his closest friend Samwise Gamgee. He doesn't want Sam to be consumed by this thing as well, and that's pure friendship right there if you ask me.The Battle of Gondor is probably the most exciting thing that happens in the entire trilogy. So much happens in the chapters \\"The Siege of Gondor,\\" \\"The Ride of the Rohirrim,\\" and \\"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\\". You have Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, the Riders of Rohan, the soldiers of Gondor, the orcs of Mordor, the Southrons and Easterlings with their gigantic Ouliphants, and the Army of the Dead all in one battle. It doesn't get any better than that.The chapter with Eowyn and Faramir called \\"The Steward and the King\\" is especially touching. Both have gone through so much that they deserve each other. And it's a shame that this is mentioned in just one minute in the (Extended) film. Five more minutes could've helped.All right, now here's what I DIDN'T like about this book.That's it?! Only Theodin and Denethor (as major characters) die in the entire war? The death of a good and noble king is such a f**kin' cliche in the world of fantasy. Couldn't Tolkien kill of several more characters to make us more emotional about this trilogy?I also had a problem with the Southrons and the Easterlings. Was Tolkien racist? Because obviously the Easterlings and Southrons are reminiscent to Middle Easterns, Asian Indians, and Chinese; and they're enemies of Gondor. These people have experienced a huge loss in the Battle of Gondor as much as the orcs from Mordor. I can't help but get pissed off. All of the races in the North (Eriador, Rhovanian, Rohan, Gondor) are basically all White, while the races in the East and South (Mordor, South Gondor) are all Eastern. I can see the racial diversity when it comes to elves and dwarves and men, but why leave out the Asians? But of course, it was only the 50's, and fantasy nowadays have far more racially diverse characters. So another point is taken away from LOTR.And finally, The Scouring of the Shire. I think I agree with Peter Jackson that this is a bit to anti-climactic in both the book and the film (and thank God that they never filmed it). Okay, so the Shire is being destroyed by Saruman and his wild men, and yes, this is a pretty exciting chapter, but is it necessary? Yes and no. Yes for the fact that our four Hobbits have matured and are now ready to face their enemies. No for the fact that we've just read through a major battle in Gondor and near the Black Gate of Mordor, and we've just experienced the climax to the entire trilogy. It gets quite tiring when the second to last chapter is being read.With all ups and downs, The Lord of the Rings is still indeed a classic that must be read. And even though I'm not a big fan of Tolkien's/Jackson's work, I gotta give credit to the men for making me wanting to be a novelist.Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the great quest to vanquish evil forever ends in this book, that i would consider dissapointing. Tolkein picked back up with putting too much detail into everything and ended it in an odd way. I was expecting for the dwarves to come out of the ground and the elves out of the woods and everyone would live together, but instead he made it more realistic, so it actually coule have happened because only men are left, but i guess that might be a good thing, a good change of pace that makes you think, and i enjoy those kinds of books. They have a massive war in this book, and Tolkein wrote it wonderfly,he showed just the right amount of detail in that part that you knew what was going on, but not too much so you were falling asleep in a war. I would call this a 8.5 out of ten, good, but not as good as it could have been."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Peter Jackson has created an OUTSTANDING masterpiece in it's own right with his interpretation of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy... but Tolkiens books are some of the best literature of the 20th century.Jackson takes several liberties with some key points of the story line, not the least of which is making Frodo a \\"Naive Young Hobbit\\" when in fact, Frodo and his companions didn't set out on their quest to Rivendell until AFTER his 50th birthday. Little inconsistencies like that between the movies and the books aboud, reason enough to pick up copies of the books to see Tolkiens original narrative."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second book of J.R.R. Tolkien's three piece story. It has a lot of action and suspense. The book has basically two different stories intwined togather. One of the stories is the becoming of a king. The other story is about the small hobbit who has to save the world by destroying the magical ring of power. Aragorn and his fellow friends are trying to tarck down their other friends who were captured by some orcs. The two hobbits that were captured gathered up some tree-like creatures and destroyed one of the two towers it was called Isengard. While the small hobbit named Frodo is led on by an evil being named Gollum who leads Frodo it to a trap near the end. This book is a real page turner. You may never want to put this one down. There is so much developement within each of the characters that you feel like you have known them for a long time. I would reccomend this book to somebody of any age who likes action-packed fanstasy stories."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King. Written by J.R.R Tolkien it is the last in the series. I loved the book it has action that makes you keep on reading non-stop. It probably has more action than the other books.The book started in Minus Tirith. The war for the ring had started. Minus Tirith called for the aid of Rohan in battle. The battle of Middle-Earth was fought at Minus Tirith. Frodo and Sam are in Mordor for most of the book. They are clad in orc-fashion most of the way to Mount Doom. The weight of the Ring grows in Mordor. They destroy the Ring. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin head back to the Shire and find that it was ruled by a terrible person. Ruffians were sent to make sure the hobbits were paying up. At one point, a ruffian made Pippin made so he Merry and Sam drew swords and slew him.I felt that I had to read this book because I saw all three of the movies and read the first two books.

As much as I love the books, I'm so glad Peter Jackson veered from the book and beefed up the roles of Legolas, Gimli, in addition to the battle scenes. Tolkien was one of the greatest creative minds of all time, but he didn't do a good job with the action, nor with Legolas and Gimli. I do love how he wrote Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Samwise and the other hobbits. All in all, a great book and a great series (and an amazing set of movies!). I wish Tolkien were still around to write more adventures. I would have loved to know what happened to some of those guys and gals!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book seemed much alike the movie. The author wrote the book in a way that made us feel like we were actually there while the story was being told. If you see the movie,In this book, the sword was put back together and the king was reborn. He was able to find ghosts that the previous king cursed for fleeing from battle and he was able to make a promise to them. He promised that if they fought for him, he would free their souls. So the ghosts took over some orc ships, and pretended to be orcs. When the other orcs came to greet them, the ghosts jumped out and attacked the orcs. With out the ghosts it would not have been a victory.In the mean time, Frodo was going to throw the ring into the mountain and destroy it. But the ring was calling to him and telling him not to. It was telling him to keep it and he could have all the power that he wanted. But Smeagle stole the ring from Frodo and fell into the lava. That was the end of the ring, after this everything was restored and every one was happy. The throne was given back to the rightful person and the hobbits went back to the shire.But, gandalf goes back to the Shire and Brings frodo on another journey that takes you on another adventure. So another serise continues..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"To some, Tolkien's greatest stregnth is creating a different world. To me, that is to some extent, his greatest weakness. He seemed to indulge that creativity too much in the third book. I found that the story and character development was greatly hampered by the constant description of locations. I know some love that aspect of the book, but to me, it made it unbearably slow at times. As soon as the action began, Tolkien would launch into detailed descriptions of places and their relation to other places. I could have skipped half this book and not have missed a thing. While I did enjoy the ultimate conclusion and happy ending, as well as the farewell between characters, this book largely could have been subsumed in the maps!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Two Towers&quot; -- the second volume in Tolkien's model-train-set of a novel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; -- has fewer of the pleasures to be found in the first volume (&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;), while enlarging many of the first volume's faults. As everyone in the world must know by now, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; basically tells how various good-hearted fantasy creatures strive to destroy a magic ring that, if acquired by the Enemy, would result in the end of decent society. Here the journey continues just as in the first volume, but Tolkien now moves much more slowly. He introduces us to fewer characters and &quot;wonders&quot; than in the first volume (most interesting, to me, were the Tree Shepherds, the revamped Gollum, and Boromir's brother), while filling many pages with tedious faux Arthurianism involving the Riders of Rohan, and with deadly landscape descriptions that are at once long-winded and vague. Nevertheless, the old excitement returns often enough -- particularly in the last few chapters -- and by the end my desire to find out what happens in the final volume was as fresh as ever."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Let's face it, \\"The Return of the King\\" is easily the worst of the trilogy (as far as the books go), but that doesn't stop it from being an beaitifully written and exciting conclusion. It's probably the hardest and all the chapters are really huge, so its only for dedicated readers. I loved this book, except for Chapter Eight of Book Six, \\"The Scouring of the Shire.\\" But then, very few people do like that particular bit."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third book in the Lord of the Rings series. It tells how the ring is destroyed, and answers a lot of questions that you may have had in your head from the first two books. It really had only a few interesting parts. It is a drag between the cool parts. They talk about things that already happened in the other books. And it is confusing. In the second half, they talk about things that happened in the first half, and say they have not yet happened. You will like this if you want to find the ending of the Lord of the Rings, but otherwise, probably not."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There is no question you will read this book. Like any trilogy, after you read the first 2, you feel obligated to complete the series and read the final one. No matter what I say in this review, nothing will deter you from reading the third of the trio. This review is written for posterity's sake, and in keeping with my practice of reviewing books after I read them.The book is mediocre-good, much like the first one. It's better than the second book and probably not quite as good as the first one. Towards the end of book 5 (the 3rd of the series actually contains Book 5 and Book 6) it seems to me that Tolkein is so far off the deep end that he loses all ability to communicate words in a digestible manner. The writing borders on horrendous, and the reader cannot differentiate one speaker from the next. Everyone speaks in the same voice, with the same grand tones, saying the same trite things.Book 6 is better. It wraps up the series and allows the reader to put the book down satisfied with the series. Without book 6, I don't think that would have been possible. One problem is this. There's no suspense for too many pages. Relatively early in the narrative we see the &quot;return of the king&quot; and the tidy conclusion subsequent to that. After this, there's no suspense, no reason to keep reading. If it weren't for the hijinx in the Shire at the end, this book would have been pretty bland, all in all.I have thought before, and this book again shows me, that Tolkein had a great imagination but was a weak writer. Pages upon pages are devoted to the most mundane of things, while action scenes are over in mere paragraphs. It seems the author wanted to gloss over most of the action, preferring to work with the majesty and pageantry he had created in his mind. If Tolkein could have forgone the written word and found a way to allow people a brief glimpse into his head, Peter Jackson's films would seem mundane in comparison.But the reality is we're dealing with the printed word, and this is not the strongest medium for Tolkein to have chosen. In his time, it was all he had. Now Jackson has taken that and worked wonders with it. I think the movies are a better reflection of what Tolkein would have liked to portray. The books, other than the Hobbit, could have been done better.Still, as I said, you will read it. It's a good enough ending to a classic series. Assuredly, the time it takes to read this book is worth it, even if it does drag a bit. It's a fantasy classic, and you should immerse yourself in it for the sake of the experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the KingBy J.R.R. TolkienHarper Collins PublishersCopyright 1955, 1965, 1966Return of The King ReviewThis book starts out with Pippin riding with Gandalf in the realm of Gondor. Then they go to the kingdom of Minas Tirith. There is a lot of talking about pretty much nothing for a while. Then it picks up with Merry while he is in Rohan. Then Merry is made into an advisor to the king of Rohan because he saw how the king's son died and he was one of his friends. Then there is an invasion of Rohan by the Orcs. Then it tells how they ride on the Road of the Dead.I thought this book was alright. To tell the truth this book was kind of slow in the beginning. A lot of it was just talking. But once they finally got to some of the fight scenes it was really good. Over all I thought this book was pretty good mmm'kay. I give it ***1/2 (three and a half stars).By A Gilpin County Sophmore"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is the second book in his trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. The book picks up exactly were the first on ends. Froto and Sam are on their way to Mordor the evil empire. The rest of the broken fellowship will trail behind and they will meet again later. The book is based on a series of mini wars that lead to the destruction of the two towers. These two towers are points on the earth were Soron and his army build and destroy.In my mind the book did an all right job at putting a few hours of film into a 300-page book, but there needs to be more dialog. I read through the book reading the author's words and nothing about what the characters thought.I also liked the two wars that they had. The author did a great job at giving you a detailed view on what is going on at the battlefield.The one thing that I have learned in the past is that you have to read over and over to get the right idea. I read the book then watch the movie to get both point of views.I would advise reading this book and not skipping it to read the last book in the trilogy. The Two Towers is an important part of the trilogy. It gives a middle ground and puts you in place for the next book Return of the King.If I were to give a grade on this book form one to ten it would be a seven. I would give it a seven because it kept my attention and keep up the pace in the trilogy. The book could be read from 16 and up. Some of the things that are going on in the book are hard to understand and keep up with if you are of a younger age."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It's a shame to give this book only 1 star, so I gave it 2. There was nothing good about it except that it had a bit less description than The Fellowship of he Ring and it took me less time to finish reading. I think the plot was sort of unclear and it wasn't very interesting. The characters vere very unrealistic and unlikable to me. This book might be good if you're older than I am. (My dad liked it.) It was difficult and boring for me."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It's Tolkien! Nothing more need be said."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers starts right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. Boromir is dead, the fellowship is broken and two hobbits are missing. Book three is the journey of Aragorn, Master Pergerin, Merry, Gilimi and Legolas search for the two missing hobbits Frodo and Master Samwise. Aragorn and the others venture through many lands and many perils. They meet with the Riders of Rohan who have light-footed horses and deadly bow accuracy, the mysterious tree type Ents who seem to be older than anything on Middle-Earth. Book four is the quest of Frodo and Master Samwise. They find themselves lost in the lands of Gondor, Rohan and at the gates of Mordor, while being followed by the elusive Smeagol. Frodo and Samwise are on a hunt to find a passage into Mordor.To me this book was not the best out of the series but the ending was good. The first hundred pages start off slow, but when Aragorn meets up with the Riders of the Mark and they begin their march to the siege of Isengard to kill Saruman the book starts to pick up. Tolkien expresses the feeling of battle well so it is easy to follow. My favorite character out of the book is Samwise. His decisions are rash at times but I think Frodo should have seeked council with him more often. It would have made the journey easier for the both of them. The end seems to express Sam as being smarter than Frodo because he seems to know what he's doing. Frodo was dazed and confused most of the time leaving Sam to do the thinking for the both of them."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the last book of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo finally finishes his quest. There are some GREAT battle scenes in here and some really interesting characters. It's funny because I started to read this several years ago, got bored, and stopped. Then I started again sometime later and asked myself why I didn't keep going earlier. Anyway, the only reason why I flick off one star is because I felt the ending was a little disappointing. Actually, there are TWO endings in this book. The end of the Ring of Power and the end of the book. I have no problem with the end of the book--it's great, and leaves you begging more more, but in a good sense. The second ending, though, I felt was a little too abrupt, and worst of all, unbelievable. You'll see what I mean when you get there. Also, THERE IS NO PHYSICAL BATTLE WITH SAURON. Not that Tolkien ever implied a face-to-face battle with him, though, but I feel it would have made the book more interesting. To me, Sauron comes across as DUMB and WEAK. Let's get real--here's a guy who lets the ring get stolen from him at point-blank-range and now he makes ANOTHER mistake by not surrounding Mount Doom with enemies and UNDERESTIMATING Frodo and company. But apart from that, this book is really good--an excellent ending to an excellent series. But I wonder how it's going to stand up when Robert Jordan's series comes to an end."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this, the second book of his extraordinary series, J.R.R. Tolkien continues where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. The Fellowship has been sundered by the events which took place at the Falls of Rauros. Frodo and Sam are off towards Mordor and a date with destiny guided by the deceitful Gollum while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on a quest to save Merry and Pippin.The plot of this second novel is good, although, as it is the middle act of a three act story, it is some what slow. Tolkien is setting up the final part throughout most of the novel, so the reader should not take this as a criticism. We get a glimpse of what the war against Sauron will be like when the forces of Rohan meet those of Sauruman. Tolkien is a master story teller, one who moves his characters around as a grand master moves pieces on a chess board.The characters in this novel are well developed and continue to grow. In particular, we see the Hobbits grow out of their child-like innocence because of the weight they carry and the events they are witness to. Frodo in particular will not come out unscathed, if he is able to survive his jouney into the darkness of Mordor.If you enjoyed the first book in the series you will enjoy this one as well. You will also be eargerly awaiting the conclusion. 4.5 Stars"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After finishing the first of the series i couldn't wait to dig in to the next one. I must admit i was a little disappointed. The first book kept me in the book and urged me to read more. This one is easier to put down. This book as a lot of boring parts and even though it is very interesting it was hard to finish."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After reading the compelling book The Fellowship of the Ring, I of course went on to read The Two Towers. I must say I was a little disappointed by this second book. The plot was very slow, and most of the book was just the group walking and wandering. Now don't get me wrong - this is a must-read if you are ever to complete the trilogy. It's just a little tough to get through. The book is at it's best just near the end."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I liked the Hobbit and the first book quite well, yet I still have not finished reading this book. I have tried for over a year now. I lost interest because the excitement within the story is gone. It feels like the author knew how he wanted the series to end, and how he wanted to start it, but had no great ideas for the middle. The prose is slow and unenthusiastic, and the characters have not developed at all. Hobbits are reluctant heroes to the point that I wonder why they are continuing such a treacherous quest. I feel almost pained to read about these gentle, naive hobbits getting into trouble time and again. I feel bad for them, and wish they would give their quest to someone more competent and enthusiastic. I started this book right after I finished the first, and I think that was a mistake. If you want to buy this book to continue the series, put it on your wish list and wait a month. When you are really dying to know what happens, and have had a break from innocent hobbits, this book may seem less tedious."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I've been reading the Tolkien books since the 70's. I'm reading Two Towers now. I re-read them every few months."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Arrived quickly. We have listened to several readings of LOTR and our family loves Rob Inglis' narration. This is completely unabridged and well performed."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"They have excellent customer service, They are dedicated to help the customer get their order correct and contact you to make sure you are very happy with them!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I recently bought a Kindle and was eagerly anticipating buying a library. One of the books that I absolutely need to have is The Lord of the Rings. (More like three books really). I go to the KIndle store. Happily buy the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. I search for The Two Towers. Not there. What kind of cruelty does Amazon have in mind? Not only do they omit one of the three amazing and astounding books, they even take the nice option to omit the one in the middle, leaving some new readers hanging on an edge not able to read any further. The Lord of the Rings was designed to be one long book. Not reading the second and only the first and third books is like reading the first five chapters of a book then the last five. Amazon has to fix this problem. Or else how will I read the adventures of Frodo from beginning to the end? Amazon should let new and old readers of Tolkien enjoy ALL three books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read the Lord of the Rings eight times. It is by far the best book I have ever read. The book has a beauty that no other book or author has ever been able to capture or ever will again.The reason, in my opinion, the Lord of the Rings are such good books is the absolute selflessness of the heroes. They are willing to give up anything. The images of Gandalf standing against the Balrog on the bridge, Boromir hurling himself into the orcs at Amon Hen, or the way every man at the Field of Cormallen was willing to give up his life to give Frodo and Sam a chance of getting to Mount Doom are the examples that spring to mind.My favorite character is Sam. He is the most courageous and noble of them all, even if he does not attract as much attention as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Theoden, Gandalf, etcetera. Sam does not give himself a thought. He always thinks,\\"what about Mr. Frodo?.\\" Sam gives Frodo as much food and water as he possibly can, only taking just enough for himself. He even carries Frodo on his back for part of the way. Sam will never give up.Another good character is Aragorn. Yes, Aragorn is a spectacular fighter who wins fame and renown on the field of battle, but that is not the reason he is such a good man. The reason is that he knows his duty and is able and willing to perform it unflinchingly. In one sentence he sums up the whole book. \\"But I am the real Strider, fortunately,\\"he said, looking down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile. \\"I am Aragorn son of Arathorn and if by life or death I can save you, I will.\\" Aragorn would rather face the Nine with an army behind them than let down the hobbits.Many people who had previously been simple folk who gave Sauron little or no thought arose and fought. Pippin and Merry are good examples of this. In the Two Towers, when they were captured by Orcs, Pippin acted bravely and resourcefully to escape with Merry. If it were not for Pippin, both of them would certainly have been slain. Pippin later fought in the Battle of the Morannon, where he saved his friend's life and was the first to see the approach of the eagles.Merry was so loyal to King Theoden that he disobeyed his order to stay in Rohan and rode in the Ride of the Rohirrim. Then, in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, he slew the Witchking, possibly the greatest single feat in the War of the Ring. (It was Merry who slew the Witchking, not Eowyn. Altough Eowyn bravely stood up to him, it was Merry's sword forged in Numenor, one the last swords of its kind left on Middle Earth, that killed the Lord of the Nazgul. Eowyn thrusting her sword into the Ulairi's face was just a gesture.)These four characters are good examples of the characters in The Lord of the Rings. There are the people who stand up and fight because they must, and those who would rather die trying to do their duty than fail.The sheer bravery of all of the people in the Lord of the Rings is amazing. They can stand in harm's way without a thought of themselves. They do not even think about their own fate, but rather the fate of the world. And they are determined to help, and take down as many foes as possible with them, dying content if they send some enemies ahead of them to pave the way if they must go themselves.Overall, this book is about the willingness of people to die for the things they believe in. The battles and feats of arms are still very exciting, but that is not what they are about in the core, although I think that the battles and feats of arms are about as far as most people see. I hope that the people who read my review will see the things I have stated."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord of the Rings is a fantastic piece of literature. While all of the parts are exceptional, part two, The Two Towers, is without a doubt the best of the series. The novel starts off with Aragorn finding a wounded Boromir. Boromir explains that the Uruk-Hai ambushed him and captured Merry and Pippin. This part of the series is split up into two books (Book 3 and Book 4). While Book 4 is fantastic and details the continued adventures of the Ring-Bearer, Book 3 really shines. The chapter about the Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best chapter in any book ever. For those readers rather uninterested in what happens to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas, Book 4 will be your favorite. An old enemy of Bilbo's is back to guide Frodo and Sam, but instead leads them into a trap. One warning though. As great as this book is, do not read it unless you can soon-after beging The Return of the King. The Two Towers has even more of a cliffhanger ending than Fellowship of the Ring did. I highly recommend this great piece of work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers includes book III and IV in the Lord of the Rings cycle. There is a ring that makes the wearer invisible, but it also corrupts that person. The ring also gives the bearer unimaginable power. In the fantasy world where The Two Towers takes place, there is the evil ruler, Sauron. To prevent the ring from falling into the hands of Sauron, it must be destroyed. The ring can only be destroyed in the volcanic caves where it was created, Mount Doom, which is at the heart of Sauron's kingdom. Frodo and Sam, the two main characters, are sent out on a quest to finish this task. Their guide is the devious, untrustworthy and deceptive creature Gollum. I especially liked this book because of all the exciting action. There were a lot of conflicts and suspensful moments, all going on at once. These events made the book entertaining to read. I would encourage every middle school student to read the Tolkien Lord of the Ring cycle."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the only unabridged version of The Return of the King. The reader is pretty good but SLOW!!! You really need to speed him up or just read the book on your own. If you rip this to an m4b and play fast on an iPod, it is good. I just need to find the right Android app to speed up his talking."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor, like Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"honestly, I love this book, and yes I have seen the movie and I would much rather read the book again. I wanted to read it because my dad had mentioned a few scenes from the novel that weren't in the book and they sounded very interesting, so i decided to read the novel and it was amazing, of course, I started from \\"the Fellowship of the Ring\\", which i will report on next quarter but i really decided to do this book because of the 3 books, the two towers really is a good median of action and beginings. I would recommend this novel to anyone, it appeals to kids from 10 to people that have lived their days to 100, it is wonderful and i think you should consider reading this triumpful novel. -725 pages-"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers. I liked it because it was a very action-packed book. It was a very adventurous book also! One of my favorite parts is the Battle of Helms Deep.

Then Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili have to battle Orcs, Goblins, and Ura-khai in their adventurous battle for mankind! I would recomend this book for people who like fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third book in the series was a little slow to get started and a little slow to end. I felt as if Tolkein got bored of writing it and wrapped up the final fight of the war of the ring rather quickly which was dissapointing since he had spent two books building up to that moment. I was rather attached to each of the characters by the final book though and was pleased with the ending overall, I just feel it could have been racier and faster paced. I still give this book five stars together with the other two. I don't think I've ever read such an enjoyable book in my life and I am so pleased to have read it. The whole book was truly magical and I often found myself on the edge of my seat cheering and willing the characters along."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"(See my other reviews for \\"Fellowship\\" and \\"King\\")Of the three, \\"Two Towers\\" is without a doubt my favorite. All the fun happens here: the ents, that horrid forest, and loads of Merry and Pippen goofing around. The only thing that would have made this one better is some more mention of Rosie, because, let's face it...Rosie and Sam are adorable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Times have become darker as the inevitable battle with the evil Sauron approaches. The Fellowship has been split up during this darkest hour. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn have been sent in hot pursuit of Merry and Pippin, who were captured by the attacking Urukhai. With Gandalf lost, Sam and the highly depressed Frodo press on toward Mount Doom, their journey looking more and more hopeless as it presses on. They meet with the manic depressant schizoid Gollum/Smeagol, who guides them shadily into the vast kingdom of Sauron. How can our heroes beat an evil like Sauron when there is so much darkness engulfing all of the Fellowship? Can Frodo be strong and face this faceless opponent?This book is by far one of the greatest fictional books that I have ever read. There is almost constant action at every turn, and it can keep a person's attention for hours on end. Tolkien has used his genius to create a world of fantasy and suspense that boggles the imagination. The twists that are placed in the book and the in depth descriptions of all the characters leave no stone unturned and leave the reader with the perfect view of all the characters. This story gives you a great sense of all the times of the real world too. The way Tolkien uses the dead marshes of Mordor as a visual of what he saw in World War II and the terrible things that occurred during that war. His depictions and transitions into different storylines are almost seamless, leaving you wanting to get through the next chapter to see what happened with the first. This book is by far one of the great fiction novels of the time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is incredibly written, and it keeps you hooked.

I liked it because Gandalf came back. I suggest that you read The Fellowship of The Rings first. This is the second book of a trilogy The Lord of the Rings.Boromir dies while defending the hobbits Merry and Pippin from Orcs. Merry and Pippin are taken towards Saruman by Orcs. Strider, also know as Aragon, Gimili and Legolas decide to rescue them rather than follow Frodo and Sam. Merry and Pippin have to run with the Orcs, and they do for 12 days until the men of Rohan attack. A sneaky Orc tries to run off with the two hobbits but he is shot. Merry and Pippin head into Fangorn. Fangorn is an old, musty, dusty forest but fangorn is also the name of an Ent or tree herded. The hobbits meet Fangorn or Treebeard who is curious about the \\"hasty\\" folk and asks them to tell their tale. When Treebeard hears about Saruman, he is outraged, for Saruman told him he cared about the forest where he was just trying to get the Ents out of his way. Treebeard gathers Ents and they go to Entmoot, a council to decide on what they are going to do. All the Ents become angry and they leave to destroy Isengard. Meanwhile Aragon, Gimili, and Legolas are on the Orc's trail and they see many clues such as dead Orc bodies on the side of the road. The Riders of Rohan are approaching so they hide in the grass. When they go by, Strider stands up. The Riders want to know all about them and they give them two horses so they can search for Merry and Pippin. Their horses are scared off in the night so they must travel by foot. When they reach the spot where the hobbits meet Treebeard they see an old man. The man is Gandalf who is now Gandalf the White. Together they go to the Lord of Rohan. Gandalf tries to council Theoden but Wormtongue, his servant, talks him out of it. Gandalf sends Wormtongue away and then Theoden decides to fight Mordor. The riders of Rohan ride to Helm's Deep where they are trapped by Orcs. Once they beat the Orcs they ride to Isengard. There they all see what damage the Ents did, they knocked down the wall and flooded it so the only thing remaining is the tower Orthanc. Merry and Pippin meet up with Aragon, Gimili, and Legolas again. They tell each other what has happened and they go with Eomer and Theoden to watch Gandalf talk to Saruman. They can't convince him to give up Orthanc. Wormtongue throws something down and Gandalf says it's of great value.Frodo and Sam climb down a cliff using their elfish rope. Gollum, who has been following them, has climbed down after them. They try to tie him up but he screams that it is biting him. Frodo makes Gollum swear on the ring to lead them to the Gates of Mordor. Gollum does leading them through marshes and valleys. When they get to the gate, Frodo knowing no other way in is trying to decide how to enter. Gollum begs him not to and tells them of another way that isn't guard so closely. The hobbits agree and they once again start walking. Sam while cooking, his fire stars to smoke and Men of Gondor find them. Frodo talks to Faramir who is Boromirs brother. Faramir tells them that Boromir is dead but he thinks the rest of the company survived. While they are talking Sam gets angry and let's slips that Frodo has the Ring, but Faramir doesn't care. The Men of Gondor capture Gollum and they leave after farewell gifts of fine wooden staffs. Gollum leads them to a tunnel where they climb the Straight Stair and the Winding Stair, and then he disappears. Frodo and Sam make their way through. They see light and Frodo runs ahead and Shelob, a giant spider who lives in the tunnel and feasts on all who enter, catches Frodo. After shaking of Gollum, Sam comes to his rescue. Sam thinking Frodo is dead takes Sting, the Phial, and the Ring. He begins to travel towards Mordor when he hears Orcs. They take Frodo and one says that he's not dead just sleeping. Sam, who is very angry with him, follows the Orcs.You'll like this book if you read the Fellowship of the Ring. If you like adventure and magic you will also like this book. This book is a challenge because there is a lot of big words. This book also has lots of battles and fighting so if you're interested in that kind of book you'll enjoy reading this."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers.

Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching. As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. And the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord Of the Rings part II The Two Towers by: J.R.R. Tolkien is a spectacular book to read. It's full of adventure, fantasy, and twists, this book has it all. It has the action, the drama, the suspence, the romance, and the comedy. You may have seen the movie, but you haven't seen anything, until you've read the book! My friend suggested I read the Fellowship of the Rings, so I did. After about 3 chapters I fell in love with it. Then I finished the book and I was upset with how long it took for me to read it. So I went and took a reading class to improve my skills. After I finished the course my friend lent me the Two Towers...I was nervous about reading it at first because of the length. Then I had a reading assignment and so I figured why don't I read this book. This time within the first two pages I felt really involved in the book.The Two Towers is the second part to the journey of Frodo Baggins, and his quest to destroy the One Ring that could bring Middle Earth to an end. It tells two different parties stories and how they fit together. One story is Frodo's story about his journey to destory the ring, and the obsticles he must overcome to continue on his quest. The second story is Aragorn(who is heir to the throne of Gondor), Legolas(an elf of the Woodland Relm), Gimli(a dwarf, Son of Gloin), Merry and Pippin's(hobbits, who are distant relatives to Frodo) story. They were his company and were supposed to lead and protect him from harm as the venture towards Mt. Doom, which is where they must go to destroy the ring. In the first book he left his companions to keep them from danger. This is their tale and what happens to them after Frodo leaves.If you are really into fantasy, action, drama, suspencful, or science fiction books, then you will love this book. I honestly thought I would hate this book, but I soon found out I was in love with it. I would recommend this book to people over 10 because of he vocabulary that J.R.R. Tolkien uses. I really love it and if you read it you will too."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Adventurous, that is one word that I us to explain Return of the King. True friends will be there until the end. This is really reflected in this book. I believe that everyone can relate, because you have been down and out, but there was someone there for you. Out of nowhere young Frodo Bagins was given the human race in his hands.In a little village called The Shire where all was quite lived hobbits. In the fires of mount doom Sauroman a ring to rule them all other rings that were given to kings, elves, and dwarves. Frodo has the ring and on his way to Mordor to destroy the ring. To help him along the way is his long time best friend is Sam Wise Gamgey. Along the way they have picked up a guide named Gollom or (Smegal). He helps them to get to Mordor but also causes some trouble.His friends Gandalph, Legolas, Arogorn, and Gimli are fighting to keep the human race from being destroyed. Arogorn the heir to the throne of Gondor has taken the sword to become king. He has been told to \\"become who he was born to be... \\"Once Frodo and Sam get to Mordor there friends distract Sauroman's army so that Frodo and Sam get in side the volcano to distroy the ring but there is a surprise, which I can't tell what that is.There are three other books before this one like The Hobbit, Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers. I recommend that you the other books before you read this one so that you know what is going on before Return of the King. I would recommend this to anyone looking for adventure, and excitement these are the books to do so. In the books you learn more about the characters and the impact that I has on their lives."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Excellent book. I love the time and thought that Tolkein put into his charcaters."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In only the form that Tolkien can give, we find that the Fellowship has all but split apart, where frodo and sam head of towards Mordor, while Strider and the others go off to save pippin and merry from a horrible death.The books takes the reader more in depth, emotionally and otherwise, with the main characters. We find that the fellowship has only been split up physically. Everyone is starting to find the strength in themselves to go on and fight for what they believe in even if it spells out their own death.This book is another reason why Tolkien is one of the best writers of his generation. A very moving book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"LOTR III: The Return of the Kings, like the other works of Tolkien on Middle-Earth, is very time-consuming and yet truly worth your time. If you have the time I would advise you to read this."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"At long last I read the final volume all the way through on my third stab at the trilogy. I've just always run out of gas after the first 1000 or so pages so it made sense to just start with this one and give it the attention it deserves (especially after seeing the film). I was suprised at how much I enjoyed the journey of the hobbits back to the Shire to kick some hindquarters as toughened warriors. Also, this was the first time for me that a book (or movie) took the time to delve into the feelings of the protagonists as their heroic climax passes and they fade back into to normal life. I found it useful in my own life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read this book 4 times, and expect to read it perhaps 20 or more times before I die.Such a book as deep and priceless as this simply cannot be written and marketed in todays shallow consumerist world. This book is a priceless treasure. When I finish the Return of the King, I can feel it in my bones for several weeks afterwards. The sadness and nobility of this work of art lingers like a sword-wound from a wraith, though immensly pleasurable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger.\\" The second book in the trilogy of the lord of the rings. The book starts with the company broken into to three groups; one group is Arogorn, Legolas, and Gimli. The other group is the made up of the hobbits Sam and Frodo, Frodo is the leader of the fellowship. The final and most pitiful group is the group with Marry and Pippin the two other hobbits who have been stolen by orcs and are on there way to Isengard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili are following marry and pippin day and night. Sam and Frodo are headed to Morodor but are lost in a endless fog of ridges and hills. On their way to catch Marry and Pippin the men of Rohan slottered all the orcs and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili are know looking for Marry and Pippins. They meet up with pippin and Marry in the most unlikely of places. Sam and Frodo come across some very unfortunate encounters.I would recommend this book to adventurous people. If you really love the Middle Ages this is a great book. The book goes along at a rather slow pace. If I could find one downfall of this book it would be too much description. But overall it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This review will tell you a brief report on The Return of the King by J.R.R Tolkein. The book starts off with Sam and Frodo adventuring. They run into many hardships. Then the war at Minas Tirith takes place. Many casualties happen in the war but in the midst of fighting Sauron's forces just disappear. If you want to know what happened... READ THE BOOK!This book was really good. It pulls you in so you can't stop reading until you finish. This is one of the major parts in the book that really amazed me. I also liked how Tolkein wrote this book. The writing really was astonishing and I think he used exactly the right words. Another element that I found in this book that was phenomenal is that he describes things in the book very well. Obviously Tolkein has a wonderful talent for writing and I feel that this book was excellent.I did not dislike this book at all. Although I wish Tolkein could describe the characters more and the scenery that a certain character is in. The other thing I did not like was that sometimes things could be too long in this book, which would make some parts boring. This was one feeling I hated when reading this book because it is pretty lengthy. The last but not least thing that I did not like about this book is that sometimes I couldn't understand at times what Tolkein was trying to say because he uses advanced vocabulary, which is why this book is not for kids. This book was wonderful but if Tolkein could fix the problems that I mentioned it would be breathtaking. Overall I did not think that this book was bad at all.I would recommend this book to any adult or young adult who loves fantasy and enjoys a long sit-down because this book is very lengthy. In my opinion before I read this wonderful book I would read the first two books of this trilogy. Thank you for reading my report I hope you liked it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of The King concludes the adventures of the people of middle-earth that were chronicled in The Fellowship of The Ring and then in The Two Towers. As in the previous two installments The Return of The King is divided into two books, Book 5 and Book 6.Book 5 takes place in the land of Gondor, one of the last resisting outposts to the dark forces of Sauron. New characters are introduced such as the evil king of nazgul, Dernhelm the warrior of Rohan and most notably Denethor, the steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir who is now living in his twilight years. The characters of Faramir and Eowyn are also expanded on in considerable detail. In preparation of Sauron's dark forces waging a battle against Gondor, Aragorn gathers around his armies to fight back. Pippin and Gandalf ride into Gondor and Pippin becomes part of the towerguard. Many people of Rohan also join Gondor in the fight, including Dernhelm, King Theoden and Merry, who was left behind in The Two Towers. As the forces of Sauron approach and the great battle begins, Denethor slips into madness and becomes suicidal, wanting to pull his own son Faramir down with him.It's not until halfway through the novel, in book 6, that we get to read about Sam and Frodo. After a climactic battle in the tower of Cirith Ungol against the giant spider Shelob, Frodo is captured and now a prisoner of the Orcs. Sam however has managed to escape with the ring. His first instinct tells him that he must now carry on the quest to destroy the ring by himself but as loneliness and the weight of the ring bears in on him, he decides to turn around and attempt to rescue Frodo. As Sam and Frodo continue their journey and etch closer and closer to the fires of Mount Doom, they encounter several obstacles along the way, including marching armies of Orcs and the ever-looming presence of the slinking creature Gollum.Book 5 and book 6 are quite different in tone and structure. Book 5 is admitedly very wordy and talkative. There are lots of slow passages and in-depth character development that often made me wonder whether I really was reading the conclusion to one of the greatest epics of all time. The battle sequence is only described over 20 pages or so. The author does not go into great detail attempting to describe it however, he places such vivid images in the head of the reader that we can easily picture in our minds what is going on. The reward for reading through the at-times murky first half of the novel is that when we fnally get to follow the adventures of Sam and Frodo in Book 6 the action becomes non-stop and the suspense never lets up. Tolkien is so good at describing their journey that he managed to make me feel what the charactes were feeling. As I was reading, I actually started to feel hungry, thirsty, physically drained and increasingly sympathetic towards Sam's frustration with Gollum's antics.Curiously, by the time Sam and Frodo's journey comes to an end, there is still about 100 pages to go. These first few pages start off with reunions, gatherings and farewells. As I was reading these first few pages, I started to worry about the the daunting prospect of having to read through 100 pages of farewells and sob stories but it turns out ol' Tolkien had a few more tricks up his sleeve. As the hobbits return to the Shire, they discover one last major obstacle awaiting them. These pages are easily among some of the best in the entire series.Reading The Return of The King on the eve of its theatrical release, I can barely contain my excitement and anticipation at seeing the spider Shelob, the cracks of Mount Doom and especially the battle of Gondor put to film. It is rumoured that the battle of Gondor will be the biggest battle scene in cinematic history. In an interview I read Peter Jackson mentions that the grandeur of this battle will easily eclipse the epic battlle at Helm's Deep in The Two Towers. To give an idea of just how big the battle will be consider this: At Helm's Deep there were approximately 300 middle-earthians defending the wall and 10000 Orcs trying to barge through it. Well, multiply the number of people behind the wall by 5 and the number of Orcs by 7 and that will be the battle of Gondor.Suffice to say, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I find The Return of The King to be the most satisfying part of the trilogy. And as for the slow moments, they are alleviated by Tolkien's beautiful artistic prose filled with ultra-clever metaphors. There is a difference between simply reading Tolkien and understanding Tolkien and I am quite pleased to see that other reviewers have enjoyed this book as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would have to say this Lord of the Rings book is the best of all three. It is so well written and the story is just beautiful. This is the one where all of the emotion is put out and you just want to cry in some parts or just become so tense that you feel as if you're in the battle of the Pelennor fields or on the cracks of doom. Pure beauty and a must read for ages to come for all ages."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I learned what tears of joy and tears of exquisite beauty were the first time I read this book. I have relearned that those happy things in each of the 20 odd times I have read this. Truth and beauty lie here like stones on the ground just waiting for you to pick them up. Enter Middle Earth with an open heart and you will find things you never dreamt of. I just bought a ticket to watch \\"The Return of the King\\" by myself. Alone because I know those tears will flow and I don't want any silly self consciousness to get in the way of enjoying seeing with my eyes a depiction what has brought such great joy to me in reading."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King by J.R.R. Tolkien is the third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book holds the final conclusion to the magical journey the \\"fellowship\\" has undertaken. Like the second book, the Two Towers, the first half of the book is devoted to the fight between men and evil, where the second part of the story chronicles Master Samwise and Frodo's quest to destroy the ring! What I liked about the book was the vivid description of the battles in the first half as well as the look in to some of the lesser known characters backgrounds and stories (Eowyn and Faramir most notably). The buildup to this conclusion had been so great and developed in the first two books, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, that I was a little concerned it might be too much for Tolkien to unwind. However I totally underestimated him as he brilliantly concluded the storyline in a series of well described battles and undertakings. Yet he does not stop there, after the final deed is done he still leaves a little bit of story to tell about the return to the Shire for the Hobbits.The theme of this book most undoubtedly is the rise up of smaller men (hobbits) to heroic proportions. Although this is a commonly seen theme in literature, no one has mastered it quite like Tolkien did in this trilogy of books. It is a very inspiring story to read and you can almost feel for Frodo because of the burden he has undertaken in the destruction of the ring. One can relate to Frodo when they feel like they have a burden they most get rid of and Tolkien makes it so we can confide in Frodo's story be it fantasy or not.Not only would I recommend this book to people, I think of it as a must read for all. I do however recommend reading the trilogy from start to finish not skipping books or jumping around. This way you will see the transition of growth for each character throughout the series. \\"And that's the end of that,\\" said Sam. \\"A nasty end, and I wish I needn't have seen it; but it's a good riddance.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is a must getter!

Frodo and Sam are trying to get into Mordor, they're getting led by a mysterious creature! Will the fellowship ever get back together? Read this book to find out! I would definitely recommend this book to a friend!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King, to me, represented the climax of the greatest trilogy of the twentieth century. It begins as in medias res as it gets. We jump in to the journeys of Gandalf (the White since The Two Towers) to the great city of Minas Tirith in Gondor, the land of men. Tolkien does a great job, as in most of his novels, of displaying the setting with such vivid words that the reader needs only to sit back and watch the world move in front of him. Gloom is foreshadowed for all races of Middle Earth as they know that their only hope lies with two little hobbits of which the whereabouts are unknown. Battle is inevitable and preparations are made for such a war that the earth has never seen. It's putting it mildly to say the people were skeptical about where they would be a year from that moment. Later, in Book 6 (chapters in the trilogy) of the series, the setting immediately jumps to Frodo an Sam and their journey to the hopeful destruction of the great Ring of power in the dark lands of Mordor, more specifically Mount Doom. Many suspenseful and thought provoking situations present themselves to the reader as they are taken along for a journey through the most evil of all places in Middle Earth. The book served as a great close to a great series in which many real life situations are symbolized in the lives of different people working together for a common cause."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After finishing the second book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers, I rushed out and got this one immediately. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.Although, I enjoyed the second book a little more than this one, this is still an exciting conclusion to the series and is a must read. I especially liked the part with Gollum and the two hobbits traveling together. While they are tempted several times to kill Gollum for his wickedness, something prevents them and in the end it saves everything.I thought this was an interesting message. While I am firm believer in free-will... sometimes you just don't know what fate has in store for you. This book is a great story about believing in your mission in life and having faith that if you press on fate will come to your aid, even if it's in an unexpected way.I wish there were more writers out there who would take on such stories and handle them as masterfully as Tolkien has done."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the final book in The Lord of the Rings series. One part of the book follows Frodo, the bearer of a dark and mysterious ring, and his loyal companion Sam, through the final stage of their journey to Mount Doom. They have been sent to destroy the evil ring by throwing it back into the place of its origin, The Cracks of Doom. Along the way, the two wanderers encounter many difficulties and hazardous obstacles in their path, including the small and shrew Gollum who is intent on getting \\"his\\" ring back or die trying.The other part of the book follows Aragorn, the noble warrior, and his companions as they battle the massive forces of the dark Lord Sauron. The battle between the two armies is the classic war of good versus evil, but with intriguing characters and extensive detail. You have the remaining group of the fellowship of the ring in this intense battle, including Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Aragorn the Ranger, and the small but bold hobbits Merry and Pippin.Overall, this is an amazing book. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that I had trouble getting started with it, due to the slow beginning. J.R.R. Tolkien makes up for it however, with suspenseful battles and beautiful descriptions. The thing I liked most about the book was the ending. It is hard to describe, but it is extraordinary and keeps you thinking even once you've finished. I highly recommend this book and would've given it four and three-quarters stars out of five, only because of the ending."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well this book was cool. i am very glad i read it. i owe this to all my firends who encouragedm e to read this. it was well worht it and glad i got the chance. please do read it. it was the best."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In an outstanding second book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, JRR Tolkien continues the saga of Frodo and the Fellowship.

It is a must read for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers tells two stories. First, it tells of the defeat of Saruman. This is Pippin and Merry's part of the story. With some help from Ents (walking &amp; talking trees), Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Eomer, Theoden and the newly resurrected Gandalf, the power of the traitor wizard Saruman is broken. In the second half of the novel, Frodo and Sam are lead to Mordor by Gollum. But Gollum, try as he might, cannot overcome the corruption of the ring; and his obsession to repossess it leads to betrayal. Wonderfully poetic, fun at some places, sad and dark in others, this is a novel not to be missed. If you don't have a copy, get one and read it. If you have read it, read it again. It never gets old.

I will say, though, that everything wraps up nicely (although not to most readers' &quot;good triumphs evil completely&quot; expectations) in this third installment of Lord Of The Rings.Don't read this book before reading the other two. That might go without saying, but don't even think about it. You will be lost.Again, the book is rich with Tolkien's gorgeous prose. You'll probably never read prose so beautifully wrought by any modern writer out there. I think I will tackle the series a second time when I am older so I can read it aloud to my children.I would say also that there are some nice spiritual undercurrents to this book that makes it fabulous from a moral perspective. You are not just reading a fairy tale, you are learning a bit about courage, duty, honesty and virtue. It's a big book to wrap your mind around, but congratulations to everyone who has journeyed through the first two books to Return Of The King. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the second volume of Tolkien's masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. There is nothing else that has ever come close to comparing to it - although many have tried. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is a wonderful second volume for Middle Earth - it concentrates on Merry and Pippin's adventures. Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity. Every fan of fantasy should read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least once in their lives. My very highest recommendation for any fantasy book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I give this book a 5 for its rating. Three reasons why I liked this book are it has great details because it always describs and tells you where the characters are in the book. The second reason why i liked this book is it tells you who the person is and sometimes it tells who there father is. Another reason is it has alot of action in it. It tells you whats happening in a battle. I would recommend this book to teenagers and above because it has alot of violence in it. The book is mostly about a war with good vs evil. Another reason why i would recommend this book to teenagers and above because it has alot of hard words to read and little kids won't know what they mean.I really liked this book and if you read it I hope you like it alot."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is one of the best books i have ever read. it starts out with boromir defending pippin and merry from orcs sent by the evil one, and from that point inward this book never disappoints. if you enjoyed the fellowship, hold on. this book will take you through many twists and turns as far as the plot. however, try to have the return of the king handy when you finish. the end will leave you hanging so much all that you can think about is wat happens to frodo and sam. nevertheless, this book is a classic and should be read by almost anyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"To the first part of this amazing trilogy I give 4 stars, because of some boring parts, but to the second part, The Two Towers, I give 5 stars without thinking too much. The story starts with the fall of Boromir that was killed by the Orcs. From there it is told how the rest of the Company straggled on in their journey, and how Sam and Frodo tamed Gollum and went to Mordor, the Land of Shadow. I started reading this story and I couldn't stop. I liked every single chapter of this book - there was no boring parts. If you like fantasies and adventures I highly recommend this trilogy, you don't know what you're missing. And about the author, JRR Tolkien - it's true what they say: a storyteller of genius! In two words - ama zing!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"i've read the book THE LORD OF THE RINGS (I, II AND III) AND I FIND IT VERY AMUSING AND IT MAKES MY MIND MORE IMAGINATIVE. I HAVE ALSO READ THE SILMARILLION AND STILL LOOKING FOR THE MAP OF MIDDLE EARTH. IT'S FANTASTIC AND GREAT."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Two Towers, writer J.R.R Tolkien mixes the ideas of a traditional fantasy with the complex features of secret languages and complex descriptions. These ideal characteristics are what contribute to an ideal fantasy novel that was once the best seller for ages and ages. The book itself is a fantasy-adventure novel and its point of view is normally the simple third person, although there are a few parts where it changes to the first person point of view. The actual theme of the book is to fight to win an adventure, and to success by winning freedom. The Two Towers is actually part two of a three book series called The Lord of the Rings. Therefore this book is actually like the meat of the series, in which all the details and difficult transitions are stored. A young hobbit (creatures who are small, plump and live in holes), Frodo Baggins, is heir to a secret ring, a ring of powers beyond the skeptical minds of all humans. His primary mission is to get rid of this ring, for it corrupts people through greed and wants. He chooses to take the way of destroying the ring through going to the dangerous lands of Mordor, where the dark lord Sauron, lies on his throne. In The Fellowship of the Ring (part one of the series) Frodo begins his adventure with a small wizard called Gandalf, who is to be his chief guide throughout the journey. Frodo then sets his backpack to finally start on his dangerous adventure to the dark lands of Mordor. With him he takes Sam Gamgee, a trusted servant of his and a few friends including Gimli, the dwarf, Merry the hobbit and Pippin the hobbit. He passes throughout many adventures including the mysterious Black Riders and being stabbed by one of them. Yet still, at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo ends up reaching his goal for the time, the Elven House. There a counsel gathers to discuss matters about the ring and such other things. They decide who to bring with Frodo and who not to, yet meanwhile war tensions were going greater as the dark forces started to pile up and head for Minas Tirith (the war fortress of the good) to start that legendary battle of good and evil. Meanwhile in The Two Towers, Frodo finally decides to go to Mordor by himself because he found himself to be a bother towards his other comrades in this adventure. Tensions in Minas Tirith start to grow more and more and the land is filled with terror, terror of war. While Frodo is on his way to Mordor alone, Pippin and Merry get lost together and are caught by the terrible orcs. Then due to a little quarrel, they were able to escape and reunite with Gandalf and everyone else. Also, as time goes by, Pippin and crew reunite with Frodo and travel a long and harsh way to Mordor with many mischievous happenings. Then they all stop at the border of Mordor, looking at the dark land with a sign of trouble. The Two Towers is an extremely intriguing and breath-taking story. Tolkien uses complex descriptions and imaginary locations to combine with the traditional elements of a fantasy novel, creating an extremely successful series and novel. So far, I view this book as the best in the series and I highly recommend this book with my rating of 10/10. It always keeps you intensified and is always a pleasure to read. The reading level of this book is for junior adults for the book itself does not use complex vocabulary but rather has small print and has a reasonable amount of pages. Also, it is practically impossible to compare this to any other book because it is to good for comparison. Even the Redwall series from Brian Jaque&iexcl;s is definitely no match for Tolkien&iexcl;s The Lord of the Rings. Therefore it is highly recommended that you read this book for it was a big pleasure for me to be able to read it and it was also a very fun book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The greatness of Tolkien's work is that he seems to be describing a world that has always existed.

This book has, of course, started with the long Minas Tirith chapter, with Pippin and Gandalf. Pippin meets the citizens. Then, it goes over to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's point of view. Aragorn has to live out his destiny of becoming king. Next, there's Merry back in Rohan. Merry just does something. It transitions towards those points while the battle of Pelenor Fields is about to begin, and Aragorn is trying to return to his home nation of Gondor so he can get the throne. But, it goes over to what I think is the climax (Sam in Cirith Ungol attempting to rescue Frodo). Sam, the real hero, and Frodo are trying to destroy the One Ring once and for all in the Cracks of Doom. Sauron still continues to carry out his men to eradicate Gondor and Rohan's men. The battle between fate begins...This is (so far) my favorite book ever! Although, it takes long to read, you'll get immersed into it if you have a strong imagination. It's full of specific details and hordes of excitement. You may not expect the ending, but you'll love it. Better than 'The Hobbit'! You'll get it if you're in high school. No matter what you do, buy that book! If you're a hardcore fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, this is the book for you. Yes!!! - Nathan"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What is more important in a book than the characters or the storyline of action and adventure? In Lord of the Rings the Return of the King, Tolkien creates an immense variety of important and interesting characters. These characters form a fascinating story that wouldn't be the same without them. Some of my favorite characters are Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. These characters are the heroes, but what would the story be without villains for the heroes to battle? Among the ranks of these villains are the Dark Lord Sauron, his puppets Saruman the wise, the Nazgul, as well as the many Orcs and Uruk- Hai that are their slaves. These characters are of many races. For example Legolas is an elf and Gimli is a Dwarf.Tolkien creates a mystical story that demands to be read over and over again. This book, which is the third book in the Lord of The Rings trilogy, is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read. When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this book in nineteen fifty- six, the thirst of readers for fantasy was extraordinarily great. This trilogy provided a quench of this extraordinary thirst for fantasy. This masterfully written book which is in my opinion the centerpiece of J.R.R. Tolkien's career, is probably his all-time best."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"On my grandson's Xmas list. He was pleased with the larger print and I was pleased with the price!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As with the Fellowship, this is a really terrific book. Mr. Inglis has the perfect voice for these readings (referring to the whole series). Highly recommend to other fans."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" continues \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" history in two books after the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring as the first part follows Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Merry and Pippin the Hobbits seeing as the second half addresses the eventful journey of Frodo and Samwise the Hobbits towards the land of Mordor. The author expertly introduces more fascinating creatures, timeless scenarios, and awesome battles in a dark and ominous fantasy.Continuing the creative progression, amazing entities such as an Ent or objects like the palantir provide further depth to a phenomenal epic. Insight into the menacing Enemy forces arrayed against the good people of Middle-earth is realized with the many layers of deception and intrigue while maintaining a sensible yet young reading level. Shocking reunions and unforgettable events deliver quality entertainment with subtle environmental messages.Unlike most novels, \\"The Two Towers\\" divides the separate group plotlines from the original Fellowship instead of intermixing them down a chronological perspective. The method might be confusing but minor references and a moderately short time span helps organize the proceedings.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Certainly a key to the success of The Lord of the Rings is that it came along at the precise point in history that it did, but there's another factor, I think, that helps account for its continued popularity today. I don't know of any other book that can be enjoyed so thoroughly on so many different levels, based on so many different understandings of the story it tells.Is the ending of the story a happy one (Sauron defeated, Aragorn claiming his rightful kingship) or sad (the passing of the elves and magic from the world, Frodo injured beyond Earthly healing)? Did Frodo fail at the moment of truth, and does that make him any less a hero? Is Sam, with his simpleminded country subbornness, a hero for his stubborn pursuit of the quest, or a fool for his stubborn refusal to acknowledge any good in Gollum, to feel any pity, which spoiled any chance of Gollum's redemption? Are the most significant powers of Gandalf and the Nazgul their magic abilities or the emotions (hope vs. fear) they instill? What sort of power does the Ring symbolize?How you answer these questions depends on who you are and where you are in life. The wonderful thing about these books is that as we grow, so do they. They can be enjoyed purely and unquestioningly on the surface tale they tell, a modern myth of action and heroism, but they have depths equalled only by the deepest tree roots. Saying that you should read these books is like telling a man in the desert to drink water. My suggestion is rather that you re-read these books regularly to see how your perception of them changes, and what those changes may say about yourself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ok... who is this Tolkien guy and where did he get the brians, time, and insight to write the perfect set novels.As most readers know, charactor development is a time consuming effort that sometimes leaves us readers in bad shape but here it's just a pleaseure to see them grow and adhere themselves to you.

This novel contains more action and is faster-paced than \\"Fellowship of the Rings.\\" As the reader has been already acquainted with much of the lore and mythology of Middle Earth, Tolkien seeks a quicker pace in their adventure tale.Tolkien continues to paint a mythological world of wonder and enchantment. The battle scenes are particularly vivid, as the Rohan riders and the fellowship attempt to stave off an assault by Orcs. Through brilliant detail, Tolkien delivers a graphic and realistic picture of a heroic battle. Indeed, Tolkien's skill for painting masterful pictures in the reader's mind continues. Although Tolkien is not flowery in his language, he nonetheless presents the sweeping battle scenes and panoramic vistas in a straightforward, yet illustrious manner.Throughout this novel, the importance of fellowship and friendship become more evident. Sam and Frodo elicit a friendship bond that may be stronger than brotherhood. Although they were certainly close at the start of their epic, their bond has grown stronger. Their loyalty to each other cannot be broken - not by Gollum, the Orcs, or any other evil creature or power. Legolas and Grimli also put aside historic animosity between elves and dwarves and become battle-tested companions. Although they may not be as close as Sam and Frodo, they display the same loyalty and camaraderie that are essential to the strength of the fellowship, and the foundation of victory for the forces of good.Saruman remains a stark reminder of the ability of absolute power to corrupt. Although he was once the highest and most trust-worthy of wizards, he has evolved into a calculating, power-hungry fiend. It is the power and lure of the One Ring that has corrupted him and turned a once powerful ally into a hideous enemy.The character of Sam continues to develop from a comic sidekick to a true hero. By the end of the novel, Sam has become a noble hero and combatant. Although he is still a pudgy hobbit, he shows valor in the face of adversary. Although he briefly abandons Frodo when he thinks all hope is lost, he quickly understands that his role may not be as the ultimate hero, but as Frodo's loyal companion, come what may. Indeed, Tolkien reminds us that one need not might and strength to become a hero, for the potential to be a hero resides in all of us, no matter how small and insignificant we may deem ourselves.The narrative leaves us hanging, as the \\"Return of the King\\" will bring us the conclusion of their quest. Yet, even though their quest may end, Tolkien will no doubt leave open many mysteries and legends of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As the last volume of the trilogy, the reader gets an end to the story, and in fact \\"The Return of the King\\" has several places where one could end, but for those who want to continue on past the end of Sauron, past the end of the War, etc., the story continues to the end of the Third Age. \\"The Return of the King\\" was originally published on October 20th of 1955. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was the last recipient of the International Fantasy Award for Fiction in 1957, it was also nominated for the Hugo for all-time series in 1966, and was nominated from 2002 through 2008 for the Prometheus Hall of Fame award, before winning it in 2009. As with the previous two volumes, this one contains two books.Book V is titled \\"The War of the Ring\\" and it returns to the story of all those outside of the Ring Bearers. It starts with Gandalf and Pippin arriving at Minas Tirith to deliver the news to Denethor and takes us to the start of the battle in front of the Black Gate of Mordor. This book tells the story of a large number of characters. Only the ring-bearers are absent as characters, though they are certainly in the thoughts of those who fight the war.Book VI is titled \\"The End of the Third Age\\", though it has also been called \\"The Return of the King\\" and similar to Book IV it is starts out focused on Frodo and Sam, with the specter of Gollum tagging along. Starting with Sam's daring rescue of Frodo, it continues with the two trying to make their way to Mount Doom. However, the changes less than a third of the way through the book, when their quest comes to an end, and the rest of the book involves all the characters again. Unlike many modern books and movies, the action doesn't end with the climax, and Tolkien takes his time telling the story of the aftermath of the war.As with the previous books in the series when compared with the movie I personally prefer the book, though I have enjoyed the all the movies as well. However long the movies are, they are but condensed versions of the books, and if left unread, you will miss out on many significant characters and events, as well as be unaware of the changes made by those creating the movies from what was written originally. The movies were a valiant effort to bring this epic to the screen, and they honor Tolkien's overall story, but to fully appreciate what Tolkien created, you need to read the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I had the hard back books which had great maps, but they where old and very musty. I bought the Kindle version and it had maps not as good to read as hardback books foldout maps. It was great to not have to bring the heavy books on our summer trips. I had read the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings when I was a teenager, I loved them and if possible loved them even more as an adult. My son would jump up and down with excitement as I read. I recommend these books for kids 8 and above and for all adults!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I remember reading an article where the author discussed which towers were possibly the two towers referred to in the title of the second novel of \\"The Lord of The Rings\\". Candidates included Ortanc, Barad-dr, Ecthelion, Minas Morgul, and Cirith Ungol. One could have included the Hornburg in the list as well, but this particular discussion did not include it. The author discussed several pairs of options, but for me the answer was simple, as it indicates at the end of authorized Ballentine edition of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" that it is Ortahnc and Minus Morgal and that is where the action is focused for most of the two books contained in the \\"The Two Towers\\". However, if you watch the film, it strongly points to two towers as Orthanc and Barad-dr. To confuse matters more, there is a letter from Tolkien to Rayner Unwin where he states that the two towers are Orthanc and Cirith Ungol, but remember that it wasn't Tolkien that split the work into three volumes and he was never happy with the title, and apparently he changed his mind later as he is the author of the note I mentioned above. Of course, to enjoy the book it really doesn't matter which two towers the title actually refers to, but it was an interesting discussion.I believe that the second volume of a trilogy is the most difficult one to evaluate. The reader is coming into a story which has already begun, and left with no real ending. In the case of \\"The Two Towers\\", Tolkien navigates those difficulties quite well. Though certainly one should read \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" first, there is a brief synopsis, and while each of the two books in the volume leaves the story hanging a bit, they are certainly reasonable places to leave the story off. \\"The Two Towers\\" was originally published on November 11th of 1954.Book III is titled \\"The Treason of Isengard\\" and covers the stories of all the characters except Frodo and Sam (who are the subjects of Book IV). It starts where Book II left off, with Aragorn hearing Boromir's horn. This book introduces numerous new characters such as Treebeard, &Eacute;omer, King Th&eacute;oden, Lady &Eacute;owyn, and of course Grima Wormtongue. It is a tale rich in characters, and in large battles, heroism, and last ditch efforts. The book ends with victory against Saruman, but that is over-shadowed by the coming battle with Sauron and the forces of Mordor, as well as the lack of knowledge of what has become to Frodo and Sam.Book IV is titled \\"The Ring Goes East\\", though it has also been called \\"The Journey of the Ringbearers\\" and by contrast with Book III there are very few characters. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are the main characters of this book, though we do meet Faramir during the tale of the ring-bearers as they take the ring to Mordor. This book as a darker ending than Book III, as the book closes with Frodo having been poisoned by the venom of Shelob and has been taken by the enemy, with Sam struggling to rescue him.As with the first book in the series when compared with the movie, I personally prefer the book, though I have enjoyed the movie as well. However long the movie is, it is a condensed version of the book, and you will miss out on many significant characters and events, as well as be unaware of the changes which were made for whatever reason. The movies were a valiant effort to bring this effort to the screen, and they honor Tolkien's overall story, but to fully appreciate what Tolkien created, you need to read the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I decided to revisit this wonderful tail and read all the way through for once. The Lord of the Rings for me is more than just a story, it's a tale of love and heartache, perseverance and triumph, shadow and dispair, loss and sorrow but also victory and friendship.

Don't miss it; it's worth every dime, and this is one audiobook that you WON'T be selling to buy another."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, \\"Sword and Sorcery,\\" by creatingThe Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of \\"High Fantasy,\\" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entireSILMARILLIONlegendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day. A history of the speakers of the \\"Elvish Tongues,\\" it grew out of Tolkien's invention of those tongues. Like a classical composer, Tolkien was compelled to put his favorite sounds down on paper, and once having done so, wove a history around the development of the languages he created, which were based, in part, on Finnish (Quenya, or High-Elven) and Welsh (Sindarin, or Grey-Elven).The legendarium backed into published existence when Tolkien wrote down an episodic bedtime story he had been telling his children over the years. As written down and published it becameThe Hobbit, the story of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his amazing journey \\"there and back again\\" to wrest a treasure from a dragon. Willy-nilly, it contained elements of his legendarium, and quite unexpectedly, it became a best-seller when published in 1937.With his publishers clamoring for a sequel, Tolkien sat down to write it. It took him twelve years to complete, finally seeing the light of day as THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I first read THE TWO TOWERS back in 1976, just as Tolkien's work began to enjoy a resurgence. Having been embraced by 1950s longhairs, and then by 1960s counterculturists who loved its vision of a pastoral and unspoiled Middle-Earth, we in the late 1970s valued it for its escapism (and not a little for the in-joke of good-natured, laid-back Hobbits indulging in \\"pipe-weed\\"). Tolkien's popularity amongst my generation spawned the publication of THE SILMARILLION, the republication of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT in leatherbound editions with typo-corrected texts, and the production of aJ.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King)in those years.I own the leatherbound editions, and the old Ballantine boxed set editions (seen here) copyrighted 1966 (which I bought in 1976). It's tough to carry the leatherbound editions around (or even read them in bed) and my Ballantine editions have fallen apart due to re-reading and age, so I bought a new boxed set. I'm glad to see that the text in the new set is the corrected text, though the maps in the old paperback edition were larger and clearer.Despite being called a \\"trilogy,\\" THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy in any real sense. Tolkien conceived THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a single volume comprising six books (plus appendices) but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, \\"The First Journey\\" or \\"The Ring Sets Out\\"; Book II, \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" or \\"The Ring Goes South\\"; Book III, \\"The Treason of Isengard\\"; Book IV, \\"The Journey of the Ring-bearers\\" or \\"The Ring Goes East\\"; Book V, \\"The War of the Ring\\"; and Book VI, \\"The End of the Third Age\\".Tolkien accepted, but did not like, the publisher-created titles, the ones most readers know. He felt that THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was properly descriptive, but felt that THE RETURN OF THE KING gave away the ending of the story. He preferred THE WAR OF THE RING for the third volume. THE TWO TOWERS is the most obscure of the titles. Does the name refer to Saruman's Isengard and Sauron's Barad-Dur, or to Gondor's Minas Tirith and Mordor's Minas Morgul, or for that matter to the Tower of Cirith Ungol? It could be any of these combinations or others.In synopsis, it is belatedly discovered that The Ring held by the Hobbit Frodo Baggins is the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than two thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.THE TWO TOWERS is the second publisher-created volume. It begins right where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ends. The storyline of THE TWO TOWERS divides in three: Boromir, killed by Orcs at the end of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is laid to rest by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who then set out in a seemingly hopeless pursuit of the Orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin. In the course of their pursuit they meet up with Gandalf The White, travel to the Kingdom of Rohan, and bring Rohan into the War, fighting the great Battle of Helm's Deep against the corrupt wizard Saruman.Even as the Battle of Helm's Deep goes on, Merry and Pippin, having escaped the clutches of the Orcs, flee into Fangorn Forest where they become friends with Treebeard the Ent who leads his people against Saruman himself at Saruman's redoubt of Isengard. (In a book filled with invented races and their languages, Tolkien's Ents, a race of living, walking, speaking trees is a stroke of brilliance, a paean to the trees and woods he loved so much.)Frodo and Sam leave the Fellowship in secret and set out to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast. Along the way, they ally themselves with Gollum, the deranged Hobbit who had held The Ring for some 500 years, who acts as their guide into the Black Land.Considering the complexities of maintaining the three storylines, Tolkien demonstrates incredible care in his storytelling. This is not simply authorship, it is the detailed craftsmanship of a master wordsmith. The Moon is in a consistent phase across all three storylines and the weather varies locally but is referenced across-the-board. In all my re-readings of THE TWO TOWERS I have found only two unforced errors: That of Faramir the Captain of Gondor, who rejects The Ring in passing (although, to be fair to Tolkien, he never actually sees it), and the fact that Sam puts on The Ring within the boundaries of Mordor but is not discovered (Frodo, who does so later, is perceived by Sauron).Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, sets a high standard for fantasy authors who come after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail.Thus, we are allowed to experience, \\"the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night.\\" The trees are \\"great ilexes of huge girth standing dark and solemn in wide glades,\\" the Valley of the Tower of Sorcery, itself illuminated with \\"a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light,\\" is filled with \\"shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers . . . beautiful yet horrible of shape like the demented forms in an uneasy dream.\\" Even in a battle scene, there comes, \\"A blare of trumpets . . . a crash and a flash of flame and darkness.\\" And of Shelob, the monstrous spider of Cirith Ungol, Tolkien writes, \\"All living things were her food and her vomit darkness.\\"This is poetry. Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. \\"Aiya E&auml;rendil Elenion Ancalima! Hail E&auml;rendil, brightest of stars!\\" THE TWO TOWERS deserves as many stars as it can get."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is a awesome book. i loved this book alot. i thought that it was done very well. lord of the rings is definitly a classic series. the return of the king brings it to a great conclusion and a great end. fantastic book. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My 10 yr old wanted to watch the movies... Told him he had to read the books first. He finished Fellowship of the Ring in 1 week and Two Towers in 3 days.

But I suppose that is what truly great art does -- hits people in different places and gets them talking. In my opinion, I agree that at some points the story did seem to drag a little, but the adventure more than makes up for it. For me, the first half of the book was not all that interesting, being mostly battle -- however, there were some significant plot twists (such as the return of Gandalf and Pippin looking in the stone) and new characters (such as Treebeard and the ents) that made it worth reading. (For what it's worth, I absolutely LOVED the ents!!) The second half of the book is what really held my interest, being the journey of Frodo and Sam led by Gollum through the mountains. The dialogue between Smeagol and his alter-ego Gollum is most fascinating, and the character development (especially of Sam) is profound. The characters really grow and change throughout their journey, but at the core is their extremely strong friendship."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read some of the other reviews here and I'm surprised how much people's reactions are spread across the board.

So to all Lord Of The Rings fans, I say HALLELUJA!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I'm on the plus side of 50 and I'm finding it more difficult to see the small print in some books.

Still a favorite. There are moments when I read this book where I can hear the call by Theoden as he leads Rohan to Gondors aid. I can smell the ash in Mordor as Frodo and Sam make their way across the barren lands and creep up the side of the mountain.What is amazing to me is that, for a book that is centered so solely about the Ringbearer and his quest, there is actually not that much time devoted to Frodo and Sam. There is always so much happening, battles and the rallying taking place to get to those battles. But all the while, as I read about these huge scenes and feel the enormity of them, I also feel how closely tied everything is and how small the world is in the sense that if Frodo fails - Middle Earth fails.I have a few favorite moments in The Return of the King. One the movie did fantastically well, the other was completely ignored by the movie.The first is, of course, Eowyn's battle with the Lord of the Nazgul. If Middle Earth were a real place, if we were allowed to go there and to live in whichever place we choose I wouldn't choose the peaceful land of the Shire, the cold beauty of Lothlorian or the regal beauty of Minas Tirith. I'd choose Rohan. The strength of character in the men there is apparent even through the treachery of Wormtongue. (And I have to admit having a bit of a crush on Eomer - even more so than on Aragorn). Eowyn facing down the Lord of the Nazgul is such a powerful scene that even as I think back on it, my heart leaps into my throat and I feel a thrill from my head to the very tips of my toes.And my second favorite moment in this book is the Hobbits return to the Shire. I love feeling the confidence that they themselves feel and enjoy watching them take their newfound knowledge, skill and judgment and show themselves to be the worthy Hobbits they are. And there's something just.. satisfying about seeing their enemy reduced to what he is.I seriously could go on and on about this book and how fantastic it is. I know I've seen some comments from folks who have not read the trilogy informing me that they haven't read it because it intimidates them. Don't let these books intimidate you if you haven't read them. I envy you your chance to explore them for the first time. And if you think you know the story because you've seen the movies - let me assure you that you don't. The level of detail and back-story woven through these books is so complex that the movies, although they were beautiful and well-done, just cannot compare to the original tale put down here by Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There is not much that I can say about Lord of the Rings that has not already been said. I can only say how this book has affected me, and how much love I have for it. I love this book, the story, and the characters. They are not characters so much as they are friends that I am separated from only by some great distance... I am not ashamed to say that I cried when I reached the last page of Return of the King, and realized that there was no more. I was sad because it ended, because it had to end, because this was the only way it could have ended, that all of their adventures were going to go on, and that I could no longer be a part of them. I especially miss reading about Sam, and wonder what will happen to him next. Perhaps the real reason I cried was that I finished a wonderful book, and that this experience, the year or so it took me to get through the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, that a book like this that was so real, with characterst that I still truly love and care about, was not likely to come again. Of course, there are other books I love, but for different reasons. Lord of the Rings will always hold a special place in my heart. Once you read it, it is a book that will stay with you always. It truly is as CS Lewis once wrote, \\"Good beyond hope.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Return of the King Book ReviewThe third book in the Lord of the Rings series is one of my personal favorites because it is an amazing and climactic adventure full of excitement and evil, love and hate. This book includes larger-than-life battles, and the looming reminder of evil in the form of Mordor: it is so close, and getting closer daily.This adventure takes Samwise and Frodo ever closer to an unsleeping malice, constantly searching for them. They suffer the ultimate test of friendship as Frodo ceases to be Frodo.The fellowship is broken, but they are all in the same battle, the battle for Middle Earth.In this epic novel, Tolkien really shows his true worth. Underlying values and morals, and a strong love story, fill the story with excitement. This is a book of extremes. True devotion and malice rear their heads in this truly amazing finale to the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Ring&quot; The Return of the King is one of the best book I've ever read.

I come. What does the king command?\\" This is when everyone finds out the question of the book's title, who really is the King. \\"The Return of the King\\" is a fictional fantasy where there are orcs, black riders, and many more mystical creatures of evil and good. Most of the story you will be traveling with the cunning and funny little hobbits that the men call Halflings.The story takes place in Middle Earth at an unknown time. The quest is for Froto to destroy the ring by throwing it into the Mountain of Doom, but then he is tricked and Sam must take the quest of the ring upon himself. Aragorn goes with his rangers, Gimli, and Legolas to the paths of the dead to fulfill a long forgotten tale that will lead to be the only hope in the war against the Dark Lord. However, the rest I cannot tell for I have told too much already.\\"The Return of the King\\" is a great book. It is funny, has lots of adventure, and excitement. There is so much suspense that you won't want to put the book down for hours. So if you like humor, tension, quests, and thrill you will love this book. I would also recommend it for the casual reader."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have not finished reading the 3rd book yet. But reading the 1st two books i can say that i really enjoy them. I find it sometimes difficult to understand what is going on in the books because they are full of so much details, but that makes it more intersting. I enjoy reading the books and finding out what each of the characters are getting up to in each book. My favourite characters has to be Legolas and Frodo.The reasons why I pick these characters is because I think they have the most intersting roles in the books and give the book at lot of character.Even though I haven't finished reading the 3rd book I found that the Appendix's were really good, it gave you alot of information about how J.R.R. Tolkein created the elvish language, the days of the months and the ages of the characters. I find Lord Of The Rings a really great set of books to read. If anybody was thinking should I read them or not, I would say that you should read the books because they are such a good read and very intersting."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As heads roll, wizards duel, and fire consumes Middle-earth, the intricately devised world of J.R.R. Tolkien, the weight of the world rests solely on the back of Frodo, the hobbit. Small as he may be, Frodo is the only creature capable of carrying the all-powerful ring to its demise in the fires of Mount Doom. The ring was a creation of the dark lord Sauron made to ensure that he will always have power in the world. For even though the wearer of the ring has the power to defeat any force that would come against him/her, Sauron's will of evil would always shine through any goodwill that the ring wearer would intend. The defeat of Sauron's forces and the destruction of the ring is the final ending that Frodo and all creatures on the side of good strive for.The Return of the King, the third and final book of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, reveals the fate of the ring, the beginning of a new era in Middle- earth, and the final time of union for the fellowship. Many great battles ensue as legions of men at set to defend great fortresses against the force of Sauron consisting of devilish creatures, orcs. Very similar to the second book, The Two Towers, the third installment switches to and fro from the battles to the journey of the Riders of Rohan to the voyage of Frodo and his companion Sam, another hobbit. As the story goes on, the situation becomes dire for the survival of men and the castles they defend. Gandalf, the good wizard, takes leadership of the good forces and leads the men into battles that cannot be won as the battles are the only choice left for the unified troops of Gondor and Rohan.Tolkien uses the power of the ring and the hopelessness of victory to display the flaws of men. The ring is the seed of all power in the world. If a man were presented with the opportunity to have the ring, he could not refuse as Tolkien describes. Frodo, the most humblest of all the creatures, knows he cannot control the power of the ring: therefore, he is not tricked into taking the ring as his own. When Minas Tirith is then upon siege, the great king Denethor feels his days are numbered. Then his son, Faramir, is brought to him in fatal condition but not yet dead. Denethor because of the situation changes from mighty ruler to suicidal madman. He threatens to kill himself and his son and proves that men can defeat themselves just as Gandalf had warned.To say that this book is detailed is an understatement. Tolkien provides a clear description of the scenery and of each creature the lives in the world. Each kingdom of men is chronicled from king to king and war to war. Although the lineage of every man in the book is impressive, it is can become confusing when a paragraph is dedicated to genealogy and the next paragraph is a narrative of the most important decision in the chapter. The book is loaded with action and is hard to put down. With the third movie in the series coming out at the end of the year, now would be a great time to enjoy the book that answers all the questions about the ring, the fellowship, and the beginning of the new era."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return Of The KingMy Review is on The Return of the King. The book takes placein a fantasy land known as Middle Earth.The conflict is between the forces of Mordor and Gondor, whichare countries, and between Frodo and the ring. The ring isevil and has a will of its own. It is a powerful weapon on thefinger of Sauron. The ring tries to consume Frodo as it didto Gollum, a former halfling who was corrupted by the ring.The ring is trying to get back to Sauron, its master andcreator. Sauron is the Lord of wickedness and darkness whoresides in Mordor, a wretched land.With his Ring Wraiths Sauron plans to reclaim his stolen ringfrom Frodo, who is a halfling. Frodo is trying to bring thering to Mount Doom, the only place the ring can be destroyed.At one point in the book, the King of Rohan, his emminence,known by the name, Theodin, shouts \\"Arise, arise, riders ofTheodin!\\" while he is preparing to aid Gondor. He thenfinishes with,\\"Ride now, ride now, ride to Gondor!\\"The story takes place after the prequels to it, Fellowship ofthe Ring and The Two Towers. If you haven't read the prequels,or at least watched the movies, I would advise against readingReturn of the King. The story is about the armies of MiddleEarth and Mordor clashing and the continuing journey of Frodoand Sam journeying to Mordor to try to destroy Sauron's ring atMount Doom. Gollum continues as well with Frodo and has hisown sneaky intentions.The book is large by my standards but its better that way. Itis an excellent book if you enjoy fantasy and reading of epicbattles. In the story it mentions the Paths of the Dead. Yes,this will probably confuse you at first, but it is revealedlater in the story. If you read the first two books andenjoyed them, reading The Return of the King is a must. Ienjoyed reading the book and hope you do as well."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A Review by StephenFrodo and Sam are on there way to mount morordor. On there way they meet many evils and survive many great perils. Not known to them is the war going on in the pelader fields where the mighty forces of sauron are waging war with the humans. Bit by bit the forces of sauron are winning and the eye of morordor is growing stronger the forces of good are on the verge of total destruction.This book was a bit of a slow book but don't let that get you down this book has a great storyline fierce battles described areas items and people. There are some hard words but with the surrounding context it is easy to find out what they mean. Everything in this book is well thought out and nobody could match this kind of talent for such a great series. The book it thought overall was too short and it should have been at least 400 pages long and should have had a couple more battles and maybe 1 or 2 more characters to help out and play a major part in the final book.This book was definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this book to strong readers and only if you have read the rest of the series and had interest in them. If you want to read this book then do it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is one of the best books I've read in a long time.

It tells what exacly happens to all the characters and I for one was very impressed by the detail. It did get kind of slow in the middle, but that eventually wore off like most books do. I would recomend this book to anyone that enjoys adventure and fantasy. These books are truly one of a kind and J.R.R Tolkien was a genius!~Laura"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It is a great book is all that I have to say and that you will have a good time in reading this book. I know that I did enjoy it while I was reading it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Listening to a book being read aloud by one who is good at it is a totally different experience from reading it oneself -- and Rob Inglis, who reads this second volume of the beloved trilogy, is the best there is. I have read the books many times, seen the movies, and even read it aloud myself to a hearing-impaired friend -- but still, I am enjoying listening to this story, which I love so much, and am hearing more in it than I have ever experienced before. Don't miss it; it's worth every dime, and this is one audiobook that you WON'T be selling to buy another."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second volume in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It followsThe Fellowship of the Ringand is followed byThe Return of the King.In this part of the story, the original fellowship of nine travelers is fragmented. Some seek Mordor and the forlorn hope of destroying the one ring in the volcanic fires that produced it. Others are taken captive, and pursued by would-be rescuers. As the travelers disperse, readers become acquainted with the lands and peoples of Middle Earth. We meet the independent horsemen of Rohan, the foul orcs of Mordor, the proud men of Gondor, and the shades of past oath-breakers, eager for redemption. The schemes of wizards, stewards and wraiths become more clear. The tension builds.The middle book of the trilogy covers a lot of ground, both geographically and in character development. The characters gather their strength for war with the forces of evil. Tolkien gives his characters distinct strengths which complement the abilities of their companions. There is a growing sense that each will have a part to play in the coming conflict--a unique and indispensable part.If you have already read volume one of the trilogy, you are going to read volume two. No choice, really."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Probably considered my favorite in Tolkien's writings, Return of the King is great. Many suspenseful events end in utter triumph and inspire the reader the whole time. I think the biblical parallels can't be missed either. It does a great job tying up some details from The Hobbit, Fellowship of the Ring, and Two Towers. Wonderful conclusion to a classic work of fiction that makes the reader look for the reality to match it. I think the fingers can definitely point to the truths in the Bible to help you find to truth in this fantasy created by J R R Tolkien"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second volume in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is faster-paced than the first and grapples more directly with the dual nature of good and evil that is at the heart of each of the three books. Each element of good has its opposite. There is the dark tower and the good tower of Gondor (hence, the \\"Two Towers\\"). There is the good hobbit Frodo and his opposite Gollum who, it is hinted, is a distortion of what was once a hobbit-like creature. There are elves and orcs. There is the good wizard Gandalf and the evil Sauron.Yet, while these pairs are opposite, they are also linked. Even Saruman was at one time a good personable fellow. Gandalf fears the ring because he can see himself becoming like Saruman and Sauron.Tolkien writes near the end of the book that the ring itself brings great power and insight, but not courage. Hence Gollum wears the ring and is sniveling; Sauron, we know, would not be so; and Frodo and Sam find courage from within. All these beings, it seems, start out as morally equivalent and should see themselves in the other. It is only after the repeated stresses of power and experience that we morph toward one pole or the other until we can barely see the resemblance. What is to account for which pole one morphs toward? I don't think it's some form of inherent virtue as much as it is chance and the cumulative force of making many good (or bad) choices that ultimately so forms our character as to overwhelm us.This book introduces the most appealing character in the work -- the ents. Whatever the metaphorical significance of these enormous, tree-like creatures (perhaps, like Tom Bombadil, they represent beings with a more perfect communion with nature than man is capable of), they are so charismatic and lovable as to steal the show.Mr. Inglis' reading is itself a work of art. He's a Shakespearean actor with the ability to give each character its distinctive voice. He interprets the text without overwhelming it. Inglis has a few peers, but there is no better reader.This is an entertaining story and great literature."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is, as other reviewers have said, the only unabridged BOT version of this classic book. Rob Inglis does a great job reading.But: If you plan on downloading CDs onto your MP3 player, keep reading.The book is broken into 48 CDs (all 3 books (16 CDs per book)). And each CD is broken up into 3 min tracks (about 275 tracks per disc).And no freaking consistent organization.Each CD has a completely (ugh!!!) different way of titling the tracks.So, my Ipod now has 800+ 3 minute LOTR tracks . . . in no particular order!!!There's no way I can listen to the book in chronological order. Instead my Ipod shuffles randomly between tracks, changing every 3 minutes.It's a disaster.But I love this book. So, I'm listening anyway.It's the equivalent of cutting the book into 800 pieces, throwing them in the air, and then reading them: William S. Burroughs, please meet J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I won't go into what Lord of the Rings is all about. If you're looking at this book you probably already know. Instead I'll tell you about the version you are looking at. This publication has a wonderful, classic feel to it. Map in the back which provides detail of Rohan and Gondor. The cover slip is great. Wonderful artwork. I purchased this version because it doesn't have the movie art work all over it. Remember, it was a book before a movie. If you're going to read the book, leave the movie behind. The Return of the King also has the Appendices and has a quality hard binding. I would recommend this version (any of three books) to anyone who wants the real Lord of the Rings experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you love the books you'll like this recording. This series is unabridged. It's something like 52 hours long for all three sets. This is what I put into my car cd player when I was trapped in rush hour traffic. It makes a good escape if you're a Tolkien fan.One reader narrates the whole book, and he does a great job of changing his voice during dialoge between characters.I've been very happy with all three of these recordings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the first book was just good enuph for me to try the second, but the second, this one, blew me away. JRR tolkein made this book much more interesting by cutting down on the explaining of the setting and a lot more about the plot. I also like the addition of the ents, they are just fun charactors that make you think a lot more, like how would a living tree look, and does it have a tongue? Overall, my favorite new charactor was King Theodin, how he is a ruler with many flaws, but he is still ruler, and you can't take that away. This book is a 10 out of 10 all the way, best book I ever read, and great for anyone who loves fantasy, action, blood, gore, and book that make you think."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It really kept me reading. I learned more about Frodo and Same and their quest to destroy the ring. While reading this book I could easily imagine the events. If you enjoyed the first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, you should read this book. There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The final volume of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" this novel is by far the most exciting and adventure-packed of the three. The epic battles are displayed vividly, as Tolkien delivers a masterpiece of suspense and action. From the epic battles against Sauron's minions to the Mountain of Fire and the Cracks of Doom, the action escalates toward the ultimate climax. However, the destruction of the ring isn't the end of the tale, as Tolkien delivers a rather lengthy coda to bring the quest to a conclusion, complete with unexpected twists and turns, particularly in the Shire.The most ironic chapter of this epic quest involves the corruption of the Shire. After the Hobbits have defeated evil incarnate and rid the world of the nefarious Sauron, they expect a hero's welcome in the Shire. However, the Shire has not been immune to the evil influence of Sauron and Saruman. However, this time they do not need the help of Gandalf or any other race and can handily defeat the corruptors of the Shire. Indeed, the four Hobbits have come full circle and have matured immensely. Their experiences abroad have imbued in them a noble, valiant character and act selflessly to return the Shire to its former glory.Without a doubt, Sam emerges as the hero and heir apparent to Frodo and the legacy of the Ring. In the \\"Two Towers\\" Sam performs heroically, but Frodo is still the main focus. Yet, in this volume, Sam is the true hero, as he nearly single-handedly carries Frodo to the Cracks of Doom to destroy the ring. However, Frodo certainly behaves heroically, although not in actions. The mere ability of him to resist the all-powerful allure and temptation of the ring is a victory in itself - a victory that comes perilously close to defeat, save for Gollum's treachery that backfires.Self-sacrifice and devotion to a larger cause pervades throughout this novel. For Frodo, his reward is the ability to maintain the status quo of peace and prosperity. There is no hero's welcome nor any grand reward for him. Indeed, Frodo is the most underappreciated of the four hobbits upon their return, despite his Herculean deeds. Sam's self-sacrifice and devotion to Frodo's friendship proves to be a valuable asset, as he musters every last bit of strength to carry Frodo to his goal, both literally and figuratively. However, self-sacrifice isn't just limited to the hobbits, as Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and Aragorn and the kings of men prove time and again that their lofty goals and not about themselves, but the betterment of all races of Middle Earth.Undoubtedly, the enduring message of this novel as well as \\"Lords of the Rings\\" as a whole, is the potential for heroic deeds in all of us, no matter how small or insignificant we may be. In the Southern lands the hobbits are completely unknown, or simply thought of to be an insignificant, child-like race. However, the four hobbits in the quest perform the most heroic deeds against insurmountable odds. Indeed, if it weren't for the heroics of the hobbits in the most unlikeliest of circumstances, Sauron's shadow of evil would have permeated all of Middle Earth. The ability to be a hero lies in one's heart, not in one's brawn or muscles.Tolkien delivers a knockout punch in the \\"Return of the King.\\" Overall, the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is a masterpiece, for sure. It is easy to see why Tolkien is revered as one of the greatest literary figures of all time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The final part in the three part Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King finds our heroes in a tight fix. The forces of Darkness are on the march: Frodo is captive in Mordor, Gondor is under siege, and the remainder of the fellowship, lead by Aragorn, is missing. In other words, things aren't looking good.The plot, once again, is masterful. You can't get any better than a story conceived by a professor of English Literature at Oxford. Tolkien is a wordsmith equal to the best of them. However, he doesn't take three pages to say something which can be said in a paragraph. There's something to be said for brevity.The characters have been maturing throughout the novel, and the third part is no different. Frodo is coming into his own, as are the remaining Hobbits. The question is, will they be able to step forward and do something epic in nature???I loved the way Tolkien wrapped it all up, and the appendicies are a treasure trove of information on what happens afterwards, what happened before, etc... Honestly, when I finished this book way back in high school I had a tear in my eyes. Very good stuff. This type of novel comes along once in a lifetime, if that often."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return of the King&quot; is the final volume of Tolkien's masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. There is nothing else that has ever come close to comparing to it - although many have tried. &quot;The Return of the King&quot; is a wonderful conclusion to Tolkien's fantasy. The finale by itself is well worth reading over and over again. Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity. Every fan of fantasy should read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least once in their lives. My very highest recommendation for any fantasy book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The powerful ending of The story of one rings fate... the final clash between good and evil is fought ONE OF THE GREATIST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"READ THIS BOOK.

I mean, when I thirst;there is water:when I hunger;there is food. Now I am home-sick for Middle Earth; does'nt it exist?! Only a master writer like Tolkien can explain a world that creates such a yearning that invokes such a question. He was an avowed Christian so the answer may be in Heaven with him. If so,I wonder,is Middle Earth still &quot;in&quot; Tolkien, or is Tolkien &quot;in&quot; Middle Earth now ? If the latter is true,then I am going to ask him; &quot;Is there room for some fans of yours too?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Of Tolkien's well-known quartet of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King is the best. The suspense builds as the war comes to its climax. In the West, all efforts are put towards defending the city of Gondor, chief city in Middle-earth, and main defense against Mordor. In Mordor, Sam continues to help Frodo towards Mount Doom, where the Ring can be destroyed. But the closer they get, the weaker Frodo becomes, and the stronger the power of the Ring becomes. Every scene is beautifully written, and even with all the action, the characters still take center stage. The writing is almost cinematic; is feels that real. It's a novel that scares you, grips you, makes you laugh and cry. One of the best novels ever written. After the climax, you begin reading more slowly. Not because it is not interesting, not because it moves slowly by its own nature. You read more slowly because you do not want it to end. After reading these novels, you will not want to leave this world behind. I have one complaint and one complaint only about this book: it is too short. If you die without reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, you have missed the greatest joy in literature. Do yourself a favor: read these books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is number two in an epic that has to be read.

I had to pick it up and reread it. I had forgotten so much and yet it was an old friend that was good to visit with again."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Despite its staggering length and dreary descriptions of every leaf, Fellowship of the Ring has a certain fairy-tale sheen and epic sweep that make it readable for all. The Two Towers, though, is mostly for diehard Tolkein fans.The first 200 pages or so climax with a huge battle for Helm's Deep, but for most of that time we have to endure the stupefying company of the warriors of Rohan. These beefy blonde Nordic guys have NO sense of humor, and drone on endlessly about their ancestry (who CARES?) when they're not indulging in soporfific courtesies. I always feel uneasy around these hulks--I expect to see swastikas appear on their shields at any moment. Tolkein was channeling the Viking types immortalized in coma-inducing epics like Beowulf and Lord are these fellows boring!However, hobbits to the rescue! At one point we switch to Merry and Pippin, and once they appear, the story moves again and we can enjoy characters with human foibles. These two doughty halflings endure capture and torment by orcs (goblins, who are much more entertaining than the ski-instructor types) and then wander into the world of the ents. If you thought tree-hugger Tom Bombadil was weird, these creatures will get you howling with laughter. They are tree-shepherds (I'm not making this up) and they more or less look like trees, but they go around saying things like &quot;Hm. Hroom&quot; and drinking lots of water. Later on, they turn out to be pretty tough, bringing down a whole walled city in minutes. Treebeard is their leader and he's right out of some Saturday morning cartoon show.The second half of the book brings us back to Frodo and Sam, and their journey to Mordor. They team up with Gollum, who was much creepier in The Hobbit. Here, he's a whiny reptilian nuisance and we must conclude that Frodo is an idiot for trusting him since anyone can tell he's up to no good. When he sells out his companions to a gigantic spider, we're not surprised. Tolkien manages some wonderful descriptions in this part, of the suffocating, foggy, wet, evil weather in Mordor (sounds like Long Island in the summer). The spider Shelob is a hoot, a creature who needed to wait for computer generated graphics.Again, most of the text is filled with dreary step by step schlepping from place to place, with tedious descriptions of EVERYTHING. There are superb moments (the orcs boiling out of their hiding places like swarms of ants, the disgusting marshes) and as anyone with half a brain knew, Gandalf returns (and he is the BEST character of all). The scene where Gandalf humiliates the evil wizard Saruman is worth the price of admission. And the slinking, cowardly Wormtongue is a great creation--if Tolkein hadn't written this in the 1940's, I'd swear he was based on Henry Kissinger.So enter at your own risk. Some exciting scenes, lots of sludge, basically a bridge from Fellowship of the Ring to The Return of the King. Not for anyone with arachnophobia."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE TWO TOWERS was more enjoyable than I remember THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING being. There's more action and intrigue, and the thickening of the plot was enough to want me to read THE RETURN OF THE KING as soon as I was finished. There's much good to say about this book, but its two flaws are more interesting.The first flaw is endemic to Tolkien. Its what I think of as the \\"eagles drop out of the sky\\" problem. Too often, Tolkien paints his characters into seemingly inescapable situations, only to be rescued by some new, external force. I was most annoyed by this by rescuing eagles in THE HOBBIT, but the problem re-occurs, albeit to a lesser extent, in THE TWO TOWERS. The problem here is that the characters rely on un-foreshadowed luck rather than their wits, or some element introduced earlier in the book (or series). This problem is especially acute near the end of the book, where a hobbit humbles a giant spider that apparently has been so formidable for years than even armies of orcs had been at its mercy.But the ending has other problems as well, not the least of which being the missed chance for Tolkien to fool the reader into thinking that Frodo, one of the main characters, is dead (until the next book). We think that for a few pages, but the book ends, serial-like, with Frodo's friend Sam realizing that he's alive. Not only do we miss the suspense generated by Gandalf's apparent death at the end of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, but the ending seems too unresolved, even for a middle book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I somehow made it long past adolescence without reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS books. I read THE RETURN OF THE KING and the others (in order, of course) because I wanted to before the movies came out. Somehow I didn't get into these books as much as I felt I should. I found the battle scenes no less boring than the over-extended descriptions of journey. The smaller-scale conflict, especially the part of the story revolving around Frodo and Sam were more interesting, but requiring a greater suspension of disbelief. The climatic moment in the final book (more than 100 pages before the actual end of the book) was anti-climatic in the extreme, and while a friend of mine who is a devotee of these books found Sauron's lack of appearance to be \\"brilliant,\\" I was disappointed. The evil faced by our heroes had a name, but no face, I guess (the move got around this by explaining that he is non-corporeal).Still, the last 100 pages, essentially a post-script, brought the whole series together for me. The allegory was strongest, or at least most obvious, here. The hobbits are a race of Cincinatuses, only wanting to mind their own business. They are totally innocent and un-ambitious. That's why they were the only ones who could be trusted with the evil ring. At the same time, they were all too quick to accept authoritarian rule without question or resistance. Frodo lost his innocence to save the world, but a little loss of innocence was needed to save the hobbits from their own apathy. The message of the last part of the book is that evil must be engaged; those who hope to ignore evil will be suppressed like everyone else, and ultimately give in to its ways.As for the battles and daring escapes, they didn't do it for me. Battle participants are often built up as Davids and Goliaths, with Goliath always losing because of David's will, luck, outside help, or reasons unexplained. Seldom do our heroes' wits or cleverness get them out of trouble, more often they are saved by eagles dropping out of the sky. Still I will miss these characters and enjoyed the movies. I'm actually thinking of re-reading THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Maybe someday I'll re-read this one, too."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Towers is a good book. Frodo and Sam travel closer to Mordor with Gollum as their guide. The rest of the fellowship gets the Ents (trees) to help destroy Isengard and Gandalf come back. I would recommend this book more to adults becaus they talk alot and some parts get boring. But some parts are good and make you keep reading. I recommend this book to 10 year olds and up."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The final book of Lord of the Rings is a wonderful novel which shows the last defence against Sauron. I recomend that you read the rest of the series first."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think it&#65533;s fair to say that this book is not as good as the first one in the series, nor is it as good as The Hobbit. But as the middle piece of the trilogy of Middle Earth, it serves a method for getting from point A (Fellowship of the Ring) to point B (Return of the King). And in that, it does a good enough job.When it comes down to it, here's the truth of the matter. This is the least enjoyable of the trilogy. But if you're going to read the first and last books, you can't skip the second book. It just doesn&#65533;t make sense. Too much of the story transpires in book 2, and since the trilogy is ultimately 1 huge book divided into 3 segments, there's no way to skip to book 3 without first stopping at this one.My main problem with this book is that there isn&#65533;t enough action nor dialogue. It might be better stated that there&#65533;s too much transition and not enough action. I believe Tolkien does his best work when he's writing about character interactions in any given scene. The Two Towers lacks in presenting the reader with enough of those situations to keep them interested.The story is generally good enough, though at times you do scratch your head. Some of the story lines seem to come to a point where Tolkien didn&#65533;t know what to do next. I think, all in all, that's how this book struggles the most.The struggle is one of trying to put a few good ideas in book of this length. There simply aren&#65533;t enough of those ideas to make it go as far as it needs to go. With that, it seems to me that Tolkien invents new scenes that enable him to add pages to his story. These scenes often times seem forced, as if he didn&#65533;t even buy into them.All in all, the book does a fair job as the middle child in this 3 step series. It doesn't bore you to the point of putting it down. Ultimately, the main story line is consistent with the main arrow of the narrative; a narrative which has good doing battle with evil in 2 different arenas.As a stand alone book, this one would never be a keeper. But as it is, this trilogy is not meant to be 3 individual books but 3 read in succession. So there's no need to look at it as a book on its own.This review serves to warn the reader that #2 is not going to be as exciting as any of the other 3 in this story (including the Hobbit). However, since the reader undoubtedly will buy and read the trilogy as one, few people will be reading any review here with an eye towards trying to decide to read this book or not.So proceed on with the trilogy, get ready for a bit of a slower ride than either of the previous 2 books, and chew off as much of this one as you can as you make your way to book #3."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"ummm... where is the american kindle version? fellowship and return of the king have kindle versions in the states... please make two towers as well... then i can give you money"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"While Tolkien's epic has its obvious flaws : the blatant racism,simplistic politics and superiority of Westerners he beats you over thehead with, the wonderful setting is not to be denied.Pitched battle as decoy is not too bad a stunt either, as they try and given Sam and Frodo more time to destroy the One Ring.After this, the repercussions of this war for Middle-Earth are felt closer to home for the four fuzzy short guys."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"(See my reviews for \\"Fellowship\\" and \\"Two Towers\\" also).Return of the King is probably my least favorite of the three. I think that my main problem was that I kept getting confused with all the battle portions. Sometimes, action does not translate well into words, this is one of those times. There's nothing wrong with the book, I just have to work harder to follow this one. I do like the return to the Shire, and I wish that that portion had gone on a bit longer, or that Sam's adventures as mayor would have been written (even as a separate book...not officially part of the trilogy, like \\"The Hobbit\\"), etc."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Welcome back to Middle-Earth in J.R.R. Tolkien's third and final portion of the amazing &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; Trilogy. In &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; we join the Fellowship as they fight the War of the Ring and follow Frodo and Sam across Mordor.Tense battle scenes waltz side by side with touching emotional moments. Throughout the battle scenes, readers find themselves holding their breath; eyes glued to the page. Throughout the tender moments between Frodo and Sam, or any other member of the Fellowship, readers discover their emotional attachment to these characters.All but the most callused of hearts will go out to the characters when suffering befalls them. Whenever trouble confronts Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin or whoever it may be, readers feel the desire to leap into the pages of the book in hopes that perhaps they can be transported to Middle-Earth, take up their sword and smite the wicked in a great act of courage.J.R.R. Tolkien uses a unique and appealing style of writing. Through his portrayal, readers feel like they are accompanying the Fellowship on their quest. Tolkien illustrates Middle-Earth through elaborate detail. This detail may become tedious at times, but the action and grand storytelling throughout the novel balance out the extensive detail. &quot;The Return of the King&quot; delights fantasy, adventure and action lovers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the third book in the trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings. This book demonstrates the frustration and darkness of the ring on the young ring bearer Frodo Baggins. With darkness falling upon the fellowship, the time has come for the ultimate battle between good and evil. The evil power of Sauron has grown strong and may not be able to be stoped. With the help from the king and some unexpected friends, the forces of Sauron are taken on. The book is a little long winded and does drag on towards the end but some scenes truly allow a vivid depiction of the events and makes you feel as though you are in the book. But this book truly involves some surprising events which make the book very worthwhile to read. This book makes my top 10 and I do suggest that any fan of mistery and adventure should read this book as well as the other two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third book in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. It continues the quest of Frodo trying to destroy the ring in the city of Mordor.John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in South Africa in 1892. When he was 3 years old he moved to England with his mother. After graduating from college, he became a professor at Oxford university. He formed a literary group with other writers called the \\"inklinks\\". In this group he wrote many of his stories. John died September 2, 1973.Out of the 3 \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books, \\"he Return of the King\\" was by far my favorite. From cover to cover i could not seem to put this book down. Tolkien keeps your interest throughout the entire novel. \\"The return of the King\\" describes the battle between the men of Gondor, and the evil army of Sauron. It also continues Frodo's quest to destroy the ring at the top of Mount Doom. Qverall, I thought this book was great, but I thought the end was kind of sad and could have been better.If you are planning on reading thois book,I highly suggest that you read the first 2 books instead of watching the movies. If you watch the movies instead of reading the books, much of this novel won't make sense to you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"For years, I had heard enough people say that The Lord of the Rings was too long and dated to be worth reading that I avoided them. Recently, I picked up the first one, The Fellowship of the Rings, and I found that those people were flat wrong. The books have aged well. The characters are extremely interesting and loveable and the plot is well paced and exciting.The Two Towers picks up right where Fellowship left off. The narrative is split between the two divisions of the fellowship. The first two books follow Merry, Pippin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, and others as they join forces with the Ents (the coolest characters in the series so far) to fight against the rising power of Saruman. The last two books in The Two Towers follow Frodo and Sams' continuing quest into Mordor to try and destroy the ring. They face some interesting obstacles, and there are quite a few plot twists in the narrative.The Two Towers is a truly entertaining read. The narrative in this is pretty fast-paces (except for one section at the beginning). There are some new characters and creatures which are really interesting. The conflicts are intense, and there are a lot of plot twists to keep you entertained. The book is especially exciting near the end. It really leaves you needing to read the last chronicle. I can't wait to experience the rest of The Lord of the Rings. I only wish I hadn't waited so long to get to it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is definitely the best book I have ever read. It is the ultimate ending to Tolkien's fantastic trilogy; it is a story of love, bravery, magic, and terror all wrapped up in one. I must admit that the ending was slightly disappointing, however, Middle Earth was better for it. I will read this book again someday-once you start, you can barely put it down. I LOVED IT!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the second piece to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the story gets divided up into two parts. The first is concerning Arogorn and Gimli and Legolas and it is my favorite part of the series. Tolkien is a master at building up the tension and then leaving the reader hanging by moving on to another side of the story. The timing and portrail of the story is the best there is for story telling in any fashion. The second part moves on to Frodo and Sam's journey into Mordor and it is eary and dark. The description of this evil country leaves the reader thankful that he does not have to make such a journey himself. The characters grow and are quite changed by the events that surround them. I always thought that if the characters were not changed by a story, then how is the reader ever going to be affected? Well, no lack of that here. Please read and you will charish this world for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In \\"The Return Of The King\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, Tolkien does a wonderful job of ending an amazing story that has branched through a mystical trilogy of magic, hope, good and evil...My favorite character in this book is Sam, my favorites have changed throughout the trilogy. He sticks with Frodo throughout the whole story and is his will when Frodo wants to give up. Sam puts his life on the line for Frodo many times in this story, he was truly what kept Frodo going.I enjoyed the ending to this trilogy, some minor characters came into the spotlight and showed their true colors, and the book wrapped up nicely."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third time I have visited the magical world of J.R.R Tolkien's unique Middle-Earth, and I'm sure it won't be the last time! The Return of the King is the final, and in my opinion the best, book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. With just as much action, adventure, suspense and romance as the first two, the final episode breaks all bounds with not a dull moment in its entirety.The book resumes the story of the remnants of what was the Fellowship of the Ring, now the Grey Company. Each have gone their separate ways, and Frodo and Samwise have journeyed to Mordor to fulfill their dreadful task of destroying the Ring. Peregrin and Gandalf set out for the slowly dying city of Minas Tirith to inform its Steward, Denethor, of the death of his son Boromir, who died protecting Peregrin and Meriadoc. While Gandalf and Pippin ride East, Merry, with the rest of the Fellowship and the host of Rohan, rides to Edoras to consult the lady Eowyn, daughter of the king of Rohan. However, a new path is revealed to Aragorn and the Grey Company: The Paths of the Dead. All paths hold danger for each company, though Frodo's is the gravest. With Sauron's Eye upon him constantly, the Ring weighs heavier on his conscience than ever, slowly working its evil on his heart. Having lost all hope, Frodo succumbs to despair and even Sam's optimism cannot lift the heavy burden from his mind.Following the end of the novel, there are the Appendices, which describe the history of each ancient race and its background. Including some excerpts from Bilbo's Red Book, they are a great help in understanding Middle-Earth as a whole.I could not stop reading this book once I started, and I believe the reader will find it just as addictive. Tolkien combines all of the human weaknesses and strengths into this magnificent story of betrayal, temptation, courage, love, hate and valor. Journey with Frodo and Sam as all of the Races join in the fight that will seal the fate of Middle-Earth and end the Third Age. I guarantee it will be an adventure you will never forget."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return of the King&quot; is the end to the fantasy epic, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; It finishes off the trilogy in such a beautiful way that you'll be craving to get more of Tolien's Middle Earth. With adventure, comedy, love, and wonderful writing, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; leaves you with such a nice, warm feeling within you that you'll want to re-read it again.In this book of the epic trilogy, we are finally intoduced to places that have been mentioned throughout the book various times such as Minas Tirith. In this novel you will find out about each member of the fellowship and their doings. More adventure that you have seen in the other two novels is present and the suspense building up to the dramatic and wonderful conclusion is great.&quot;The Return of the King&quot; should not be read unless you have read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; before this. This book is the end to J.R.R. Tolkien's gorgeous trilogy and you'll savor every word of it. This is wonderful reading and will be loved by most fans of the fantasy genre.

This is one of the most popular fantasy novels of our time and should not be missed.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was the best of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I loved the battle scenes and heroic importance the hobbits had and their big part in winning the War of the Ring. Meriadoc and Peregrin were the greatest; it touched me to see the friendship between the two, and the cheerfulness and ignorance of Pippin, who did nothing but ask questions. My favorite part, though, was the second part, which followed poor Samwise and Frodo as they entered Mordor. Sam's love and loyalty to his master amazed me, and without his hope and strength, the Quest would never even had a chance.As the made their painful journey, Sam helped dying Frodo with his will and physical strength as well. When they traveled to Mount Doom, I almost felt as if I was there, the depression, hopelessness, thirst,hunger,fatigue....It seemed so real, I couldn't put the book down. The ending saddended me, when the four hobbits came home to nothing they expected, and Frodo struggles with the remberance and cost of being the Ring-bearer. This book is my favorite, and I defintely think anyone could read this book and be satisfied....Before reading this bbok though, you might want to read first the Hobbit, and then the rest of the LOTR trilogy (it makes it alot more easier to understand...)"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I admit, Tolkien is an excellent writer. He is vivid, descriptive, and ultimately creative. Unfortunately, not everyone can get into Tolkien's fantasy worlds, all thanks to our MTV-based society.

Sam and Frodo press on to destroy the ring in Mt. Doom, and the rest search for the Orc-Kidnapped Merry and Pippen. This novel left me in laughter, awe, and sometimes even in tears. I don't want to spoil the ending, but I will tell you this: After I completed The Two Towers, I had to immediately start The Return of the King, just to find out if what happened really was what I thought happened (those who have read it should know of what I'm talking).Two words: Read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book, THE TWO TOWERS by JRR Tolkien was incredible.

It followes the story of a hobbit named frodo who is trying to take a ring that can destroy middle earth. Frodo has his faithful friend Sam Gamgee and also an unlickely companion called gollum. who also seeks the power of the ring. there are only two things wrong with this book however, 1 you dont know how it started unless you read the first book fellowship of the ring, and 2 you wont know how the story ends until you read the third book return of the king."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord Of The Rings gets my vote for the absolute best series of all time. Tolkien does an excellent job of showing his awesome writing skills in these books. If you have gotten a chance to see the movie, you will know what kind of brilliance Tolkien has. The book, im my opinion, is much better than the movie, because you can put a different faces on each character. There is no much more to the book, rather than the movie. It goes much more in depth than the movie. The Poems and riddles that Tolkien comes up with is amazing. This is a very good book, I would reccomend this book and the series to all ages of readers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.It begins with the death and burial of Boromir and then to the journey of Aragorn , Legolas and Gimli to rescue Pippin and Merry from the Orc captors.When we read about Pippin and Merry's captivity , we for the first time in LOTR , witness the repugnant , cruel and totally without anything redeeming way of being of the Orcs.We also meet the Ents , shepherds of the trees and the tall and fair blonde horse riders - the Rohirrim.Thus we meet Treebeard and once more for a while two of our heroes Pippin and Merry get to spend some time in one of the few havens of Middle Earth ,temporarily safe from the enveloping darkness of the Dark Lord , the Enemy , Sauron and his forces . In this book Gandalf reappears having been miraculously resurrected as Gandalf the White . More powerful than before he breaks the spell of Saruman's emissary Grima Wormtongue over the King of Rohan , Theoden . The epic Battle of Helms Deep takes place while the Ents totally destroy Saruman's evil realm of Isengard before Gandalf himself destroys Saruman's power .In The Two Towers new characters such as Boromir's brother Faramir , the warrior of Rohan Eomer and his beautiful sister Eowyn appear . Such themes as the Palantir are introduced and the Hobbits meet up with the degenerate Gollum who for a while acts as their guide before predictably betraying them to the giant spiderlike demon Shelob.more than before through Merry and Pippin , Frodo and Sam we witness the amazing quality of the Hobbits . The novel takes the saga to a dramatic climax in Mordor and the stage is set for the final conflict between Mordor and The West.Aside from the action and events we need to take time to appreciate the beauty and scope of Middle Earth.LOTR has an important message in that it rejects moral relativism and exhorts us to always choose good over evil , so important when we are faced with the challenges of terrorism and those who would destroy freedom ..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is incredible. It is equal to, if not better then The Hobbit and/or Fellowship of the Ring. The book, seperated into two independant novels, follows both the journeys of the shattered fellowship, and the excapades of Frodo and Samwise.

Tolkien is a wonderful read. It is the continuation of the journey of the Fellowship. However, in this part of the book, the fellowship is broken. In the beginning, they are deciding where to go and they end up with an ambush of orcs. Boromir dies defending Merry and Pippin who are taken away by the orcs. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn fight off the orcs and end up not finding any of the hobbits. Frodo decides that he must go to Mordor alone but sure enough, loveable Sam ends up going with him. The book is broken up into showing the journey of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli and what Merry and Pippin do as well. Another part is the travel of Sam and Frodo to Mordor that takes place at the end of the book.I have to be honest and say that I was already a fan after seeing the first movie and then reading the first book. I had to read this book and I ended up loving it because of being a fan of Tolkien. Nevertheless, it is how he writes that makes me and so many other people love his work.There was action in it that helped get me through the book. Some parts I enjoyed were Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn on the hunt of orcs to rescue Merry and Pippin. Nevertheless, Merry and Pippin end up escaping and enter Fangorn Forest where they meet a new creature called an Ent. Actually, the Ents are the tree people, who are able to move around and talk but they look like trees and are very old.Some other neat parts are the destruction of Isengard and the defeat of Saruman and a very exciting battle at Helm's Deep that is in a way my favorite part of the book.However, for me it is somewhat hard to choose my favorite part since I like the book so much. Not every part however was as exciting as the battle at Helm's Deep, there were some down times when reading the book, but I have come to expect that when reading Tolkien.I love this book and I recommend it to anyone at all interested in The Lord of the Rings. It is worth taking the time to read which will fly by when reading such an exciting book. You will be transported into another world that is so interesting and fun. Go read The Lord of the Rings and step into the world that is Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second volume of Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" begins with chaos. Boromir is found dead, pierced by O rc's arrows, and Merry and Pippin are gone. Frodo has tried to escape and journey to Mordor alone, but his faithful comrade Sam followed. The remains of the Fellowship, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to let Frodo be. Their part of the task is over, now it is time for other battles. They try to save Merry and Pippin instead (who save themselves pretty well), and then they all travel to Isengard where the once so mighty and good wizard Saruman dwells...On the way they meet some new characters, for example the old Ents, and the riders of Rohan. At the same time Frodo and Sam struggles on to Mordor, a long and weary journey . However , they are getting some unexpected help.The Darkness is rising, and the only one who can save Middle-earth is the once so cheerfullittle hobbit who deeply regrets his thirst for adventure...The turns in this story are pretty interesting, the characters change as the great war draws nearer, and so does Middle-earth. It becomes darker, and not as cheerful as before. The Elves are going westwards as Sauron's forces draws nearer. This part of \\"The felllowship of the Ring\\" is a lot more mysterious and misty than \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". Frodo, who used to be happy ,and mild realises what he is about to do, and the heavy burden on his shoulders almost kills him. Only one thing keeps him going, -his task, to save Middle-earth which makes him a good deal more powerful in his way of talking and acting . Luckily he has got atrustworthy comrade on the road. Sam would never betray Frodo ; even though his master is not always nice to him.. Another one who has changed a great deal since \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is Gandalf, who returns from what everybody thought was death. Saruman has in his desperate search for power allied with Sauron, and is no longer on the side of the good. This task is now Gandalf's, he has become Gandalf the White, the mightiest wizard in Middle-earth. When he meet s Merry and Pippin they are at first afraid of him. He is very powerful and not as cosy as before. Aragorn is also changing, from the Ranger to the King.I think that it is a pleasure throughout to read \\"The Two Towers\\". In one way, it is kind of strange since the only thing they do is walk, and maybe fight a little sometimes.There must be something in Tolkien's way of writing that makes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" so extremely good. But what? I think it is because of the fact that nothing is predictable.Suddenly a new character runs out of the forest and the story turns violently ( for example the Ent Fangorn,or Faramir). We should not forget the Palant&iacute;r who is overcome in Isengard. The stone has been the window between Mordor and Saruman since his betrayal. Now at least that link is broken. The most fascinating thing though is the change of Middle-earth. At least I was left in the \\"Shire-mood\\" longer than I probably should have , thecheerful and bright fairytale . It was a bit of a shock when suddenly everything was dark and serious. Perils and battle are one thing, but the creeping darkness is another. No one is asinnocent and light of heart as before. That is the greatest difference between \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". Tolkien also uses the language to create this mood. His way of writing is wonderful, after all he has come up with new languages, and new letters. It is fair, and often as wellthought over as in a poem. I have never read later fantasy with a more beautiful language.Even though the movie was extremely good, you can't compare it with the book. But promise me that whoever is reading this lousy bookreview will both watch the movie and read the books..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was a great book. The book was full of action, suspense, and a great thriller. Aragorn is my favorite character. He leads the battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn is very brave and heroic. Frodo is the ring-bearer. He is the one who must toss the ring into the fires of Mordor. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves action and suspense."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Although ther are many fantasy books out there in terms of imaganitive power the Lord of the Rings trilogy has them all beaten.This book is in a class all of its own."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This Book is one of the greatest books ever writen and is over flowing with nonstop action. You must read the first two books in order to enjoy this one. It begains with Gandalf and Pipin going to The White City which is attacked in 5 days from their arrivel. The action does not let up tell the end. And in the end the ring ends up destoying itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The biggest master piece of all times. JRR Tolkien is a genius. Who ever likes good fantasy story telling, most read the works of Tolkien. Most of all The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit. Ones you start reading this books you never want to stop. If you found Harry Potter wonderful, JRR Tolkiens work will blow you away."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you haven't read &quot;the Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, but saw the movie,you will still be sufficiently primed for the next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Interestingly the book is divided into two complete sections: one devoted to Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf, and the second to Frodo and Sam.This &quot;chapter&quot; of the trilogy for me contained much more heart pounding action as the stories wind up to their climaxes in the last book.Being a big fan of the Robert Jordan &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series, I became very aware of the many similarities between the two, and where Jordan most likely got a lot of his inspiration.Reading this you can see why it's considered one of the great classic pieces of literature, while still being as vibrant and exciting as any modern work on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this book was enjoyable to read because of the setting and it being a fantasy. Another reason why I enjoyed it because of the battle parts, I thought that those were so discriptive. I chose a quote from the battle seen at the Rock. \\"Yet there are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,\\"said Gamling. \\"I know that tongue. It is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in many western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for our doom seems certain to them. 'The king, the king!' They cry. 'We will take their king. Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers of the North!'\\"To me the theme of the book is the battle of good and evil and not letting evil over take you. And also not to let evil possesions control your life and what you were meant to be in life. It relates to my life and probably everyone's life because the battle of good and evil will always be there forever.I would recommend this book to the people that have read this trilogy because if you didn't it would be very confusing. Especially if you didn't read that Hobbit, the first book, because you wouldn't know the characters in the story and you wouldn't know the struggles with the Ring and how it came about. Also if you have seen the movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, then read the book also because the movie left out some of the parts."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Two Towers,' in my opinion, proves itself to be superior to its predecessor, 'Fellowship Of The Ring.' One reason that I feel 'The Two Towers' is able to accomplish this is the story's overall pace. At one point in 'Fellowship of the Ring,' seventeen years went by where almost nothing took place. In 'The Two Towers,' there is very little room for our main characters to sit and rest. There is far more action in 'TTT' than that of 'FOTR,' and it is because of this that the second of the three books in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is all the more enjoyable. Even the ending (which I refuse to spoil for those who've not read it) is far superior. This one leaves you thinking, \\"No! They can't end it like that!!\\" Fortunately, it doesn't end here, and next on my reading list is the final chapter of the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" trilogy, 'Return Of The King.' After completing 'The Two Towers,' I can begin to see where George Lucas got many of his ideas for 'The Empire Strikes Back,' just as I could see how J. Michael Straczynski had gotten many ideas from 'Fellowship Of The Ring' (as well as the other two 'LOTR' novels) for his TV show 'Babylon 5.'"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second Installment in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.It is a most beautifully written story and you will soon find yourself on middle earth,the place where the story takes place.

The creativity of J.R.R. Tolkien was aw-inspiring and strange denizens and other surprises became ubiquitous (but not overused) fast. Odd creatures and humanoid races were commonplace. Settings were amazing and truly contrived of the stuff of fantasy. Also, the storyline was unique and well concieved. All of the characters were unique and spectacularly designed and each had his/her own personality and individual dispositions. I loved the structure and how the author would describe a period in time from one place or point-of-view, and then tell what happened elsewhere during the same period of time. Ultimately it was.... well, fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King, by J.R.R Tolkien, is a wonderfully written book concluding the three part trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. This book takes place in the world of Middle Earth, during the Third Age (there are 4 Ages in this book). The book starts out with Gandalf and Pippin riding towards Gondor and Minas Tirith. When they arrive, they find that the Grand Steward, Denthor, morning the death of Boromir, his oldest son, and trying to figure out what to do about the impending attack from Mordor. Meanwhile, Frodo has been captured and Sam goes into the land of Mordor to save him. After the rescue, they run into Gollum, and he tells them he will help them to the Crack of Doom and destroying the Rings. They begin the journey, but soon they realize that Frodo is getting weaker because the Ring is getting stronger. At the same time, in the land of Rohan, the Riders of Rohan are mustering to help Gondor in the desperate struggle. Along with them is Merry, who helps them. In the land of Rohan, Aragon is now revealed to be the heir of a great power. He goes into the land of the dead, (No, NOT MORDOR!) There, he gathers an army of dead, now, he is revealed to be the King of Gondor! Back in Gondor, all the forces are colliding, the forces of Mordor, led by the King of the Ringwraiths (Given power by Sauron, the lord of Mordor and the true owner of the Ring), the Riders of Rohan, led by Theoden King, the Men of Gondor, led by Gandalf, and the army of the Dead, led by Aragon. Who will prevail? Back in Mordor, Sam, Frodo, and Gollum are making progress towards the Crack. Will they make it in time and save the day? The writing style of Tolkien is WONDERFUL. Many fantasy novels are based on this trilogy, as is The Chronicles of Narnia. &quot; There were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for Frodo and heavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing sword.&quot; This book is AMAZING!!!

I cannot wait until I purchase the Return of the King, for it is the 3rd book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

I have finally finished the Lord of the Rings. Savouring the last page of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Return of the King is a bittersweet moment. It is hard to say good-bye to these wonderful characters. The first half of this book was dazzling in its darkness and the entire book was only marred a little by the anticlimatic last hundred pages (excepting the delightful last two chapters set in the Shire, still amounting to four chapters of good-bying.)

This book is also the best part from the Lord of the Rings.The book is mainly divided into two parts. In the first part, we follow the acount of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. As the trio continues to search for Merry and Pippin, they run into the White Rider. Is this White Rider a friend or foe? And you will also follow them as they travel through the land of Rohan, and combine forces with Rohan's king and army. Join the crew as they travel to Helm's Deep, and face the forces of Isengaurd, and a final confrontaion with Saurman is at it's hand. The part with Saurman is very alarming and different that what one would expect.The second half of the book revolves around Frodo Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee. The duo is traveling throuh Eymn Muil, with hopes of reaching the Dark Gate, and to make their way to Mt. Doom. On their way, Smeagle, or Gollum catches up with them, demanding his Precious.

Yet unlike his brother, Faramir is able to resist temptation by the Ring. But when a accident occurs, and Gollum misunderstands the situation, the outcome is disasterous.This book was beautifuly written by my favorite author JRR Tolkein. This book will leave you on end, as it did me. It has more action, and drama than the first book, and that is why it stands as my favorite of all of Tolkein's works.

If you haven't read the 1st book then I strongly recommend that you read it before you read the second one(you won't fully understand the story if you don't read the first one).Frodo and his Companions have been beset by danger during their quest to destroy the ring of power. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the Company was attacked by Orcs(aka Goblins). Now the two hobbits, Frodo and Sam, make their way alone down the River Anduin-alone, that is, except for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. The rest of the Company--Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli--set off in a different direction; toward the fast-marching Orcs who captured the two remaining hobbits--Merry and Pippin. The Fellowship is broken. Will Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli be able to catch up with the Orcs? What doom awaits Merry and Pippin? Will Frodo and Sam be able to reach Mordor and destroy the ring? Read the book to find out!I read this book a year ago when I was 12. The book is very detailed and has a background of measureless depth(which makes the book seem like a pre-history). For some people it may seem boring. And in truth some parts take a little longer to read(because of the detailed background). But thats what makes the events in the book seem like it actually happened. If you love fantasy books like me, and you like adventure stories, then this is the book for you. I also recomend this book to people who read and liked the 1st book, The Fellowship of the Ring. You won't be disappointed, this book is as good, or even better than the 1st book.This is a good book for people 12 years old and up. The Two Towers is one of the best books I've ever read, with elements of high adventure, suspense, mystery, poetry, and fantasy. An extraordinay work--pure excitement."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The highest I can give this is 5 stars?! That's all I can give it?! If you love mideval fantasy with extremely suspensful battle sequences, then don't pass over this book. Any of the people who give this bad ratings don't know wht they are talking about. The plot is awesome! The coolest character is Legolas, he is like the best elven archer in Middle-earth. Elves are the best archers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien's power with words reaches it's apex in this , the third volume of the trilogy. From the simple descriptions of the characters to the battle scenes , and Frodo's efforts to scale Mount Doom , the author brings the entire epic to life here in the grand conclusion of the tale. Anyone who can read this and not feel &quot;as one&quot; with the Hobbits has no soul and is devoid of emotions.The book commences with Sam Gamgee believing that Frodo has died in Shelob's lair and undertakes to become the Ringbearer. Denethor prepares to defend Minas Tirith but seemingly has fallen under the influence of Mordor and attempts to cremate the still living Faramir and himself on a funeral pyre. The riders of Rohan are mustered and ride to the assistance of Gondor...All in all there is much action leading to the victory of men against the hosts of Sauron. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam creep ever nearer to Cracks of Doom to destroy the One Ring.Even though I originally read this book 30 years ago , I was once again entranced with the world of Middle Earth on reading it again. One of the few books of the 20th Century worthy of the title &quot;Literature&quot;. Much better than any of the later imitators in the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book will hold you until the end with the continuity of the suspense. Mordor is a relentless force and the ring is even worse for Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgey. They have tried to abandon Gollum, but he has proved helpful in this book to the end. The final battle between good and evil takes place, with all the forces of Middle Earth against all the forces of Sauron and the One Ring. Once you have begun this book, you will not be able to stand the suspense. It does NOT end after the battle, for all of Middle Earth is in disrepair and many of the elvin kind are leaving. This truly is a clever ending to an epic tale of the One Ring.

Only two things can save us: a lost king returns to his throne, and a little hobbit makes it to Mount Doom.Yes, there's a lot of tension in \\"The Return of the King,\\" the brilliant, rich conclusion to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy saga. And rather than cheaping out with a \\"and they all lived happily ever after,\\" Tolkien gives his saga's finale a bittersweet edge, along with plenty of wild battles and good vs. evi..Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a war like this, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Frodo and Sam are stuck in the vividly horrific Mordor, while the city of Minas Tirith is on the verge of completely crumbling. Tolkien does a phenomenal job of exploring the madness, despair, rage and sorrow that accompany a war, and the way it can affect even the idyllic Shire. And he doesn't forget the slow period of healing that follows -- for people, for civilizations, and even for nature.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Speaking of Frodo, this trilogy's hero is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down to a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.And the supporting characters are not neglected either, with the younger hobbits being exposed to the horrors of war, Aragorn breaking fully into his role as the future king of Gondor, and passionate war-maiden Eowyn affecting the war as nobody else could. Some much-loved characters are lost, and others will be permanently changed.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of this book can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following \\"Return of the King.\\"It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A timeless book. Lots of great lessons of life illistrated throughout.

Sometimes his voice is a little irritating in that if you already have an impression of a character his voice doesn't quite fit, (most of the issues i had with this narrator was in the hobbit with thorin) but overall he's excellent."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Having only recently delved into the works of Tolkien recently for the first time, I have to say that I wasn't all that impressed with The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Ring. While I thought that Tolkien had a fantastic and original idea for his time, his writing left much to be desired for me. I did however, enjoy The Two Towers more than the previously mentioned books despite it having a few flaws for me as well. The Fellowship of the Ring needs to be read before this book, and because of that, I am not going to recap what happens in that book for this review. So be forewarned, the following can contain spoilers for those who haven't read the first book.Frodo and Sam had taken off for Mordor by themselves, leaving the rest of the Fellowship to its fate. They encounter the mysterious creature Gollum on the way and through capture, convince him to promise to be nice and lead them along the best path to Mordor. Gollum is a tricky character though and not the most trustworthy and leads Sam and Frodo closer to their peril. Meanwhile, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli have set off in pursuit of Merry and Pipin, who were captured by Orcs. Along the way they come across the Riders of the Kingdom of Rohan, known for their horses, and in the midst of a terrible war. The war is with the white wizard turned evil, Saruman, and his army of orcs that his is unleashing on the Southern kingdom. They decide to help and turn the odds against this horrible force that is descending upon the land.The characters in this book aren't quite as developed as in the first one. While we have plenty of background on the Fellowship characters from the previous book, we don't get much in the way of description for the Riders of Rohan or some of the other newer characters. I do have to say that Gollum is still my favorite. The interesting way he has of speaking and his interactions with the Hobbits are very interesting and a pleasure to read.The writing is very descriptive in other ways and unfortunately this can make the book slow reading at parts. It would have been nice to have more character description as opposed to the multiple instances of describing scenery and legends that aren't even really pertinent to the story. I did find that this book had less song and rhyme than the other and I appreciated that as I tend to skip over them since they distract from the flow of the book. The book isn't very offensive either and despite having battles, not really violent.I look forward to the last book and seeing if it will be my favorite out of all. My opinion has grown more positive with each book and I hope that it does improve.The HobbitBook 1: The Fellowship of the RingThe Two TowersCopyright 1954398 pagesReview by M.

I love this title, and I must say that it is my favorite of the three as well as one of my favorite titles of all time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I love listening to books on cd/tapes, especially when it is read by someone good. This person acts out the book and does several voices so you can distiguish the characters. Make sure you get the same reader for the other two books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Yes, the third book of the trilogy was my favorite. Again, a shame that I waited so long to read them. I have gotten more into fantasy over the last few years, so I was bound to read them eventually. I think, I was afraid of not liking them. My Daddy loves them and raves about them any chance he gets. What if I did not enjoy his most beloved stories? But, no worries, I loved them. They have changed my perception of every book I read in the genre. I can pick out the Tolkien in Harry Potter and Eragon and, well, pretty much every bit of fantasy out there. The reason Return of the King is my favorite, however, is Jesus. No, really. This story is about a King returning to his people and his kingdom, freeing them from fear and hopelessness. It is a story about God's plan for us. And I love that. Actually, I even heard Beth Moore reference a scene from this book in a Bible Study, recently. And, you know if Beth said it, it's got to be the gospel truth. *wink*"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Fellowship is broken. Frodo and Sam travel alone to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. The Three Runners; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli track the kidnapped hobbits, Merry and Pippin. Saruman the White sends his Uruk-hai army to destroy the kingdom of Rohan. Gandalf the Grey returns as Gandalf the White, and informs The Three Runners that the hobbits are safe, and then set out to assist in the defense of Rohan. There are many great battle scenes in this novel, which makes this book a fast and action packed novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a journey where there is a good fight around every corner."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers, takes up where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. When the trust that was so necessary to the fellowship comes undone so does the fellowship itself. The quest splits off and the first half of the book is instead focused on the fellowship that was left behind and their hunt for those members that were taken by the orcs. Even though you don't pick up with Frodo and the ring until half way through the book it was still very exciting to hear about the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, not to mention the remaining hobbits.Many things changed in this novel and it was great to see how many of the characters are growing and maturing, changing and finding new inner strength and wit and hope. And, even though they are no longer on the main quest Legolas and Gimli still find plenty of excuses to knock some orc heads about as they journey into Rohan and discover the treachery of Sauroman. I also loved the Ents and the magic and history they brought to the story. It was also wonderful to read about the geography of the world so you could always follow along with where everyone was easily using one of the maps included in the book.The detailed layers in the story telling in this volume helped the first half come to life as all sorts of new countries and politics, beings and histories, magic and more were brought to light. I loved the poems and the languages and the names that all flowed together to just make the story come that much more to life.The second half of the book was much more quieter. Not as many characters and not quite as much going on. Frodo and Sam continue on alone until they discover Gollum, or Smeagol if you like, has been following them and decide it is better to follow than be followed and rope him (literally) into being their guide. This part of the story ended up being much more personal and seemed to go even faster as you followed the hobbits in their quest to Mordor and see over and over again just how dangerous, perilous and foolhardy the whole thing appears to be. Not to mention every time it seems like they have reached a milestone you realize they have so very much farther still yet to go. There's a whole third book yet!Fans of the movie should really read the books as well. You can immerse yourself more in the world and really take in all of the details, the songs, the legends and the world itself on a far more intricate level that only a book can achieve."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read some of the other reviews here and I'm surprised how much people's reactions are spread across the board. But I suppose that is what truly great art does -- hits people in different places and gets them talking. In my opinion, I agree that at some points the story did seem to drag a little, but the adventure more than makes up for it. For me, the first half of the book was not all that interesting, being mostly battle -- however, there were some significant plot twists (such as the return of Gandalf and Pippin looking in the stone) and new characters (such as Treebeard and the ents) that made it worth reading. (For what it's worth, I absolutely LOVED the ents!!) The second half of the book is what really held my interest, being the journey of Frodo and Sam led by Gollum through the mountains. The dialogue between Smeagol and his alter-ego Gollum is most fascinating, and the character development (especially of Sam) is profound. The characters really grow and change throughout their journey, but at the core is their extremely strong friendship."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Greed, betrayal, infighting, and indecision have led the Fellowship ofthe Ring to break up. Gandalf has fallen, and Boromir is dead. The restof the party is split in two, as Frodo sneaks off with Sam, to go toMordor, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the Orcs that haveabducted the other two hobbits.A lot of breaking stuff, fighting and sneaking to be found here.It ends in a cliffhanger."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have bought the lord of the rings in all it's form since becoming interested in all things tolkien 25 years ago and the trilogy in this form is absolutely superb. Rob inglis's voice and narration really complement the book brilliantly. Excellent stuff."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All three of the shorter novels published as \\"the Lord of the Rings trilogy\\" are fantastic novels, but the action taking place in The Two Towers is fantastic! This \\"trilogy\\" (originally meant to be published as one book) contains lush imagery, rich and detailed description, heart-pounding action and you can really immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth.In The Two Towers, Frodo and Sam continue their solitary journey to Mordor, and are eventually overtaken by Gollum (Sm&eacute;agol). Gollum agrees to guide them to the Black Gate of Mordor, but their journey is fraught with danger (not the least of which is Gollum's dual-personality dilemma). Tolkien cleverly wrote his master epic in six books - two books for each volume which was eventually published. In The Two Towers, the books show the division between the Frodo/Sam storyline and the remainder of the Fellowship. Pippin and Merry become separated from the rest of the Fellowship and flee into an ancient forest full of strange and wondrous creatures. A fantastic journey filled with Orcs, Ents, a confrontation with Saruman and a reunion, not only with the remainder of the broken Fellowship, but with the reborn Gandalf, this chapter of the adventure is definitely a page-turner. Even if words on a page don't tend to excite you, this will keep you enthralled. The world that Tolkien has created in Middle Earth is so easy to lose yourself in, you might not want to come back!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"im sorry but there is nothing i can say about this that hasent been said in the 100000 reviews for this book on amazon!

I'll always love the first several chapters of The Return of the King for its focus on that city-on-the-brink, and for the apocalyptic battle against the witch king of Angmar and his minions. And the great news is, that's just the beginning of the book!Book V, the first part of Return of the King, picks up with the fate of all Middle Earth teetering on the very doorstep of destruction at the hands of Lord Sauron's most powerful ringwraith servant. Aragorn and company forge a last alliance between the human kingdoms of Rohan and Gondor that serve to stem the Dark Lord's tide while Frodo and Sam inch ever closer to their final destiny ... and the ring's (chronicled in the first three chapters of Book VI).Just as The Fellowship of the Ring lovingly spent several chapters establishing a world that needs to be saved, this final installment of Tolkien's master trilogy spends several chapters wrapping it up when the major danger has passed. It seems old J.R.R. was reluctant to leave, but don't be fooled (or over-spoiled by Peter Jackson's abridged movie ending). The uprising in the Shire, which serves as falling action and conclusion, does what so few stories of this scope ever do: wraps up every loose end and shuts the door on the story in a way that made it virtually impossible to sequelize. And Tolkien is to be credited for that.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy, \\"Teeth.\\")"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Anyone who read all of The Fellowship of the Ring and bemoaned its supposed slow start or lack of action (misguided souls ... surely God will correct them im the afterlife) will finally find a home in the second part of The Lord of the Rings. The Two Towers has the benefit of an established world the author no longer needs to set up, and the story moves along from wonder to terror and back again at a most satisfying pace.When we left Frodo, he had abandoned all the fellowship except his servant Sam, unwilling to share his seemingly certain destruction with them. Thus, Tolkien splits his narrative. Book III is devoted to the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they learn the fate of the fallen wizard, Gandalf, and seek to rescue the hobbits Merry and Pippin from the clutches of the orcs. Book IV returns us to Frodo and Sam on the hopeless trek to Mordor. Along the way, they enlist the help of a most unlikely guide ...Epic battles, walking tree-gods, monstrous spiders, and reintroduction of literature's most tragic villain, Gollum, highlight this most worthy second part of the greatest fantasy epic ever written.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy, \\"Teeth.\\")"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"first time listening to books on cd very good but sometimes difficult to keep myself focused."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the second book of the series it is also qiute good even for the ten thousanda of twists and turns tolkien provides. the fellowship is split in 3 now 1) Araghorn , Legolas and Gimli 2) merrin and pippin 3) Sam and Frodo .

The book is adult literature so it may take you awhile to read. The characters in this book learn to work together, no matter what they are. No matter if the are Elf, Man, Dwarf, or Hobbit, they learn to cooperate with each other and even become friends. This book is sad and romantic. The also is gory because there is a lot of battle scenes, so if you do not like fighting then do not read this book or any of the other Lord of the Rings books. Even though, in my opinion, Return of the King is the best book of the Lord of the Rings series, I strongly recommend that you read the first two books, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.

Tolkien takes us once again back to Middle-Earth, his fairy world populated with unique forms of life and filled with ancient myths. And amidst this enchanting setting, we accompany our merry band of Hobbits on their exciting adventures that carry them to places far beyond their and the readers imagination.After the fellowship broke apart at the waterfalls of Rauros, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas set out to rescue the two young Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by orcs to be brought to the traitor wizard Saruman. The chase itself is as fast paced as the second part of Tolkien's first book had been since the departure from Elrond's home. The events that unfold around the three hunters culminate in a furious battle at Helm's Deep where the riders of Rohan clash with Saruman's mighty forces. These chapters possibly form the most intense string of chapters of the whole LotR trilogy.In contrast to the classical epic fantasy style of the first part, the second part of TTT focuses on the journey of Frodo and his faithful companion Sam to Mount Doom, the mighty fortress of evil Sauron. While the first part of TTT is filled with strife and warfare, the second part is also a journey to the true meaning of friendship, trust, betrayal and courage. Frodo and Sam find assistance when they least expect it by the hands of Faramir, brother to late Boromir, who succeeds in uncovering Frodo's secret task, but rather gives the weary Hobbits hope than despair as he resists the temptation to take the one ring from Frodo when he has the chance to do that. And they experience betrayal at the hands of Gollum, who first brings them closer to their final destination, but eventually leads them into a fatal trap. But it's the courage of dear Sam, who prevails when things appear to have been lost and evil is just one final step from victory...And that's probably the key to 'The Two Towers'. Where TFotR focussed on the adventures of a group of heroes set out to defend good from evil, TTT teaches us about friendship and faith, all spiced up by exciting battles and mysterious riddles. That's what makes Tolkien's epic so unique, as it is more than just a string of adventures in a world of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was very good. J.R.R. Tolkien does a great job of painting a clear picture of his world and its characters. One thing he does often that bugged me is he tends to babble on and on about the smallest things. Perhaps this is was makes his books so detailed and descriptive. I've read all the books in the trilogy and I think that if you liked the movies, then you'll love the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is an awesome novel. The first time I read the Lord of the Rings, I thought the Two Towers was the weakest of the three novels. Since then I have read it again and believe it to be much better than The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Rings. After I finished reading The Fellowship of the Rings for the second time, I remember thinking, &quot;Hopefully the Two Towers won't be too dull.&quot; I got my wish. In fact, each page of the Two Towers built my enthusiasm and anticipation. I could not put it down. The Fellowship of the Ring creates a masterful plot, and the Two Towers magnifies it.The Two Towers recieves it names from the towers of Orthanc and Minus Morgul. At Orthanc the deeds of Aragorn, Merry, Pippen, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas are performed. In Rohan they bring about the destruction of Isengard. The latter part of the novel returns to Frodo and Sam and their journey across Mordor and Ithilien to Minas Morgul. The book closes with disaster approaching the quest of the ring and war coming to Minas Tirith.Tolkien is an awesome author whose imagination and skill has inspired my own imagination on many journeys."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is my favorite book in the Lord of the Rings series. From the first pages when Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas being running, running in search of Merry and Pippen, I am hooked every time I open the book. The battle at Helm's Deep is intense. During the battle, Gimli is separated from Aragorn and Legolas. When Legolas hears of this, he betrays his concern for Gimli saying, &quot;But I wish that he had come this way. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is thirty-nine.&quot; A wonderful friendship is born.We meet the King of Rohan, Eomer, and of course Eowyn, the White Lady of Rohan. Women everywhere cheer when she appears! Later we meet Faramir, brother of Boromir, who appears to have the inner strength that Boromir lacks, however he remains in the shadow of his older brother. We travel with Frodo and dear, dear Sam while their guide, Gollum (oh, yes) takes them past the ghosts and battlefields of the Last Alliance.But it is the Ents that absolutely enchant me. Fangorn and his brother Ents (you'll have to read it to find out what an Ent is) are slow, steady, and peaceful creatures. Until they are riled enough to fight. And when they fight...let's say you just want them on your side.Enjoy this book. The middle of a trilogy is often seen as just a tie-in between the beginning and the end of a story where 'nothing really happens'. EVERYthing happens in this book. Don't skip it. It's fabulous."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I hadn't read this since high school and I picked it up again about a month ago. Just an incredible series, it's the best escape I could imagine. If you haven't read it yet, do so immediately, you'll find yourself longing for the simpler life of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read the Tolkien Trilogy every year ever since I was in 6th grade. The Return of the King is an outstanding book, and it concludes Tolkien's Trilogy, The Lord Of The Rings, and it does it well. It concludes the adventures of a ranger fromthe north who's true identity is the heir of kings, and a hobbit's courage and trials. But the only way to understand this wonderful book is you need to read the first two books, which I'm sure everyone would. Although this is a great novel, you need patients to read it. And Tolkien has an outstanding use of words, for he uses old English text. This book is great for teens, but I warn parents that the book might have your kids reading all day long, that has happened to me before. Also, it's a great book for adults, i think. It shows the meaning of freindship, love, and obsession in some sense. And it also shows the meaning of ucatastrophe, which is a sudden turn of events from bad to good, the oppisite from the word catastophe. Tolkien came up with the word ucatastrophe, to explaine the end of the book. He also uses it as in the story of Christ. This is a great novel and I incourage anyone and everyone to read this great book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book starts out from where the first book, The Fellowship, ends and makes way for the sequel, The Return of the King. Frodo and Samwise have left the Fellowship, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go chasing after the orc company that has captured Merry and Pippin. Frodo and Sam meet up with a familiar face. Also, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find someone believed to dead. If you are expecting me to elaberate, you need to go read it yourself . \\"Do not be hasty.\\" as Treebeard (A character in the book) says (J. R. R. Tolkien, 452).There are only two main characters in the book, Frodo and Aragorn. Frodo is a courageous Hobbit (halfling) from the Shire. He has never been out of his homeland before, and is not the typical hero. Aragorn is a human ranger form the north. He is the heir to the throne of Gondor, yet he does not want to become king. The story is set in Middle Earth, a typical fantasy setting. There are four main areas each with its own geography. The Shire, in the far west is mostly forest and small hills while its neighbor to the east, Rohan, is made up of grasslands with mountains to the north. Next to the east is Gondor, which is made up of a mountain range and more grassland. Finally, in the far east is Mordor, the land of the Dark Lord, Sauron. Mordor is surrounded by a mountain range and its other land is cracked and infertile. The story is set with medieval weapons like swords and bows, but gunpowder makes an appearance in the middle of the story.This book is in the fantasy genre. The story contains elves , dwarves, halflings and humans along with various mythological creatures. Tolkien did several things well in the story. The description of the natural formations is extremely detailed and all of them seem like he was really there to describe them. The characters are also taken to great detail. All of them have intricate character and all of their aspects seem believable.The problem in the story that the characters must solve is that the ring must be destroy in Mordor. Sauron tries anything to regain control of it and if he succeeds, Middle Earth is doomed to be controlled by his might given to him by the ring.This book will be enjoyed by fans of other fantasy novel such as Eragon and the Shannara series. The stories share genres along with similar mythology. They all have the same main races along with having some sort of dark lord as the antagonist. It is better than these other novel though because it has more attracted plot and character development. The sentences and thoughts are much more complex and will be hard to grasp to younger readers.In my opinion, it is the second best in the Lord of the Rings series, following The Return of the King, but ahead of The Fellowship. It is ahead of the Fellowship because its more active start but starts slower than The Return of the King. Tolkien's description is full of complex descriptions and the sentences never get old. The British style does distract from the content for the American readers, but does not put it beyond the reach of most readers. My reactions to the book were wanting to read more and I thought that it was well done. I appreciated the detail, but the confusing names prevented me from completely understanding the plot on the first read through. On the second read though, it was much easier to grasp and I was able to grasp it perfectly. Due to the dryness of the book, it was hard to read for hours at a time, but I could easily go for twenty minutes to half an hour. This allowed me to take a break and think about the events, not just rush on to the next chapter. I rate this book five out of five."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Sure, we have all seen the movie, and have been impacted deeply by it (I sure was). The book is also this way, only more broad and fleshed out. The part I hated the most was the end, for I knew I had to leave Middle-Earth. Though I was leaving it, I knew one thing: I would never forget it or what the characters symbolized. Well done, Tolkien. Well done. And thank you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is my favorite book out of TLOTR! In my opinion, it's much more intriguing that the The Fellowship and The Return. OK, I haven't finished The Return yet. But believe me, this one is the best. The beginning didn't thrill me that much, but I couldn't stop after I got past it. The new characters and settings made me so excited.I think the last half of The Two Towers is my favorite, because it has Gollum in it, and I was excited to hear about him again after The Hobbit. Eventually I started thinking in third person without realizing it. o_O It was scary..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As you open the book The Two Towers from the series The Lord of the Rings you will be fill with excitment, wonder, and suspence.

With many loveable characters, a great story, a great new fantasy world with many place to explore, and the rich, moving storytelling were nothing people have ever seen before. Now with the books, video games, fan clubs, and three great movies, LOTR is easily one of the best stories of all time.THE BASIC PLOT: (Contains spoilers, so beware.) The Fellowship has separated. Boromir has been slain by Orcs, Gandalf the Grey fell with the Balrog into the pits of Moria, and Merry and Pippin were kidnapped by the Uruk-Hai. Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, are heading to Mordor to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom.Like the first one, this story is divided into two parts (called Books.) Book III tells about Aaragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's encounter with the newly reincarnated Gandalf the White, their encounter with Theoden, king of Rohan, the fight at Helm's Deep, and their encounter with Saruman, the treacherous wizard. It also tells about how Merry and Pippin's escape, and encounter with Treebeard and the Ents of Fangorn.Book IV tells about Frodo and Sam's encounter with Gollum, the twisted creature with two egos, one being Gollum, the other being Smeagol, his original self, their encounter with Faramir, Boromir's brother, and their encounter with the evil spider Shelob.OPINONS: The Two Towers was an exciting read! Filled with great narrating and storytelling, interesting new characters, plenty of action, and most of all, detail. This is much more longer and better than the movie! J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the best authors ever!OVERALL: A must read. Make sure you read The Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring first, though!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Return of the King\\" is a wonderful culmination to J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Like the second installment, \\"The Two Towers,\\" it is split into two stories. The reader must wait until nearly halfway through the novel to pick up again with Frodo and Sam in Mordor. This manner of storytelling is not quite as successful as in the second book, particularly when Tolkien tries to line up events between the two story lines. The chapter about Faramir and Eowyn, although beautifully written, seems almost an afterthought, being totally out of the chronology. The battle between Aragorn and the Corsairs is weakened because it is told only as a recollection. And in one chapter, Tolkien drastically overuses the phrases \\"and lo!\\" and \\"for behold!\\".But these are minor quibbles. \\"Return of the King\\" is a worthy successor to the first two novels, and every bit as richly detailed. Tolkien's ear for language and eloquent handling of emotional situations combine to produce some of the most heartbreakingly beautiful sentences I have ever read.The Appendices comprise nearly a third of this book. One can peruse these for hours, revelling in the incredible detail of Tolkien's world.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the greatest literary works of all time. It is worth reading over and over and over."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the last installment of the Lord of the Rings, the pivotal moments in the battle for Middle Earth occur. Pippin becomes a guard of the Citadel in the service of Denethor. Denethor, the steward of Gondor, becomes insane and commits suicide by fire. Merry is in the service of King Th&eacute;oden, the king of Rohan. Th&eacute;oden dies in the battle of Pelennor fields. Sam goes into the tower of Minas Morgul to save Frodo from his evil orc captors. Frodo and Sam venture into Mordor where they destroy the One ring. Aragorn is crowned king. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin return home to find that Saruman has defiled their homeland, the Shire. Grima Wormtounge murders Saruman. Sam Gamgee marries his true love, Rosie Cotton. Bilbo, Frodo, and Gandalf go to the Grey Havens where they will go on a ship to the West, or Undying Lands.Out of the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King is the most intense. It is usually the favorite book of those who read it. I find that this book has the most emotion for me because when I read it, I am there on the journey with them. I have grown to love each character and I cared what happened to them. When Frodo and Sam went into Mordor, I was there too. I have spoken with a girl who thought that Frodo was acting like a baby. I then realized that those who only have watched the movies do not have a compete understanding of the power of the One ring. In the movie, the essence of the One ring is lost. I believe that if a person really wants to understand the Lord of the Rings, they should read this book. The Return of the King is my favorite book. It is definitely a great book to read and I want everybody to read it. This book is a tragedy because Frodo is sacrificed in a way. My favorite quote is in the end of the Return of the King, where Frodo says, \\"But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them\\" (382). This shows the sacrifice that Frodo gave to save the Shire. A sacrifice that was not properly acknowledged for it's worth. Sam is the only person in all of Middle Earth who truly knows of Frodo's suffering to save the Shire."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This adventure filled action-packed thriller is only #2 in this awesome trilogy.When the hobbit Frodo Baggins and his friends go out on a quest to destroy the ring of power they find that it isnt an easy road to travel.They find other companions to help him on his journey like gollum the power obsessed fiend that wants the ring for himself,but when he leads Frodo and his friend,Sam,he betrays them while going to destroy the ring in the fires of Mt.Doom.This quest is a difficult one for the hobbit and his friend.I give this book 5 stars because it kept me on the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This trilogy is the best piece of literature ever concieved.

I think from now on Frodo needs start listening to sam, because his instinct about gollum was correct."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second part of the trilogy definitely picks up the pace. The story continues with the epic adventures of the fellowship, only this time it splits into seperate but related subplots. Sam and Frodo in one and the rest of the fellowship in the other.

Boy was I wrong.This book has so much description, it is unbelievable. It makes you want to start talking and writing with more description. \\"In such an hour of labour Sam beheld Mt. Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of Ephel Duath from those who climbed up the path from the west, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched in blood.\\"This is a great story about good vs. evil, Where an unlikely hero is asked to do the unthinkable.....

I think that this is my favorite book of the three so far, but I'll have to hold back final judgment until I read The Return of the King, the final book in what has turned out to be my favorite trilogy. The story as interpreted, is broken up into two stories that combine in the end to make sense of this dramatic thriller. The first part of the book has a wide range of activity; it's about the beginning of the War of the Ring in the time of Middle Earth and it concentrates mainly on Merry and Pippins adventure through mysterious lands. As they meet some of the cruelest and unique creatures, they press on to find Frodo and Sam who are on their way to destroy the ring. The second part of the book follows Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they try to make their way to Mordor, to the top of Mount Doom where the ring can be destroyed to preserve the world. The story turns out to be the most interesting of the two books so far and I highly recommended this book to the educated class who desire a in-depth, breath-taking adventure through a character filled new world.A+"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; book series are considered Tolkien's masterworks and for good reason. The third book begins as Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins's nephew and the Ring-Bearer, is captured by orcs and taken to a tower in the dark land of Mordor. Sam, Frodo's servant and a member in the Fellowship, tries to get Frodo out of the tower. The story then turns to Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor and the only thing that stands in Sauron's way, and his army. They came to the Black Gate (the entrance of Mordor) to buy Frodo and Sam time, for their only hope was the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien describes each scene with so much care and detail that you'd think you were actually there. He takes you to a world of fantasy and adventure that grips you from the start and does not willingly let you go. Tolkien puts the &quot;good triumphs over evil&quot; genre and adds unexpected twists and turns that are thoroughly entertaining. I would recommend this book to everyone. The plot is thoroughly enjoyable and exciting. The story line and flowing and beautifully written. J.R.R.

Picking up just before the climactic battle of Gondor, it keeps up the suspense through to Frodo's internal battle with darkness. I won't give away anything that happens (in case someone has not read it yet) but let it suffice that Tolkien is one of the best writers I've ever read, and his world of Middle Earth is imaginative and the inspiration for almost the entire genre of sci-fi and fantasy. I've re-read the last few chapters of The Return of the King uncountable times, it is so moving. All the characters are realistic and have depth; the settings are gorgeously detailed; Tolkien was a master storyteller beyond compare.

While Frodo and Sam move closer to destroying the ring, fierce battles wage between forces of good and evil with Aragon leading the victors.

It has a sad beginning with Boromir getting killed and Merry and Pippin being captured by the Uruk - Hai and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli run in pursuit of them. When the three hunters find a trail leading to Fanghorn forrest they meet Gandalf again. After learning that Merry and Pippin are with Treebeard (an ancient being of Middle Earth), the four men decide to stop the corruptive undoings of Grima Wormtoungue in Rohan and make King Theoden and his Rohirrim army fight against Isengard. The Rohirrim army go to Helm's Deep to fight off Saruman's Orcs. After Rohan has won the battle, King Theoden,Aragorn,Legolas,Gimli,and Gandalf goes to Isengard to comfront Saruman. The five reach ruined like Isengard where they meet Merry and Pippin. After the Voice Of Saruman episode, Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff and Wormtoungue throws the palantir at them and there Pippin looks into it and is terrified and is taken by gandalf into Gondor.Book 4 is my favorite with Frodo and Sam meeting with Gollum and making him their guide to Mordor. His shortcuts he takes them are long and perilious like the Dead Marshes. On their way they meet Faramir, Boromir's brother and is taken to a forbidden pool area where Gondor rangers hide out. After the hobbits tell Faramir about the ring he lets them go. At the end, Gollum betrays the hobbits and take them to Shelob the spider where Sam wounds her and Frodo is poisoned by her. The Orcs take Frodo away and Sam is left alone in the darkness of Mordor. THE TWO TOWERS is fast paced and is much better to understand than THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.

I think I could read them for the rest of my life! I highly recommend this book or anyone who loves trial and error and good vs. evil stories. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Fellowship of the Ring was an audacious, sweeping fairy tale with fascinating (and sometimes silly) characters, a narrative surge that survived tedious pages of description, and a mythic quality that overrode some of the pretension. The Two Towers was a fan's book, filled with boring Nordic warriors and a lot of pseudo-legendary claptrap, but redeemed by the hobbits and some stunning scenes.Return of the King, the third volume of Lord of the Rings, is downright weird. Tolkien seems to have lost it. For much of the first two hundred pages, he is trying to write Beowulf (possibly forgetting that it's been written already and that this is not the year 1050). He even writes passages in perfect Anglo-Saxon poetic style, replete with proper rhythm and alliteration. Much of this is brutal to get through, with its fawning adoration of warriors and its recitations of family histories. Tolkien is so enamored of these Vikings that he downplays the fascinating and scary episode wherein Aragorn leads the armies of the dead against the forces of Mordor. This imaginative incident is offhandedly retold by Aragorn in the midst of all the stupefying knightly courtesies. Even the hobbits, Merry and Pippin, take on the bombastic cadences of the warriors, becoming sycophantic boobies as they bow and scrape to two different (and nearly indistinguishable) kings. The best sections of this Anglo-babble involve King Denethor of Gondor going bonkers and trying to burn his son alive.When Tolkien finally gets to the Big Battle, the writing energizes, especially when Merry and Eowen-the beautiful princess disguised as a warrior--take on the Head Nazgul. But weirdness returns as Aragorn, who apparently is the Chosen One, begins healing the mortally wounded! This is a bit much, especially when Tolkien's prose turns Biblical (lots of &quot;ands&quot;).We finally get back to Frodo and Sam, who walk to Mount Doom over many, many, many pages (the slightly homoerotic relationship between these two becomes uncomfortably overt in this volume). Meanwhile Aragorn and all the warriors confront the REAL Head Nazgul in Mordor to distract Sauron, and plotting sense takes a holiday. Sauron--this omnipotent creature of darkness, who can see all--turns out to be as easily duped as a freshman buying a phony elevator pass from a senior. He totally misses Frodo and Sam traipsing up Mount Doom. And the only reason the two hobbits get there is because the orcs conveniently quarrel and slaughter each other.And then comes the Huge Climax, the moment the whole epic has been building toward--and it's over in one paragraph! Frodo wants to keep the Ring, Gollum bites Frodo's finger off and falls into Mount Doom. End of Sauron. Eighty gazillion warriors, two kings, elves, dwarves, and a mighty wizard couldn't touch this Prince of Evil, but he's done in by a bit of slapstick! You look back on a thousand pages and say &quot;What was THAT about?&quot;Then, after pages of pageantry, there's a whole new story! Saruman, the once mighty and evil wizard, has set up shop in the Shire as a kind of Tony Soprano, and the four hobbit warriors rout him and his thugs. Where did this extra tale come from? If you know that Tolkien was a Luddite, you can understand the stuff about cutting down trees and building smoke-belching mills. But after defeating Nazguls, Balrogs, and Sauron, routing a pack of comical toughs isn't exactly a challenge for Frodo and company. Amazingly, Tolkien's prose transforms here, becoming plain and spare. I suppose you could admire Tolkien for the tour de force of transforming his prose to fit his characters, but I find it disconcerting. There is a bittersweet loveliness to the ending, where Frodo, mortally wounded in his soul, sails off to the Gray Havens with Gandalf and Bilbo.So this book is kind of a mess. And yet--with all this, somehow the three-volume epic keeps you engaged, and you care about the hobbits. I'm reminded of Moby Dick--not a similar story, but also a book that is a stylistic and structural disaster and yet somehow works. I read all the way through Lord of the Rings and will probably read it again, infuriating and labored as much of it remains. I suppose Tolkien's fierce belief in his own world lends this flawed saga a touching enchantment."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"report by Joe AntonucciThe book I read was Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King. The author was J.R.R Tolkien. What this book was about is that as Frodo and Sam are getting closer to Mordor, there are a lot of troubles with the rest of the world. The world seems to be getting ever more overwhelm by orcs and goblins. Sauron's forces seem to have almost taken over the world. One of the major surviving cities, Gondor, is under attack and Gandolf tries to save it. When it seems like the city would be lost, Aragon brought the help of undead warriors to help them in battle. As all this was going on, Frodo and Sam were getting very close to the mountain. When they got at the top, they meet and very unpredictable guest. I cannot tell you who, because it would ruin the book. What will happen to Frodo and Sam? What is going to become of the rest of the world? What happened to Rohan's king? These are some questions that by only reading the book, you will find the answers too.I think that this book was pretty exiting to read. I also think that this book could get really boring at parts too. I think when there is a lot of action going on, it makes the book seem a lot more interesting. I was able to feel like I was in the book because the author described the characters and there emotions very easily. I think that the main conflict interested me a lot because it was about major battles and a lot of fighting. I liked this because it makes the book a lot more interesting to read. I think the characters were very realistic because of how the author showed their emotions and their personality's. I thought they were very realistic, except that there were elves and dwarfs.The author's voice during the book was more of a serious one. During the really important parts it was but in some of the other parts, he did have a funnier voice. Also at some parts he had a real mellow voice. I thought the author used a very large verity of vocabulary. He used words that I have not ever heard before, but the words still made sense to me. Also the author even made up his own language, which he used in the book. I think J.R.R. Tolkien had a very unique writing style. He wrote in like a olden times style of writing. The writing, at some parts, was very similar to how Shakespeare would write. This writing style is not my favorite because it makes it very confusing to understand. I think the author did a pretty good job with the amount of dialogue though out the book. I think he could have added more to it, because at some of the parts he would ramble on and on about the setting, and it made it very hard to understand what was going on. I thought the author's tone could have been funnier, but I thought his over all tone was good. I think J.R.R. Tolkien could have added more dialogue and a lot more humorous stuff to his book, but over all I would say this is a good book, not the best book I have ever read but it was okay.I believe that Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King was an okay book. I believe that J.R.R. Tolkien could have added more stuff to his book. I beleive he could have made the big battle scenes a little bit more exiting and that I believe he could have added more stuff with what happened to saromon. I think kids of the ages 12 and up should only read this book because it is a hard book to understand. I think this book deserves a 8 out of 10 because it seemed to have lacked parts from the book. It felt like some of the pages were missing but there was not any missing. The author left of at some parts, witch made everything really confusing. I think both boys and girl would enjoy this, if they have the IQ to understand it. I believe this was not the greatest book I have every read but it was not horrible.I believe this book was an okay book. It had an amazing detail in its settings. It made you really feel like you were in the book, but the down sides were that the book was to long and boring. Also it seemed like parts were missing right out of the book. I believe that this book deserves an 8 out of 10. I think this book could have added more to the ending because it sort of left you off. I think this was the worst book out of the 3 Lord Of The Rings books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return Of The King being the last part of The Lord Of The Rings sees the final battle between the forces of Mordor and those of the West.We observe the phenomenal growth in character of Merry and Pippin who come into their own as Knights of Rohan and Gondor respectively . In this capacity they perform great deeds of heroism .We also learn more of the characters Faramir of Gondor and the shieldmaiden and young noblewoman of Rohan , Eowyn .There are particularly strange and interesting scenes such as Aragorn's deal with the Dead Men of Dunaharrow to help him defeat the forces of Mordor and thus gain their freedom from the curse of being undead.The epic Battle of Pelennor Fields sees the heroism and sacrifice of many of the key players in the saga...This book sees the final resolution to the conflict between good and evil.The lesson of The Lord Of The Rings is that the forces of justice and good can win provided we always realise our cause is just and make a clear distinction between good and evil.This holds a lesson in the world-wide fight against terrorism and all those who want to destroy our Western , Judeo-Christian civilisation.This at a time when young people seem no longer influenced by real heroes and when political correctness and narcissism obscures moral clarity.LOTR is therefore more relevant today than ever."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This third and final entry in the Lord of the Rings series sees the crashing together of massive forces as the hordes of Mordor come together against the forces of good on the battlefield.

An unexpected gift, it became pure magic for me. There were moments when I became so affected -- scared, and then triumphant. I was living the adventure of Frodo and the whole fellowship. It made the summer of '86 a coming-of-age moment for me, something unforgettable. The knowledge of the book was something i could hug to myself, a deep dark secret, a source of pleasure when the summer finally ended and I had to start junior high school.When I was older and read it again, I was more critical. I didn't know why. I didn't want to be. But suddenly, Tolkien's words seemed too heavy to me, too ponderous. The metaphors were clearer, though.

In the book the Two Towers a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a mystical ring.

He has manycompanions in his quest such as noble Aragorn, the dexterous elf Legolas, thetough dwarf Gilimi, his faithful companion Sam Gamgee and two other younghobbits nicknamed Merry and Pippin. Together they must fight darkness and bringlight back into the world. I really enjoyed this book because there was alwayssomething happening. There was only one point in the story that became sort ofdull but then it picked right back up into action. Also this book was very wellwritten and whenever it talked about a person or a place you could see them inyour mind. Another problem about this book is that is very confusing. You havetwo completely different stories going on at the same time and it is hard tokeep track of who is where and what they are doing. Overall this is a very goodbook and I would recommend it to anyone who liked The Hobbit, The Fellowship ofthe Ring, or if they like just plain fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Most young or adult readers dream about having a great book with a little bit of everything. This book has a great mix of suspence,fantasy,action, and adventure. It is divided into two parts, the adventure of Sam and Frodo, and the adventure of the rest of the fellowship of the ring. This book is much better than the first but to read it you have to read the first book. The thing that astonished me the most was how the author developed the characters, making us readers know their personalities as if they really existed. I would recommend this book to any good reader, for his dream of a great book might come true."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien is an excellent author, and if any book is needed to convince you, this is the book. I am not an avid reader, and I was suprised at how much I enjoyed reading this book. Even more suprising was how much I thought about the book when I wasn't reading it. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was the first of Tolkien's books that I ever read, and it instantly became my favorite. After reading &quot;The Return of The King&quot; I can honestly say, I have a new favorite! No other book has such a great story, with all the friendship, drama, suspense, and action you could ask for. The only thing better than the story itself is the great ending!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien refuses to end things quite as expected in the conclusion of the Lord of the Rings.As it begins, Pippin stews in Gondor recuperating from his traumatic experience at the end of his story in &quot;Two Towers&quot; under Gandalf's watchful eye, while we see the final battle through Merry's eyes as he unexpectedly plays a major part in the end of the war. Meanwhile, Sam attempts to rescue Frodo, who is weakened both physically and mentally as they near Mordor...This is the most emotional entry of the trilogy, ending not with the war but it's aftermath as the hobbits return to the Shire only to find that trouble has hit home. Merry leads a defense as Frodo begins to learn the price he must pay for having been the Ringbearer.Not only the greatest fantasy ever written, the trilogy also becomes, in this final installment, an allegory about why isolationism doesn't work - and why sometimes the good fight has to be fought, occasionally at great cost, long before home becomes the battlefield."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers picks up the action right where it left off in Fellowship of the Ring. This installment is has a darker and more desperate tone than Fellowship. With the Fellowship sundered, there is a sense of fear and urgancy among its members. Sam and Frodo continue their journey to Mordor with the Ring. Along the way they make an unusual alliance they hope will speed their trip. At the same time, Aragorn must concern himself with treachery of Saruman while coming to grips with his own destiny.There are more &quot;action&quot; sequences in this book than in Fellowship and that may appeal to those who found the first novel dull. More interesting to me, though was how the notion of fate pervades the book. Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, and Theoden all must put a bit of faith in destiny and undertake tasks that they fear might destroy them. The notion of personal sacrifice helps put in perspective the danger that faces Middle-earth. How dreadful must Sauron be if so many are willing to lay down their lives to stop him."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's writing is full of life. I have always felt as though I was watching the exiting events rather then reading them. In the continuing saga of The Fellowship of the Ring, the bond of the &quot;Nine&quot; characters proves their loyalty and unselfishness to the Ring and it's bearer. Though they are torn apart, the &quot;Nine&quot; do not break their friendship. All still play a great part in the threatening mission of the destroying the Ring. I can feel the heavy oppression all around them as they must face nightmarish reality and go where Elves fear to tread. Each characters' action determines whether all is lost or won. My only regret is that I can't read as fast as I've got to know what will happen next. Tolkien's Middle Earth is so full of unexpected creatures, humor and sorrow. He makes me want to know the intriguing stories of the Elves better, and hate the evil Orcs and Goblins with a vengeance. All the songs and poetry he writes in his books seem as though he were only translating them from the real Middle Earth itself. He puts such feeling into all the corners of his writing that it makes it seem as believable as our own history. If you have already read the Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers will take you to places you've never been, into doom or glory. Will the bond of the Fellowship save Middle Earth from destruction? Find out! Read this book of mystery, magic, love and sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkein was the original fantasy author, The Lord of the Rings his masterwork. This is the best book of the trilogy, my own copy has been reread enough that the confrontation with Sauruman is taped in, the last bit of index is missing, and the cover is well repaired. This is darker than the first, and more action packed. As the Fellowship devides, but still travels eastward along roughly the same route, we see more of Middle Earth, meet new characters, and see more action. This in an absolutely indespensible item for anyone who claims to be well read in fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is a great fantasy adventure full of action and suspense.In fact, I hardly ever read but with this book I read straight through! It took me through the make believe world known as Middle Earth, going into vivid details and descriptions of each area that the characters must go. From the vast forest of Entwash to the chaotic and dark kingdom of Mordor. Also, the flow of the book was steady and enjoyable because there was constant action and the book added effect by having multiple main characters.I recommend this book for everyone who wants to know what a great fantasy is like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Having read all the Lord of the Rings series, we have now come to the end of the road where the destinies of our lead characters are revealed.The battle of Gondor is vividly narrated & you feel the fear, pain & sadness of each character.

However, successful as they may be in their quest, the story does not end there. Instead, their lives has just begun for a new age.I am certain, after having read this book, you cannot stop thinking what would happen next to Frodo Baggins while the rest of the hobbits are happily residing in the Shire. All I can do is wish him the best on his next journey."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King starts out slowly, but quickly builds to offer some of the most gripping and emotional battle scenes ever written. The seige of Gondor is awe-inspiring, so well written you'd swear Tolkien was standing there watching it happen before him as he was taking it all down.And that's only in the first 6 discs! It only gets more gripping from that point!*Reading* J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings &quot;trilogy&quot; (I think we all know now it's not really a trilogy, but rather seven slimmer books slapped together to make three fat ones), is wonderful. But *hearing* the books read by a master like Rob Inglis is nothing short of breathtaking. Inglis transforms the books from something you merely imagine into something you actually experience. Each character comes alive and becomes someone you'd instantly recognize should you chance meet him/her.The Return of the King follows on the heels of The Two Towers and picks up the tale of the quest to destroy the One Ring. King is written in the same way as Towers, with multiple tales going on simultaneously. In the Two Towers, the tale is split into three: Frodo and Sam...Merry and Pippin...and Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The tales never converge (Inglis' characterization of Gollum in The Two Towers is chilling, by the way -- what a brilliant performance!) and, in fact, seem to splinter even more at the very end of the book. (I won't reveal what happens lest you haven't heard/read it all yet.)King begins with Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli more or less together -- then going their separate ways again...only to come together, miraculously, at the battle for Gondor. And then...well, you'll have to listen for yourself to discover if Frodo succeeds.As with the previous RecordedBooks editions, this CD set is perfect. The sound quality is flawless. Very clear and crisp. Every nuance of Rob Inglis' marvelous voice is heard without spot or blemish. And the 16 CDs (some 15 hours!) seem to fly by. I swear there were times when I didn't want to leave the car because the action was so gripping.As I listened to The Return of the King -- in fact, as I experienced the entire series on CD -- I kept feeling a stirring inside of me that was hard to explain. I think it has to do with knowing one's place in the world, doing what's right, chivalry, gallantry, royalty, kings, queens, etc.For example, whenever I heard one of the characters address someone like Aragorn as &quot;lord,&quot; or when Merry and/or Pippin chose (out of love and respect) to serve their kings to the end if need be, I wondered if we're missing something these days. Actually, I longed to experience the same thing. Some days I just want to be commanded by my king. And I want to follow wholeheartedly as a loyal subject, bravely wielding my sword in battle. Life is so much simpler when you know exactly what to do. Much more clear-cut.But such is the world of J.R.R. Tolkien. Part of its allure is the majesty of the language. Part of it is the unparalleled imagery of the world he created. And part of it is the gallantry and bravery of the characters.If you're new to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series, don't start with The Return of the King. That's the last chapter. Start with The Fellowship of the Ring. Or The Hobbit, which is the &quot;prequel&quot; to the series.But if you want some of the finest audio book experiences you'll ever enjoy, get this set read by Rob Inglis. His deep, expressive, British voice is perfect to make Toklien's world spring vibrantly to life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part to the Lord of the Rings and contains book three and four. Without reading Fellowship of the Ring, the part of the novel which takes place before The Two Towers, this book would not make any sense at all. However, for those who have read the first part, The Two Towers extends the story for another 400 pages or so of pure pleasure.The story begins where Fellowship of the Ring left off- orcs attacking the fellowship which has been scattered, and Frodo and his servant Sam leaving by boat on their own path to Mount Doom. As one might come to realize, The Two Towers is just as good if not better than Fellowship of the Ring. This book contains a lot of fighting, even right from the first several pages. Much like Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers leaves the reader in a very serious cliff hanger. When I read the end, I couldn't wait any longer than it took to obtain the third book; as soon as I finished the last page, I got into my car, drove to the nearest book store and picked up the third part to the series.Anyone who is a fan of the first book would be committing a crime if they didn't read the second. The Two Towers is a great book. Not at any point does this part become boring and is magnicifently composed just as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King are."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"How could I possibly fit every glorious thing there is about this series of books into 1000 words? Tolkien is a genius; there is no way to deny that. He has managed to create an entirely different world, every tree, every creature, every nuance of language, every folktale; everything is on these pages that might possibly exist in middle earth. That I believe is Tolkien's true genius, his ability to construct this world in his head and to let us visit it, completely and fully for four glorious books. However, maybe that is not the extent of his genius. Maybe not because Tolkien also tells a ripping good tale throughout these novels. The prelude with Bilbo being swept up by a band of dwarves and being sent against his will to battle a dragon takes about a night to read, despite the fact that it covers over 300 pages. And then you start the true trilogy, and the ring that Bilbo finds which seemed like a neat little trick in The Hobbit (it grants the wearer the benefit of invisibility) this ring is suddenly so much more than a very handy parlor trick. It is THE ring; crafted ages ago in elven halls with unspeakable power and unfightable draw. Men kill for it, dwarves kill for it, everyone would kill for it and suddenly you are swept off on another adventure with another unsuspecting hobbit that covers all of middle earth and includes the fate of the world...all over this little unassuming ring that must be destroyed. The journey you take in these books will not easily be forgotten, here I am getting chills thinking about the epic battles between good and evil that spring up like weeds around the path of this little ring and Frodo, the hobbit who is charged with destroying it. These books are just wonderous, I cannot say that enough."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The reviewer who stated that, compared to the LOTR, all other books seem pointless and dull, really nailed it. One of its most compelling aspects for me is that practically the entire thing takes place in the mountains. Those of us who spend most of our recreational time in the hills, whether clinging to the side of a rock face, walking among ancient trees, or floating down a river, will find chapters that resonate clearly and speak to our inate sense of adventure and wonder. Tolkien clearly was a nature lover along the lines of John Muir, indeed I cannot but believe that Tolkien was exposed to Muir's writings at some point. Having read most of Tolkien's writings that are extant, my personal favorite passages are from Unfinished Tales, with its fleshed out versions of Turin's misfortunes and triumphs, and his uncle Tuor's epiphany at Vinyamar, and The Fellowship of the Ring's sojourn at Rivendell, with Bilbo's brilliant &quot;Flammifer of Westernesse&quot; poem and the ominous red star in the sky that &quot;glared above the trees&quot; like a watchful eye. But it is the chapter from The Two Towers, &quot;The Stairs of Cirith Ungol&quot;, that stands out in my mind as a pinnacle of Tolkien's art. His description of the &quot;accursed vale&quot; of Minas Morgul, and the hobbit's ascent up into it, seem to me so vivid as to have only come from someone who had experienced some of those horrors firsthand. The phrase &quot;wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay&quot; clearly refers to the gasses that rotting corpses emit, which Tolkien more than likely experienced in the trenches of World War One, and one can picture the author reacting to these and other wartime horrors as Frodo did, &quot;his senses reeling and his mind darkening&quot; ...&quot;tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side.&quot; Also, Tolkien's most fully drawn character is presented in TTT, the enslaved Gollum, and the confrontations with Shelob, replete with moving references to &quot;the back story&quot; (&quot;...as though Earendil had himself come down from the high sunset paths&quot;) and the imprisoned light of &quot;the last Silmaril&quot; blazing forth &quot;like a white torch&quot;, are sheer genius. The LOTR's power stems partly from its ability to conjure up as plausible a link between the mythology of ancient Europe and the present day as we are likely to get, and if there really is anything in English Lit that even compares, for imaginative output and for sheer storytelling ability, then I haven't read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Interestingly enough, you could read this from start to end without having read The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Ring, but why would you want to?The Two Towers is a bit faster-paced than The Fellowship of the Ring, and the imagination factor is off the scale. Tolkien will take you to places you've never been: forests where tree-like Ents rule, or dark passages where vile creatures lurk, to name a few. Tolkien uses what I think is a brilliant strategy - he splits up his group and tells one's tale for awhile before switching to the other. You'll always be wondering about Frodo and Sam, or else Aragorn and his company at any given time. Hence, you'll end up loving the characters even more.Devour every detail of this book. It is exquisitely written, and it's a book that deserves to be read slowly and deliberately so you can soak up every last word. Tolkien writes very poetic prose. A friend much smarter than I suggested that Frodo is much like Moby Dick's main character. That is, Frodo is the &quot;archetypal Christian struggling to deal with something well past his private reality&quot; (his words). I don't agree 100 percent, but it certainly is food for thought."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part of Lord of the Rings. It was hard to come to a decision, but I have to say that this favorite out of the three parts. With most of the questions left from The Hobbit answered in The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien kicks up the action and takes the suspense to a new direction in The Two Towers. Tolkien brilliantly split the story two ways in TTT. In doing that, Tolkien allowed himself to really develope the supporting characters more easily. This becomes so apparant at times that the lesser characters seem as important as the main character, Frodo. In fact, Frodo isn't involved in about ten chapters of TTT. It gets to be noticed that the characters experience events and situations that really changes their thoughts of perceiving their world. The Two Towers is full of twists and surprises, and it leaves you wanting more. Excellent descriptions of the regions that the Fellowship pass through overflow in this book. Like in The Fellowship of the Ring, you forget that this fantasy, as the background and lore has the sense of a real and complete history. The Two Towers, overall, has a darker mood than The Fellowship of the Ring. At the end, a feeling exists encompassing the real danger that the quest might fail. The Two Towers has one real bad aspect. Near the end, the reader can feel extreme tension and suspense because of the actions in the book. Then it flat out leaves you hanging by the neck, leaving you cursing like you never cursed before, unless you have The Return of the King waiting right there to be picked up. The Lord of the Rings is not to be checked out at the library if a person wants to check out each volume seperately. Some passages will refer the reader to a Appendix, and those are in TROTK. Check out a single volume edision instead, or better yet, buy LOTR, single volume or three volume version. Lord of the Rings should be read and experienced by everyone, and acknowledge that Tolkien was a real genius. We would have suffered greatly if he wasn't born."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Two Towers is a work incomparable to anything out there. The skill with which Tolkien weaves his world creates a vivid tour through the imagination. Every word can be noted to have meaning; each race, and person for that matter, has a different style of speech. As a story, the Two Towers works alike to the Empire Strikes Back (though I am by no means comparing the two, I believe Tolkien's work far superior...Sorry Star Wars fans). It is the second act of a play, with the heros in distress and the Fellowship trying to hang together. Sam has the ring, with Frodo left for dead by the blow from Shelob. The shadow of Sauron eats evermore into the heart of Gondor, and forces are prepared by both sides. The fate of Middle-Earth hangs in the balance by the end of this novel. The Two Towers also displays a wonderful new cast of characters: we at last meet the wiles of Saruman, see the horror of Shelob, and feel the Ents' last battle. Rohan's noble Theoden and Minas Tirith's tortured Denethor also add to the mix, contrasting with each other as the Enemy's work is revealed even in the higher tiers of the Mark and Gondor. Don't miss out on the Two Towers. It is a classic of fantasy which will live on forever in the minds of those who read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings is one of the best fictional works to date. Tolkien was a masterful story teller, one without equal. Whether you like fantasy or not, this book, along with The Fellowship of the Ring, The Return of the King, and of course The Hobbit should be part of anyones library."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I can't get over this trilogy. The book will grab you and throw you into the world of Middle Earth and you'll never want to leave. Then when you are done with the book, you will feel like a full blown heroin addict needing more to satisfy your desire. It is so good that it hurts when its done. Take my word for it. I'm not kidding."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is an in-depth story about the faring of each individual member of the fellowship after it was broken in The Fellowship of the Ring. Some were bracing for war against the evil of Sauron. Others were dealing with the treachery of the evil wizard Saruman.Tolkien masterfully conveys his message to the reader. The general theme of this book is that good always triumphs over evil, and the author displays this in the text very well. When the reader thinks that the fight is hopeless, a miracle happens and good triumphs in the end.When I read this book, I found it to be exhilerating and fulfilling to me. I would recommend that anyone who needs a good book should read this."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part to the lord of the rings trilogy. The first book was translated to a movie which i saw. I liked the movie so much that couldn't wait for the next movie to come out, and many people told me that the movie was exactly like the book; So i decided to buy the book.the author tries to give his message to the reader by expressing it through the plot and the theme. Plot and theme is very important in a story and this book is full of it, it is very suspensful has relations to the rennaissance times in europe. In this story is about a series of rings that were given to all of the powerful leaders of the dwarfs, elves, man and one given to the dark lord of mordor. This single ring has the power to control the world but the ring was lost from the lord when he was killed. It rested for thousands of years until it as found again and given to Frodo, the hobbit. He and some key friends were sent to mordor to destroy the ring. The second book starts in the middle of their misson were all has gone wrong. frodo has taken leave with trusty friend Sam, gandalf was believed to be killed, one member of the fellowship has been killed, and two hobbits were taken prisoner. The three remaining members of the fellowship went out to rescue the hobbits where Frodo felt that he had to go alone(with the exception of his friend Sam) because the ring had a seductive power to people of the weak mind and were trying to steal it from him. The hobbits were found and Gandalf ended up not to be dead. They join with allies and build up an army against the traitot wizzard, Saruman. frodo continues his duty as the ring bearer to destroy the ring while he ecounters many obstacles along is way. The ending is too good to be given away, so too bad."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Who ever said that sequels are never as good as the originals? In Tolkien's second novel, The Two Towers, Tolkien disproves this theory about sequels. The Two Towers is the second book in a three book series.Before reading this book, one should read The Fellowship of the Ring, because in this novel, Tolkien develops the main characters that are all trying to help Frodo destroy his ring. The danger and peril faced in this novel is met and possibly surpassed in the sequel. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the dangers they had to overcome were not as extreme because they were facing them as a group instead of the characters facing them separately as they did in The Two Towers. The Perils are also not as severe as those faced in The Two Towers... BR> If one is wondering how Frodo came to bear this powerful ring, one should read The Hobbit. The novel tells the story of Bilbo, Frodo's uncle, and his adventures with a fellowship of elves also in this novel Gandalf is introduced. Tolkien describes his world that he created for his characters in this novel also.Overall this reader was very interested with the novel, The Two Towers, and found the novel very entertaining. The way Tolkien wrote these fantasies was very unique. Through out the novel, Tolkien was very descriptive. This was a good and at times a bad thing. Take for example an action scene, descriptions are the key to a well-written battle and Tolkien does this very well. Also Tolkien uses good description on his characters. The only bad thing about Tolkien's descriptions is that he may get carried away and starts describing things that are not pertinent to the novel. When this happens it tends to make other things unclear and hard to understand thus makes that section boring and not important to the novel. Out of all the books in the trilogy this reader read, The Two Towers did not take that long to read mainly because it has the most action. Taking into account this reader has not"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"WARNING!This review contains spoilers of the first book,so if you haven\`t read that,I recommend you not to read this.Well,the first book introduced us to the world of fantasy.Then it is time to read the sequel.As you have probably read the first book before reading this,you need no further introduction to the characters.The fellowship of the ring broke up in the end of the first book. Aragorn (the human),Gimli (the dwarf),and Legolas (the elve)has now left Emyn Muil to save the hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orchs.Frodo and his best friend Sam now decides to enter the shadowland of Mordor alone,because it is too dangerous to enter it for the others.This book is divided in two halfs. The first half is about Legolas,Aragorn and Gimli\`s adventures. First,they meet up with Gandalf (that might come as a surprise to many)and then leaves to help King Theoden of Rohan to fight the orchs.Merry and Pippin escapes the orchs and meet up with Treebeard,who is some kind of living tree - an ent.The second half is about Frodo and Sam\`s adventures on their way to Mordor and Mount Doom,their encounter with the creature named Gollum and a really terrifying monster named Shelob.Over all,this sequel is very exciting. It is fun to read two adventures which takes place at the same time,but on different locations. The first book introduced us to the Middle Earth with detailed descriptions etc,but this one is more like just a great adventure. If you like action,this book will not disappoint you.There is a lot more action in this one.Over all,all of the books are like one great adventure. Like the first book,this book has a little unclear ending too (but I won\`t reveal what)to overgo directly in \\"Return of the King\\",the last part of the series.As for what I remember,this was the most exciting book to read as there happend so much. It doesn\`t feel slow at any time. There is always something. And Tolkien has chosen to put out the dramatic sequences here and there. There is no time when it\`s just \\"action,action,action\\" and \\"talk,talk,talk\\". He varies it deeply in all of the books. And I really appreciate that.Now,the first film has already been released and I am now awaiting to see the big screen version of this book. But don\`t forget to read the book too. If you don\`t read this,you\`ve really missed great litterature!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book was great! I found the book very entertaining and would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fantasy. The book is told in the third person showing all the events of Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, which made the book fun and captivating. However, I did become bored with many of Tolkien's unnecessary descriptions that I found too lengthy and often too detailed. Still, the book kept me interested to the very end. If you enjoy books that have both humor and sorrow, then you will love this book and for that matter the whole series.(The Fellowship, The Two Towers and Return of the King)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien, tells what happens to everyone in the company after the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring. The first half of the book tells what happens to Boromir, Merry, Pippen, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandlaf, and Gimli. The second half tells of Frodo and Sam who are lost in Emyrn Muil. The book tells of how they meet a \\"friend\\" who leads them for a while they face many other dangers.Sam Gamgee is a likeable character because he comes from a different social class than the other hobbits and he still protects his master and fights with honor. Pippen seems like a likable character. He does a lot of wrong things at the wrong time, but his personality seems cute. Merry's character is very unique compared to many other hobbits. He has to face things that many hobbits would not have to face. The way the author keeps you in suspense throughout the book and does not just blurt out what he is thinking is good. The ending is both satisfactory and unsatisfactory. The author makes you think one bad thing had happened until the very end. The theme of the book is good always triumphs over evil.The author's style is overall satisfying. At some points in the book the author keeps you very interested and in other parts, he loses the reader. The author goes into very detailed descriptions but it is not too much. The vocabulary is pretty difficult. I disliked the way the book is cut in half and you don't really know what is going on with the other characters until you finish half of the book. The book would probably appeal to people from the ages of 10 all the way to adults because of the violence. It is also, appealing because of the many friendships in the book. I would recommend this book because the book has a well-written story line. I would give this book ***** stars.C. L. A."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The evil in this book scarcely bothers to present itself as anything OTHER than evil. It is in this respect different from evil in the real world. ... Tolkien insists in his introduction to the second edition of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" that the work is not allegory; it nevertheless NECESSARILY bears some relation to reality, and though \\"The Return of the King\\" is fine of itself, it is better if you try to learn something from it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The following review is for people who wouldn't want the reviewer give away the big spoilers -- particularly regarding a certain Ringbearer you well-know and love. But as you can imagine, the fates of the Fellowship of the Ring, Saruman, and Sauron are finally played out in this third and last installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.*** Aragorn faces his royal legacy, the hobbits serve valiantly in the battle against the Sauron, and the Quest of the Ring to Mount Doom is given a fitting conclusion.*** Tolkien's trilogy wraps up in a somewhat unusual manner. Many will find the latter part of \\"The Return of the King\\" to be superfluous and lacking the fire of the earlier action. But thoughtful readers will appreciate what Tolkien has to say.*** The Lord of the Rings adventure is immense and life-changing to its players -- particularly for the hobbits who never imagined themselves so far away from home and so instrumental to the forces of the world. Tolkien's final chapters are about coming home again and realizing that you have a responsibility, wisdom, and talent to bring to everyday life.

The fellowship -- including Aragorn, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf -- is separated from Frodo who journeys to Mordor without them. Aragorn and the others are not at a loss for adventure, however. The first major battles are fought against the dark forces of Saruman and new allies are forged in the process.*** While essential to the epic and not-to-be-missed, \\"The Two Towers\\" is noticeably weakened by the absence of Frodo in the storytelling until two-thirds of the way into the book.

In The Two Towers, the second installment of the Trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, the tale of the One Ring's journey from the Shire to Mordor is continued. While not the fastest paced story at times, the book is still exciting and worth the time to read. The books starts out with the continued tale of Aragon the ranger, Gimli the dwarf, and Legolas the elf as they rush to save Merry and Pippen, two hobbits, from suffering in the hands of the evil wizard Saruman and his Orc servants. Along the way they are helped by the riders of Rohan, Gandalf the wizard returned from the grave, and the Ents of Fanghorn. At the same time, the story follows Frodo and Sam, the last hobbits to remain in the fellowship, as they bear the ring on. They are lead by Gollum and face the many perils of the lands around Mordor.

Here presented is THE ONLY completely unabriged reading of the Lord of the Rings to be found, and to commuters like me, it represents a long awaited opportunity to become aquianted with the work of a genius without fear of losing precious shards of his masterpiece to the whim of an editor. Worth every moment of the 20 hour listening time, from the endearing character voices to the hearty singing of songs and chanting of poetry that is sure to linger in your mind throughout the day. A purely wonderful experience for both Tolkien Veterans and the uninitiated alike."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is so secure at the pinnacle of all fantasy that any review of it risks presumption. The measure of this work's greatness can be found in the thousands of lesser works it has inspired, some in imitation, most in homage--all pale reflections of the world, the wisdom, the wonder of Middle Earth.Over the years, I have re-read this masterwork at least two dozen times. Yet it never ceases to delight me with new revelations. Over time, these revelations have evolved from discoveries about the book to reflections about myself. This is art in its highest form: it inspires, indeed, demands self-understanding.In my younger days, I was drawn to the clash of armies, the glory of battle, the valour of Aragorn and Eowyn, the sacrifice of Theoden and Faramir. But as I have aged, it is the suffering of Frodo and Sam that most moves me. The deepest courage is not found in battle, but in the act of bearing the heaviest burdens alone, beyond help, beyond hope, beyond endurance, beyond even despair--\\"that which we are, we are; /One equal-temper of heroic hearts, /Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will /To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\\"This work is perfect in its completeness. It lacks nothing and is endowed with themes both timeless and universal.Consider the role of pity. We contemplate this theme for the first time when Gandalf reflects that Bilbo spared Gollum's life for pity. Then consider Frodo's first meeting with Gollum: \\"now that I see him, I do pity him.\\" Or Gandalf's rebuke of Denethor, \\"...for me, I pity even [Sauron's] slaves.\\" Faramir's pity for Eowyn--\\"do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart\\"--lifts despair from her soul and permits her to live and to love again. And the pity between Frodo and Sam is the bond that endures at the last when even flesh and spirit crumble. Not least, Tolkien commands our pity: and we, in the act of offering it--to Frodo, to Sam, most especially to Smeagol--take the world of Middle Earth as our own.Consider also that the little people do the bravest deeds and tread where the great dare not: the quest of the ring is undertaken not by Aragorn, nor even by Boromir, but by a timid hobbit from the Shire, whose quality is not in his pedigree or his strength of arms, but in his will and his strength of character. \\"If you do not find the way, no one will\\", Elrond tells Frodo, and, \\"This is the hour of the Shire-folk\\". Sad that since Tolkien wrote his majestic work, his erstwhile followers and imitators have fallen back on such tired cliches as swashbuckling heroes and impossibly clever heroines. The magnificence in Tolkien's creation is not to be found in the strong, but in the humble. It is about a gentle hobbit like Sam, who likes his beer and tends his garden and thinks simple thoughts, but who would stare down death while fighting orcs and trolls and giant spiders, not because he thinks himself noble or brave, but because he is far beyond the noble or the brave. Frodo and Sam are names for you and I.Consider finally, the sacrifice: Gandalf's sacrifice in Moria, Boromir's sacrifice at Amon Hen, Theoden's sacrifice on the Pelennor fields, Aragorn's readiness to sacrifice himself times beyond count. But the theme of sacrifice is most profoundly embodied in Frodo. He willingly assumes a burden that endangers not only his life, but his soul. His ordeal through Mordor and his piteous struggle up the slopes of Orodruin successively leave him with no possibility of relief, of return or, towards the end, even of release. He has long left behind any hope for himself. He goes on because he alone is charged with undoing a great evil and must destroy it or die in the trying. Beyond the terrible burden of the ring, he bears the more terrible burden of his duty to all the peoples of Middle Earth. And at the last, when he saves Middle Earth, he does so for others, but not for himself.In the end, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not about highbrow thematic concepts, mythic saga or epic heroism. While it is all of these things, it is also something better and simpler: a story for you and for me, centred not on impossible superheroes, but on little people--\\"The Odyssey\\" reshaped for the common folk. The enduring power of this work is ultimately founded in its simplicity. In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", Tolkien successfully reaches the heights that all great art attains: he captures the essence and purity of transcendent truths; yet brings them home to the simplest and most innocent of sensibilities--a timeless creation not just for us but ultimately of us."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"By all means, choose this unabridged cassette version whether you are \\"reading\\" LOTR for the first time or for the umpteenth time! I debated whether to go with this cassette version of LOTR or the newly-released BBC CD set with Sir Ian Holm. Thank goodness for Amazon reviews because after reading that the CD set was NOT truly unabridged (how could they leave out Tom Bombadil?!), it simplified my decision. Rob Inglis is outstanding reader and does a fine job selecting an appropriate voice for each of the characters. I personally find it much more pleasing than a host of voices (of course if Sir Ian had done the entire CD version, I'd be back to a difficult decision). The point for me when listening to a book is to hear the story and use my imagination; too many voices or sound effects can be distracting."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the final part of The Lord of the Rings. In this last part the feeling of good versus evil reaches its pinnacle in LOTR. Tolkien gave incredible detail describing the War of the Ring, as it spanned several chapters. All of the characters are developed further, and for most of the TROTK, the story remains a two way split. TROTK has an amazing conclusion, and that is partly bad. Upon finishing the novel, I was sad that it was over, and I didn't want it to be over, because Middle-Earth is a great place to get lost in. You go on the journey that the Fellowship undertook, and feel everything that each member of the party felt. This is possible because throughout LOTR, Tolkien wrote vivid passages describing the regions of Middle-Earth, the characters, and what they were thinking. I read TROTK more slowly, because I wanted to stay longer than what the novel would allow. The four hobbits of the Fellowship become harden warriors, a trait that was virtually absent from their kind. Even though the novel finally came to a complete finish, it felt like it left room for more. It's to bad that there is no direct sequel, and while it answers most of the questions left from the end of The Hobbit, the reader can come up with plenty more questions upon finishing LOTR. Professor Tolkien did a work that was unexpected in its depth. He invented several REAL languages and writing systems, a complete history to back the novel, and created a wonderful world filled with diverse races and environments. Some fantasy authors may have tried to reach Tolkien's level in fantasy literature, but I am certain the The Lord of the Rings will never be duplicated. The Return of the King stands as the incredible conclusion of the greatest epic ever written. My only regret was that it ended."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is one-third over, evidenced by Viggo Mortenson on the book's cover, waves of new readers are checking out what is yet to come.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel. With his own experiences in war, Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, the reader will start wondering if he can actually give it up.Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin have changed as well; Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and has a hand in destroying one of the most evil entities in the world. Pippin's adventures are tame compared to those of his friends (possibly because he's still an adolescent), but we see him moving past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior against Sauron. Gandalf's true nature is glimpsed yet again, but in a subtler manner. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching. Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Aragorn calling the dead, Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, the literally earth-shattering climax, and of course the Havens scene.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. I also advise readers to check out \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In my reviews of The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, both read by British Shakesperean actor Rob Inglis, I wrote that the sound quality on these audio books is crystal clear (neither too high, too low or distorted in any way), Inglis's characterizations are spot-on and the story itself (presented here in the only unabridged version available) is engrossing.The Two Towers continues the story begun in The Fellowship of the Ring but introduces new characters, more battle scenes and a nearly palpable feeling of impending doom as Sauron and Saruman search for the ring.Speaking of new characters, I don't think you'll ever find characters more fascinating than Ents. Ents are walking, talking trees found in Fanghorn Forest. Treebeard (a most &quot;unhasty&quot; Ent) is their leader. He's the oldest living thing in Middle Earth. As Inglis read these passages, I could almost picture the unhasty trees talking to Merry and Pippin. And I longed to look into their very old, wise eyes as they did.The bottom line: The Two Towers (part two of the Lord of the Rings &quot;trilogy&quot;) is equal to the previous books in every way.Which means there really isn't much more that needs to be written. This is, without doubt, the best audio books edition of The Lord of the Rings available.How do you know if The Two Towers read by Rob Inglis is right for you? Well, if you...1. Love Tolkien's stories.2. Have drive time on your hands.3. Enjoy hearing a British voice.4. Don't want to here a &quot;dramatized,&quot; multi-voiced version.5.

Tolkiens trilogy continues in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the second book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The first book, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (read my review on it, too!) end with the breaking up of the Fellowship. The Company is faced with a choice, whether to continue on with Frodo the hobbit to Mount Doom to destroy the ring, or travel to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, to help fight the evil Sauron's forces. But in the end, Frodo secretly goes off alone with his faithful hobbit friend, Sam, to Mount Doom. The other members split up to try to find them.Here is where &quot;The Two Towers&quot; story begins. Boromir is killed while trying to protect hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orcs. The three other members of the Company, Aragorn the Ranger, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf, set out to rescue them. They realize that the orcs are not of the forces of Sauron, but someone else. Then a member of the Fellowship Gandalf the wizard, whom they thought was killed, tells them that the orcs are working under the wizard Saruman. Before Saruman had been good but had turned to evil and wants the powers of the Ring. Gandalf tells them that Merry and Pippin have escaped are in the capable hands of Treebeard and the Ents. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to instead go to the lands of Rohan to help King Theoden in the upcoming war from the forces of Saruman. Here ends part one of the book. The second part tells about Frodo and Sam's quest to the land of Mordor with the unexpected help of... Gollum!J.R.R. Tolkien is certainly a genius, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy have such a depth to it! Middle-Earth is so believable with all the legends, history, geography, language, and races so thought out. Reading the books, I was captivated and couldn't put the books down. Probably one of the best books I've ever read, or will ever read.One of my favorite characters is Legolas the Elf. Elves are so fascinating to me. They're so mysterious, so a part of nature, and a good companion to have. It's so funny how though Elves and Dwarves don't get along too well, Legolas and Gimli are the best of companions and inseparable. Another favorite character is Pippin the hobbit. He's so cheerful, brave, and seems to always get into trouble!I can't honestly say which of the books if my favorite since they're all fantastic. My suggestion to you is that if you are planning to read the books, you should have the whole trilogy on hand, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Also I think it will be a good idea to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which is a prelude to the trilogy and it tells how Frodo's uncle, Bilbo Baggins, go a hold of the Ring. Most enjoyable I think for ages 12 and up since I think the books will be a little complicated for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book starts off exactly where, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; (see my review) ends. The Nine Walkers of Boromir, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, Merry and the Ring-bear Frodo set out from Rivendell. After their leader and guide fell into the abyss in Moria (an ancient palace of the Dwarves in the mountains), Aragorn became their leader.After emerging from the mountains, and passing through the land of Lorien, the Company faced a choice. Should they go to Mordor, where Frodo must go to destroy the Ring, the all-powerful instrument of evil and corruption or travel to Minis Tirith (Tower of the Guard) capital of the Gondor, a nation of Men who are at war with Mordor and its evil ruler Sauron.The Hobbits Sam and Frodo disappear and depart for Mordor. The other two Hobbits (Merry and Pippin) are taken captive by Orcs, despite being defended by Boromir, who is killed in their defence.In the first half of, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; the tale of what happened to Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn is related. In the second half of, \\"The Two Towers,\\" the tale of what happened to Frodo and Sam is related. Within the book, I much prefer the first section of it. The reunion of the Hobbits with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas is one of my favorite moments in the book.In some ways, whenever I undertake to read, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" I dread the second section of, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Personally, I do no appreciate the pain-staking description of every mountain, rock and flower; I keep waiting for some actual dialogue or action to happen. Tolkien obviously had a vivid, EXTREMELY detailed imagination for he invented every single part of his fictional world of Middle-Earth to be believable. There is a history of behind all the races and some of the races have their very own languages.The problem that Tolkien may have run into in his epic work is that he lost something in attempting to achieve the grand scale he sought to produce. His heavy use of allusions to persons and events that the reader knows nothing of start off as evocative and then begins to get annoying. However, in terms of good epic length fantasy literature, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" started it and it is probably one of the best novels of the 20th century. One last note, remember, Tolkien originally wrote the story for his own enjoyment, he did not envision millions of people in dozens of languages reading his work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I've been a fan of fantasy books for years, mainly because I read and fell in love with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a child. Yet I didn't read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; until a few months ago, in anticipation of the new film. Once again I fell in love with Tolkien's Middle-Earth and story-telling ability. I loved the dramatic twists at the end of &quot;The Fellowship;&quot; indeed, I thought I had never read anything quite like it at the time. But the story of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; blew me away.In the first half, Book III, Aragorn leads Gimli and Legolas in hot pursuit of Saruman's band of orcs, who have nabbed hobbits Merry and Pippin. These five members of the now-broken Fellowship find unexpected allies in the Riders of Rohan, and the Ents, ancient dwellers of the Fanghorn forest. The battle at Helm's Deep with the servants of Saruman was riveting.Book IV, which deals with Frodo and Sam's journey towards Mordor, seemed very slow-moving after the events of Books I-III. Still, there are incredible descriptions of the often-barren, mountainous landscape, the hobbits' dealings with Smeagol, and occasional settings of staggering beauty (the groves and thickets of Ithilien, the Window of the Sunset). The sense of impending doom builds as the hobbits draw closer to Mordor. Yet I realized that there was no other way Tolkien could have built up to the conclusion more deliberately or masterfully as I read, late last night and spellbound, the staggering events in the final two chapters of this book.I never thought it possible that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; could be better than &quot;The Fellowship,&quot; but there you have it. I loved Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents, and the tree-creatures' deliberate ways. As a student of geology, I couldn't get enough of the beautiful descriptions of mountains and landscapes. I loved how everything in Middle-Earth is steeped in history and lore - even magical objects like the Palantir, with an ambiguous, almost-forgotten history, take on a deeper dimension. Most of all, I loved the moments of the truest kind of friendship. Friendship grows between Gimli and Legolas, two (initially) unlikely companions. And Frodo and Sam, always drawing closer towards the heartland of the Dark Lord, realize that now, more than ever, they must rely on their companionship and loyalty to each other.I couldn't recommend anything more highly, and would also caution you to have &quot;The Return of the King&quot; close at hand!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King gives a spectacular ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The final book begins as the city of Minas Tirith, capital city of Gondor prepares for war against the Dark Lord Sauron. The realm of Rohan musters all its remaining strength in the hope of saving Minas Tirith. Aragorn son of Arathorn, heir to the throne of Gondor, also gathers an army to try to save the city of Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, Frodo's royal servant, Sam, rescues him from the Tower of Cirith Ungol where a company of orcs holds him captive. Once Frodo has been rescued he and Sam set out to destroy Sauron's evil ring of power at Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor. Will Frodo and Sam make it all the way to Mount Doom through the orc infested barren wastelands of Mordor? Will Minas Tirith fall to Sauron or will they triumph to face him in the final battle?I recommend the Return of the King to anyone who enjoys fantasy, action or drama. Though before you read Return of the King, you should read the first two books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I dislike the second part of the two towers although I did enjoy the first section because it moved much faster then the 2nd section. And the characters seemed to take forever to move from one spot to the next. However the characters themselves were devloped well and had distinct personalities.My favorite part of the book was the ending. Where Sam and Frodo were attacked by the spider like creature Shelob. This happend after thay had walked through caves for days and were betrayed by what they thought was there loyal and faithfull guide. Then beliving his master was dead Sam left him ther and went on only to find out later that his master, Frodo was only stunned.The charaecters were very vivd to me because of there ability to use what they had in the wild. They also had vey distinct personalities. The plot was very easy to understand even though it did move slowly at times. Over all I would recomend this book to people who have alot of time to read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part of The Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien. In it, the fellowship of nine that was once created in Elrond has broken up so that only the two hobbits from the Shire in Middle Earth, Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, remain on the journey to Mordor.Meanwhile, a wizard and former friend of Gandalf's, Sauron the White, has built a large army in Mordor that includes orcs, humans, and a creature that is a mix of both, and is growing stronger by the hour. He needs only one thing for his plans to rule the world to succeed.It is Frodo's mission to destroy this thing, which he happens to have in his possesion; the Ring that rules all of the other Rings of power. This ring has a power so great that if one wears it they become invisible. However, the only way it can be destroyed is to return it to where it was made, the Cracks of Doom in Mordor.On their journey, the hobbits encounter many foul-and welcome-surprises. It is for the reader to find out what these events are.A high point in The Two Towers is when Pippin and Merry enter the Forbidden Forest and come across the long-forgotten Ents. It is exciting because it keeps you wondering how dangerous these creatures are. The low points, thought, are when the author writes about parts of the journey that can be a bit boring. Overall, The Two Towers is an enthralling book to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the greatest epic fantasy trilogy of our time. The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, told of the forming of the Company of the Ring, nine companions, who embarked on a perilous quest to the land of the Dark Lord, the land of Mordor. In the Company Frodo the Hobbit was the bearer of the accursed Ring of Power, which Sauron forged in secret eons ago, and which must be destroyed in the fires of the Cracks of Doom, the one place where the Ring can be destroyed, in order to save Middle-earth from annihilation.The Two Towers begins exactly where the first book left off. The Company of the Ring is scattered by a sudden attack oforc-soldiers, some in the service of the Dark Lord of Mordor, some of the traitor Saruman the Wizard. The orcs, mistaking the Hobbits Pippin and Merry to be the Ring-bearer and his servant, capture them, and Aragorn the Human, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf embark on a pursuit of the orcs, determined to rescue the Hobbits. Boromir has been slain by the orcs in an attempt to defend the Hobbits.Meanwhile, only Frodo and his loyal hobbit companion Samwise Gamgee are left to carry the deadly Ring of Power to the Mount of Orodruin, the Cracks of Dooom, in Mordor. After escaping from a dreary land of rocky mountains, discovers the creature Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring, becomes their guide as they cross the borders of Mordor. . .Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli discover Gandalf the Wizard returned from death. Together with the armies of Rohan, they battle against the forces and strategy of Saruman the traitor. . .The Two Towers is a highly thrilling novel, efficiently and vividly describing the Secondary World of Middle-earth, and the highly believable characters that populate it. I can hardly wait for the film to be released in theaters this December. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The two towers was a fantasy book. It was my favorite book I have ever read.

But I saw the fellowship of the ring and i was hooked. i could not wait to see the next one. So in turn i purchased this delightful read, sat back and read this book while sipping a cool mocalatte on a brisk winter's eve as my turkey basted . (no I'm just joking around... i just read it at school for a project.) any way the book picked up right where the other ended of corse. but the orcs have sam and merry . sam and frodo are off and it starts as a long chase to catch the orcs involving Glimmi, legolias ,and Aargon (Imight of miss spelled some things wrong) it is extremly long and describtive i frankly don't want to say more because maybe like me you wanted to find out yourself but i will say that some guy from catskill,new york wrote some review about the two towers I don't know what the hell that guy was talking about so don't take any thing from that .but the book was awsome this is cliche but really I could not put it down if you really liked the first book you will love this one . the new characters are cool and interesting every wasgood in the first book and then it switches to frodo and sam and even that i thought was good but slow i'm out of time so in conclusion it rocked totally awsome"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"aside from the slow pace of the reading, this recording is sure to please.great in the car, in bed, or whenever.it's verbatum, so read along if you like!don't buy a dramatization, get the briliant origional!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third book in the series of four, this book explodes with adventure from the one before it. It is the sequal to the tale of a group of 9 set out on a sole quest, to throw the ruling ring into the only place it can be destroyed, the Cracks Of Doom. The book goes from one small problem to another until ultimately only Frodo and Sam get to Mordor. from there, i can't say. This book is wonderful and i reccomend it to anyone who has a sense of adventure. this tale will always keep you on the edge of your seat and it will always keep you amazed. read this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I loved this book because it was one of those you just can't put down. This sequal to the Fellowship Of The Ring is just as good as the first. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and it keeps you guessing. I loved this book because it feels like it actually happened and you are hearing from someone who was there. J.R.R. Tolkien puts so many creative creatures and characters in this book. He makes up a history of wars and detailed maps, it is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkein is one of the best books I have ever read. Two Towers is the second book of the Lord of the Ring series. The plot of the novel revolves around destroying the ring of evil power.The novel beginning with an interesting \\"cat and mouse\\" game. The characters are from all over middle earth. Some of the characters are Froto, Gimly, Arawhen, elf and dwarf. The character are trying to destroy the ring. They had to destroy the so the evil would not come back.In the book Gimmle comes later. Gimmle helps them get to somewhere they need to go. He is helping them because he was tortured because he had the for along time. When they found out he had it they found him and tortured him. On the way back they blindfolded him so he would not know the way back.In the book they had a lot of imagery. When I read some parts of the book it felt like I was in the book. He used a lot of description. The symbol of the book was the ring itself. The ring symbols the book because the book is based on destroying the ring. The theme of the book is about the Hobbits. Hobbits even though small have as much to offer as humans, elfs and dwarfs.I would recommend Two Towers to anyone who likes to read to fantasy and adventure books. Tolkein used many details to describe the characters and settings with in the novel. The sere Lord of the Ring is an exciting, suspenseful and action packed book. I cant wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A! Elbereth Gilthoniel!So we stood on the quay with Sam and Merry and Pippen and watched Frodo and Bilbo sail away with Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel, at the end of The Return of the King. For my son's second time and my thirteenth or fourteenth. And when I reached the last sentence and the trilogy we'd been using for bedtime stories for most of his seventh year was over, he said he wanted to start all over again with The Hobbit. Much as I love Tolkien's melodic prose, particularly his descriptions of the landscape in the turn of the seasons, reading him aloud takes some work. But there's a definite payoff. I think I finally got the names down to where I could pronounce them as J. R. R. intended. And it's undeniable that my son got a far-away dreamy look listening to these adventures that he didn't even with Narnia and Treasure Island. Then there is the reward of his admission, the other day, several years later, that despite enjoying the movies, which he had watched over and over again, he'd decided that he really preferred the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I got the whole \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy for my husband woh loved the movies. He has truly enjoyed listening to the audiobooks and so have I. The reader is excellent and provide different voices for each character. I would compare the reader to Stephen Fry of the UK version for the Harry Potter audiobooks. These books were definatly worth the money."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I didn't enjoy this as much as the first part of the trilogy, but it was still pretty good. Strangely divided, though. The events of this book take place simultaneously in two locations, and rather than skipping back and forth, Tolkien for some reason tells all of what happens in one place, then jumps to the other parallel story, occasionally giving chronological markers -- while such and such was happening in the great battle to the north, yada yada. Still, a good, and obviously crucial part of a great overall story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which was never meant by Tolkien to be a trilogy, but three separate books seem a lot more manageable than one 1008-page volume). I liked this one better than the second book, but not as much as the first. I thought that, like in the second book, the way Tolkien divided the narrative was weird. Rather than switching back and forth between two simultaneous stories, he tells all of one, then all of the other. Still, that's a little nit-pick for an epic of this magnitude. I'm not sure if The Lord of the Rings as a whole would make my personal top 10 list, but it definitely deserves a spot among the greatest novels ever written, if not for the writing then for the sheer imagination and ambition of the project. I've never read a book that so convincingly creates an entire world. It's no wonder this is considered to be the definitive fantasy. There were times when I wanted to live in Middle Earth and other times when I set the book down and felt like I had been in Middle Earth for a while. An incredible escape, and well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"im sorry but there is nothing i can say about this that hasent been said in the 100000 reviews for this book on amazon! BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!I LOVE YOU TOLKIEN !!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As all things end, so does Tolkien's revered Ring trilogy. In this concluding volume, the surviving Company, minus Sam and Frodo, reunite to make a last stand against the inhuman darkness which has ushered forth from Mordor to swallow the world. Gandalf, resurrected now as the White Wizard, rallies the combined armies of Rohan and Gondor, Aragorn reveals his true nature and is proclaimed the returned king, and beneath the searching eye of the Evil One, a pair of lowly hobbits, exhausted and nearly out of hope, continue on toward a fateful rendezvous in the infernal core of Mt. Doom. Heroism, loyalty, courage, and determined resistance to the powers of oppression are all themes triumphantly proclaimed in this novel, and there are scenes inside The Return of the King which stand so memorable they endure in the brain throughout a reader's lifetime. Many writers would be unable to end such a monumental series on a note of triumph, but somehow J.R.R. Tolkien achieves the nearly impossible and herein delivers his best work of all."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Return of the King\\" completes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" history as two books with the first reporting the assault by Sauron's evil forces against his enemies and the final book following the covert mission of Frodo and Samwise the Hobbits. The author successfully combines individual emotion and vast warfare in a dark yet delightful fantasy.Various fascinating events transpire, Gandalf finally displays awesome powers, King Theoden of the Rohirrim becomes a stronger secondary character, and even Merry and Pippin the Hobbits become independently formidable. The storyline shows every character having an important part and making heart-wrenching sacrifices to ensure a victory in the fight against evil.\\"The Return of the King\\" resumes the divided separate group plotlines from the original Fellowship instead of intermixing them down a chronological perspective. The method might be confusing but minor references and a moderately short time span helps organize the proceedings. Not only does the reader comprehend the lasting effects of the epic battle years later, presenting a thorough account of actions and the consequences, but also discovers the enormous depth into the genealogy and language inside the different cultures in the appendices.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Merry and Pippin have been captured by orcs and Aragorn, Gimili, and Legalos are out to save them.

It's a fun and exciting book that will entertain anyone who reads it. But it lacks something that the movies really did a good job in. the movies went into more depth and details of the characters. Which isn't something you expect a movie to do. But the book left me hangin' on some of the charcters. The only character that truly gets your attention every time he appears is Gandalf. My reccomdations: don't read this book if you have high expectations from the movie. I'm not discouraging you from reading it but I'm just warning you. It's an intruiging book that will captivate you until the very end.

I think this would be good book for everyone to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This review is in reference to what Jacobs (see review below) and others have written. I have not listened to this audio narration, but I have read the books. It's true that the story goes a little overboard when it comes to details. But it's important for everyone to realize that Tolkien was a linguist. He was most interested in languages, not fantasy. He had invented a completely new language (Elvish) and wanted to share that language with the world. Plus, he was very interested in what kinds of songs &amp; stories different races would have. The Lord of the Rings was the best way he saw to present his new language and songs to the world, to wrap it up within a story. He researched ancient myths and runes from countries around the world and put them all together to create a world called Middle Earth. So if the story seems to go too slowly for you, just remember that it was NOT Tolkien's aim to tell a great fantasy story. His primary aim was to share with the world the songs/stories of the different races, the Elvish language, and his invented Hobbit race. Naturally, that means that he'll go a little overboard describing every little detail about Hobbits and Elvish. Tolkien was surprised by the big response his trilogy recieved, and even more surprised by how many people tried to make his story into something it wasn't intended to be.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the world he created and I enjoy how he brought so many old, mythological creatures to life. If it wasn't for Tolkien, the modern fantasy genre wouldn't have taken off the way it did. If it wasn't for Tolkien, the Dungeons and Dragons world (Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, etc. books) wouldn't have existed. In fact, if it wasn't for Tolkien, many of our modern fantasy novels wouldn't be full of the dwarves, elves, and other creatures in the form they are in now. All those things took off because of the hype over his trilogy during the 1960's. I'm very grateful for the impact his story had. It's just important when you go back and read his trilogy to realize that his aim wasn't to cause any of that. His main aim was not to tell a good story. His main aim was to teach everyone what he had invented (namely, the languages and folklore of the races). I know this because Tolkien himself said so many times. Don't go into the story expecting something different."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is an exciting, fast paced, novel. The novel is about the a man named Aragorn and how he is the riteful heir to the throne of a mighty kingdom, and a hobbit, or halfling, who is on a quest to destroy the One Ring of Power. A dark lord named Sauron aimes to destroy all of human kind and rule Middle-earth. He forged the One Ring of Power, and with it his disires can be filled. The race of mankind fights to destroy it, while Sauron's army of orcs, evil creatures born out of the ground; Nazgul, kings of old who were decived; and evil men; fight to recover the One Ring of Power.The Return of the King is a real page turner. J.R.R. Tolkien, the author, has created an entire world, and history in order to write this book.

Man i dont know what your on but it must be good you see all those cheesy character are the basis for all the other characters in pretty much every single fantasy ever written are based on what tolkien wrote. a dwarf is always the the way tolkien described it in this trilogy, same goes for elves wizards and halflings. Oh yea the story is mundane and cheesy as well. man oh man gotta love the simple minded. you see god knows the whole fantasy setting does seem to blend from book to book, but when tolkien wrote this masterpiece it wasn't and do you know why, because tolkien created the entire fantasy genre with this cheesy storyline. every other fantasy nad i mean every other fantasy you read you can thank tolkien for because if not for him modern fantasy writers would have to go through all the trouble he did of creating an imaginary world with divers races and settings, also a few languages, oh and like i said tha basis that modern fantasy writers use for there characters, also creating a few thousand years worth of history.

This book could stand on its own without a prequel or a sequel. The level the writing takes on is phenomenal. This book concentrates more on the travels of the other companions in the fellowship than on Frodo. Several mishaps and adventures come about as the Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track their kidnapped comrades Merry and Pippin. More than a &quot;cult classic&quot;, this book serves a deeper purpose; it sheds light on the exploits of humanity. It shows the darkness and the unity man posses within himself. The story picks up with the escape of Frodo and the capture of Merry and Pippin. It includes the return of Gandolf and the battle of the Ents at Isengard. Man begins to unite in the land of Rohan.

Let me start off with saying that the movie by New Line CInema is out December 18 in theaters. ok.The Two Towers is a continuation of the first book, the Fellowship of the ring.It starts off where The FOTR ended, Boromir is dead in Aragorns Arms(sorry if ya haven't read that yet!),Legolas and Gimli are running around fighting the last of the orcs, Merry and Pippin are captured, Frodo is in the Lothlorien boat, and Samwise in running through the forest, trying to find Frodo. Sam does find Frodo and convinces him that Frodo needs Sam there with him, and Frodo, being very fond of Sam, decides thats the best thing to do right now. They both get in the boat and paddle over to The east shore and start there treck to Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn is in a very tight spot. He could either follow Frodo and Sam, leaving Merry and Pippin to torment, or follow the Uruk-Hai and leave Frodo and Sam very much unprotected. In the end he decides for the better, that he, Legolas, and Gimli should go and track down Merry and Pippin. So renued with vigar and spirit, they set off at a fast pace. Day after day they run until they reach the plains of Rohan. They see then that even though they are running as fast as possible, with no rests, the Uruk-Hai are very far away and are running through the nights. Even though, they keep running. The hobbits are alive they find, but before they can catch up to them, they are barred by the Riders of Rohan. The Hunt continues until they find themselves in the fangorn forest, where they meet a very special friend, Gandalf! There is alway a big battle in all of the Lord of the Rings books, and in the Two Towers, it is the battle of Helm's Deep. In the second part of the book, it goes back to Frodo and Sam, and Smeagol, or Gollum as we know him. Gollum has offered to lead Frodo and Sam through Mordor safely, or will he? Frodo doesn't know it, but Gollum has more planned out than he thinks...Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would recommend the book Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for people who would read it for fun. I would not recommend this book for some one who is reading it for school because it is hard to journal about or to summarize. This book is for people who like fantasy and books with a large vocab. This book is about a group of people who are trying to get to Mordor to destroy an evil ring."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the J.R.R Tolkein Classic Trilogy, Lord of The Rings.The Book starts at the ending of the first book in the Lord Of The Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, when The Fellowship splits and goes different paths. The hobbits Frodo and Sam go to Mordor to finish the quest of destroying the Ring Of Power. As they pass towards Mordor, Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, who has been stalking after them for the ring.They force him to be their guide to Mordor. As they pass into the edge of Mordor, They go to Cirith Ungol to take a hidden route though the mountains. Gollum tricks Frodo and Sam by taking them to the Shelob, a giant spider. They sneak through its cave and Sam kills the Shelob. But Frodo was poisoned and taken by Orcs to a guardhouse.As Sam and Frodo are on their quest in Mordor, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are tracking The Orcs who stole Merry and Pippin. The Orcs are killed by Riders of The Mark. Merry and Pippin escape and meet Faragorn,part of large living tree race known as the Ents. Faragorn and the other ents attack Sauraman and defeat him with the help of the Riders of The Mark and Gandalf after their battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn , Gimili, and Legolas rejoin Merry and Pippin and head to Tithral Minias to aid Gondor from Mordor's Attacks.I thought that this was a very enjoyable book and I would read it again. The book added many interest creatures and charaters that made J.R.R Tolkein's series famous such as the Ents.I liked how it showed the charaters progression as they passed on their separate quest and conflicts and how they fit into the bigger picture. Each charater developed a distinct personality and showed how they changed from the beginning of the book to the end. The problem with the book was if you had not seen the movie or read the first book , you would be completly lost. At times the book was confusing but eventully it made sense.I think this was a very enjoyable book and should be read with the rest of the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Consider, if you will, an imposing book so flawed that it is filled with uber-heroes, beatific heroines, irredeemable villains, archaic diction, puffed up prose, overwrought melodrama, entire races consigned to evil, and motivations that are told rather than shown. I am thinking, of course, of... \\"War and Peace\\", or perhaps it is \\"Les Miserables\\". Then again, it may be \\"The Odyssey\\", or \\"The Merchant of Venice\\". Come to think of it, this is a pretty accurate description of the Bible.As its detractors so tediously note, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has flaws. However, these critics get so absorbed in picking their nits they fail to notice that, like its fellow classics, this work's pre-eminence renders its flaws inconsequential. If one is intent on fault-finding, faults one will find. But one is thereby blinded to the greater glory.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed one of the most glorious of literary classics. It attains a majestic tone matched only by a handful of its peers: \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" perhaps, or \\"Paradise Lost\\", where the dimension is epic, and the settings, characters and themes pass into the collective consciousness as archetypes. Such archetypes are not formed by chance; they occur only when a creation taps into universal truths and the most essential elements of human nature.Middle Earth, the One Ring, Hobbits and Wraiths, the quest not imposed but willingly undertaken, strength not of body but of will, courage not of battle but of endurance, the smallest in stature carrying the heaviest of burdens and doing the greatest of deeds: these images and themes have passed into the common culture. How we respond to these archetypes depends on the person we are.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" offends by turns: effete intellectuals because it is unashamedly mainstream, the attention challenged because it is lengthy, and jaded cynics because it wears its heart on its sleeve. If you hold membership in any of these clubs, then this book is not for you. Like the best classical literature, this work demands qualities in the reader that are sadly now out of fashion: things like tolerance for detail, a sense of history, a linguistic ear, a love of epic grandeur and an appreciation for literary convention. Most of all, it requires an innocence and an exuberance that runs counter to the existential nihilism of the day. There are no angst-ridden antiheroes in Tolkien, no moral malaise, no self-absorbed ghouls paralysed by the futility of existence. If you must have these things, then look to Michael Moorcock and his Elric sagas. What you find in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is Tolkien's rejection of such thinking.Ultimately, Tolkien's creation is for the life affirming. It comes from a perspective where life has meaning--where even suffering and death have meaning--and the act of living is not an end in itself but is dedicated to a higher purpose. For those willing to embrace such virtues, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" makes a sublime connection to our hearts through its grace, its compassion and its incomparable genius."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This story begins with a young hobbit named Frodo whose uncle found a ring that turned the person wearing it invisible. Then Bilbo (Frodo's uncle) had to leave the Shire. So Frodo took the ring. Then, Frodo went to Rivendell were he met Legolas and Gimli who helped on the quest to destroy the ring in the fires of Mt. Doom, which was in Mordor. On the quest Frodo got separated from all of his companions except Sam.I liked this book because it has a lot of action in it. I also think that J.R.R.

My favorite character is Legolas because the way the author writes about him is awesome."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers, I think, is a wonderful book as are all the Lord of the Rings series. And, I personally think that J.R.R. Tolkien was a genius."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"REVIEW OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERSIn the book there are 8 friends that have a quest to destroy the ring and evil forever. But in the beginning they got split apart, and Sam and Frodo are left with the ring to go to Mt.Mortar where the only the place the ring can be destroyed. Throughout the way Sam and Frodo meet a strange creature who has been acquainted with the ring before. Later on in the book they both figure out what he really is after. In the book there is kindness, love, bravery, friendship, and a life-lesson.The themes of the book are bravery, love, friendship, kindness, and a life-lesson. Bravery is when Frodo faces his fears in the journey, like when he faces orcs, and love is when Aragorn thinks about his girlfriend. Friendship in the book happens when Sam saves Frodo from almost getting killed and kindness is when Sam helps Frodo destroy the ring. Life-lesson is learned by Frodo who understands to keep your friends close. This is what the theme is in the book.The characters are Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. In the beginning of the book Frodo and Sam run away to leave Aragorn sword-wielder, Legolas bow-master, and Gimli axe-holder behind. But later into the book they find an old and lost friend. Also Merry and Pippin are caught by the urau-kia to be taken to Sauroman, the wizard who turned evil. So the ring is left with Frodo and Sam to be destroyed, and they meet something special on the way.The setting in the story is in Middle Earth. It has lakes, streams, rivers, hills, volcanoes, mountains, cities, towns, and fortresses. Or as I would say, it is just like our planet. It also has cows, fish, wolves, dogs, cats, etc. There is also evil as black riders, trolls, goblins, orcs, cave trolls, and sarouman throughout the land.I would recommend this book because if you like a book with friends, action, and bravery, this would be the book for you. There is also kindness, love, and life-lesson to be learned in this book. Characters in the book are so courageous, brave, and loyal to one another it ads up to be one important fight throughout their travels. Another thing I like about this book is the setting because it is just like our own earth. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who deals with friendship everyday."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"We return to Middle- Earth in &lt;u>Return of the King&lt;u/>, the last book in &lt;u>The Lord of The Rings&lt;u/> trilogy.

With many loveable characters, a great story, a great new fantasy world with many place to explore, and the rich, moving storytelling were nothing people have ever seen before. Now with the books, video games, fan clubs, and three great movies, LOTR is easily one of the best stories of all time.BASIC PLOT:BOOK V: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, go to the capital city of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There they meet the Steward of the city, Denathor, who is Boromir and Faramir's father. They must fight a huge army of Orcs and protect the city.BOOK VI: The climax and resolution of the book. Sam goes to rescue Frodo, and they march toward Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. I won't tell you what happens at the end, but it's a great ending.OPINION: Over 450 pages, but beyond pg. 311 are just optional appendixes that give great info to the plot. This is one great and exciting book, and I noticed in the movie they forget to tell about the battle in the Shire at the end. A must read! There are many more books besides The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings about Middle-earth. I suggest you to read \`em all!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third book of the trilogy is amazing, full of emotion. All of the hobbitts become famous as heroes of the realm by accomplishing daunting tasks to help defeat the dark lord and gain freedom for Middle Earth. Saruman is reduced to a truly pitiful creature that is still full of spite. Aragorn is revealed as the rightful king and takes his place at the head of the realm.There are also a lot of real world lessons delivered in this book. Evil must be stood up to and fought against even with everything to loose. Freedom is the ultimate reward and valor deserves much respect. Some people will never repent or admit their mistakes but will always blame others for their downfall (Saruman). And many more I'm sure."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have recently reviewed The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring and can only reiterate: Rob Inglis is the perfect narrator for J.R.R.

Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. This book contains some of the most powerful (Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, Frodo's meeting with Famamir), most humorous (the reunion of the travellers in Isengard), most vividly descriptive (the landscape of Ithilien), and most deeply moving (Gollum finding Frodo and Sam asleep, the story of the Entwives, the choices of Samwise) writing in the entire trilogy. Tolkien also introduces the reader to two completely new and richly detailed societies: the Ents and the Rohirrim. The storyline has been neatly divided in two, and one of these sections further divides in two. Tolkien handles his diverging plots skillfully and with great suspense.I firmly believe that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the greatest work of literature ever written, and a case can be made for \\"The Two Towers\\" being the best book of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book truly enchanted me right through the begining.

Tolkien's \\"The Two Towers\\" is the second part of the classic \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, widely regarded by many as the greatest fantasy epic ever written. The novel is far more sweeping in scope than Peter Jackson's acclaimed film adaptation, especially when the latter comprises only one half of \\"The Two Towers\\" (\\"The Two Towers\\" has scenes which appear in the first and final installments of Jackson's film trilogy.). The title refers to the twin towers held by Middle-earth's dark lords; Orthanc, at Isengard, the home of the traitorous wizard Saruman and Bard-dur, the Dark Tower of Sauron in Mordor. This splendid novel continues the chronicles of Frodo Baggins, the Ring Bearer, and his companions and friends as they seek to destroy the accursed ring, and free Middle-earth once and for all from the threat posed by the Dark Lord Sauron.Book Five recounts the exploits of Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry and Pippin. It opens with Boromir's deathbed confession to Aragorn, admitting that he tried to seize The Ring from Frodo Baggins. Before he dies, Aragorn assures Boromir that he has regained his honor by fighting bravely in defense of Merry and Pippin, now captives of orcs - some from Isengard, and the others from Mordor - returning to Isengard with their prisoners. Soon Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli follow in pursuit of these orcs into the land of Rohan. Merry and Pippin escape and flee into the old forest of Fangorn, meeting Treebeard, the eldest of the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli venture into Fangorn too, and are reunited with Gandalf, newly risen from the dead, after his fierce struggle with the Balrog from Moria. Eventually their paths will cross in Rohan, at the capital city of Edoras, soon after a successful defense of the kingdom from Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep led by King Theoden, his nephew Eomer and Aragorn. And Merry and Pippin will see Saruman's power destroyed and his fortress of Isengard wrecked by vengeful Ents led by Treebeard.Book Six chronicles Frodo's and Sam's eastward trek towards Mordor. They meet Gollum, who is tamed - at least for a while - by Frodo, acting as their guide into Mordor. They also encounter Faramir, Captain of Gondor, Boromir's younger brother, who offers them friendship and advice regarding their journey. It is a journey that becomes more perilous due to Gollum's renewed treachery, as the trio head towards the dark pass of Cirith Ungol and the ancient evil lurking within."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is one that will stay with me forever.

The second is of Frodo Sam and Gollum. While Frodo and Sam are getting closer to mount doom to destroy the one ring of power, every one else is fighting off the armies of mordor.

There is a third part and the Hobbits that are living return home and find out they have to save that as well.This story has good strengths. It all played out. I would suggest reading the other books first. There weren't many weaknesses in the story. I couldn't find any.

So I'm writing this for those who know the film but not the book. There are some minor differences in plot, inevitably, but both Tolkien's Trilogy and the Peter Jackson movie trilogy are great. I REALLY great. After vast battles and perils the forces of good previal, and Middle-Earth is saved, but at a cost. Tolkien unfortunately, I think, cut the final chapter from this, which provides a satisfactorily epilogue. It can, however, be found in his collected work elsewhere. The book also contains valuable appendices, chronologies, notes on the languages of middle-earth, etc. It's hard to say more about something so well-known, but if you loved the film you ought to love the book, too. Incidentally, Hal GP Colebatch's book 'Return of the Heroes&quot;, which I have reviewed on its own page, gives an interesting and insightful socio-political analysis all Tolkienties should enjoy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the final book of the trilogy. The Return of the King is the most suspenseful of the trilogy for a couple of reasons. The first, it is the climax. The second is the order of events. The Two Towers ends with Frodo captured and Sam trying to rescue him. But the story line is not continued until the battle at Minas Tirith is resolved. And the battle at Minas Tirith is exciting as well. When Tolkien finally returns to Sam and Frodo, he leaves of with the Captains of the West making battle before Mordor. Just the order of events makes this one of the most exiting books I have read.The story begins with Pippin and Gandalf arriving in Minas Tirith. Denethor is a proud ruler who has fallen into folly. Pippin enters Gondor's service and Merry enters Rohan's service. Merry rides to battle with Dernhelm. After the battle, the captains ride to Mordor to draw attention from Frodo and Sam. Frodo and Sam make their way to Oroduin, where Gollum becomes an unlikely hero. After the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen, the hobbits return to the Shire, where a terrible shock awaits them. The movie does a nice job, but it was not long enough to include everything.If you're looking at this book, you have probably read the first two, and are ready to get this one. If you have liked Tolkien's other work, I encourage you to purchase the Silmarillion, which shows the beginning of middle earth through the tragedy of the Nolder."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of The Rings: Two Towers is far better than the first although the fist one was needed for ground work so that the second to make any sense at all. Part 2 is very well written with vivid battle scenes and intricate plot twists that were completely unexpected by me or anyone who i know who read it. The way the timeline of when the movie is set is congruent with the introduction of explosives and tactical warfare. The two towers in otherwords is a well written book that sticks to some kind of historical guidelines.

SoonPeriod: 6This book has section 3 and 4 of the Lord of the Rings series, and tells about the companies' deeds. It all starts when Bromir, a fiends who has tried taken the ring from Frodo, dies. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin were caught by orc-guards and are taken to the city of IsenGard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are in pursuit, though. Then the riders of Rohan apper, and they destroy the orcs. The hobbits now escaped and now they meet Treebeard, the ent. Later on, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli meet Gandalf again, who has returned from the dead. When they met with Gandalf, he takes Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to King Theoden's castle. Gandalf heals the king of a curse, and they are now both allied. All of them now continue their journey towards Isengard. Meanwhile, Saruman and Wormtoung are stuck in the tower of Orthanc. Saruman was no longer a wizard after this because he would not repent towards Gandalf. Wormtongue threw a stone out the window, but it failed to Gandalf, because the stone was a palantir, one of the seeing stones of Numenor. Peregrin picks the stone up and gives it to Gandalf, but later steals it at night. Peregrin looked at it, and he is revealed at Sauron. But Gandalf forgives Pippin, and gives the stone to Aragorn, who rides away to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, in a distant land, Frodo and Samwise are lost in Emyn Muil. Gollum has been on their trail. But later on, Frodo tames Gollum and Gollum becomes Frodo's servant. Gollum leads Sam and Frodo through the Dead Marshes and then they reach Morranon, the Black Gate of the Land of Mordor in the north. They can't pass through the gate, so Gollum tells Frodo to go to a secret entrance in the Mordor Mountains. While on their journey, they met Faromir, the brother of Boromir, who was leading an army of Men of Gordon. Faramir learned about the Ring, then tried to overcome his brother, Baromir. faramir then helps the hobbits by replenishing their supplies. After that, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum make their way through Cirith Ungol, the spider's pass. Faramir warned that that place was dangerous, unliked Gollum had told. Then they reach the Cross-roads, and take the path towards Minas Morgul. Meanwhile, they see Sauron's first army, led by the Black King of Ringwraiths. Gollum then guides the hobbits to Cirith Ungol. At that same time, Gollum betrays them, and leads them to a monster called Shelob. But Gollum was frustrated after that because of Sam's bravery. Samwise chases Gollum away and hurts Shelob. After that, Frodo is stung by Shelob and dies. Samwise then realizes that he must complete the journey alone, but as he goes into Mordor, he overhears the Orcs. He now learned that Frodo is not dead, but drugged. The orcs then carry Frodo's body down a tunnel where Sam cannot catch up...I liked the book because they gave italicized poems or songs. I like the songs in this book because they are both cheerful and emotional. They also might give clues what happens next in the story. For example,\\"Trough Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows. The west wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes. What news from the west O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight. Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight? \\"I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey; I saw him in the empty lands, until he passed away in the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more. The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor. O Boromir! From the highwalls westward I looked afar, but you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\\"This song gave me clues what would happen next, so that's what I like about the Story.What I don't like about the story is that there were too many words I couldn't pronounce. Sometimes I read pretty fast, them a hard word that I can't pronounce comes up, and then I'm going to have to read the word slowly. For example,\\"The skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to spread its great wings over Emyn Muil, upon which the dark thought of Sauron brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the vale of Anduin with hail and lightning, and casting its shadows upon Minas Tirith with threat of war.\\" In those sentences, I had to stop and pronounce the hard words I couldn't pronounce. That's what I don't like about the story.My favorite part in the story was near the end of the book. Actually, it is the end of the book. It is the part when Frodo get drugged by Shelob and then taken down to the tunnel where Samwise couldn't catch up. It reminds me of a brother and he is being taken away, and the little brother cries in tears trying to catch up to him. Also I like it because in movie format, there was so much suspense. in the movies, the orcs take away Frodo, carryng him down the tunnel, when Sam tries to get him back. Then after that, it just says \\"The End.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book will keep you on he edge of your seat.

In the begining, Sam and Frodo, two hobbits on their way to Mordor, capture an small and helpless creature who is trying to steal the ring of power away from Frodo. The creature's name was Gollum. He had been the previous owner of the ring of power until Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's uncle, found it in Gollum's cave. Gollum says that he can lead Sam and Frodo to Mordor safely if they spared his life. So they did. In another story line, Merry and Pippen , two other hobbits, found themselves captured by orcs; but one night, the Riders of Rhohan, men who are skilled archers and horsemen, had come and saved them. After their freedom, Merry and Pippen, foolishly ran into the Enchanted Forest. They were unaware of the mythical creatures that lived in the forest. They met an Ent, a tree that can walk and talk. His name was Treebeard. Treebeard took Merry and Pippen to see the white wizard to determine if they were Orc spies or not. Upon arriving, they met Gandalf. They didn't realize that he was reborn and turned into the White Wizard, who had special powers. Meanwhile, Aragon, who was the leader of the fellowship, Legolas, an elf, and Gimli, a dwarf, were in trouble at Helm's Gate. The Orcs, mutated elves, outnumbered the fellowship 10:1. Just when they thought that all hope was lost, Gandalf came out of nowhere along with the banned Riders of Rohan to kick some Orc butt. At the same time, Treebeard, Merry, Pippen and other Ents came to Isengard, the city where the evil wizard Saruman lived. So when they found out that all the trees in the city were cut down, they got mad and summoned all the Ents together and destroyed Isengard.I liked this book for many reasons. First of all, it has a lot of adventure and action. It had lots of battles between good and evil. It had me on the edge of my seat as the Orcs ran day and night trying to get to Mordor, while the fellowship was hot on their trail. Also, it has a great story line. The plot was well written because the author didn't reveal the whole story all at once. He kept building the story line chapter by chapter. In addition, I also liked it because of the mythical creatures in the story. You could visualize how the monsters looked like since the author wrote it in such great detail. For example, \\"They found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It belonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say\\". Those was just one quote of many which are in this book.The reason why I like this book so much is because it is a fantasy. I love fantasies. I also like science fiction movies and The Lord of the Rings has all of these features. Fantasies catch my eye because it most of the things that occur in story, don't happen in real life. For example, In Lord of the Rings, there are cave trolls and talking trees. Fantasy stories are great because it puts me in a different world and I forgot where I am.My favorite part of the movie is when Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas are going into battle with the ferocious Orcs. With the sound of the battle cries the Orcs are making, thousands of these Orcs fight against just hundreds of very brave men. Before this great battle commences, an army of 4,000 Elves come to aid the brave men. Thousands of arrows are shot at the same time striking the Orcs and dropping them like flies. Then the great hand to hand combat begins. Swords and spears start flying everywhere. It looked like a swarm of bees fighting since there were so many Orcs and men fighting. The battle rages on until the gate was breached. It looked as if the Orcs were going to win this war."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Another great Tolkien novel. Characters are excellent. Story is better."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers was an excellent adventure. Of the whole book the only thing I disliked was how the beginning started out a little slow, but it defiantly picked up. I did enjoy how the book opens shortly after the destruction of the group. You have Merry and Pipen who have been captured and taken hostage by a group of Orcs. While Frodo and Sam are trying to get to Mordor to destroy the ring. Then their is Aragorn, Legolas, andGimli who are trying to locate the where about of Merry and Pipen. On their journey they come across the Riders of Rohan. The Riders tell Aragorn that they ran into the Orcs lastnight, and slaughtered them, and they didn't see any hobbits. They must have died in the battle, but actually they escaped into the Forest of Fangorn unnoticed. There the hobbitsencounter a very old ent named Treebeard. Their description of Saraman and the evil wizard's plans move Treebeard to call together all the ents of the Forest. Then they set offto wage war on Isengard.In the meantime, the three companions enter the Fangorn in pursuit of the hobbits. In the forest they are amazed to realized that Gandalf is still alive. Gandalf tells them thatMerry and Pipen will be safe, but that the city of Rohan is in great danger. The four travel to the capital or Rohan, where Gandalf tries to convince King Theoden to ride into battleagainst Isengard. Gandalf does and Theoden leads his Rides of Rohan to Helm's Deep, where they will prepare to defend against a huge army of Orcs.While all of this is going on, Frodo and Sam are traveling to Mordor, seeking Mount Doom. On there journey their is a Gollum that pursues them silently, but aftersome time the hobbits manage to ambush and capture him. The Gollum promises to lead them to Mordor, but Sam doesn't fully trust the Gollum, unlike Frodo. The Gollum leads them, and they travel for many days through the Dead Marshes and later the ruined Plain of Dagorlad. Finally they reach the Black Gate but its impenetrable, but Gollum informs the hobbits that he knows of a secret route, but further south. Frodo again agrees tofollow the Gollum. After a few days of traveling they run into the Men of Gondor, led by Faramir. After hearing the natures of Frodo's quest, Faramir agrees to let the hobbits go,and warns them that the route the plan to take is very dangerous.Once again following Gollum, Sam and Frodo eventually find themselves in the mountains outside Minas Morgul. They enter a dark tunnel and the Gollum disappears. Suddenly, a horrifying spider appears from the darkness. Will they be able to fight off the spider, and why did the Gollum disappear?Plus you must read on to find how the battle turns out with the ents destroying Isengard. Then can the three companions and the Riders of Rohan hold off the outrageousnumber of Orcs?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers is a masterpeice of tolkien. It continues the story of the Fellowship of the Ring as a sequel by bringing all the things that the fellowship had and more. It met the high bar left by the fellowship and was able to carry that mark throughout the whole book.This book so much to offer, from blood pumping battles, to the mythical Ents. It starts by telling the story of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas chasing the band of orcs that holds onto Merry and Pippin. The first few chapters switch between Pippin's party and Aragorn's party. It builds up suspense with the meeting of treebeard and the White Rider. The Helm's Deep is the climax of the first part of this book.The second book continues the journey of Master Samwise and Frodo Baggins, the ring bearer. These two meet a new friend right in the beginning. His name is smeagol. Sam feels that he is untrustworthy yet Frodo trusts his new companion and heeds his advise and uses him as a guide. Smeagol of course is trustworthy to Frodo and proves his worth through the marshes of the dead. He even show him the way into Mordor. The make in a good distance into Mordor when they are captured by their allies, Faramir. He seeks the ring for Gondor, but eventually sees his downfall with the ring and allows Frodo, Gollum (smeagol), and Sam to journey to Mount Doom.This book is simply a work of art by Tolkien. It shows the perfect form of a science fiction novel. It is a must read especially if you liked the movie."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Rob Inglis does a wonderful job reading the whole series.

Tolken does a fabulous job drawing you in to the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the final book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Although a little shorter than the previous two books, it does a wonderful job of bringing all the plot lines back together in an altogether satisfying conclusion. What I love about The Lord of the Rings is how Tolkien brings the unlikely Fellowship together and then has the members spin out into their own adventures- all in service to their original goal, but with each character fully realized and making their contributions in keeping with their own strengths and personalities. It is not the heroism of just one or two characters that make success possible- they are all absolutely essential in their own inestimable ways. Much subsequent fantasy that has followed in his wake falls woefully short of this wonderful mix of plot and personality. It all moves forward with a sense of inevitability that never feels forced. This is a true classic in every sense of the word, and while we all have favorite scenes in this or that particular book, they all work together as a whole. Everything is necessary, very little is gratuitous or drags the story out longer than is absolutely necessary- a trait of restraint that a number of subsequent popular fantasy writers should perhaps have taken more note of. This is even more astounding when you realize the depth with which Tolkien has realized the world of Middle Earth. You sense a real and rich background world, which is evident without being constantly spelled out. For those of you interested in this background material, I would strongly suggest reading the Silmarillian. Only then do you really understand how deep the linguistic and fictional history of Middle Earth actually is- the origin of Sauron's master, the master's fall and Sauron's apparent rehabilitation, the creation of the rings of power and the past history of man, elves, dwarfs and halflings that eventually leads to the story of the ring. Then go back and read The Lord of the Rings again with a whole new level of understanding and appreciation."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book was a good read. The descriptions can get long and parts.But otherwise it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien is one of the best fantasy writters and in this book you will discover why. The book is faster than its prequel and it makes you want to drop every thing else until you finish it"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"JRR Tolkien's second addition to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is full of interesting plot elements and archetypes that create a very riveting and interesting story. The story itself will have you wondering what is going to happen next. At times, the book may seem slow, but in the end, it's all worth it. That being said, you may have to be a fan of The Lord of the Rings to appreciate some of the elements of the story. Simply put, it's not for everybody, but anyone can learn to appreciate the various plot elements and archetypes the author utilizes.The story has some interesting plot elements. All of the characters, such as orcs, hobbits, ents, and dwarves, help to create a very fantasy-filled setting. The dark setting adds to an already interesting story. The dark setting highlights the struggles of two principle characters, Frodo and Sam, and how difficult it is for them to guard the Ring. The Ring itself is rather interesting because of its influence over others. In the bigger picture, Tolkien probably used it to show how desperate people can get to achieve what they want and desire. But simply put, all the elements of the plot somehow create a world filled with fantasy.Tolkien's use of archetypes is very effective in establishing the meaning to the story as well as a means of communicating with the reader. The author could be using the Ring as a symbol of addiction, because it seems that whenever someone comes across it, they become infatuated by it. The character Frodo can be seen as someone with free-will because for whatever reason, he never lets himself be overcome by the Ring's power. Tolkien also uses Mother Nature as a means of communicating to the audience. By using the ents and their leader, Fangorn, and the impending conflict with the Orcs of Isengard he adds meaning to the story by possibly suggesting that people respect Mother Nature or people will get what is coming to them.Overall, The Two Towers is very effective at creating a world of fantasy while putting some worthwhile plot elements into it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The story itself is self explanatory, although the 3 volume story is wordy and less fun than the Hobbit.

In this land, Middle Earth, are enchanted forests, grueling mountains, vast wastelands and glorious fields, all of which are setting to a great tale. A tale of hope, darkness, joy, pain, love, hate, triumph and sorrow all interwoven with masterful skill by a masterful storyteller.

I happen to like the sort of expository preaching that moves phrase by phrase, or word by word (There is just nothing so trivial in text that I'm not interested!); but I know some of you are big picture sort of people, and if that's what you are, then The Message of the New Testament by Mark Dever contains your kind of expository sermons: Sermons that focus on the main themes--the big picture--of scripture.There are twenty-eight sermons in this book--one overview of every book of the New Testament, and one introductory sermon overviewing the New Testament as a whole. Each sermon was originally preached by Mark Dever in his church--Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. Overview-type sermons are unusual (I haven't heard many, have you?), and I would guess that they are more difficult to prepare than the more usual sort of expository sermon. I can only begin to imagine how much work it was to produce this series of sermons, but I'm glad Mark Dever went to all the trouble. It's a fresh new way of looking at the New Testament and what it is teaching us.The main portion of The Message of the New Testament is divided into three sections: [...] Jesus, containing the sermons on each of the gospels and Acts; Key Ideas for the Times, containing the sermons on all of Paul's epistles; and Living in the Real World, containing the rest--Hebrews through Revelation. Each sermon contains a main body, concluding applications, a prayer, and then a section of questions for reflection that build and extend upon what could be learned from the sermon.This is a long book--547 pages--and as you might expect with sermons, the text is dense, although not difficult to understand. I started The Message of the New Testament in January and read some of it almost every day, but only finished it up this week. It's not the kind of book I could skim because I wanted to get every single bit of it, since there was so much to learn.Don't let that it took me so long to make my way through this book scare you off. It was certainly worth the time and effort. I looked forward to each reading session, even if it was only a few stolen minutes while I waited in the car for my son to finish up one of his activities. If I hadn't received the companion to this book--The Message of the Old Testament--in the mail last week, I probably would have been a little sad to finish it up. But as things stand, I've got a new, 800+ page book to start.And I'd be willing to bet that if you take the time to read it, you'll learn something, too. I might even promise you that."},{"Title":"The Message of the New Testament: Promises Kept","review":"Mark Dever has written a companion volume to his forthcoming book The Message of the Old Testament: Promises Made.

Dever explains in the introduction, \\"The sermons in this book are more expositional than topical, but they are expositional with a difference. Rather than looking at particular Scripture passages through a microscope, we are looking down from an airplane.\\" (page 16)What an amazing resource for believers, lay leaders, and pastors alike who are looking for a decidedly biblical, yet practical, overview of the New Testament. Since each chapter was originally a sermon, there is a very logical flow to the reading.

Each chapter also concludes with some thought-provoking questions that are great for personal study or small group dynamics.I wholeheartedly recommend this exceptional resource for its doctrinally sound, yet very understandable \\"Big Picture\\" treatment of the meaning of the New Testament.

All verbs are identified by their type of \\"conjugacion\\", which is explained in a special section \\"la conjugacion del verbo en espanol\\" with examples for each of them(infinitivo, gerundio, participio, indicativo, subjunctivo, imiperativo)."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait, yes I did, the dog. He was the only one who was real. Self centered garbage."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"Warren Adler's \\"Random Hearts\\" is a decent romance, asthe two surviving spouses of plane crash victims meet,and try to untangle the mysteries of the heart. Theyblame themselves and their dead spouses for the harmthat the adultery caused. The book moved real slowly,and then when it hit around 200 or so, it speeds wayup, and the conclusion felt a bit rushed, andcontrived. Not the worst Adler book, and certainlynot the worst book I've read."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"I thought this was a very unique little book, and it kept my interest from the first to last page because its characters were not predictable. I liked the heroine more and more as the story progressed...she was such a strong person. And I liked the twist re. her attitude toward her little boy. Not stereotypically female at all! I don't want to spoil the plot (not at all like the movie - much, much better) but I would encourage people to read it. It's a lot of fun and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"I listened to this book on tape in the car and frequently found myself talking back to it, saying things like: &quot;Is the dialogue going to stay this trite?&quot; and &quot;You've got to be kidding.&quot; Imagine my incredulity when, halfway through this abysmal book, I found out that it had been made into a movie starring two of my favorite actors. I could tell from the trailers that the plot had been changed considerably for the film, and no wonder. But why would anyone waste millions of dollars turning a bad book into a movie?After hearing terrible reviews of the film, I waited until it appeared on cable and finally watched it. Amazingly, it's even worse than the book, with unbelievable characters who wander through the plot jumping to the most illogical of conclusions at the most improbable times.Readers who like good fiction would be well advised to steer clear of this plane crash of a book (and the movie too). Read &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot; by Anita Shreve for a better treatment of a post-air disaster mystery."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"This book was so bad I threw it in the trash after reading it. The only point I could get from it were that the surviving spouses were &quot;star crossed lovers&quot; just like the ones that died, so in the end they understood why they had been cheated on. The daughter mentioned on the cover is in the movie, apparently the person who wrote it didn't even bother to read the book."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"I have probably watched the film Random Hearts about 15 times now. I never get tired of it. The story is one of betrayal at the highest level of a relationship, discovered only by the participants' untimely death. The survivors grapple with clues trying to determine when the clandestine love affair started, where it took them, how serious was it, and how the innocent partners hadn't a clue at all until their partners died. I think this was Sidney Pollack's last film that he directed. A true masterpiece as most of his films were. This is why I decided to read the book. I was not disappointed. Even though the characters themselves were quite different than they were in the film, the tone and essence of the story is intact. It's a thrilling read, suspenseful and exciting."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"Yes, this book did have a misprint on the cover of the book, but that didn't prevent me from reading it. The most important messages from this book, I believe are 1. adultery is a sin- the couple that died got what they deserved, and 2. there is such a thing as the miracle of forgiveness- the couple that survived shall go on and overcome."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"Something drew me to this book in the store (probably the cover). It started off okay but then got very predictable. On the back cover, it mentions that one of foursome has a &quot;daughter and a dog&quot;. It was a son, not a daughter. I really hate mistakes like that. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"I too got the book from the library. The pain each of them felt seemed very real. Then the pain changes to immense anger. The book is an easy read that kept my attention. If the movie succeeds then I would guess they will release a paperback of the book, but look in your library if you want it sooner. Another thing, don't expect the movie to be like the book. They have changed the names of all the characters."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"I see by the reveiws that there seems to be no middle ground as far as like or dislike. I will not go into the story line as a lot of the other reviewers have so there is no need to. I read The pilots wife. Watched the movie and read the book Random Hearts. Of the two I thought the book Random Harts was by far the the best in all respects. Suspence, characters, story line, allso the ending was much better in Random Hearts the book. I feel it was better than the movie but that may be because I am not a big fan of Harrison Ford. As we all do not like the same books, if you feel like you would like to read this one, do so. As the old saying goes. One persons garbage is anothers treasure."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"That's what Viv and Edward are left to do. Warren Adler investigates the chilling calamity of being betrayed. As the two surviving spouses gradually realize their situation, they suffer through disbelief, grief, anger, frustration, loneliness, low self-esteem, bewilderment--all subtlely drawn--to the final crowning human achievement and catharsis--forgiveness and love. I always admire the way Adler frames a story. RANDOM HEARTS is thoroughly graphic and poignantly uplifting."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"Great plot starting out. It really sounded like it had promise, which I am sure is why a friend bought it for me. Two people running away from their marriages die in a plane crash. How would the surviving spouses react to their affair? I like romance and all. But, I could barely finish it. What a waste!How many ways can someone find to say &quot;I love you&quot; within 5 pages??? This was so trite, with so little character developement I cannot even recall the characters' names. But then why would I even want to do so? There are very few books that I have read that I could not find something in them to like. This was one."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"This was a true waste of time. The characters had no redeeming values. The self absorbtion and total devaluation of the child were abhorant. I read it all thinking it would redeem it's self in the end but it only got worse. One of only a handful of books that I wish I'd never read. The Pilots Wife is a wonderful book dealing with a simular situation and betrayal."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"This novel is, essentially, two characters thinking 'I hate you so much right now' to their adulterous dead spouses. And then thinking 'why do I love you so much?' to each other. Given that the novel is so very interior it's a wonder anyone decided to film it. But then again, given the film bears about 0.2% relation to the novel, maybe it's not. Final Score: the novel is (much) better than the film, but then the film was disappointing. So I'm at a loss to know what I'd have thought if I'd read the novel first. Now there's a conundrum."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"This book starts out quite well but once the adulterous spouses die in the plane crash the novel also takes a downward plunge. The behaviour of the surviving partners is quite impossible to credit, their motivations hard to comprehend and the romance between is unbelievably cliched and in bad taste.I somehow can't imagine that this mishmash can be made into a successful film so I think I'll give it a miss."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"This new version of a 1980s book is prompted by the release of a current Harrison Ford movie based on the novel. In all ways the book is better than the motion picture. The book has style and believability. It was based on the true story of the Air Florida crash into the Potomac River. The movie has almost nothing to do with the original story. Roles are changed, names are changed, careers are changed, and the entire thrust of the book is altered almost beyond belief. Read the book. It is solid and professional. No loose ends are left and the story moves briskly to a satisfying end. First rate in every way. Enjoy the novel and do not confuse it with the movie."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"Would they have ever met, if.....?This is the story of Edward Davis and Viven Simpson, the surviving spouses of a couple who are killed in a airplane crash on the way to sun, sand, and adultery. He's a congressional assistant from Iowa. She's a dedicated housewife from Vermont. Both were happily married, or so they thought.When they meet for the first time in the Medical Examiner's office, identifying their deceased spouses' bodies, both are shocked by their betrayal. Their friends and families don't understand how they feel. Homicide Detective McCarthy tells them to get on with their lives. But Edward and Vivien need to know how the affair could have happened. They need to realize the truth about their spouses. And they need to understand themselves.They come together realizing that only they understand their own emotions, and offer each other the support that they can't expect from their families and friends, who saw them as halves of dedicated couples. His job is on the line. She has a child. But they each need a fresh start.They each have a matching key belonging to their dead spouses. What do these keys unlock-physically and metaphysically? This is the question that occupies Edward and Vivien throughout the book, and while searching for the answer they become a solidly locked new entity.Readers may wish that Edward and Vivien would confide the truth to their unsupportive families and friends, especially Edward, who is menaced by his in-laws. It's short and fast-paced, so you get to the end quickly wishing there were more. But it's an exciting read, that keeps you turning the pages all the way through.Ironically, I read this book just as the World Trade Center buildings came crashing to the ground as the result of airplane crashes. I felt much of my own sense of personal security disappear just as Edward's and Vivien's do. The characters both feel during their psychological journey that they can't trust the people closest to them not to cause them pain. Just as we must all implement new security procedures to protect ourselves, so must Edward and Vivien re-evaluate their relationships with their families and friends-and each other. Can we-and they-ever again feel truly safe? The investigating officer tells them to go on with their lives, just as we have been asked to. But will things ever be the same again? And can we, the survivors of the attacks, come together in a new awareness of ourselves, as do Edward and Vivien? It remains to be seen if the recent tragedies will bring together more random hearts."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"The start of the paperback had me very interested, but halfway through, I began losing interest. The behavior of both surviving spouses did not seem logical, (such as the boy's mother leaving him for months, with his grandparents, with one or two phone calls with him.) I finished the book, but did not feel anything. I will feel regret that the pleasure of reading it is over, when an excellent book is finished. It may be a better movie than book."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"Warren Adler started with a simple plot of an unfaithful husband and an another man's unfaithful wife. Simple start that starts slowly but draws you in so deep that you're trying to guide the remaining two characters- partly to make sure that they fall in love, and quickly. The two guilty parties have already been signed to the deep, so we're just pulling for the survivors as if they were destined to meet and fall in love and the basic plot and the other two characters had to be inserted and wraps around them for that effect. Read the book - forget the movie. Incidentially I've read the book 7 times - it's that good and different. Incidentially I'm a much older kid."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"It is the reader's misfortunate that all of the characters do not die in the plane crash that occurs at the beginning of the book. Pass this book up and read instead &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot; by Anita Sheve."},{"Title":"Random Hearts","review":"This book was awful from the very beginning and, listening to it on tape, I don't know why I finished it after hearing the silly dialog at the beginning between the two doomed cheaters. They sounded like two hormonally driven 16 year-olds and, already knowing what would happen to them, my anxious wait for their time to end seemed gruellingly slow.I didn't feel bad for Edward and Vivian either, because an entire book of turning a rock over to examine every feeling and everything two spouses can experience emotionally is like being anchored to a feather in a stormy ocean. Their own affair made me want to vomit, and the ending was a joke. Tawdry cheap affairs all around, and not one sympathetic character among them except for the kid and the dog who are treated cruelly and irrationally by the betrayed wife. I never saw the movie and, after hearing it's worse than this book, don't want to. Time's one thing you can't get back, so don't waste yours or your money on this book full of bad dialog and insipid, unlikeable characters."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Why read the whole series if you're such a critic. Maybe you have no life, so you spend you're life reading, so you can sound knowledgeable in criticizing the material. Who cares if the good guys always win and it is not unpredictable, it satisfied me, and I'm sure, millions of other people. Books are to entertain and be interesting, and out of all the books I've read, this is the highest in each of those categories. I never thought fantasy would interest me, but after my brother forced me to read this series, I changed my whole view. I would reccommend these books to anyone and everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I just finished my second reading of Enchanters. Between them I read Sorceress. It is in many ways the same book. The cast is wandering around trying to get to the right place at the right time to do the right thing. The pleasure is in the journey, the little and apparently purposeless events which are fun to read about. Enchanters, unlike Sorceress, actually has a major event at the end, followed by everyone getting married like a Shakepearean comedy. What I'm saying is that I find Eddings like Wolfe. I just pick up the books and read them without worrying about the plot."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"i loved the whole series. escpecially this book.

This is one of the best books ive ever come across and i'm no Fantasy fanatic. A must read for everyone who thinks that fantasy is boring!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"After reading all five books of the Belgariad, this particular book stood out. The culmination of the prophesy, the last great battle between Torak and Belgarion, was tension-filled and had one sitting on the edge of one's chair. Characters such as Barak, Polgara, Silk, Xenedra allowed the reader to relate to them on a one-to-one basis. You felt as if they were in the same room with you. They made the book all that more interesting to read. You cried with them and laughed with them. The author has really done a great job writing a novel in this genre."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Before I start this review, I have to admit that I cried when I read the battle scene..It was so SAD. This book wraps up the plot so well, and all the characters are loveable and even though it's not the most original plot it's still a good/funny story"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I've read all of the books related to this saga, and I own Belgarath the Sorcerer. To the people who say it is a typical story, KEEP READING! It only gets better. If you want something more complicated and you want a backround on the story, read BELGARTH. Or Polgara the Sorceress. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"This series started off with much promise. The first book was excellent, as well as the first two parts of the second, but besides isolated sections the rest of the series suffers from a lack of consistency and intensity. I have two main gripes with this last book. The &quot;great war&quot; at the end between the different forces seemed forced and fluffy and I never really got a feeling that the &quot;good side&quot; might lose, almost like Eddings was going through the motions to fill up pages. Also, the actual conclusion to the whole series is surprisingly anticlimatic in my mind and let me down a little. Eddings' characters are pretty interesting, although they are mostly little more than strict adherences of practically all the fantastical archetypes. Several characters like Silk, Barak, and Mandorallen I especially liked and wondered why Eddings didn't discuss them further, especially in later stages of the series. The relationships between the men and women is interesting and I found myself rooting for som"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"DON'T READ THIS BOOK........ YET.

Quite simply put,it's good, it's fantastic, just go out , buy this book and read it..you can thank me later.I envy those who have never read it for the y get to be introduced to such imaginative characters such as Belgarath and Silk. A truly epic saga that deserves more praise than could ever be putdown in writing. WHat are you waiting for, read it!... trust me"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Of all the books that I have read, this is the best. Nobody does it better than David Eddings. His style of writing is so unique in a way that you'd think he's actually been there. The words that describes the scenes and objects that the characters see just sinks into ones mind.The characters' actions, characteristics, and the way they talk makes them alive. And it almost makes you believe that your right next to them and seeing all the action in front of you, but you theres no way you talk or respond to them.The way Belgarath and Garion communicates with wolve, and the way they describe wolves is so unbelievable that it's great. It's like seeing and feeling how wolves acually are.David Eddings description of how Torak was slayed and the action of the other gods were incridible. Nobody is better than David Eddings himself"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I love this book. The way they describe the battles - having each element of the rainbow-array army move in turn. I almost cried for the Arendish serf boy. &quot;The song ended very suddenly, never to begin again.&quot; I of course loved the EVENT. Some of the parts were funny. &quot;I thought you wanted to stand around and watch the world change.&quot; &quot;Please stop groaning, Rhodar. You sound like a sick cow.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to do? Walk around with a sign on my chest reading &quot;spy&quot;?&quot; I liked it when Queen Islena finally delivered that ultimatum to Grodeg. I liked the childish way Ce'Nedra declared, &quot;I'm invading Mishrak Ac Thull, Uncle Varana.&quot; It was sweetly sad when Morin way saying, &quot;Sleep, Ran Bourne. You can play with your little toy soldiers again tomorrow.&quot; And of course I liked when Polgara discovered she had had her power all along. I could kind of see it coming though, when it was Errand who finally brought Durnik back. This was also the first book where I was abe to figure out that Chaldan was the god of the Arends. This is a must read. Breathe deep seek peace, Tin"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"An extremly good story that's both serious and hilarious inturns, the Magician's End-Game nicely caps off the five bookBelgariad series. Extremly well written, it tellsabout the periodafter Belgarion's crowning when he makes thejourney to Mallorea, and to the inevitable clash betweenTorak and himself. Meanwhile, the Imperial Princess and future QueenCe'Nedraprepare for her own clash, of war, at Mishrak ac Thull.Perhapsslightly confusing to those unversed inThe Belgariad,it is never the less an otherwise very complete andsatifying story. I was recommended this story and I now recommend it to everyone else."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Ouch. I hate to leave any story unfinished, so for that reason, and that reason alone, I managed to stagger to the end of this series. Bad move. In most heroic fantasies, we get to see adolescent (or at least naive) heroes grow and mature over time to become truly extraordiary individuals. Not so in the Belgariad. While the magical powers of the characters grew, there was no growth whatsoever in the morals, courage, or other personal qualities of any of the characters. Also, the characters and storyline actually seemed to become more juvenile and trite as the story &quot;progressed&quot;. For example, two of the main adolescent characters who have never fought with horse and lance manage to win a jousting tournament in a land of &quot;ultimate&quot; knights with only some minor magical aid. And the interaction between the male and female characters in the book bore far more resemblence to a junior high school than to the way one would expect the most powerful individuals in the world to behave. The &quot;evil&quot; characters were too stupid to be threatening, and the heroes' demeanor was more like they were on a picnic than involved in a life or death struggle against evil. If Mr. Eddings insists on publishing more of this drivel, he should arrange for someone to pummel that annoying hag Polgara. Her condescending treatment of every male character might have been appropriate if they had all acted like immature brats, but -- oh, yea."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Enchanter's End Game by David Eddings is the fifth and final book in The Belgariad saga. This book finishes off the tale of Garion and his progression from kitchen scallion to that of powerful wizard. Edding's writing style may turn off some fans as at times he will explain in great detail some event and then others he will offer only a cursory explanation and description. Also, some of his characters are very clich&#65533;d and he seems to recycle a few plot lines now and again. However, that should not take away from the fact that this series of books tells a good story and offers a variety of situations to keep most readers interested. I also believe that this series of books would be a good series to recommend to a younger (12 and up) reader to get them interested in the genre as the concepts are not overly difficult to understand.The plot of this book starts up right where the last book, Castle of Wizardry, leaves off. There is an epic battle that will be taking place and Garion and his group are seeking to kill the god Torak. The two plot lines together lend themselves well to playing off of each other and allowing enough time to set both up. Edding's does a good job at making sure the reader understands they story well enough so that when events occur the readers knows why they happened as well as an inclining of what to expect next.As I mentioned before, my biggest complaint with Edding's writing is that his characters are overly clich&#65533;d and it seems like he uses a cookie cutter to place a \`class' of character into the story and then adds a bit to make the character appear new and interesting. The only character within this book, and the previous 4, that really stood out to me is Silk. He brought a slightly new feel to the classic rogue character and his banter was rather humorous at times. Other than that the characters were mostly forgettable. I am not saying they were \`bad' characters, they are simply not characters that kept me interested for the sake of themselves. I was interested in the story, just not so much because of the characters.Overall, this was a good book and a decent series. If you are expecting an epic tale, like that of Steven Erikson, you will be disappointed. This is a series that is fun to read and does not require a great deal of effort to understand it. I would however recommend this series to newer fantasy readers as well as younger readers. It may be a good \`hook' series to get more people interested. All in all not a bad finish to this saga."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"This book is David Eddings worst, but it's still absolutely amazing! I've lost track of how many times I've read it.Garion finally faces his fear, and gets rid of it, saving the world, universe, and all of that at the same time.This book shows and end holding a new beginning, something I really like in a book. This book also has the characters shown from a new point of view, especially Ce'Nedra. She is amazingly more mature in this book.The characters in this book are realistic and enjoyable, as is the rest of the story. I stronly suggest this book to anyone out there who enjoys an easy, advanced read."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Polgara is my favorite character. I love her in the other, REALLY love her now.*WARNING SPOILER*When she said she would give up her power I was shocked! And even more so when she still had it! To give up something she has tremendous strength and one hell of a will*END SPOILER*I love how Belgarath and Polgara interact- it's a very complex father/daughter relationship. Belgarath says that Polgara is a pain- evemn questions if he sould have bought her back from a Nadrack (I know I spelled it wrong) man.

The amount of research and history involved in this tale is so huge, you'd swear it actually happened somewhere. I'll leave the creative writing to the masters, of which David Eddings is definitely at the top of his class!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"This book was a wonderful conclusion to this great series. The ending was absolutely wonderful and all the characters came to closer. Definetly the best book of them all."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Eddings tries without success to salvage what was a bad concept on which to base a series (the whole prophecy which controls everything notion). Yes, all the familiar Eddings trappings are there, but they begin to wear thin after awhile.... all the witty, one-dimensional characters. This was great literature when I was in 7th grade..... only sentimental attachment, and the acknowledgment that I re-read the series an infinate number of times growing up cause me to refrain from rating this failed ending to the series lower. If you got sucked in to the series by the first three books - which are genuinely fun if trite - you'll have to suffer through this one to see how the story ends."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I have read everything I can find by Tolkein. I have read all I can of Tad Williams. I have read hundreds of books in this genre and I can say this series is excellent. This genre is popular because it requires an imagination, and it is there for the readers to have a good time, not to make literary students of all of us. I don't give a damn for character development and plot - I want something that is going to take me away and let my imagination go on a ride. Eddings did brilliantly with this. The last few books were so fast paced, I couldn't put them down. I can't wait to begin reading the Mallorean. If a person wants to do some seriouse literary reviewing then try a different Genre."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Enchanters' End Game chronicles the climax to Garion's long quest to bring two conflicting prophecies back into synch. As Child of Light, he and his friends have wandered across the Alorn kingdoms, ventured into Tolnedra and Nyissa, and now Garion, Belgarath, and Silk are in the Angarak side of the continent heading for the final confrontation with Torak.Pacing Garion is C'Nedra, who has rallied the armies of the West to provide what amounts to a distraction so that Garion, thousands of miles away can slip into Cthol Mishrak without the entire Murgo population trying to put an end to them. For all the sarcasm and wit that the characters display, this is a grim struggle, and C'Nedra's forces will be caught between the massive armies of the Mallorean Emperor Zakath and Taur Urgas the insane king of the Murgos. Levity or not many will die in the confrontation.Of the two story arcs, C'nedra's is the more interestingly told. Garion's adventures are mostly hiding and running at a very forced pace. His challenge is to keep his fear in check as he prepared for a duel that will kill one of the participants. On the other hand, the Alorn kings and many friends surround C'nedra. The preparations for the final battle are extensive, and many of the characters show unexpected sides.In retrospect, once this series slows down in Castle of Wizardry, it never quite regains its pace. Eddings hadn't quite learned to control his efforts in this series, and his early rush left him lacking a bit of plot in the fourth volume of this series. Enchanters' End Game recovers (nothing like a massive battle to perk things up) but Edding's will always be noted more for characterization and detail than for action. But his next series, the Malloreon is more evenly written, so the pacing is much smoother.I tend to view these stories as comfort food for fantasy addicts. While they lack something in the way of fast paced action and emotional range, they are genuinely entertaining. I've reread them all several times and they always seem to bear up. I wish everything I read was at least this well done."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Enjoyed this one as much as the others in the series. This ends the Belgariad series and sets up for the Malloreon. All in all these are good reads. Most of the folks I know have read this series and The Malloreon several times...they are sort of habit forming. If read for what they were written for, light books which should be enjoyed and ones to have fun with, then you will like them. If on the other hand if you just graduated from Jr. High and are much, much too mature for them, then you should probably wait until you reach your dotage so that you can appreciate them again. Yes, they are flawed and yes there are endless contradictions (some 233 by my last count), but that is part of the charm of this work. Hey, go out to a oak tree in the woods or in your park, kick back, read and enjoy. Recommend highly."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I'm probably one of the very few people that actually admit reading David and Leigh Edding's novels now. Especially since Tolkien has come back into fashion in a big way. But I've always been a great admirer of Eddings novels - their plots are EXACTLY the same as Tolkien's literary classic, right down to the location names (\\"Cthol Mishrak\\", anyone?). Despite all that, there are two things that keep drawing me back to their novels.The first strength is how strongly their characters are written. It's so easy to believe that these characters COULD exist in real life, because they're so flawed...and yet so noble and heroic.A good example is \\"Belgarath the Sorcerer\\" - Belgarath is DEFINITELY not a Gandalf clone. He's a thief, a liar, a cheat, and loves keeping the company of woman of questionable reputation. Despite all that, he's still one of the most adept masters of \\"The Will and the Word\\", and can perform heroic deeds when called upon.The Edding's other strength is their narrative. The plotline IS a rip-off of Lord of the Rings, but it moves along at such a good pace, and is so well written, that you totally ignore that issue as soon as you read the first page. The only conclusion I can come to is that although the main plotlines are similar, their execution is totally different.Now...onto the book review. Of all five books in the Belgariad, this is my favourite. And a large portion of that is due to the battle at Thull Mardu. The plotline in this book revolves around this single event - we see the lead-up (gathering the troops), the battle itself (which is realistically written), and the aftermath. In the lead-up, we get a much better look at some of the protaganists - especially the Alorn Kings. We're also introduced to General Varana, a character who will return in the Mallorean. All of them are very well written, and each of them has a character quirk that endears them to us. We start to care about what happens to them.The battle itself is quite realistically written. The Edding's strength in this area isn't the body count - we don't seem to get a real idea of how many people die. It's their portrayal of individual events that make it so powerful. There's one quite affecting scene involving a young boy playing a flute on top of a hill that is very well written - and is also used to portray the stupidity and waste of war. It's also important to point out that the good guys are actually outnumbered in this battle, and very nearly don't win. My only complaint about this section of the book is that the Edding's don't provide a really good explanation of exactly how the good guys escape in the end. It just seems to reach a particular point, and then, seemingly satisfied that things will turn out alright, we immediately switch to the battle between Garion and Torak.As for the battle between Garion and Torak? It was every bit as interesting as I thought it would be. I would love to see this scene portrayed in a movie. The one aspect that really surprised me was HOW Garion defeated Torak - anybody who's read the book knows what I'm talking about. In the end, it wasn't through Garion's skill with a sword, instead it was through taking advantage of a certain aspect of godhood. In retrospect, this makes sense. After all, a god is totally infallible but does have one obvious weakness.In conclusion, I enjoyed the battle at Thull Mardu far more than the final battle between Garion and Torak. Both were equally powerful events, it's just that one had more time devoted to it than the other. I actually read the Mallorean novels before I read the Belgariad, so it was interesting seeing the events that lead up to the second set of books. I can certainly see why so many people like the Belgariad more than the Mallorean. As for me, I enjoy both saga's equally, although I have a soft spot for the Mallorean because I read it first."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"In Enchanter's Endgame David Eddings draws the Belgariad to a much anticipated conclusion. As the armies of the West invade Mishrak ac Thull to stave off two huge armies of Angaraks, Garion, Belgarath, and Silk jounrney to the heart of Torak's dominions, Cthol Mishrak, City of Darkness. Both the allied armies and Garion's small company will face challenges and a few suprises that the sleeping God Torak has up his sleeve.Edding's stories are nothing terribly new, but they are fun and witty. This book especially showcased Eddings ability to weave some really fun characters into a familiar fantasy setting while not being cliche. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!While glancing through my reviews last night it came to my attention that I wrote a pretty involved review of Castle of Wizardry and then went on to write what I thought was a cool review of Guardians of the West. This means that I just blew past the climactic novel in the Belgariad without even noticing for a while.After a little reflection I realized how that could have happened.It goes like this. Enchanter's Endgame is book five in a beloved but rather um... safe series. The upshot here is that book 5 of this series is essentially about a duel between our hero and one hell of a villain. Since this is how most fantasy series in the last decades have gone there is a tendancy to just say \\"This book is where the good guys finally win.\\" and be satisfied with that.Under the surface though, it is not that simple. While it is true that this is a good guy vs. bad guy story, while it is true that the good guys obviously win and while it is true that the casualties on the good side are people we ultimately don't care about, it just isn't that simple of a climax.One reason for this has to do with the fact that Eddings knew he was going to sequelize this series so he was sowing seeds for the Malloreon here at the end. It is here where the mystery of Errand is really brought out. It is here where we meet 'Zakath for the first time and, if you are like me, you want to know what that apostrophe means.All that aside, this is still a novel about endings. These endings are, for the most part weak and safe. Examples of this are Durnik's death and resurrection, a plot device made all the more disappointing by his ascention to sorcererhood. I don't really hold that against him though since this kind of stuff is very common in fantasy.So, this is a good final installment of The Belgariad and a good precursor to the Malloreon and a solid book in its own right."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"First, everyone is a critic, few get paid to do so.Any work had rave reviews and negative reviews. Take a chance and read it for yourself to be the final judge.Well, Unlike most reviews, I'm not going to 'book report' it and summize what happened. The story continues nicely, and now the overall climax of the previous 4 books comes to a head. The fate of the universe lays in the balance, and it depends not only on Garion, but also his friends, Polgara, Durnik, Errand and his future wife, to decide what happpens.Very well written. I like the climax and the gradual wind down to the end (whereas many books have the climax and end shortly thereafter leaving you asking. 'what about?').All of the lose ends concerning everyone get tied up. Wow. I am glad I bought the first book on a whim recalling a good review here on Amazon.I look forward to the Malloreon!I would recommend! A very enjoyable read!A+"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"More, more, more! This is such a great series! The ends of all of these books leave you hanging for more. The Malloreon is just as good. Right up there with Harry Potter and The Secret of Platform 13!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I'm not going to review each book of the series individually since they are all the same in structure, and sadly, nearly in content as well. This series has to be considered one of the most predictable, monotonous, dry fantasy series out there. Near the beginning of every book David Eddings, for some reason I simply can't understand, basically spoils the rest of the book by having characters say what they're going to do. It's like \\"We'll do A, then B, then C,\\" where C is the end of the book. These summaries wouldn't be so detrimental if the author actually had some unexpected things happen along the way...but he doesn't. It happens exactly according to the summary every time. At least ninety percent of every book in the series is monotony--basically you know what's going to happen and are just waiting for it to take place.The characters are also pretty flat. They each of interesting quirks, but the author just keeps replaying them over and over again. If Aunt Pol makes one more smart-guy comment or Garion \\"blushes\\" in embarassment one more time... I tell you, someone blushing as much as him has no right to be a king of any sort.Now that the worst aspects of the series are out of the way...I must say I enjoyed the \\"mythology\\" inserted into the beginning of every book. In fact I enjoy that more than the book itself. It seems very creative, and it is very well done. Also the first book is probably 3 or 4 stars, rather than the rest of the series' 2 stars...the beginning of it is much better done.I have to conclude that life is too short to waste time on books like these. Just pass it on."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I read the whole series in a few weeks, and I say it was great. It lacks a bit of power, but is very well written, funny, and much more entertaining with realistic insight then some overhyped fantasy.Good action, romance, human emotions, and a building zenith of events that keeps the pages turning. The only part I had a problem with was how they cut out the best part at the very end. I mean, come on Dave, you know we all wanted to know what happend AFTER Ce'Nedra and Garion got married. And I say that from a comical standpoint. But I still fail to see why fantasy, as well as socity, embelishes violence, yet shuns sex. Whats up with that? If you can write in detail about death and bloody combat you can sure write about love and sex. The joke with the orb was funny, but I think something much more funny was going on at the time ^_~ And it was also a good charcter development point, to bad it was to ''offensive'' to write about. Only other flaw was that travel got a little boaring and I would have liked to know more about the universal sceam of things, I found that very cool. Despite a few flaws ( and every writer has flaws) Eddings is great. Truely great.And if you didnt like it why did you bother reading it. I put a book down if I don't like it and, I sure don't go to a major webpage and say how it sucks. Get a life. And for people who can enjoy good fantasy, read Eddings. Or other authors, there are so many good fantasy novels, if you can stop compareing and read with an open mind, and heart."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Looking at the average rating for this book left me absolutely shocked, I find it impossible to believe that anybody could find anything even remotely interesting in this series, or any other by David Eddings. Firstly, the plot in this whole series is so shallow it is almost insubstantial, and gives the reader so much information that there is no joy in trying to piece together the story. The information in itself was not such a bad idea, but unfortunately Eddings gave too much away, and quite often I had guessed the outcome of an event a hundred pages before it was finally revealed. Also the series was made boring by the fact that the enemy was never all that evil, and the \`good guys' always seemed to have the upper hand in all areas. Secondly the characters in the entire Belgariad/Mallorean series are completely inappropriate for their chosen roles. They are reasonably well developed, but completely and utterly unconvincing - they seem to behave as if they are showing off to their mates, not at all as if they were out performing the seemingly serious task of saving the world. The main character Garion seems to undergo almost no psychological change at all after all his experiences, his behavior and attitude is the same when he is a nine year old kitchen hand as when he is a sorcerous king of the world. Aside from this the characters and the plot are so hollow and predictable you feel dissatisfied and ripped off when finishing the series because it fails to deliver any of the things such as plot, character development and suspense, which are so essential for a novel's success. One good point, however, the series is so long that you ca really become emerged in it for a short while, but unfortunately this only adds to the disappointment at the end of the series. I have heard people criticise this book for being unorigional, but in actual fact these criticisms are unfounded, the book is original - nobody else has ever written such a linear, empty and predictable example of fantasy literature. Finally, to all those people who think this series is god's greatest gift to fantasy readers, do yourself a favour and read Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"The Belgariad series ends with a fluffed up book. While the finally apocalyptic battle between Garion and Torak is exciting, the end of it is somewhat cheesy. The worst part of the book is the useless fluff written in order to extend the ending into a full-fledged novel.Going into the fifth book, the reader knows that Garion and Torak will fight an epic battle. What the reader shouldn?t have to do is drudge through the micro-management of an army travelling, nor read about how a queen runs a country that has nothing to do with the story anymore. Unfortunately, that?s half the book. Most of the rest of the book is Garion, Silk, and Belgarad travelling. Like usual, they travel, almost face capture or death, and escape. The same sort of thing that happened in the last four books. It seems like Eddings really wanted to extend this series to five books no matter how useless the material was.Other than that, Eddings does retain his readability, and his imagination is as good as ever. I recommend this book, however, as it tidies up the prophecy nicely."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Just another example of why fantasy is considered pulp, and suitable only for 11 year old social outcasts. I read this when I was twelve and found it to be childishly written and poorly conceptualized, with paper-thin trite characters to boot. Oh well. If you read this series, and still want to give fantasy a try, read &quot;Memory Sorrow and Thorn&quot; by tad williams. It is everything these books are not."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Will Garion be able to overcome the dark God Torak even though he is deemed the overlord of the west. Will he be able to overcome the will of a god and save the world the universe itself. Read the book yourself and find out."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I stopped about page 150 or so. The truth of it is, this series is just a little too immature for me. The way Eddings steoreotypes his races- i.e. all Tolnedrans are greedy, all Arends are incredibly stupid, all Sendars are practical, etc.- is just way too unrealistic. I remember reading a scene where the Mimbrates and the Asturians are discussing their animosity, and finally figure out that they've been fighting thousands of years over nothing, and what's more ridiculous, they haven't realized this because they never once talked to each other about it. It's ludricrous for people who have been warring for millenia to all at once say, \\"Oh! Is that it? Wow, it's a good thing we finally spoke to each other, or no telling how long this would've lasted.\\" No one's THAT stupid. Also, a good portion of the dialogue is JUST PLAIN SILLY. At first it was bearable, but after a while all the little dry comments began to grate more and more. All in all, these books are just too chldish and should be avoided by mature readers. Also, the characterization is not that great, and this makes for boring reading.I finally stopped when I got to that Arend nonsense, but honestly, this book isn't any better or worse than the other books, so if you've been enjoying this series so far you shouldn't find any problems with this one. I guess it just took me this long to finally realize what I was reading. Stupid me, I suppose."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Well this last book was so drawn out I could barely finish it. I believe the series would have been better if it was in one 500 page book. Not to bad of a series but my god was it draw out."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Without repeating what Allanon86 and A Reader (\\"Well, So Much for Free Will\\") said in their reviews I'd like to add a few other things:It seems that David Eddings has done NO background research _what so ever_. He seems to have zero understanding of music and his descriptions of the mental and physical aspects of battle are sad and laughable at the same time.About music: it seems most of the heroes are virtuoso players/singers without any practice. I can't remember if it was in this series or in the Malloreon in which Durnik played a lute but even when I last read it when I was 13 I remember shaking my head in disbelief: I've played classical guitar since the age of 6, electric guitar since the age of 12 and drums since the age of 10 so I have a vague grasp of how the whole concept of playing music works, how your skills improve or rust etc. In the scene Durnik turns out to be a master lute player even though he hasn't touched an instrument for years and years. I assure you, if you once learn to play guitar or lute, leave it for a few years and then try to play, you won't be able to play crap. Same goes for singing. I doubt Eddings has ever touched an instrument himself or talked the matter over with a musician. If he had he wouldn't have included such silly scenes in his books.As for violence...it's clearly apparent that the author has not consulted people like law enforcement officers or bouncers or soldiers who all face real world violence on a daily basis let alone been in a violent confrontation himself. If he had consulted the pros or if he had any personal experiences of violence he would drop the glorified and humoristic Hollywood approach which stain all battle scenes in all of his books. They are mostly happy-go-lucky scuffles in which the heroes actually HAVE FUN! I mean, come on, make sure you know what you're talking about before you put it in a book! Not to mention the 100% lack of any compassion towards their opponents; Eddings has written the story so that the angaraks (murgos, thulls, grolims) are not to be considered human; they are waste which should all be killed and to top it all, killing them is great fun! The more murgos you kill, the more fun you have. Afterall, they are _just_ people of an inferior race.What made me laugh in the fighting scenes were the actual descriptions of the moves and maneuvers. My favorite scenes were those which included Silk because he, being an acrobat and all, had the most ridiculous moves. It's like reading an over-the-top parody of a fight scene. Just make sure you're not eating while you read Silk's fight scenes; you might choke on your food. Same thing with the physical impossibilities: at one point he describes how Cho-Hag pierces his opponent with his sabre...yes, fine, but just a few lines back Eddings said that Cho-Hag's opponent was wearing a plate armor! How can you pierce a plate armor with a sabre? It's the same as trying to pierce a steel plate with a butter knife. At that point (250 something pages) I just put the book away.By the way, has anybody else noticed a certain reflection of our world in Eddings'? The great, vast Mallorea with their red clothes and great numbers of men (Russia, anyone?), Chereks with their beards, braided hair, war boats, and large swords (Scandinavians?), Murgos and Grolims, the religious fanatics (Muslims?), the &uuml;ber-practical but simple Sendars (Germans?), the Rivans on their Isle of Winds with their gray weather (Great Britain?) etc. etc. Maybe it's just me...Anyway, another funny thing is that in the great battle of the armies of the Glorious West and the Evil East it seems that the Angaraks have no cavalry. Eddings constantly goes on about how the mounted Algars and Mimbrates destroy the Angarak-infantry but where is the Angarak-cavalry? It's clear that they have horses but where are they in this great battle? Did the angarak-army march to the battle and then go \\"oh gee, we forgot to bring our horses\\"?Another strange thing is that the troops of West are all very organized, the leaders use tactics and whatnot whilst the troops of East seem to be this unorganized mass with no sense of military tactics?It seems, at times, that the whole point of the novel is to emphasize how much superior other races (mostly the western ones) are when compared to others (eastern/southern races).Most of the female characters are also pretty clich&eacute;.Two stars for actually going through the trouble of writing a fantasy tale (which I enjoyed when I was 13) and for some of the humor (some of it is actually funny). I might recommend this series to a fantasy-hungry preteen even though there are better series out there."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"This is the fifth and final book in the Belgariad (after Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, Magician's Gambit and Castle of Wizardry).In this volume, Garion, accompanied by Silk and Belgarath, makes his way through Drasnia and Gar Og Nadrak, and finally crosses the Sea of the East to Mallorea. There in Cthol Mishrak, the evil god Torak is stirring from his endless sleep and waiting for their prophesied battle, the outcome of which will decide the fate of the world.Meanwhile, Ce'Nedra, self-proclaimed Queen of Riva in Garion's absence, is travelling across Arendia and Tolnedra, raising an army with her speeches. Although it breaks her heart to know that it will be badly outnumbered and that it won't stand a chance against the hordes of Thulls, Murgos and Malloreans, she knows this is a necessary sacrifice to create the diversion Garion needs to reach Mallorea.The part I preferred in this final volume is when Ce'Nedra's army is encamped in Algaria. There Durnik and the Alorn Kings engineer clever contraptions to carry King Anheg's fleet up the mile-high Eastern Escarpment. I also enjoyed reading about the battle of Thull Mardu, where all plans start to go awry, not to mention the final encounter between Garion and Torak, where all the pieces of the Prophecy click into place. All in all, a pleasant, if not tremendously mind-boggling, conclusion to the series. On to the Malloreon now!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"For people who enjoy reading for the purpose of getting into the story. The books written by David Eddings' are for people who get attached to characters and love to immerse themselves in reading.

Enchanters' End Game is as good as the others in the series. The books are great for people just starting to read fantasy to see what good traditional fantasy is like. It might seem a little boring for people who have read a lot of fantasy."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"It just doesn't get better than David Eddings, the Belgariad and the 5 books that follow called the Mallorean. All are a must read for adults and children alike. I love Harry Potter, but even he takes a back seat to the magic of David Eddings."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Okay, I'd agree that Eddings is repetitive, and the plotline is similar to Tolkien, but what I enjoy the most are the interactions between the sexes, which Tokien definitely does not have.What I like about Eddings is the humour and the realism. The characters are life-like, fun, and endearing. Besides, the repetitions are what you would really notice if you thought in book-report-format: \\"and then they did this, and then this\\", but I think that there are enough details that differ to keep it interesting.I like this book best of the series because it wraps up all those loose ends and of course, there's all the surprises, so touching since by the time you reach this book, everyone in the book is like family..."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I decided to rate one of the books of Belgariad, because it was the first series published, and it was first I read. I have read all of Eddings' fantasy books, and I have to say with the exception of &quot;The Redemption of Athalus&quot; and the &quot;Polgara&quot; they are all great books. The problem lies in the fact that all of Eddings' series are the same. He had one brilliant idea back when he wrote the Belgariad, and every thing else has been the same with a little twist. If you are a die hard Eddings' fan and you think I am wrong, reread the Mallorean again, and you will see that Eddings' confesses to it thru his charater's. So if you are new to Eddings' Choose one of the series and only read that one series. If you absolutly love it and want to read it over and over again, then read his other works."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"David Eddings explains things in such a way that you can put yourself right into the story.

It finishes the series with most of the loose ends tied up nicely without being cut off. Most of the characters have all developed in their own separate ways - some more than others. In short, this book, - the entire series is for fanatsy fans everywhere."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Enchanters' End Game must be one of my favorite books. The characters are each unique and special and the book written so well, I can believe that the plot is happening. And as each book can be tested by the passing of time, this book has endured well. I have just finished reading it for the 3rd time and the story still keeps me interested. There is such a mix of humor, adventure, and magic, to keep anyone from putting the book down. I recommend this book all the way."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"This review may be abit biased, but in my opinion, those who have slated the book should have another go at it. It is important to read the Rivan Codex to be placed in the proper context of the storyline, characterisation etc. That is onlyif yout have dismally failed to realise the man's brilliance at writing. Granted, David Eddings is not the most prolific writer, but in any creative field, you grow as an artist, and he has shown considerable growth in his other series. Enchanters End Game is a book I shall continue to read, and each time, it will provide fresher entertainment to my eyes. To the reviewer who labels Polgara as a &quot;hag&quot; all I have to say is that you are a mysoginist who is afraid of a woman in power. With your blatant views on females, I do not suggest reading Melanie Rawn's Exiles trilogy. The story is a good one, the ending not to final, but does not leave the reader frustrated. I think the battel with torak is well-written, and was not dragged out for long. The battle of Thull Mardu is a well-written piece and for all the clods out there, it takes precision to stage a battle of that magnitude. I found it delightful reading the battle with the hierachs of Murgodom. So what if the good guys win??? Was Asharak's victory with Garion's parent not enough to satiate a blood lust?? I hav eto disagree with the reviewers who have slated the book. I found it entertaining, worth my time, and would recommend this to anybody who wishes to cut their teeth in the fantasy genre.

This may explain a lot.3) Despite this, they are color-coordinated.Sadly, with Garion's slaying of Torak and the defeat of the 'Other Prophecy', he effectively removes free will from the universe, locking it into its original 'purpose' - a destiny so controlling you might as well not even bother getting up in the morning. When cosmic forces micromanage, you know you're in trouble.I assume the only reason anyone would read this book is because they read the previous four, so a review seems rather besides the point. But hey, you should know what you're in for.Allegedly, Eddings wrote another five-book series to follow this one. Read at your own peril, 'cause I'm not going there."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Polgara is my favorite character.

Immature writng? Far from, i completely disagree, I would say the Belgariad as a whole (And this book in particular) is probably some of the best stuff i have ever written. And as for some of the other suggestions people have had, well.. Lord of the Rings had our characters spending the first 1,000 pages doing, erm, well... nothing? and how about the Wheel of Time where are *Ahem* supposed heroes spent 150 pages doing, erm, nothing? Tw's excellent MS+T series is about the only one i would agree with - this one does come close to Eddings writing. Also, George RR Martin's Game of Thrones would be another good tale.

I'm reading the whole series for the third time. Thank you Mr. Eddings!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I'd like to start by saying I like the world and the characters, I think they are quite imaginative and interesting.These books could have been condensed into one book. The plots are a bit thin, but ok. Once the plot is established however the books are then filled with page after page of meaningless drivel. For example, when the group passes through a town, I don't need to read 3 or 4 pages of the town's history and political structure which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot but this kind of thing happens over and over. I understand trying to drag out the suspense a bit, but saying he went completely and ridiculously overboard is an understatement.The books would be ok for teens I guess except for the questionable moral behavior. The books seem to continuously advocate that lying and deceit are perfectly fine if it gets you what you want. Also, most of the main adult male characters binge drink whenever possible. I wouldn't want my teens reading about that, they have enough bad ideas already."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"This entire series is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s gathered in one place. Some village-idiot grows up to become king over half the world and gets a magic sword (pulled from a wall--hmm..rings any bells? [The Arthur legend]) then he sets off on some silly quest to rid the world of all evil. I read these books (and the following series &quot;The Malloreon) when I was 12 years old. That is probably the upper limit if you want to enjoy them. Eddings couldn't come up with an interesting story if his life depended on it. The main character (Belgarion) jumps around with a big silly sword killing bad-guys to the left and the right, but in 10 (!) books he doesn't get hit once!! Silly or what?My advice is to start reading some real fantasy like Tolkien or Robert Jordan."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Does this series really need five books? One kids pop up book would seem to about handle the amount of real plot and development which has taken place in this series. The characters are a paper thin bunch of cliches who hack and slay their merry way through huge numbers of sub moronic bad guys. The Quest for the Blue Stone motif is most definately wearing thin in Eddings stories, (I hear the plot was recycled in the second series) and the premise that this merry band should prance their way around laughing and joking with the weight of the world on their shoulders is basically just pathetic. OK, OK : some of the jokes are funny, and the series is a way to pass time on a long train ride or something, but dont take it seriously. And a special message for people who compare Eddings with Tolkien : Give UP! There is NO point of comparison. Tolkien created a living, breathing world of characters complete with mythology, rich history and complex and deep characters. He did this subtly so some people may have missed a lot. Eddings created a world of stasis which suddenly springs into action in time for a bunch of cliches to prance around saving the world before dropping back into stasis again. Then, in the second series, he does it a second time. Readable, but definately a lowest - common - denominator pulp fantasy. Try a master like Tad Williams, Robin Hobb or Tolkien to see what true, well crafted fantasy is like."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"There are some very good things about this book, and then some really glaring flaws. Despite all, this series is the best Eddings wrote. His characters are actually likeable. In later ones his writing style goes clunky and he tries to make every other sentance a deadpan joke. In \\"The Dreamers\\", the style of writing is so 'talk about important things in a silly way' that the series falls flat. Sorry to rant about that, but really, if you want to read Eddings read the Belgariad. (If you're curious, the Mallorean is about the same characters and has some of hte Belgariad's charm, but not all. The Elenium and the Tamali, both about a two-demensional knight named Sparhawk, are okay but really not at all interesting. \\"The Redemption of Athaelus\\" is one book about a thief and a goddess; completely funny, but it would be a disaster if it weren't a single book. \\"The Dreamers\\" is just aweful. STay away from it.)However, I'm talking about Enchanter's End Game. Moreover I am writing to amuse myself, not whoever reads this. So: Things I like. I adore the way the queens left behind to rule while their husbands go off and fight handle things. Silar of Algeria, Porenn of Drasnia, and even the flakey Islena of Cherek spend their time defeating hte plots of the Bear-Cult, a bunch of conspiratorially minded religious extremists. Silar sends them off to conduct a survey of all the foals and calves in her kingdom; Islena (assisted by the formidable Lady Merel and the sneaky Queen Porenn) ships them all off to war; and Porenn herself manages to clean them out of her spy service and send them to the worst duty posts she and her spymaster can think of. On the side, Porenn negociates with the supposedly enemy kingdom of Gar og Nadrak so that hte Nadraks end up switching sides in the middle of a battle. The queen of Arendia, Mayaserana, manages (in heavily embroidered language) to stop her country's civil war, which was supposed to have ended centuries ago but stayed because of a formality. Something regardant on which of her titles half of the country owed fealty to. You have to read it to understand- honestly, the Arends are the silliest people in teh series. And finally, Layla of Sendaria, a rather stay at home mother, defeats a scheming ambasador by pretending to be incredibly absent-minded and enlisting hte help of her three youngest children to interupt him. The queens all get away with huge things because people expect them to be stupid, and they aren't. Except maybe Islena, and she has the good sense to pick good advisors. The situation parellels the way ladies took over ruling and fighting at home when their husbands were off on the Crusades in teh middle ages.The humor in this book hasn't gotten so crazy and omnipresent. It's there, but in later books Eddigns feels that his undoubted funniness gives him the right to ignore characters, setting... in fact, the later books are made up of humor, battles, some sex/romance, and in some cases a little-girl goddess. Bad form. Fortunately he hasn't done that yet here. This one's still okay.The bad things: Eddings tends to make every person in one of his countries as one of a 'type'. Sendars are practical and decent. Period. Arends are passionate and not too bright and taken up with nobility to the point of idiocy; if they are Mimbrates tehy talk in high style (Thee, thou, prithee, et cetera, sentances that last forever.) Chereks are semi-pirates. Drasnians are sneaky. You get hte picture. THat's the chief flaw."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"'Enchanter's End Game' brings us the story of how Garion travels towards his final encounter with the god Torak, which he will have to fight in order to save the world from a grim fate. At the same time, Ce'Nedra and the others are gathering an army to meet the threat of the Murgo and Malloreon forces which are converging upon the western kingdoms. I will not give away the ending, but this book is as great as all the other books in the series, and gives a suitable ending to the tale.This is the sequel to 'Castle of Wizardry', and the final book in the amazing series of five books known as 'the Belgariad'. The series is later followed by another five in 'the Malloreon'. The story is the classic fight between the Evil which seeks to rule the world, and the Good which wants to save it, but what really makes the book so great is the characters. They are all very distinct from each other, with their own personality and desires. Eddings manages to keep them all separate, so that they are not mixed together in a faceless group. Instead they each have their part to play in the quest to save the world.I have read the entire series at least 20 times by now, and it remains my favorite fantasy. It is lighter than 'The Wheel of Time' series by Robert Jordan, which makes it suitable for younger readers as well, but it is great for anyone from around 12 to 112. I think many, like me, read this series as their first fantasy, and it is a great start to get interested in the world of magic and swordfights. There are other great fantasy series, but this series is still required reading for fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"First read this set of books when I was 15 I'm now 40 and loved it more this time round ....."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Every Book in The Belgariad series is amazing.

I felt a strong emotional attachment to many of his main characters and thoroughly enjoyed reading The Belgariad Series."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"In just three short days I plowed through The Belgariad series and emerged, happy (and a bit melancholy to leave them behind). As much as I loved the series, wept at certain deaths, rejoiced as characters got everything and more than they could have dreamed of, I have only one small criticism to offer now that I've finished my first David Eddings series.I think authors such as Brandon Sanderson and Mickey Zucker Reichart have spoiled me when it comes to battle scenes. Take for example, Reichart's Renshai series - the swordplay is so beautifully described it makes me want to weep thinking about reading it again. Every motion came alive in my imagination. In contrast, David Eddings struggled with putting into words the action taking place in these books. Villains died quickly and neatly, which robbed me, as a reader, of a need to see them get their \\"just desserts.\\"That said, I still loved the direction of the story, the way all the pieces fit neatly together, the growth of the characters and uniting of the world, and that little bit that left the story open to grow more."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"I had not read in a little while and found out I was going to have surgery. So I hit the book store searching for a book. I love the King Arthur lore, so the first book in this series appealed to me. OMG!! I picked the perfect series. I read the first five before I left the hospital. I enjoyed it so much, as a present my husband bought me the first book in the second series. What I enjoyed was the different layers to the story and the characters. Each character had the flaws and their good points. The story line on the surface is somewhat simple and easy to read. But each time I read them I find a new depth and meaning to each plot twist. I even managed to talk my husband, my nephew and my niece into reading them. We all agreed the series is a 5 star read."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"The final book of the Belgariad continues the two plot threads begun in the previous book: one thread with Garion's quest to Cthol Mishrak, and the other chronicling the war. Strangely, the first part of the book (Gar Og Nadrak) is the part I found most enjoyable of the book. It shows an Angarak nation caught in the middle and desperately trying to stay out of the coming war. I really enjoyed the scenes in Morindland with the magicians. Eddings did a good job detailing the preparations made by Belgarath before entering Morindland, and also vividly describes the battle Belgarath had with the rival magician. When they finally get to crossing the land bridge, there is a sense of palpable foreboding as they approach Mallorea.As we switch to the war plot thread, we also see snippets of the other queens currently ruling the kingdoms of the West. These parts did not provide too much insight, although the scene with Layla's children and the Tolnedran ambassador was humorous. But overall these scenes with the queens for the most part could have been cut without damaging the narrative. I also noticed a propensity by certain characters (*cough* Ce'Nedra) to end a conversation with \\"You're impossible\\", and detracted from the story a bit every time that phrase was repeated.The battle scenes at Thull Mardu were decent, and Eddings did a good job of showing the magic vs. physical battles taking place. He did include a short, but poignant interlude with the Arendish flutist being silenced. Eddings does a good job of bringing characters from earlier books into the main part of the story.The climactic showdown was kind of a letdown (although nowhere near as bad as the one in Mallorean). I did find Belgarath's tantrum at Garion to be pretty funny, and the most interesting part of this section. While the Belgarath-Zedar showdown ended in unexpected fashion, the rest of this sequence was fairly predictable. While Eddings alludes to Garion's inexperience during the battle being equalized by Torak's maiming, it just seems that Garion has not made enough strides to take on a god (even if that god is maimed).What struck me while reading this book is that Garion becomes more and more one-dimensional as the story progresses from Gar og Nadrak to Mallorea. It seems that Garion needs to be constantly prodded to take the next step, be it by the voice of prophecy, Belgarath, Ce'Nedra, Polgara, or Adara. At certain points, I just wanted to yell at Garion \\"Take the initiatve for once!\\"In spite of my criticisms, I did enjoy reading this book. This was the first time I had read the Belgariad in almost 20 years, and overall I still think the series is decent. I think the series tends to fit the mold of YA fantasy, and that's fine. Eddings gives the main characters decent insights through the balance of the series (which is found wanting in the Mallorean). Aside from this, I've read the Mallorean, Elenium and Tamuli by Eddings; I would say the Belgariad is easily Eddings' best work, and I look forward to re-reading it again at some point (hopefully sooner than 20 years next time ;)"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game","review":"Many people think David Eddings is overly formulaic which he is a bit but since I enjoy the tale he tells I do not mind reading it over again. His characters always have great humor at their core and you can't beat a good epic tale for entertainment value. This particular book is one of my favorites by him."},{"Title":"Radical Innovation: How Mature Companies Can Outsmart Upstarts","review":"I think this book will have the greatest value if read in combination with Yoffie and Kwak's Judo Strategy. Why? Because the authors of that book correctly stress the importance of maximizing organizational speed, agility, balance, and leverage in any competitive marketplace. What they do not address (except perhaps indirectly or by implication) is the importance of radical innovation which, more often than not, proves to be a decisive competitive advantage. Indeed, the seven authors of the book I am about to review identify \\"Seven Challenges in Managing Radical Innovation\\" (see Table 1-1 on page 8) and meeting these challenges effectively indeed requires maximizing organizational speed, agility, balance, and leverage. Obviously, no single volume asks all \\"the right questions,\\" much less provides \\"all the right answers.\\" Hence the importance of carefully correlating the ideas from several different sources. I also strongly Michael Hammer's The Agenda which offers a \\"model\\" by which decision-makers in any organization (regardless of its size or nature) can determine appropriate priorities and then set appropriate objectives before formulating strategies and tactics by which to achieve those objectives.The subtitle of this book (\\"How Mature Companies Can Outsmart Upstarts\\") reminds me of Jack Welch's comments when explaining why he admires \\"small and sleek\\" companies:\\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"For those who seek radical innovation in so-called \\"mature\\" companies, the challenges which the authors of this book identify are obviously much greater than they are for those in the \\"small and sleek\\" companies which Welch admires. A majority of upstarts pursue a \\"judo strategy\\" (in one form or another) because they lack the resources of their much larger competitors. (David had no chance if he wrestled Goliath.) For that reason, they cannot afford incremental innovation. They must take bold, decisive action when and where it will have the greatest impact.When explaining what they call an \\"imperative,\\" the authors of this book make a critically important distinction: \\"...incremental innovation usually emphasizes cost or feature improvements in existing products or services and is dependent on exploitation competencies. In contrast, radical innovation concerns the development of new businesses or product lines -- based on new ideas or technologies or substantial cost reductions -- that transform the economics of a business, and therefore require exploration competencies.\\" This is indeed a key distinction.Much of the material in this book was generated by the authors' research over a period of five years (1995-2000) which followed the development and commercialization activities of 12 radical innovation projects in 10 large, established (\\"mature\\") firms. For the authors, a radical innovation project must have the potential to produce one or more of these results: an entirely new set of performance features, improvements in known performance features of five times or greater, and/or a significant (i.e. 30% or more) reduction in cost. What the authors learned from the research serves as the foundation of their conclusions; also of what they recommend to those who seek radical innovation in their own organization. All of the ideas presented are anchored in an abundance of real-world experience. Although this brilliant book's greatest value may be derived by decision-makers in \\"mature\\" companies, I think substantial value can also be derived by decision-makers in the \\"upstarts\\" with which such companies as DuPont, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, and Texas Instruments will continue to compete. One final point: All of the \\"mature\\" companies discussed in this book were once \\"upstarts\\" themselves. How revealing that all of them are now so hard at work on regaining or preserving certain competitive advantages which once served them so well."},{"Title":"Radical Innovation: How Mature Companies Can Outsmart Upstarts","review":"Very succinct yet comprehensive. It has key advice on the marketing, finance, and people skills necessary to see a new idea advance to a great new product. This book should be required reading for all MBA students, managers, and anyone who has the dream of a great new idea but is unsure as to how to make it come real. Although the title states that the book focuses on how more established companies can create environments to promote radical innovations, the information can readily be applied to any firm regardless of length of operations - and yes, to individuals.The authors present a list of 7 challenges that face the radical innovator and then they provide the competencies, or skills, that are necessary to meet these challenges. Throughout the text, real-life examples from well-known firms help the reader to understand how these challenges come about, and to even recognize a challenge should it present itself. The examples do tend to focus on radical innovations that are new technological products, but the recommendations could also be applied to other new ideas such as new management systems or organizational structures."},{"Title":"Radical Innovation: How Mature Companies Can Outsmart Upstarts","review":"Having read this book two thoughts come up:1. They should have had much more in-depth data, why stick so much to the surface ?2. Is their overview of ways to deal with radical innovation comprehensive ?Seen the impressive list of authors and the impressive research they've done the book is disappointing. Maybe because they were limited on what they could disclose, time pressure etc.To learn more about dealing with radical innovation I recommend the books 'Corporate Venturing, 'Intrapreneuring', 'Webs of Innovation', 'The Innovators Dilemma'.So should you read 'Radical Innovation ? Well if you're active in the field it should be on your shelves, otherwise I wouldn't spend my dollars on it."},{"Title":"The Obstacle Race","review":"This is another wonderful Christian love story by Ethel M.

As usual it was hard to put this novel down until it was finished. This author has the ability to hold your attention until the end. I haighly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi)","review":"It's about time this book was reissued in English, in a fine translation by Perec's standard-bearer in the Anglophone world. Perec's half-fictive and half-autobiographical masterpiece is an original and devastating approach to one of the most difficult historical moments of the recent past, the Holocaust. &quot;W or the Memory of Childhood&quot; embodies all of the violence of this historical tragedy and of memories of such tragedy.There are two narrative threads running through this book, touching each other occasionally in a manner that illuminates both in strange and arresting ways. Half of the chapters are &quot;W,&quot; the fictional account of a man, Gaspard Winckler, who has survived a war by adopting the identity of a parapalegic (the real Gaspard Winckler) who later dies in a shipwreck off the Tierra del Fuego. Prodded by the mysterious Otto Apfelstahl, the living Gaspard embarks on a journey to recover his memory of the real Gaspard, to discover who he was and how he died. This journey becomes, in the second half of &quot;W,&quot; a description in coldly anthropological terms of a seemingly totalitarian island-state, in which citizens are forced to compete in brutal and naked athletic games for things like food and the right to procreate--the basics of human life.The other half of the chapters are Perec's own autobiographical contributions, beginning, despite the promising title of the book, with the admission, &quot;I have no memory of childhood.&quot; Perec's voice sifts through his rubbled past--his father's death in the French Army, his mother's transportation to Auschwitz, his being concealed in a Catholic school and raised by his relatives--and attempts to separate what he remembers from what he has been taught to remember through photos, language, etc. His reflections are marked with a humor that is endearing in light of his horrifying experiences, and with a subtlety that is astounding in light of the atrocities to which the text must bear remote witness.The two narratives, &quot;W&quot; and &quot;The Memory of Childhood,&quot; weave around each other like ivy, finally becoming, in a stunning and climactic final chapter, part and parcel of one story. Perec's ultimate fusion of his willful fictions and his awe-full remembrances is powerful and well-presaged; the entire universe of the book builds beautifully and disturbingly toward this final moment, as the fictions become more like fact and the autobiography occupies itself increasingly with fictions.Bellos' translation is superb, even if one does lose some of the very productive puns of the original (the moment early on, for example, when &quot;l'Histoire avec sa grande hache&quot; should make us think simultaneously of History with a capital H and History with its big axe; Bellos sticks with the capital H rendering of the phrase). (From what I can tell, he has not modified his original translation of the book substantially, if at all.)&quot;W or the Memory of Childhood&quot; is a sobering, touching, daunting and disturbing reminder of some of the worst our century has had to offer. If you are interested in a writer who is unashamed of standing heroically baffled and gaping in the face of immeasurable atrocity, buy and read this book."},{"Title":"W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi)","review":"Some memories are so terrible that revisiting them is more than a person can stand. And yet there are stories that need to be told. Goerges Perec, who lost both his childhood and his parents to the Nazis in World War II deals with this problem by telling two stories, one real, and one metaphorical.The real story of his youth is told almost dispassionately, as if he cannot bear to bring up the emotions of that time- or perhaps it is an accurate telling of a childhood in which emotion was repressed as a way of surviving. The metaphorical tale of the nation of &quot;W&quot; is also told from a distant, and somehwhat dispassionate perspective; it is a cruel land, but the narrator speaks of it as a historian or an anthropolist might.It is only when the two are read together (the chapters alternate) that the full effect is appreciated by the reader. The cruelties of &quot;W&quot; are in fact alternate tellings of the realities left out of the true narration. Through this, the true horror of Perec's childhood emerges."},{"Title":"W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi)","review":"Georges Perec's \\"W, or The Memory of Childhood\\" is both an autobiographical and fictional look at the world Perec grew up in around the time of World War to and the Nazi occupation of Europe. The work introduces two alternating stories; the first, an observation of an island, W, off Tierra del Fuego, and the second, an autobiographical piece, rely heavily on one another to accurately present an allegorical look at a place easily compared to Nazi Germany.\\"W, or The Memory of Childhood\\" begins in a captivating narrative of Gaspard Winckler, a man who deserted the war and is discovered by one investigating the disappearance of a paraplegic child who bears the same name. Because Gaspard took the child's name in taking a new identity to avoid capture after deserting, he is commissioned to find the child whose body is discovered missing from the wreckage of his mother's yacht after an accident claimed everyone on board's life. This task leads to the island of W, scrupulously depicted as a place where athletic domination reigns supreme and physical capabilities are all that determine a person's worth. When coupled with the autobiographical section of the life of Perec, one gains a clear understanding of his intentions in taking us to W. The reader becomes aware of the horrible circumstances under which the people of W must live. The simultaneous offering of the two stories allows the reader to sympathize wholly with Perec's plight during childhood, as we are able to grasp on multiple levels the tribulations he experienced growing up as a Jew under the Nazis.For one to obtain a complete recognition of the effect the Nazi regime had during World War II, one must read the allegory and autobiography in alternating fashions as presented. In this manner, we can accurately see, especially in \\"Part Two\\" of the narrative, Perec's feelings and interpretations of the Nazi regime and how his life was affected by the fear inflicted by them. For example, Perec was baptized to save himself from being branded in similar fashion to the way novices were branded on the island of W, which, if the representative symbol of the island alone was observed more closely, one could see that it can be rearranged to form either a Star of David or a swastika (such rearrangements of symbols were observed intimately in Perec's autobiographical section). Intriguingly, Perec struggles to separate actual memories from those he has either invented of have been invented for him. He is aware that there are memories he actually recalls himself, such as his mother being sent to a concentration camp and his father dying in war, and those he's unsure if he invented. The concept of real and imagined memories adds complexity to the autobiography and allows one to sympathize further with Perec as he is unable to perform basic memory recollection due to the traumas faced during childhood.One is unable to deny that \\"W, or The Memory of Childhood\\" portrays a powerful message to the reader concerning the fallout of Nazi occupation in Europe. Unlike many stories of the Holocaust, Perec's work focuses on his individual struggle through the time of the Nazi regime allowing a vivid and more personal look into the effect this period had on those who experienced it. Furthermore, the narrative section allowed for one to witness, in comparative fashion, the type of society that the Nazi regime exemplified in their conquest of Europe. Both the intensely emotional aspect of the autobiography and remarkably captivating nature of the narrative easily entrance the reader in Perec's work. \\"W, or The Memory of Childhood\\" is a magnificent piece of literature for those possessing even the slightest interest in WWII history."},{"Title":"W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi)","review":"the two narrative trajecories of Georges Perec's W create parallel stories that seemingly are unconnected (and that's all I'll write about that,so as not to give anything away).Perec employs inventive literary devices within the two stories--clever, clever, clever!This book astonished me, which hasn't happened in a while!"},{"Title":"W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi)","review":"Perec is one of the great geniuses of 20th century writing. His prose is unlike anything else, and arises, one suspects, in the deep recesses of pain and confusion that was his growing up Jewish in France between 1936 and 1945. His parents both vanish, and he is hidden/brought up by a series of aunties, or maybe they aren't real relatives. His childhood, a vapor to him, is nonetheless what created his world view, and what fuels his remarkable writing.The alternating chapters are a parallel metaphor to his story. First, the lost boy, then the Nazis. The picture he makes with language expose both the heroics and depravity of the human soul. It is almost too much to stand."},{"Title":"W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi)","review":"The story of one man's journey of self-discovery! Georges Perec's W, or The Memory of Childhood is a semi-autobiographical work that forces readers to suspend disbelief and accept that the juxtaposed narratives are a reflection of the author's total human experience. Perec divides his work into two parts with two alternating narratives. The first narrative introduces a narrator the audience believes will travel to the land of W to find Gaspard Winckler, a boy whose identity he assumed to reach Switzerland. The second narrative is an autobiography of Perec's childhood experiences. Perec moves from very basic information, like birthdays and relative names, to more detailed stories with vivid descriptions. In part two, Perec abandons the microcosmic story of the individual searching for another individual established in part one, and turns his focus on the macrocosmic story of the society and culture of W, a world defined by the organized chaos of competitive sport. The society is segregated, has rules with no real meaning, and power is taken to a demonic extreme.This reviewer initially believed that the W narrative in part one makes readers want to find Gaspard Winckler. The perceived abandonment of the Gaspard Winckler plot and the flip flop between the two possibly unrelated narratives can create questions about the validity of Perec's writing. The author departed from the initial storyline and takes readers to a place that they had not expected to go. Discussing the work with a fellow reader allowed me to look at the total experience of the work in a different light. The book is cumbersome when the reader looks at the two stories as events occurring in two different places. The work should be analyzed as a window into the mind of Perec. The distinctly individual way in which Perec has processed and recorded his memories in his mind allows him to create, extrapolate, reconstruct, destroy, and deny images from his life experiences.W serves as a sociological metaphor for the past, the present, and a possible reality of the future. Like Miner's \`Body Ritual of the Nacirema' article, Perec is creating a metaphor for the reality he has seen, is seeing, and could possibly see. W for Perec's past is how he has come to understand the Nazi occupation in France. W for Perec's present, when he published the work, represented concentration camps in Chile under Pinochet. For the future of the world, W is an apocalyptic vision of a world in which the status quo is not questioned and followed blindly. The W narrative ends in a Rod Serling-esque fashion in which an omniscient perspective reveals that W's inhabitants are slaves to society because they do not challenge the system they live in. The society of W could possibly free itself from its situation if they decide to end the cycle of violence, apathy, humiliation, and sorrow.Perec's W or The Memory of Childhood chronicles the author's journey to learn more about who he is as a unique individual. He is trying to reconcile his past, present, and future. The journey to understand himself as an individual leads Perec to explore the environment and society he has been subjected to (C. Wright Mill's idea of the sociological imagination). Perec is making a powerful statement about the control humans possess in their lives. Humans are influenced by larger forces within society, and blind obedience to an unseen power could be cancerous. The W narrative and the autobiography reconcile Perec's understanding of his experiences. Perec's W or The Memory of Childhood must be framed as a complete entity that is independent of space and time to appreciate the personal journey through a man's mind."},{"Title":"W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi)","review":"You know those dreams that are especially absurd, but quite realistic? So realistic that reality and fiction have a strange way of mixing the next morning? You awake thinking that your boyfriend is angry at you for cheating on him. With Val Kilmer. Or that you won the Apprentice and are now working for Donald Trump, not at your pathetic job shelving books in the library. And for that brief second reality is clouded and hazy. You have to spend a minute or two telling yourself that you don't even know Val Kilmer. Such is Georges Perec's W, or the Memory of Childhood. It is a confounding blend of reality and fiction. In the beginning it is easy to make a clear distinction, but by the time you reach the end you are not sure where one ends and the other begins. It takes a second to sort it all outBe forewarned. This is not a book for the Danielle Steele fan.The story is a twisting dual narrative. One narrative is a memoir of Perec's own childhood during the Holocaust. The other a created story about an island obsessed with sport. Both stories seemingly have nothing to do with the other, but by the end of the book you understand that one was written for the other, the effect much like transposing two photographs on top of each other.Perec's childhood is with recounted (not in italics) with factual lists-he had a mother, a father, a potty, a cot-and a confession that he has little memory of his childhood. He tells the reader how he remembers his childhood-recalling to the reader the way he recalls it, not how it may have actually happened. (He adds addendums now that he is older to help aid the confused reader.) He retells his childhood devoid of emotion-his mother is sent to the death camps, his father killed in combat, he is sent to different border schools. It is stark in black and white print, told with a voice of indifference. It is this lack of emotionalism that sets the tone for the other story-the story of W (in italics).Woven just as elusively in his memory of childhood is the story of W. W is a tiny island that at first glance seems to be a land of joy and triumph-a land where the Olympic ideal is revered and honored. It is in the tale, in this island of W that we learn of unspeakable horrors, where champions are elevated like gods and losers killed, beaten, and tortured. A land where Law is chaos and deceit is rewarded. A place where there is no value for human life, just the result it is capable of producing. It is this grotesque story that is charged with emotion and we recoil in repulsion. It is in this story that Perec connects with his own memory of childhood and shares with us how he feels. Perec tells us, \\"How can you explain that what he is seeing is not anything horrific, not a nightmare he will suddenly awake from, something he can rid his mind of? How can you explain that this is life, real life . . . wherever you turn your eyes, that's what you will see, you will not see anything else, and that is the only thing that turns out to be true.\\"(Perec 139-140).Perec's unusual method allows us to experience the history of the Holocaust in two ways: one a factual representation of the author's own life and the other an emotional horror through the story of W. It is in W we see the full extent of what human nature is capable. Because of this W, or the memory of childhood will haunt and challenge you. It is branded in your memory, as you try to understand it. It takes a second to sort it all out."},{"Title":"Hulls and Hulks in the Tide of Time: The Life and Work of John A. Noble","review":"Erin Urban's moving biography of John Noble not only does an excellent job of introducing and explaining his work, but also allows the reader to understand why the work is important. Anyone who is at all interested in maritime history, shipbuilding, or even rigging will find a wealth of information here. Everyone will be moved by these superb lithographs that are a testament to those who worked for and built this country."},{"Title":"Margaret Bourke-White: Photographer","review":"This book illustrates why Margaret Bourke-White should be recognized as one of the 20th century's top photographers. Her ability to capture a moment during war and destruction or an enternity in marble and stone, is awe inspiring. She was not limited by her feminity. She moved easily into the world of machines and factories, capturing molten metal and shiny blades. Again and again, I return to the book and study all aspects of her photographs. The depth of field, the rhythm, the harmony and the life seen in all her photos takes my breath away. Within a few days of purchasing the book, I had the joy of visiting the National Art Gallery of Canada in Ottawa where there are two Margaret Bourke-White photos in their collection. The soft creamy paper used in these pictures counters the hard metal of the image itself. These are the third and fourth Margaret Bourke-White's I have had the pleasure to see in person. The other two was a copy of the original cover for LIFE magazine and a single rose bud. Both of these photos are owned by Margaret Bourke-White's sorority and are featured in their archival collection. The photographic reproductions in this book, although lacking the soft creams of the Art Gallery's copies, do capture the integrity of her photos. I will treasure this book."},{"Title":"Margaret Bourke-White: Photographer","review":"For several years, I would stop in the photography section of whatever bookstore I was in to see if there were any monographs about Margaret Bourke-White's photography. Alas, there were none. Margaret Bourke-White was a remarkable photo-journalist who has given us many remarkable and lasting images of industry, war and society. She joined Life magazine at its founding and died at the time of the magazine's demise in 1972.This book provides a comprehensive look at her work decade by decade with the best of her best work included with an introduction to each section by Sean Callahan. The appearance of this book is long overdue. A perfect companion to this volume is the biography by Vicki Goldberg."},{"Title":"Margaret Bourke-White: Photographer","review":"This large format hard-backed book is a magnificent tribute to one of the world's most renowned women photographers. Published by Pavilion, this landmark retrospective (with a UK street price of 40 pounds) contains 160 pages of some of her most remarkable monochrome images, together with some rarely seen work from her personal archives.Reproduction is quite literally superb, with the pictures jumping from the page; most images are placed one to a page while some spread the gutter. Those who aspire to create the very best black and white prints should study Bourke-White's work carefully. As fine art photographs they would hang well in any gallery. As documentary images they are as good as any I have seen.From the 1920s to the 1950s Bourke-White fearlessly recorded objects, people and events that shaped history. First famed as an industrial photographer, she then became on the first staff photographers at Life magazine.This book is the most complete collection of her work to date and includes photographs from her early days. Images of industrialised America, through to war-torn Korea and the Nazi bombing of Moscow, all show life as it really was, and photographed in such an accomplished way, that the reader can't help but be drawn into them as though it was yesterday.Few photo books impress me as much as this one. A worthy addition to anyone's collection."},{"Title":"Margaret Bourke-White: Photographer","review":"I did not buy this book because MBW was an inspirational female or other, but because her photos are simply superb.

That's what this book is. They say that when the student is ready the teacher will appear. Anybody searching for a spiritual teacher need look no further. I've spent my life wondering about the nature of reality and asking myself these questions: does God exist, does pure evil exist, what is goodness, what do my dreams mean, what is astral travel and where does it take you, what happens when you die. This book answers all those questions and more. It is extra large and at 511 pages the reader receives the equivalent of about 4 books for the price of one. The writer's generosity of spirit is breath-taking. You can't put this book down and you'll read it over and over again. Hughes weaves into her book snippets of holy texts from every religion. You see how all religions are simply different spokes leading to the center of the same wheel. The most fascinating thing is that while you read this book, you begin to change yourself. Energetically, things happen to you. The book actually draws you closer to God and to happiness. There's a spiritual healing that occurs, if you allow it to. At the end of hte book you actually see paintings of may of hte things which Hughes has experienced while astral. You also get to read the music that she's brought back with her (you can in fact order the CDs that go along with it). The book will quite simply rock your spirit. You will place it amongst your sacred texts and never let it go."},{"Title":"The Mysteries of the Redemption: A Treatise on Out-Of-Body Travel and Mysticism","review":"I&#8217;m a big fan of Marilynn Hughes books. Over the last decade I&#8217;ve recommended Odysseys of Light and Crystal River Flowing to so many people. But this book, Mysteries of the Redemption, is so much more. It&#8217;s a wealth of information that will feed your Soul for years. This book is vital to journeying out of body and in Spirit. After reading nearly every OBE book, I am now a firm believer in letting the experience come to you, rather than forcing it to you. I believe the information in this book leads to healthy spiritual growth which in turn will lead to beautiful and natural Out of Body Experiences, and the eventual Ascension. See you in Paradise! Paul"},{"Title":"The Mysteries of the Redemption: A Treatise on Out-Of-Body Travel and Mysticism","review":"Many of us have a book that we describe as life changing. Well.... Welcome to mine! In this epic book, Marilynn Hughes takes us on a long Journey wherein she describes through her many mystical experiences a process of purification of the Soul. In sharing her experiences, we are given an account of an exploration of a much bigger reality than most of us have ever been made aware of. And as we are taken through the many layers of this multi dimensional reality we hear a very human story which explores past lives, purgatory, other worlds and non physical environments. Heavenly realms, hellish realms. This is a story of sinfulness, of virtue, of suffering, of joy and enlightenment. It is an exploration into territories which we have heard and read about for centuries from mystics and from the writings of the worlds ancient religions. Entwined within the pages the author inserts passages from the worlds greatest sacred texts, which are always appropriate to the subject matter in discussion and give the experiences added depth and meaning. This is a book best read slowly, over a long period of time, in order to absorb the concepts and meditate on the deeper meanings. But what makes the book so special to me (and I've read other reviews that say the same thing) is that whilst reading, I began to learn that we are all dynamically active in this multi dimensional reality ourselves (even if we have been unaware of this for our entire lives). And so as I read, I began to experience some deeply meaningful experiences within my own dreams. I've never looked back since reading this. A life changer in every sense of the word, this book has helped me in many ways that would be difficult to describe here. It will always be special to me and I hope you love it too!"},{"Title":"The Mysteries of the Redemption: A Treatise on Out-Of-Body Travel and Mysticism","review":"I LOVE this Book.

If you are into the spiritual search then this book is a waste of time. It a meandering, poorly structured book of dreams, written much like a diary. Poorly structured, boring to read and no credibility to the personal dream life of someone that thinks they are special because of their astral dreams of past lives and angels and the like.

Interestingly, the antagonist is referred to as \\"the limping man\\" until the last pages. I wonder if this was a source idea for the later Nameless Detective series. This crime story is an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science","review":"Trying to explain magic in rational terms has rather fallen out of fashion, and sometimes you have to turn to the classics.Half philosophy, half science, Troward's little volume builds a rational and plausible basis for controlling events in what most people would deem &quot;supernatural&quot; ways. His premise, condensed down to three words, is &quot;faith changes reality&quot; -- it's what comes up in exploring that hypothesis that makes the book interesting. The book is as well-organized and well-presented as you would expect any college textbook to be, although the flowery 100-year-old language might be a turn-off to some.While &quot;Edinburgh&quot; is of use to people trying to understand (or accept) magic, its greatest value is by far for those who are already exploring the subject. I wish that this book came in clue bat form, so I could hit a number of would-be &quot;mages&quot; over the head with it, and have them absorb it instantly. While one may not necessarily agree with everything Troward says (I found the insistence on a Christian perspective rather extreneous, for example), his ability to build a rich and cohesive system is an inspiration -- and a solid foundation. Ultimately, those who wish to change the world must understand it, and this book can be a great first step on that path. It's one of the must-read books on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science","review":"I have been a student of quantum theory as it applies to our ability to create form from thougtht. &quot;The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science&quot; by Thomas Troward were published in 1909. They contain all of the same principles being set forth by today's gurus of quantam theory such as Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer. Very interesting book. Also recommend, &quot;Your Invisible Power&quot; by Genevieve Behrend. Ms. Behrend was the only student of Thomas Troward. Her book is a more basic way to apply the same principles."},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science","review":"A classic by one of the pioneers of New Thought; these lectures deal with the questions of spirit and matter, the nature of intelligence, the unity of spirit, and the relationship between the conscious and subconscious mind. Troward had a knack for conveying profound philosophical matters in a most understandable way and for formulating ancient truths so that a child could understand. He explains the difference between form (matter) and being - that the one is the mode of the relative and the mark of subjection to conditions, while the other is the truth of the absolute and that which controls conditions. Because spirit is infinite, it is everywhere and must be present at every point in space at the same moment. This is a fundamental fact of all being. The relation between spirit and being as idea (from which the elements of time and space are absent) and form (the relative which is dependent on those elements) leads to the fact that pure spirit continually subsists in the absolute and from it all the phenomena of being flow. In proportion to our level of recognition of this fact, our power for producing visible outward results by the action of our thought will grow. The book concludes with the practical application of this knowledge in our lives and affairs. I highly recommend the Edinburgh lectures as well as the Dore Lectures and Troward's masterpiece &quot;The Creative Process in the Individual.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science","review":"I first came across Thomas Troward through working with Bob Proctor on a coaching program.

I love reading anything that has to do with him.The only problem I ever have with writings of T. Troward is that sometimes he speaks a little too intellectually. He also sometimes refers to things that are a bit dated, and that can also make it difficult to follow along at times.There is nothing else out there for learning how to use your thoughts to control your life, like the teachings of Thomas Troward.

But seeing as &quot;Roseanne&quot; is one of my favorite shows, I had to pick it up. This is Roseanne Barr-Arnold's second book; I have not yet read the first one. The book discusses everything between the start of her stand-up act through her marriage with Tom Arnold. She has lots of fun bashing all of the people she worked with on her hit sitcom and her ex-husband, Bill Pentland, who she was married to for 16 years and had 3 children with. The thing that is ironic about this book is how Roseanne talks about how much she loves Tom Arnold, when she divorced him the same year that this book was released. The book is actually quite interesting, however. We see that Roseanne Barr and Roseanne Arnold are definetely two different people. This Roseanne is sticking with her story about her father molesting her and her sisters. (The Roseanne Barr of 2004 is now getting along with her family.) I think that this book is a little one-sided, though. Roseanne doesn't seem to think about how her children must feel during this divorce. I do recommend it for those of you intrigued by Roseanne Barr-Pentland-Arnold-Thomas's life story."},{"Title":"My Lives","review":"This is Roseanne's second autobiography, the one in which she alleges childhood sexual abuse by both her mother and father. She also details how her younger sister fled her parents' house due to abuse (and now denies any abuse) and how Roseanne's daughter was also abused by Roseanne's father. Roseanne claims her weight issues stem from childhood sexual abuse. In a bizarre chapter at the end, Roseanne even alludes to having multiple personality disorder, as a means of surviving abuse.Roseanne also dishes about the formative years of her sitcom and her desperate struggle for creative control, as well as her romance, marriage, and creative partnership with Tom Arnold. She also describes in detail the infamous National Anthem debacle, from what her intentions were through the aftermath.I don't know if I find Roseanne 100% credible. She's outrageous and unbalanced and I can't help but feel that she skewers the truth to meet her own needs. If you can get past that, this makes for an interesting read."},{"Title":"My Lives","review":"I love her honesty in this book. It's a horrible yet inspiring story of so many struggles. I could definitely relate. I commend her for her courage and bravery to stand up and speak out."},{"Title":"My Lives","review":"Roseanne is always brilliant. For some reason this audio book is more relevant now than it was 20 years ago."},{"Title":"My Lives","review":"I really liked this book, but I think I liked her first book,[...]... better. Though, in this one she had less fear of the truth, wasn't afraid to get raw, and admit not only other's shortcomings, but her own...Again, I was struck by the fact that she was so brilliantly intelligent, yet emotionally wounded, a poetess, a feminist, a mysticist, a flower child, a mother, a queen in her own world. All of these different parts of her enveloped her and sometimes threatened to take over who was truly \\"Roseanne\\".I was shocked, actually, how the first season she had to fight so hard to get her character to be... well, HER. She had to fight tooth and nail not to be yet another Samantha or June, not to be what the act that had GOTTEN her the show was built around. Her biggest supporters were, at that time, John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf. They stood by her when the rest of the studio loathed her for speaking her mind and fighting for her own truth. And, then there was Tom Arnold, who I actually gained a little respect for after reading this.He was with her before she was a star, her best friend, her writing partner-- a man who silently was in love with her, but she was married to an emotionally manipulative drunk, who tried to constantly use her own children against her, and actually held secret meetings with the studio brass to conspire against her, as well as The Enquirer and her own children, telling them that their mother must love her \\"little job\\" more than them because she was no longer a stay-at-home Mom. (Despite the fact that he, himself, when left to watch the kids was oft times too drunk to even get them to school...) Of course, that's different than the general consensus at that time, that he attached himself to her coattails after her fame...Though, things with Tom weren't all roses, either. She was in denial about his coke habit, but eventually through him getting help, was able to face her denial about her own, abusive and parasitic family. And that her father molesting not only her and her sisters, but her DAUGHTER, and saying \\"Call it molest, I can live with that-- that's just a woman being hysterical\\"... well, that was just sickening.But she seemed to have come out the other end stronger for it-- though, she was still married to Tom at the end of this book, so I don't know what happened next... but all in all, despite her ascervic (and sometimes quite raunchy) wit), beneath that is a very strong, intelligent, and LOVING person, who I hope now is doing well."},{"Title":"My Lives","review":"I read Roseanne's first book. It was so awful, it was almost torture. This book is an improvement. Roseanne writes more lucidly the second time around. It is more biography than rambling mess, as the first book was. She covers her personal life as well as tid bits regarding her sit com. The sit com is one area where I do believe her. She had to fight (and it wasn't pretty) for control of her own show.I can see where many ideas for the show came from after reading her books. The problem is that the show was funny and Roseanne's life anything but funny. Roseanne Barr is nothing like Roseanne Conner. Not surprisingly, Roseanne Barr swears like a trucker. She has no filter and says anything and I mean ANYTHING that comes to mind. (I wish I could do this too, but ya just can't!). She was heavily into drugs, alcohol and even has sex with multiple guys for money. This is all while she was married with three kids. She talks about loving her kids, but was barely there to raise them. What a mess.She also covers the fact that she had suppressed memories of her parents abusing her, mentally and sexually. She states that this is what made her act out so badly all her life and she dealt with it through multiple personalities. She provides a list of each personality's name at the end of the book.Because her behavior has been so incredibly bizarre and over the top, it is hard to know what to believe or not. It's hard to see someone's pain as enjoyable. Like lots of people, she needed to write the book, but I'm not sure we need to read it."},{"Title":"My Lives","review":"I found this book in one of those factory second tables at the shopping centre, I thought it was a novel Roseanne had written, some cheesy romance thing but because I am such a huge fan I bought it anyway, God I loved it, So brutally honest and self examining, I loved the people she loved and hated those she hated.Great bio, the best I ever read."},{"Title":"My Lives","review":"The best thing about Roseanne's book, \\"My Lives\\" is the picture on the cover.I have always loved Roseanne because she is/was such a talented and courageous entertainer. Through her groundbreaking sitcom,Roseanneshe showed the American family as it really was meant to be seen. But I also think there's a part of her that's really not all there. And, sadly she started to unravel around the time this book came out.\\"My Lives\\" was published 14 years ago, 5 years after Roseanne's first autobiography; the considerably less in-your-face \\"My Life As A Woman.\\" But in her latest editorial debacle Roseanne lets it all hang out so to speak.Roseanne is intent on painting a very ugly picture of her life through this book. She was the victim of incest and sexual abuse by both her mother and father. She was forced to become a hooker because her and her first husband were living on skid row. She gave up a child that she had as a teenager. She never learned to trust men. She ate like there was no tomorrow and when she gained success she became incredibly inebriated on her own fame.All of this comes off as so cliche and rather sloppy. It reads like a perverse National Enquirer article. But all of that cannot compare to Roseanne's most \\"startling revelation.\\" She claims that she is the victim of Disassociate Identity Disorder (in 1994 when this book was published the \\"disease\\" was called \\"multiple identity disorder.\\") Yes, that's right Roseanne claims to have hundreds of personalities living within her one body.I can remember an interview that Roseanne once did with Arsenio. He was talking about La Toya and all of her hairball stories and Roseanne defended her saying: \\"I would rather believe a liar than a molester.\\" Well I suppose anyone would. But that does not give her the right, just because she has a public voice, to go on national TV and trash people, the people who were the closest to her simply because she forgot to take her Prozac. And, when Roseanne finally got her head on straight there was never a big press conference or any media appearances to dispel these malicious lies. It's sad that truth isn't as appealing as dishonesty is.As you probably do not know (because it was rarely reported in the MSM,) a few years after this book was published, a newly divorced (and re-married again Roseanne) has \\"regained her sanity.\\" This \\"new\\" Roseanne now recants all of those hateful statements in this book. But even to call those statements hateful would be doing an injustice. What would you call someone who makes up false allegations of sexual abuse towards her parents?I just think Roseanne has made some very poor decisions as far as her personal life and her professional life are concerned. She laid her life out for the entire world to see and somewhere along the way she forgot who she really was and she forgot what the truth was.The overall text of \\"My Lives\\" is written in such a childish methed, which huge print and very nondescriptive language. This was rather surprising to me since I know that Roseanne is a wonderful and very talented writer (she has been writing her own material for years).Geraldine Barr (Roseanne's sister,) wrote a rebuttal to this,My Sister Roseanne. Unfortunately, through her many contacts and with all of the power and clout that comes with having the number one coast-to-coast television show in the Country, Roseanne was able to get the book collectively blackballed. Critics panned that book as a cry for money. These same critics didn't bat an eye when Roseanne publishes an autobiography only 5 years after her first one.If you're interested in learning about the real Roseanne, I recommend watching her TV show and some of her movies. I also recommend reading her first autobiography and Geraldine's book, as well as any magazine interviews that Roseanne has done over the last 7 to 8 years (anything between 1991 and 1998 are riddled with statements that Roseanne herself now states are \\"untrue.\\") But skip this book, unless you enjoy reading about trainwrecks.I do feel bad for Roseanne but from what I have read about her now, she is enjoying lucidity and is at peace. But more than that, I feel awful for her poor parents. I cannot think of anything worse than to have a child make up such false statements for the pure purposes of selling a book.Where is Roseanne today?Now going by \\"Roseanne Barr\\" once again, after marrying Ben Thomas twice and divorcing him twice Roseanne's now living happily single with her teenage son. She is currently performing in Las Vegas at the Sahara and when she's in LA or New York Roseanne enjoys stand-up from time to time. Roseanne has gone on record as stating that she has no interest in going going back to series TV on a regular basis, however she is planning on writing another book. She just wants to put the past behind her and focus on the future. Roseanne is also a very proud grandmother and is very involved in her childrens' and grandchildrens' lives. In April, Roseanne and the cast from her show were reuinted for a TV Land Award; \\"Roseanne\\" was given the pop-culture award. In this latest persona, Roseanne appeared very subdued and even wore a fashionable gray forelock in her hair. Perhaps it's a sign that she really has changed. Or, maybe one of her personalities has an aversion to Lady Revlon?"},{"Title":"Prose Merlin (TEAMS Middle English Texts)","review":"Yes, this book *is* in Middle English, but the language really doesn't pose a problem. I'm not a Middle English specialist, although I will confess to having a reference work on ME in my library. I didn't need it to read the Prose Merlin. There's a running glossary at the bottom of each page, which you'll barely refer to once you get used to the language. There's also a good commentary on each chapter in the back of the book.Basically, as an early English reworking of the French Vulgate cycle of Arthurian legends, it offers a unique take on these legends that you just won't find anywhere else. Malory's version of the same stories comes out quite differently. Plus, the Prose Merlin is just a good story, and doesn't become tedious the way much medieval literature does.So, if you're interested in the Arthurian legends, I'd recommend it. Don't let the language put you off. It's definitely easier than Chaucer, and perhaps a tad bit easier than (untranslated) Malory. This book would also be a good choice for someone who wanted to try reading some Middle English; it's a good confidence-builder."},{"Title":"Prose Merlin (TEAMS Middle English Texts)","review":"Just wanted to let you know, this edition is abridged.

It is vivid, and how powerfully so. It is small and slight, as it should be. It is like a little album of photographs that we carry around for a lifetime. The images created by this book are strong, rich and lasting. The battle of wits between little Anne, her mistress and the male observer is never really won, but played out exquisitely to a climax that is neither satisfying nor predictable. The cruelty is tender, the flesh is vulnerable and the object of desire is as ambiguous as our reaction.

They are given close attention and clear analysis, with the exception that clearer maps/graphics would have been a plus. This campaign is interesting in that both sides accused the other of killing wounded men, mutilating the dead and other atrocities, accusations which the author reports but does not explore."},{"Title":"In Review: Pictures I've Kept: A Concise Pictorial Autobiography","review":"In terms of qualifications for the American Presidency, Dwight Eisenhower most likely only has to take a back seat to George Washington.

Eisenhower is pretty much what this book is all about. It is a very simplistic autobiography written by Eisenhower with a fare sprinkling of black and white photographs taken from his private collection and obvious photo ops occurring throughout his long career; more about that later.I like biographies and auto biographies of presidents, collect them, read them and mull over them. Now to begin with, a very good argument could be made that with the possible exception of LBJ, Eisenhower was the last president to be elected in this country that was even vaguely qualified to hold the job. I make this statement strictly from a consideration as to what they would have placed on their resume if applying for the job. That being said....This is a rather light weight autobiography and those that have a desire to delve deeply into the life of this interesting man; examine his war time experiences, pick apart his Presidential Administration and learn more of his maturation process probably should seek out another volumes. There are many out there and they are not all that difficult to find. No, this is a rather pleasant little read, more like a gentle talk with the author over a cup of coffee. Many of the horrendously important aspects of this man's life are briefly passed over; if mention at all. No, this is simply a pleasing chat with an individual who was a pleasing man. If you are looking for a work that is either pro or con his administration, then this is not the work for you.I will say, and agree with another reviewer here, that the title is a bit misleading. While there are indeed quite a number of photographs, this is far, far from a photographic biography. I must admit to being a bit disappointed in the number, subject matter, quality and overall photographic coverage here. Again, there are better works out there by others. If you are looking for a photographic history of this president; one that more comprehensive, then you must continue your quest!The president here seems to have gone out of his way to avoid any controversy what so ever and I have to begrudgingly admit that he has done a good job in that area. We do get some nice little peeks at the General's life; some inside information as to his dealing with various world leaders and a good dose of his rather strained home-spun philosophy at times. (It needs to be noted that Eisenhower tried, at times, to come across as \\"just a good old boy,\\" and he was far, far from that in reality as he was actually a very complex man, skilled general, statesman and politician and extremely well read). This makes for pleasing reading but certainly fails to open any doors of understanding to any depth what so ever. The writing is good as I am sure he had a legion of editors go over this work with a fine toothed comb and it is certainly an easy read which will cause absolutely no strain in the understanding department.I suppose that this work is important for people like myself who collect books of presidents...it was indeed a nice addition to my collection. It could also serve as a good overview of a remarkable man during remarkable time; good for those who want to know just a bit about the man and his times but have no driving interest to dig very deep. Just keep in mind that it is simply that; an overview.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"In Review: Pictures I've Kept: A Concise Pictorial Autobiography","review":"In terms of qualifications for the American Presidency, Dwight Eisenhower most likely only has to take a back seat to George Washington.

As usual, in this one he does more detective work than acting. The book features a number of the running characters in the series (my own theory of character conservation): his lousy but gossipy agent Maurice Skellern, theater solicitor Gerald Venables, and the fanatical theater-struck team of Bartlemas and O'Rourke. Having and re-using his own regular cast of characters, Brett gives readers the homey feeling that they are among friends again. Charles at age 47 is just barely skirting the outer fringes of alcoholism.One of his liaison partners, Jacqui, asks Charles to help her reconcile with her lover, the very successful theater impresario Marius Steen, who has told her to buzz off and is incommunicado. Jacqui has paid for some compromising blackmail photos that show her at a wild party with a masked Marius. She wants Charles to be the go-between and deliver the damaging photos to Steen to show her lover that she is trying to protect their love affair.Unfortunately Jacqui hasn't thought to buy the negatives so Charles has to visit the blackmailer, who it turns out has been killed in a roadside shooting, but his wife is carrying on the nefarious business. The wife, a sex pot, wants money and Charles. She gets Charles but no blackmail money.Typically there's a lot of insider theater and actor stuff that stage buffs will love. Brett is often comedic and ironic. Charles realizes what a loser he is, but he soldiers on thinking of the next Bell's whiskey, careful that he doesn't develop Distiller's Droop as he did with Jacqui. His daughter Juliet is a key player in this story, but her husband has a hard time stomaching his father-in-law who in turn can't the son-in-law. His daughter asks her father if he's an alcoholic, and he answers, \\"Where does liking a drink stop and being an alcoholic start?\\"Charles does several impersonations during his investigations, one being Inspector McWhirter of Scotland Yard. In this book Charles even gets a bullet wound in the arm during his detecting chores. This a highly recommended mystery with a busy plot line."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Federal Reserve","review":"This book goes into a tremendous amount of detail on several subjects I simply had no interest in. If you want to get a job at the Fed, for example, this book has an entire chapter dedicated to just that. How about developing our communities? Because the Federal Reserve Board is required by law to promote local economic development, there is a chapter on this as well. Would you like to know if we Americans are saving enough? No worries. Since the Federal Reserve helps member banks develop consumer education programs, there is a chapter on savings, too.For the general reader, where this book is very helpful is in showing just how many responsibilities the Fed has. There are educational, regulatory, supervisory, as well as the more obvious monetary roles the Fed must play. It, of course, has a national role as America's central bank, but it also has a powerful international role that is less well-known. This book gives an abbreviated history of the institution and America's banking history, and it also has an entire chapter on the circumlocutory way Fed Chairmen express themselves in public (called \\"Fedspeak\\").What the book is less helpful with is detail. Everything is discussed, but nothing is dealt with at even moderate length."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Federal Reserve","review":"This book was written by an insider. This is not a bad thing. This book is a great tool to help anyone understand the workings of the Federal Reserve System. Whether or not someone agrees with how the Fed runs itself is a seperate matter from this books intention and who this book was created for. This book does not get into philosophical idealogy of economic systems and it shouldn't. It accurately discusses the tools the Fed uses to help steer the economy in the direction they want it to go. It also explains the layout of the structure of the Fed. This book is good for anyone curious about the structure / tools of the Fed and why it does what it does. The Fed helps run our economy and this book shows how pretty decently. It won't disappoint you, as it is straight-forward and comprehendable. Great for anyone who works in banking / finance / invesments."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Federal Reserve","review":"While there is certainly much any reader could learn from this book, it certainly cannot be claimed to be definitive.My job requires me to know quite a bit about the Federal Reserve, the details of whose various processes and responsibilities are usually given short shrift in most macroeconomics textbooks. And while it's the easiest thing in the world to find a book which mentions the Fed, usually nothing more than a cursory overview of the institution is given before the discussion moves on to the three tools of monetary policy and their roles in the macroeconomy.Thus it was I was transported with delight when I was alerted that Alpha Books had come out with this title in 2003 (as of my writing it appears to be out of print). Others might think the title odd or arcane, but for me being conversant with the esoteric workings of the Fed has a direct bearing on my livelihood.Alas! This book is not so great. I am disappointed to report that it reads like a government brochure, without getting down to the nitty-gritty. Or only brushing the nitty-gritty.Worse, remember how I said that most economic textbooks focus on the Fed's three main tools of monetary policy and not much else? Well, this book doesn't even do that, dealing only glancingly with monetary policy.From the look of it, you might think you're getting a much deeper, much more detailed explanation of how monetary policy works, but you'd be wrong. That's not the kind of book it is. It's almost a coffee table book, without color plates. There are no graphs and charts, and most of the text employs a \\"Who woulda thought!\\"-type approach. It seems to be written for people who already understand the subject--pace the title.In particular, what I was looking for were extended discussions of the three tools of monetary policy, and a sickening amount of detail as to how they're carried out, their ins and outs, their effects, etc. I found nothing of the kind.For example, in something I was reading the other day, I came across a statement to the effect that to increase the money supply, the Fed buys bonds \\"from the government.\\" It's this last part that puzzled me. I thought the Fed was buying back bonds in the hands of private citizens.So I sought out the explanation in this book. Surely there, the nuts and bolts of how Fed bond-buying goes down would be spelled out in nauseating detail.No such luck. (Although the book does inform you that the Fed occasionally buys and sells bonds.) And ditto for similar technical questions.Not that the book is a complete waste of time. There's a lot here I didn't know about the Fed, but most of what I learned was simply not vital, functional knowledge about the nuts and bolts of how the system operates. The book celebrates definitions; deeper explanations are few and far between.In sum, I would characterize \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Federal Reserve\\" as a mere appreciation of the Fed, filled with trivia, addresses, definitions, and a raft of interesting facts, but designed either for one whose interest is merely casual, or who already knows so much about the workings of our central bank that they're dying for a round of trivial pursuit."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Federal Reserve","review":"The book was informative in many ways especially in the history of the FED and some of the key historic and contemporary figures. The chapters on FED \\"Speak\\" and on whats going on up to 2003 in the US Economy were well done. My big disappointment is with the fact that the authors never mentioned the very historic and monumental event of taking our currency off of the Gold Standard. This one decision alone is a very big part of why we have so many ongoing problems in our economy that need so called \\"Fixing\\" by the Fed.There was mention of Richard Nixon and the Fed Chairman at the time Nixon was in office which is when they made the big decision to dump the gold standard but yet the authors never mention it at all. I can't believe they left this important event out of the book by accident.I'd like to have an explanation from the authors concerning this gross negligence."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Federal Reserve","review":"It was written in 2002 so it does not cover what has happened since '07 .

It is based on religion rather than psychology, with attention paid to The Bible and the role dreams played throughout.The author posits that a dream is a vision of the future, and that any relationship with the past or present is incidental.From a religious perspective, I question the authority and validity of the author's interpretations.Scientifically speaking, the work has very little to offer aside from an alternative/historic view (which is not without value).Now that dream psychology is mainstream, and religious dream interpretation is on the fringe, this book's title is misrepresentative. A more fitting title might be &quot;A Religious Dream Dictionary: 10,000 Dreams Interpreted.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Dreams","review":"While being far from psychologically acceptable (or believable) these days, Miller's &quot;Dictionary of Dreams&quot; does present a glimpse into how our great-grandparents interpreted dreams - it reminded me of Mrs. Beeton's &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; and its codification of Victorian housekeeping! I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys interpreting dreams in a humorous spirit, as well as for those who enjoy authentic examples of popular history.And, to anyone who has an issue with the dream analyses - lighten up! It's just a book from a century ago - not a Jungian treatise!"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Dreams","review":"I found the book initially entertaining as bathroom reading, for the pure nonsense value and a glimpse into our dark past. Some examples:Banana - To dream of bananas, foretells that you will be mated to an uninteresting and an unloved companion.Baste - To dream of basting meats while cooking, denotes you will undermine your own expectations by folly and selfishness.However, after around a dozen entries, they all blur together as portending either great fortune or great sorrow, with separate interpretations for women, all centering around love or how orderly their kitchen will be. After more entries, the ugly side of our dark past surfaces, with entries about Negroes, Mulattos, Jews, etc.This book was written in a time (1909) when racist sentiment was the norm, as another reviewer points out. Use of the word \\"Negro\\" is one thing, now politically \\"incorrect\\", however interpreting dreams about \\"Negroes with their banjoes\\" as signifying \\"unavoidable discord...worries with hirelings...sickness\\" etc. is beyond PC, it's racism. Similarly, dreaming of Jews \\"signifies untiring ambition and an irrepressible longing after wealth and high position, which will be realized to a very small extent\\" and so on... In short, the book is interesting from a historical perspective, like minstrel shows, but needs to be viewed in context, and is of no other value in today's world. Sadly, this book has been latched on to by all manner of well meaning new age crackpots looking for easy answers to life's hard questions."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Dreams","review":"I got this book as a gift and still think it was a waste of money.

It is based on the screwy premise that dreams are a form of ESP and predicts one's future, and that only the author can tell you the true \\"meanings\\" of what you've dreamt. The author's interpretations of what your dreams supposedly predicted usually have no logical correlation to the dreams. Get this:The first part of the entry for \\"cats\\" says: \\"To dream of a cat, denotes ill luck, if you do not succeed in killing it and driving it from your sight.\\"Part of the entry for \\"fire\\" reads: \\"To dream of seeing your home burning, denotes a loving companion, obedient children, and careful servants. For a business man to dream that his store is burning, and he is looking on, fortells a great rush in business and profitable results.\\"Got that? According to this book, to dream you're petting a soft, furry kitten means that bad things will happen to you; but to dream of seeing your home or business burning down means that good things will happen. WTF?I thumbed through this sleazy, unscientific tome and looked up various other entries, and everything supposedly predicts good or bad fortune in some absurdly twisted way. This book was pure hogwash when it was first published in 1909 and it is still pure hogwash today.

I've read many dream books and none of them have ever been this accurate in predicting future events based on your dreams. Almost all, most of the dreams ive had - I looked up there meanings and on most of the dreams it has a diffrent thing that will happen than the exact object or person/thing you dream of. But it always comes true IN REAL LIFE. It has been bone chilling. This book is a dream bible to me and Ive had it for about 5 yrs now and have used it till its almost fallen apart. It not only has dream meanings but the preface has the whole story of dreams over the ages and exactly how they work and affect us in the waking life. Its fascinating. Some reviewers had a problem with some racist passages or writings in here, but you have to understand the meanings in this book have been studied and some are the old meanings or they stay true to the real meaning of the dream so they use defitions from older times. And it will say somthing about a person of color once in awhile during the book.( If you have a certain dream) and those definitions are few and far between. Other than that - THIS BOOK IS REAL. Take it from me and my own experiences.- It hits the nail on the head like no other book you will ever read. Just make sure you remember most of your dreams and look up the meanings and if you have a real vivid or strange dream make sure you circle and remember the meaning of it so you can go back and look it up when the meanings happen to you in real life , whether its the next day or a couple months down the line. But i guarentee it will happen - AT least thats what happened to me. Enjoy the book. Highly RecomendedPS- I started having all these dreams and i would circle the meaning in my book so i could keep track and see if that would happen in real life and the first couple months alot of the stuff happened but there were some outlandish things like finding money that said ill never have to be worried to pay my bills again and you will be ( prosperous) and At the time i could never beleive that because my life wasnt at the best at that exact time , the stuff it said i couldnt beleive so i dismissed it ,or i kept it in the back of my mind just in case, BUT about 5-6 months later ( those dreams i circles that i said ( yea right ) to or didnt beleive CAME TRUE. So if it dosent come true right away dont dismiss the book. There is definetely a coincidence between what we dream and what happens in real life to us. They still havent figured it out but they are doing more & more research every day to try to uncover the mystery of dreams. I cant say this book has been a coincidence because to many things have been accurate and right on target.

I checked it out of my local library to help me interpret a dream I had the night before. I was astounded at the content. The book's cover and all outward appearances profess it to be a modern work. However, as far as I have been able to deduce, it was written around the turn of the century. Not only is the book not about interpreting dreams, but about the &quot;prophecies&quot; dreams hold, but the book is FILLED with racist terminology. I urge you to track down a copy and look up &quot;fight.&quot; A few entries down, the book helpfully informs you of what it means if you dream of being attacked by razor-wielding &quot;negroes&quot; on your walk home. How offensive! And the book might be acceptable if marketed as what it actually is: an antiquated volume meant for us to snicker at. However, according to the publication information at the front of the book, it seems that you merely slapped a more modern looking cover on the book every dozen years or so and have sold it as a modern dream encyclopedia ever since! How irresponsible! In the wake of the resurgance of new-age science, uninformed people, even children may pick up this book and be influenced by its nonsense.

What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life! I strongly recommend getting this version of Carroll's classic story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass hold a special place in my heart. After my father died almost ten years ago, I purchased a copy for my mother. I suggested she read it and see that Alice, no matter what she went through, how bizarre and disturbing, always found a way to come out on top. She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source. This version is wonderful for the young or the old, as it's LARGE PRINT. I really can't say enough good things about this book. (On an interesting side note, there's a camp of thought about it actually being written by Queen Victoria...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"It appears that many of the reviewers of this particular edition of the book are not actually reviewing the product. Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child. Taking this perpective, readers will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This Book Brings out the best of both words.

Also, because they are junior editions they don't have introductions, give author backgrounds, etc. - although I don't believe any of the IJL editions are abridged except for The Three Musketeers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Another favourite book from childhood is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (or Alice in Wonderland as it's sometimes called) by Lewis Carroll.The novel was written in 1865 and tells the story of Alice, a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantasy world called Wonderland. Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

Rereading it made me more aware of the intoxicating dreamlike quality of the story line as well as the incredibly tongue-in-cheek writing style. BUT... I was very disappointed to open it and find it contained NO illustrations whatsoever! Reading A.I.W. without the John Tenniel drawings is like eating plain dry bread.

I'm going to order a different one right now."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"In my english class we had to pick a foreign author and a book to read. I choose this book because I'd never read it before, I've seen the Disney version of this story but never got around to reading the actual book. I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes. I also enjoyed the poems throughout the story and when characters speak in riddles and ryhmes. The Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter would have to be my favorite characters in this whole story (besides Alice herself). Its a great book and I'd be happy to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I love the Alice books, but this was the first time I read all of them. I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover. Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover. Not only do you get both the beloved stories, you also get the ORIGINAL \\"Alice's Adventures Underground\\" which Alice in Wonderland was based on. It is also notated throughout the book, with the explanations of each notation categorized in the back by Book:Chapter:Notation #.The thing that, for me, makes this particular pressing stand out, is not just that everything is all neatly bound together, but I absolutely ADORE the stylish new COVER! In fact, I love ALL the new Penguin Classics series of re-bound classic novels."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland, the classic, thrilling fiction book, by Lewis Carroll, is a story that has intrigued and captivated readers for more than a hundred years. In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from.

Well later on she discovers that there are a few reasons why s some things are not nonsense. These are some of the nonesense things; Drinks make you shrink, cakes make you grow, cats can dissapear, and flowers can sing. Some of the things Alice does can be thought as lessons, the sentence \\"Curiosity killed that cat\\" is used in other ways in the story, starting with chasing a rabbit down a tunnle.

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts.

And perhaps it's folly to even try.I grew up with a hard backed copy of Alice in Wonderland and remember going through the pages countless times, gazing at the magnificent pictures--especially the Jabberwock--and giggling at the poetry. \\"Father William\\" and \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" still occupy parts of my brain as snatches and shards that want to pop out at awkward moments.That battle worn, orange backed book, handed down I'm pretty sure from my Dad, and read by him with equal enthusiasm when he was a kid, is long gone, and now that I'm armed with a Kindle I downloaded a copy to enjoy a fine book from my youth. If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself.

Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent. She sang all the songs and chose clever voices; I'm sure she led me to enjoy the book much more than if I had simply read it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"What can be said... much and nothing.

Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her. If you sometimes feel that things are not going your way, you might want to pick this book up. It may work, just like for me and that professor."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"The Modern Library edition is a nice choice for the adult reader, featuring all the wonderful original illustrations (by British political cartoonist John Tenniel), a thoughtful forward by A.S. Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading. AIW and TTLG are must-haves in anyone interested in fantasy/sci-fi, along with Chronicles of Narnia and other great classics."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll. The book itself is not worth your money. The text and margins are very small and do not seem well centered on the page. The font is simple and ugly. The spine of the book is completely white and doesn't have the title of the book or author listed. It may be superficial, but how do you recognize this book on a bookshelf?

My review is about this specific Hallmark Edition book.It's difficult to find a nice hardcover version of both stories complete with the original illustrations. the illustrations are either poor quality, or are reduced in number. This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at. This book is bound nicely and will make a great addition to any library or collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are probably some of the most famous children's books in the English anguage. There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet.

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection)","review":"It's amazing that many people have never read this book. After all, it's virtually impossible to find an American unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and the instantly recognizable illustrations. Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats. This is an adult fable. Carroll invites us into his dream, and we share his fantastic experience through the clarity of a writer's genius.

He wrote this book for his niece (?) but he still weaved in some of his own political beliefs.

In fact, I once tried to read a copy from the 1980's but I couldn't go on with it because the pictures were bothering me. Luckily, there's really only one freaky illustration in the original version, and that's the picture where Alice's neck is very long. It's a bit disturbing.But the book is well written and a good adventure story, too.I love the characters. They're very interesting.\\"'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\\"- \\"The Chesire Cat\\", Alice In Wonderland, by Lewis CarrollCome to think of it, the Chesire cat illustration is actually quite creepy as well. But it's not a big deal or anything.The whole book's just weird fun. Where in the world did Mr. Carroll think of all this? The Mad Hatter? The Queen of Hearts? The Duchess and her pig baby?Alice herself is a considerably strange character.All in all, aside from a couple of creepy illustrations, the book is wonderful.

Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse.
