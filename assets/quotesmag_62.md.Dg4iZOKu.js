I stopped at page 46 because I was concerned it was going to damage my vision. This book has 1,069 pages, so that is an alarming amount of strain on the eyes.I would recommend you check the different versions at a brick and mortar book store before you order a copy from anyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is definitely not a book for the weak at heart.Ms. Rand has a very peculiar philosophy. I was left kinda empty after reading Fountainhead so I turned to this book upon an extremely strong recommendation from my friend. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.The story is quite solid. It has a good viable plot that is logical and believable. Although a good part of the book has characters talking to each other about ideas, it's all good and the vast majority of the talk adds a little intrigue into the book. It's nothing that'll wretch your heart and make you cry or have you tense with excitement, but it'll keep you hooked.Now, I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas that she presents in &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot; However, there are some core truths in the book that I believe all individuals should know, such as the bogusness of relativism. After my initial reading, I read it several more times, focusing more on the philosophical aspect rather than story itself. Although I don't agree with the &quot;virtue of selfishness,&quot; and her avid disagreement to altruism, I must say that it reaffirmed my beliefs in an absolute world.I can safely say that I will probably re-read this book until the pages fall apart and this is one for me to hand down to my kids."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":". . . let's not forget it's also a mystery and a romance. Who is John Galt? And what is he doing (if he's doing anything at all?). Why does it seem as if the entire world's economy is grinding slowly to a halt? Ms. Rand's view of a bleak dystopian future where government intervention in the economy causes further economic misery causes further government intervention, ad infinitum, seems chillingly real. Lord knows it's all too often the case in this world, even in the good ol' USA on occasion (remember the 1970s and &quot;whip inflation now&quot; as though inflation were the individual citizen's fault?).Pick up the book and you'll either get hooked on the strong characters and plotting or you'll be bored. If you're bored, don't sweat it: after all, ATLAS SHRUGGED is nearly four times as long as the average bestseller. But if you like the book and the ideas it contains, you're in good company--Alan Greenspan is an admirer (not a slavish follower, but an admirer) of Ms. Rand's ideas.I ought to mention that in Dagny Taggart, Ms. Rand created an explary feminist heroine, a railroad executive with brains and beauty and metaphorically speaking more *stones* than the guys who serve under her. And this was in 1957!There are many, many reasons ATLAS SHRUGGED is a great book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Like many people, this book changed my life, not only in terms of political philosophy, but in terms of personal identity and direction. On a base level, Atlas Shrugged presents an eloquent mystery with compelling characters in a complex and enticing plot.If you are looking for more than a thrilling story, you are certain to find it in Rand's superb integration of philosophy and fiction. Each line is written with purpose, be it literary, philosophical, or both.All in all, Atlas Shrugged is an uplifting story that asserts the autonomy of the individual from social pressure and rules. If you believe that philosophical and political freedom is of utmost importance, then you should not hesitate to read this book.As many have said, this is a book to be read over and over, with new things to learn and gain each time. The concept of the individual as a hero, a creator, and a thinker is universal and timeless."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Reading Atlas Shrugged is a disturbing experience, because the disaster Rand foresaw is coming to fruition. \\"Business is bad. Wealth is bad. We must distribute the resources evenly.\\" Is it better for everyone to be poor than to allow creative and energetic people to work and reap the rewards?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Despite its popularity, Atlas Shrugged is more a vehicle than a novel and as such it can try a reader's patience. It can captivate, it can challenge, but one recognizes it for what it is: a literary Trojan Horse. Rand wheels in her plots only to employ them as devices to tout her well-honed objectivism, (all well and good, I might add, until the moment the ruse crosses over to redundancy).I sympathize with Rand's views to the extent that they address the temporal, but the evils of socialism are quickly understood. By page 300 I was urging her to get on with it. Further on, however, she turns the corner and Atlas Shrugged finally begins to engage the responsive reader. There is evidence today of what Rand warns against and her didacticism is roundly welcomed.One must ultimately decide what they value in this book - as a novel, I believe it achieves the sobriquet \\"ponderous\\". As a treatise it affected me deeply. While the core tenets of Atlas Shrugged are not unfamiliar, Rand's magnum opus provides intellectual focus. It is a reference point from which one launches assessment of the world at large.Atlas Shrugged survives any criticism as literature because it is a clarion call for individual liberty. One may deny the relative value of its message, but one cannot doubt its influence. It's a novel one wants to rate lower, but one that inexorably demands 5 stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"On March 24, 2009, 'Atlas Shrugged' reached #17 in overall book sales at Amazon.com, and it had been locked up in top fifty for some time.

Want to know what America's future will look like, read this novel today! Everyone needs to know \\"who is John Galt\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It has been over 10 years since I read Atlas. Since reading Atlas for the first time I've undergone experiences and seen places that reinforced the conditions of life described so eloquently in Rand's great mystery novel. At the same time, however, I've experienced situations both first-hand and from a distance that highlight the grayish hues of social justice and, without contemplation, appear to undermine Rand's themes and world view. Through a grueling process of self-realization, I've found myself able to answer the 3 most important questions that I think this book leaves with it's readers:Why does this book affect some people so deeply?- The archetypal characters of Atlas experience the lonliness that all passionate people feel at some point in time in life. One does not have to be a cutting-edge scientist of executive to feel the emotions that men like Hank Reardon feel. Atlas is filled with detailed scenes depicting this brutal lonliness. What makes these scenes memorable is that the characers are self-realizing this painful emotion, and the reasons for it, in the narrative. Those people who cherish this book, I think, do so in large part because it is comforting to know that we are not alone in our dreams and aspirations for the world around us; sometimes events make these items difficult to hold.Who is the more moral man - John Galt or Eddie Willers?- 6 years ago someone asked me this question and I felt dumbfounded. I did not know! Are they not equals? This is a difficult question for one to answer, because, I think, that one cannot honestly answer it without first judging his or herself. This question has come to mean a great deal to me because I think that there is a difference between John Galt and Eddie Willers, and not simply in terms of talent (the obvious difference and superficial basis for comparison). John Galt is the moral man because he takes definitive action. Eddie Willers - it must be said that he does not possess the same talent as Galt - permits his fear of failure to tie him to a world that he does not respect, despite the fact that he sees the morality of the world he cannot release. I am ashamed to say that I aided the U.S. to overthrow the government of a sovereign nation with brute force and disrupt the lives of its population. I know that the threat of violence does not accelerate change, even if it does permit change to occur. I know that it is excruciating not to know how to act when someone makes you choose between the life you know and your sense of honor.Finally, do presence circumstances (Enron, MCI/Worldcom, bank eat bank) post Atlas as an irrelevant piece of American history?- No. Ayn Rand expounds a philosophy in Atlas Shrugged and her speech to USMA \\"Philosophy: Who Needs It\\" - her 2 best works I think - that is communicated through a story. The story has distinct characters, but the social position of these characters in the novel make it deceptive to hastily view todays capitalists through the same lens. While Rand uses the $ sign to symbolize value, it is not dollars themselves that are the currency of men in Gult's Gulch. Instead it is value that is the real currency. Capitslism IS a complete philosophy - and not just an economic system, as children are prone to be taught - exactly because it allows us to assess value in absolute terms, not in currencies which merely reflect value. If you apply this logic - that the true capitalists are those who exchange items of equal value - it seems to me that the real looters of today ARE the proposed capitalists who propose that their only objective is to get cash to their investors (and themselves, of course). What is lacking with this 21st century generation of looters is a sense of direction or pride in the actual fruits of their labor beyond the rewards that show up as big numbers in bank accounts.Atlas Shrugged is a thrilling mystery story and, after one reads it, much like a religious text for those who believe that men can discover truth, even if we must be content, today, to merely stand on the edge of the unknown and hypothesize."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is stunningly direct and wonderfully complete. One of the most impressive aspects of the book is its amazing conceptual integration...not only does the entire book proceed logically from the philosophical premises, but the premises are woven so deftly into the plot that the reader is left with a sense of wonder. How many other books can successfully combine a story of epic proportions with the presentation of the fundamentals of an entire philosophical system?Probably the most common criticisms of the book attack its length and its characters. As for the length, what else does anyone expect from a book dealing with so much material? At least &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; has its phenomenal complexity as the reason behind its length...so many other books are just long for the sake of being long. I hate to even mention it in the same review, but Melville's story &quot;Billy Budd&quot; is only seventy-something pages long, and should have been about ten. &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, which is something like the literary antithesis of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, would have done the world a favor by not being written at all. These are far worse crimes against literary art than the few extraneous speeches found in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. I see the length as a non-issue, unless you are one of those people for whom the value of a book is determined by the number of pages.As for the characters, it always amazes me when people complain about all of Ayn Rand's characters being &quot;one-dimensional&quot;. She writes some of the best minor characters in literary history, and I honestly don't think that's an overstatement. She is at her best when dramatizing a concept by painting it in details. It's amazing how many analogues of real-life people I can find in the more minor characters - Lillian Rearden, Eddie Willers, Cherryl Brooks, Dave Mitchum, Dr. Stadler, the men and women in the train...I could go on and on. These are the characters that really flesh out the book as a whole, and add meaning to the activities of the protagonists.This point has been made many times before, but just for good measure: The main characters are not supposed to be real people! They are philosophical abstractions, not the neighbors next door. They are meant to dramatize philosophical perspectives and concepts. Those who like extremely naturalistic writing will probably find them unidimensional, but extremely naturalistic writing gets old fast. How many times can we read about the couple next door or the old man down the street? How many times must we be subjected to the same overdone plot of boy-meets-girl, with the same overused characters? &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a refreshing change from the relentless redundancy with which literary naturalism assails the modern reader.I will admit, the book can get a little preachy at times. The dissertations on philosophical concepts, such as the meaning of money, are incredible essays in their own right, and I highly recommend them - they just interrupt the flow of the novel. I think Rand was at her best as a fiction writer, so I would have preferred it if she had stuck to fiction in this book, and saved the philosophy for separate publication. The events of the book are all the examples she needed to communicate her philosophy...the essays could have been published separately. But in my opinion, that's really the only major flaw in the novel's structure. And I'll add that the first thing I thought when I was this book was, &quot;That's a great title!&quot;Love it or hate it, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a stunning literary and philosophical achievement. Whether or not you agree with it, it will make you think long and hard, and hopefully you'll follow Fransisco d'Anconia's advice: Check your premises.

The dead on accuracy of her dire predictions will astound you. I couldn't believe it when someone in the book gave the \\"You didn't build it\\" speech!

Some will have you think that because Rand was an atheist, somehow her philosophy is useless and as such you should not waste you time. However, I would argue that there are many movies out there that are directed by, and are stared by known atheists, yet those will still patronize the movies. I am not an atheist, but I respect the freedom of religious choice EVEN when that choice is not to choose at all."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Basically, it's a story about a female top railroad executive, Dagny Taggart, trying to make it in a man's world and coming up against all sorts of barriers, chiefly in the form of her useless, slack-jawed brother, James, who is chairman of the board of the Taggart Transcontinental Railroad. The siblings inherited the massive corporation from their father and, the beautiful but apparently cold, Dagny, Vice President, Operations, is trying to run it according to the principles established by their legendary grandfather, Nat Taggart.But make no mistake about it - this is a very poor novel. Quite why Penguin considers it a \`Modern Classic' is mystifying. Essentially it is purely a vehicle for Rand to push her so-called \`objectivist' philosophical baloney in which each of the \`heroic' god-like characters, merely Rand's mouthpieces, rant for page upon page about her new utopia based on unregulated rampant capitalism in which being kind is considered to be a despicable weakness and a mortal sin: even dear old Robin Hood gets a good kicking for stealing from the rich to give to the \`undeserving' poor rather than the other way around!To say that the characters are one-dimensional is something of an understatement! Those who embody the \`right' principles are described as being \`gaunt', \`erect', \`angular', \`looking as though they were wrought from rock', tanned with golden or coppery coloured hair and naturally, all stunningly attractive and even approach such physical perfection that the \`heroine', Dagny, is so astonished that her ability to rant is temporarily removed! Those who belong to the \`enemy'; either the totally apathetic or \`the Looters', are described as being \`pale', \`puffy' \`portly', \`clammy' or \`bent'.Gradually, society begins to disintegrate and Rand chronicles the transition of America into a socialist state in which those few right-thinking individuals, represented by her god-like captains of industry, gradually disappear from view having scuppered their factories, foundries and offices etc. to prevent them being of use to the \`looters'.A kind of bizarre mixture of 1984, Lost Horizon and any one of John O'Hara's later novels, this poorly written polemic at over 1100 pages does not repay the time required to wade through it. Had it had a more professional editor it might have been worth the effort at 500 pages or so. Those interested in trying Rand's novels would be better advised to start with The Fountainhead.

It is far too long and windy, the characters and pseudoscience are unrealistic, and everything is almost comically black 'n' white.There are some good ideas within, but it's probably not worth your time to wade in and find them. Read Rand's earlier fiction for somewhat better stories, or her nonfiction if you really want to get into her head."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A militant and dogmatic atheist, Rand preached a version of unmitigated individualism and what she called the &quot;Virtue of Selfishness,&quot; an ethic that glorifies egoism and the material gratifications of Economic Man. At her funeral in 1982 an immense dollar sign stood beside her casket, and the characters in her books are always sketching the symbol in the air like early Christians sketching the sign of the cross. For all her hatred of religion, Rand managed to turn herself and her ideas into her own private church, and her intolerance of dissent rivaled that of the Ayatollah Khomeini. One story, about Murray Rothbard, shows how far she carried it and how seriously she took herself. Rothbard one of the world's leading free market economists and libertarian thinkers, was a lifelong agnostic, but his wife, Joey, was and is a Christian. When they were younger, they had some truck with Rand and her circle of worshippers, but then the Great One found out about Joey's faith.Rand gave Joey six months to soak herself in Rand's own screeds against religion. If, at the end of that period, Joey abandoned her beliefs, she and Murray could sign up with the Source of All Truth Herself. If not, Murray would have to divorce Joey, or else they would be exiled to the outer dark. Murray, quite properly, told Rand to go take a flying jump up in the lake (or words to that effect). He kept his wife, and his wife kept her faith, and somehow they managed to live happily without the benefit of Ayn Rand's wisdom.Rothbard was not the only thinker who penetrated Rand's buncombe and saw that she was in fact a dangerous enemy of the very liberty she championed. Whittaker Chambers wrote a withering review of her novel Atlas Shrugged in National Review. Calling it a &quot;ferro-concrete fairy tale,&quot; Chambers noticed that despite &quot;the impromptu and surprisingly gymnastic matings of the heroine and three of the heroes,&quot; no children ever seem to result. &quot;The strenuously sterile world of Atlas Shrugged,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is scarcely a place for children.&quot;Actually it could be argued that there are nothing but children in her novels. The Post story quotes one of her major heroes, Howard Roark, in The Fountainhead: &quot;This country,&quot; he intones, &quot;was not based on selfless service, sacrifice, renunciation or any precept of altruism. It was based on man's right to the pursuit of happiness. His own happiness. Not anyone else's.&quot; Really?It is typical of Rand and her self-obsessed followers that they conveniently ignore every sacrifice on which this and every other human society is based -- men who die in wars, women who die in childbirth, parents who do without so their children may prosper, leaders who surrender privacy and wealth for service, and whole communities that stand together against a common enemy. Men who died at Valley Forge and the Alamo, with a courtesy unknown to the Virtue of Selfishness, would have politely asked Ayn Rand to take her false and solemn platitudes somewhere else."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have taken some time on collecting my thoughts after reading this book. It took me quite some time to read, for simple disdain, but I decided to give Ayn Rand her due attention and stay 'objective' through my reading of this work. Yet time has done nothing to change my opinion that this is by far the most overrated book American literature has ever spawned. It would be expected for a first novel to wear its politics on its sleeve, as it were. It is expected for the themes, topics and ideas of a first novel to be blunted. This is why Fountainhead is so forgiveable as a novel. That work is a romance story with the heavy handed themes of Rand, but it is to be expected as a first novel. However, Atlas Shrugged takes these themes, blunts all sharp edges until the work strikes with the subtlty and finese of a Gallagher act. This novel transcends heavy handed into the realm of pure propoganda for Ms Rand's philosophy. The work is completely inseperable from her philosophy to the point that this might as well be the manual. This makes for very poor literature, as literature with such overtly obvious aims lacks the ambiguity and openness that writing literature requires. Great novels allow for the reader to form their own views, Ms Rand is not prepared to let her readers have the same freedom. I understand that she was meaning to write such a work that explains her philosophy, but this work is tantamount to the 'white telephone' films of faccist Italy. This work could not be more black-and-white, allowing for no shades of complexity by offering us characters who are either support her claims and thus are flawless in their righteousness and the other characters who go against her ideas and thus are moronic, shallow and asinine as human beings. She isn't making an argument, she is shoving her opinions so far down her readers throat that vomiting is nearly impossible to avoid unless you swallow her words without even the slightest questioning. This work is popular because it strokes the collective human ego and feeds the narcissism of the most shallow and vain people imaginable who have a vested interest in feeling like the romantic figures they are not. For others it compensates a massive inferiority complex by telling them that they are in fact superior. The main problem I have with this work, as I said before, is that it cannot be engaged without engaging her philosophy. This is a problem because her philosophy is completely void of anything resembling intelligence and, most certainly, wisdom (I use this reference because philosophy means the love of wisdom). Objectivism is the most poor excuse for philosophy this country has ever stumbled upon. First of all, her creating a name for her philosophy as if she penned something new and unique is so unbelievably pretensious. Beyond this, her creation of this school of thought is erroneous in the conception that it is original. There is nothing about Objectivism that is new, unique, different, original or even slightly adds or changes anything to philosophy. Everything, and I mean everything, she ever wrote philosophically has been written before and much better I might add. The belief that everyone is free to their own will and that there is an objective nature to everything was so used by the time Rand rolled around that it is laughable to anyone with an education that she had the audacity to believe she created something at all. The problem is also that her philosophical structure cannot stand on its own weight. The belief in objective reality, for instance, inherently contradicts and does not work in anyway with the belief in the absolute freedom of the individual. Objectivism is sickeningly overwrought, as the dumbing down of thousands of years of philosophy, slapped together in an incoherrent babble. Given the philosophy that was taking root in Rand's time, this reversion to an extraordinarily obsolete school of thought, is certainly ridiculous. I can sum all of this up by saying that these are only a few of the reasons why Objectivism has never been taken seriously and never taught in any institution outside of the Ayn Rand institute. That this work cannot be taken without regarding her philosophy makes the work sterile and dead, without purpose. This work, in all areas it wishes to influence is futile and flat. There is no point in reading this work. Absolutely none. It is tragic that such a pointless work should be so long. In a couple thousand pages this work has added nothing to philosophy or literature and even attempts to set both back by over a thousand years. She was thankfully unsuccessful in convincing anyone she was right ouside the most idiotic of Reaganites and the most insecure people who need propoganda to feel better about themselves. It will not be long before she is forgotten and this work fails to live on. For now our civilization will have to wait until the most overrated work it created fades away into laughable obscurity. I envy the future generations who do not have someone tell them they should read this work or sit behind some nitwit in traffic that has a beat-up Ford with a bumper sticker reading Who is John Galt. Lucky folks indeed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having looked at some so-called \`100 all-time favorite books' list recently, I was surprised to see that Ayn Rand had four books in the top five positions.Having read her \`big four' (Anthem; We the living; The Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged), I have to say that I am no fan of Rand. She comes over as nothing less than an ideological propagandist; rabidly opposed to any sort of mutual assistance or social co-operation whatsoever; banging on, ad nauseum, with her relentless, one dimensional support for arch capitalism.Having come from a privileged \`White' Russian family that was dispossessed by the \`Reds' and having lived her formative years in her native Russia, through years of civil war and, ultimately, revolution, one can see just how her bigoted point of view was formed. However, this bias is also her downfall as an author.She may have called her pseudo-philosophy \`objectivism', but her point of view is never objective.Rand is an extremist in the true sense of the word, to the extent that it has clouded her ability to judge rationally, and led her to a basic misunderstanding of exactly what she was fighting against. As her publisher, Macmillan, stated when rejecting her manuscript for \`Anthem'- \\"The author does not understand Socialism.\\"While Rand's descriptive ability is usually quite wonderful, at times even poetic, her plot devices are pedantic and overly contrived. In \`Atlas Shrugged', for instance, she builds for us a growing socio-economic crisis of Alice-in-Wonderland type proportions, that results in a plot that has more holes in it than a Swiss cheese: The \`good' characters are without exception, pure, noble and unflinching \`Gods'; the \`bad' players conversely, are all, without fail, spineless, conniving, maggots.There is an underlying lack of credibility throughout the entire plot which grows exponentially more fantastic with each and every new and absurd revelation. Firstly, every single one of the noble characters is a captain of their respective industries: Coal; Steel; Automobiles; Railways; Oil; Mining etc....no carpet shampoo manufacturers or 5-and-dime store empires for them! Secondly, amazing coincidences abound: without exception, every single one of these industrial tycoons went to the exact same university. Amusingly, all the other countries on the planet are socialist nations, although, to be fair, Canada isn't even mentioned.The story line continuously beggars belief with its superlative relevations and insights: For instance, our heroine, Dagny Taggart, is so presciently gifted that having glanced at a lump of metal in a disused factory she immediately recognizes it to be a futuristic engine that will eventually save the world, even though it is half buried in the dirt, and half the components are missing! We are further dazzled by the tale of the exploits of Ms. Taggart's grandfather who once \`hocked' his wife for a million dollars and repaid it in the nick of time. Yet another industrialist, Francisco D'Anconia's ancestor \`threw a glass of wine in the face of the Lord of the Spanish Inquisition' and then fled, leaving behind a marble palace, his fortune and his girl. As a kid Francisco D'Anconia himself hit a home run at his first ever attempt; The Taggart's and D'Anconia's were neighbors and played together as kids. There is also a mysterious pirate called Ragnar Danneskjold, who steals every critical shipment of goods that is needed anywhere in the world. It appears there is no navy or coast guard or air force to stop him, or even see him. There is also constant mention of a man called John Galt whom everyone seems to know wonderful true stories about, but who disappeared 12 years previously, threatening to \`stop the motor of the world'....Galt, Danneskjold and D'Anconia all went to university together....the same university as everyone else!! Later on it transpires that the Galt character who the baddies are frantically hunting for, is an ordinary employee of Dagney Taggart's corporation, Taggart Transcontinental and has lived in the same apartment with his name on the door for the past 12 years. He even eats in the cafeteria and chats to Dagny Taggart's right hand man at lunch....and still nobody can locate him!The coincidences come in so thick and fast that the whole plot becomes overly predictable. In fact only one third of the way through the novel I successfully guessed the entire outcome, with one minor detail awry. (a hidden valley in Colorado instead of an uninhabited island)What Rand is so obviously trying to achieve is to demonstrate the wickedness and unworkableness of socialism. However, she embellishes to such an extent that she overcooks the whole pudding. She finally pops the souffle herself, by having one of the chief stooges, a Dr. Ferris, admit to our hero Hank Reardon, that what the industrialists have been fighting against (pointless, limiting laws that the Machiavellian politicians of Washington have been passing) is not communism at all, but the underbelly of capitalism: gangsterism. Ferris admits that, when the industrialists break the law, as Washington knows they must, that they will then simply be able to blackmail them into compliance.Not so much Engles then, as Capone!This is the point where Rand throws the baby out with the bath water, and confirms Macmillan's opinion about her.If Rand really understood socialism she would have known that she actually shared an aim of Socialism: a stateless society. Capitalism on the other hand, will always need to have most of the very infrastructure that she so overtly loathes, as under Capitalism, unlike Socialism, there will still be individual nations trading with each other, and using money as a means of exchange. If there were no such thing as the State, how would international treaties be formulated; national boundaries guarded; private interests protected; trade monitored; crime prevented or detected; jails run etc etc?A final nail in Rand's coffin comes when Dagny Taggart is discussing the society that all the tycoons have created for themselves in the secret and hidden valley in Colorado, a type of society that Ms. Rand is so obviously extolling the virtues of. Dagney Taggart asks The ex-oil mogul, and now potato farmer, Ellis Wyatt \\"Where is your market?\\" He replies \\"I now work for use not profit!\\" This of course is a central tenet of socialism, the very system Rand purports to hate! Other revelatory gems from inhabitants of this cloistered world also demonstrate the philosophy that Rand obviously admired- A Dr. Hendricks announces that he has found a cure for aneurisms or embolisms, and yet ...\\"not a word of my method will be heard outside\\" (our valley). A famous composer concurs, in regard to his latest music. As John Galt puts it \\"We're on strike!\\"What, if anything, was she thinking when she wrote that?Rand was a bigoted, elitist snob, whose narrow focus and ignorance, underpinned by her traumatic early life, evolved her into little more than a fascist. Her paranoia was a product of the times however, indeed her most famous work was published at the height of the McCarthy witch-hunt. It's a pity that so many people should have fallen for Rand's particular brand of hysteria; but not surprising that so many conservatives today continue to admire her shabby and third-rate works."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was always curious to read Ayn Rand because I know she has had a powerful influence on many successful people. Now I can't comment on her philosophy because in all fairness I didn't read the entire novel. In fact I gave up on about page 200. I got a sense of what her philosphy is, and I was somewhat drawn to it. Her writing, however, I found to be atrocious. Where the heck was her editor? And here's a handy rule of thumb: anytime you come across characters named Dagny, Francisco and Orren, run, don't walk to the exit."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"No really, I would.Since this is a mostly a novel (though such classifications can be at best marginal concerning this &quot;stellar&quot; work) I shall adopt the stance of Wilde: that morals and philosophy do not matter in relation to the writer's skill.And it sure would be nice if Rand had some of that skill. The plot was simplistic, and you can tell she spent too much time in Russia because the book is one uninteresting mound of propaganda. I have come up with more character development in my wet dreams, and the whole world she painted had this sickening feeling of fakeness.Rand's objectivism is an absurdity that results from capitalist philosophy. Her system might be applicable if everyone in society could be perfectly good and perfectly retched at the same time.With all the absurdity and trash I was unable to finish the book (the place I ended was about in the middle of the final speech which would be best called &quot;Requiem of a Brain&quot;); with all of this trash I understand why one would stop the world from spinning because really... what's the point?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Disclaimer: (I would have liked to give this a 2.5 star rating, but since that was not an option, keeping in mind that reading is never bad I went ahead and gave it 3 stars)...One the things that Rand does manage to accomplish in this book is to have the reader reflect upon their own personal convictions and think seriously about them. In the sense that the book instigates such an intellectual journey, it is not a bad start. In terms of fictional stylism, this book truly deserves mixed reviews. Compared to characters in any serious work of fiction Rand's characters are one-sided, shallow, and dull. Rand does a horrible job trying to portray any living human being - even Rand herself and other objectivists have lead far more complicated and intricate lives than those of the characters, and Rand seems woefully ignorant of this thing called &quot;life&quot; out of which other competent authors design their characters. However, her use of imagery and descriptive writing is superb. The mental pictures she paints are almost crystal, clarion clear. The plot is intriguing and fun to follow, until about 3/4 of the way through after which it simply becomes ridiculous. There is no obscurity, however, about her central message, and the clarity of the theme does not really interfere with the other elements of the work, except perhaps characterization. Furthermore, I have no hesitation in cautioning readers against being carried away by her flawed philosophical arguments. On a superficial and quick reading, the arguments Ayn Rand presents in her self-proclaimed &quot;philosophical&quot; system are very intriguing. For example, consider the title of a chapter &quot;A is A.&quot; However, in the spirit of philosophical inquiry, when one inquires what sort of justification Rand has for this, she simply says that this is &quot;true&quot; and appeals to a sense of self-evidence. However, the appeal to &quot;self-evidence&quot; is simply inexcusable. For when we say something is &quot;self-evident,&quot; that does not mean it is in some sense &quot;absolutely true&quot; - it only means that we, for whatever reason, strongly believe it to be &quot;absolutely true.&quot; Excuse the philosophical jargon, but what Rand does is try to provide a phenomonological justification for the foundations of the &quot;rationalism&quot; of Descartes&amp;co. In some sense, she wishes us to believe that &quot;A is A&quot; is an &quot;encounter&quot; with some sort of &quot;truth&quot; that is in some sense &quot;out there&quot; independent of human consciousness of it. This borders on Platonism, which Rand herself vehemently denounces. But the &quot;immediacy of encounter with the 'truth'&quot; for Rand (a phenomenological act) is the sole source of justification (which, by the way, is not made very explicit in this book) for her statement &quot;A is A.&quot; Of course, modern symbolic/mathematical logic has also accepted this premise. However, symbolic logic has accepted it as an &quot;axiom,&quot; that is, a statement &quot;true&quot; by definition. There is a not-so-subtle distinction between an axiom and a vague, philosophically meaningless &quot;sense of truth&quot; that Rand advocates for its justification. Furthermore, the statement that &quot;reason is the grounds for epistemology&quot; is simply absurd. First of all, by &quot;reason&quot; let us understand this as the study of &quot;implications,&quot; hence making it a &quot;subset&quot; of logic in terms of its objection. Aristotle, along with his medieval worshippers, one of the most INCOMPETENT philosophers ever (read the first sentence of the Nicomachean Ethics, or go check out my review on that work), also believed logic's greatest value to be epistemological. It is (in my opinion) for this reason that he never progressed beyond the rudimentary syllogism. It is not worthless, epistemologically speaking, and rational thought is a foundation of knowledge, but it is not the only foundation. While this works very well in a universe that is composed exclusively of valid (I.E. truth of a conditional under all &quot;interpretations,&quot; e.g. &quot;if p, then p&quot;) statements and invalid statements, it fails miserably in a universe such as our own that is composed mostly of consistent statements (e.g. if p, then (p and q), which is false if q is false, but is true if q is true or p is false). For example, if I say that if I take an umbrella out today, then I take an umbrella out and I will be dry. This may come out true...I may block myself from rain, or it may not even be raining. However, it is still conceivable that I will be pushed into the ocean and get wet. Hence, the truthfullness of this statement is &quot;consistent&quot; - it could be false or it could be true. In this case, logic alone fails to provide anysort of truth value to this statement. However, because the statement itself can conceivably be true and false, it is not a meaningless statement. It is out of such shaky foundations that Rand constructs a system of political and ethical prescriptions. However, the real problem with the work is in her line of reasoning. We may accept her self-described &quot;metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical 'systems,'&quot; but even granting her this much there are philosophers who have used her starting points and arrived at arguments for democratic socialism (Adler's &quot;Four Dimensions of Philosophy&quot; is an excellent contrast to Rand's line of &quot;reasoning&quot;). Far from being the works of incompetent moocher academicians, such thinkers as Adler present coherent, well argued conclusions that help illuminate the limitations of Rand's personal attempts at constructing a system of thought. In conclusion, I ask that the reader seriously think about Rand's reasoning and her premises. Her writing may sway you to be persuaded, and her imagery will surely make an impression on you. However, her actual &quot;philosophical statements&quot; are objectionable at best and at worst simply wrong."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is just amazing how stupid this book is! This book was such a waste of time. It is very hard too believe that so many people talk about this junk as some kind a great work -it isn't. I think that so many people love this book because it is a call for \\"greatness\\" to someone that has an elite/better then you are mindset. It is also a call to \\"worship\\" for people that are selfish. Now they have a tool to re-enforce their childish/high school like thought process. As a novel the book is very bad. I had a very hard time understanding the actions of the \\"hero's\\" in the story. The characters are nothing but cardboard \\"personas\\" used to sell the silly \\"Philosophy\\" of the author. The really funny thing was that I had a hard time remembering who was speaking because most of the characters talked alike. But it really wasn't talking but mindless retarded speech. There was no type of real character development. The \\"good guys\\" were all the same (and saving the world from chaos) and the \\"bad guys\\" were all the same mindless parasites living off the hero's. The novel was developed around Ayn Rand's warped view of life. It isn't philosophy. The readers that thank of this thrash as such never read or studied real philosophy. To her all issues were black and white. What kind of thinking is that? The answer is cult thinking. The novel read like something written by a middle school kid with no real understanding of how complex real people are. I had a very hard time caring for the characters because they acted like something from Star Trek with their unreal and social behavior problems. But I guess it adds up. Ayn Rand was very hard too get alone with in her life because she was not willing to see other viewpoints as intelligent. Part of her main problem was that she had issues with understanding real people and real social problems. Unlike books where I look forward to the next chapter in excitement, here I was looking for the next chapter hoping the book would get better - it didn't. But I did get worse - starting with John Galt's speech. I believe that Atlas is so bad because it was developed around her so called \\"philosophy\\" / cult. Ms. Rand's book lacks ANY real world issues. What you will find in her book is an escape to a silly alternate world that has no kind of reflection on the real world. Is this her only method for making her junk philosophy work? It is not mature enough to address real world problems and reach any real solutions? Therefore the child like solution that is reached in the novel calls for the \\"Atlas\\" or movers of the world to stop living in one place and go live in a utopia that is run by Ayn Rand's (CMNO) Chief Mind Numbing Officer John Galt?! Wow- what a smart person Ayn Rand was. For the teenagers that think Ayn Rand is so great, I ask you: Why is she not taken seriously in the academic world (philosophy or literature)? The answer is because her work is bad. Most people in good mental health would never think that someone like this would have any real good answer for human affairs. Writing a book about an alternate world run by freaks of nature which doesn't even come close to the real world is not amazing-but proof of her failure.Can some one please tell me how being selfish is going to make the world a better place?Can someone please tell me how unlimited, untouched capitalism can make the world a better place?Ayn Rand couldn't because she had a great disconnect with reality."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The \\"Essentials of Objectivism\\" are neatly summarized on page 1074 and 1075, study these two pages and you will have a good idea where Ayn Rand stands.

But the reality is that for over a hundred years before Atlas Shrugged was written, anarchists like Peter Kropotkin, Mikhail Bakunin, Errico Malatesta, Max Stirner and others were affirming that the rights of the individul were paramount, and that even capitalists were oppressing people, not just government. This fact was lost to Rand, who saw a Bolshevik under every bed. Rather than be drawn in to the Ayn rand cult, read a book by Kropotkin, Proudhon, or even Noam Chomsky."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ATLAS SHRUGGED is Ayn Rand's new Torah, with John Galt in the role of liberator/lawgiver Moshe and Ayn Rand herself as the Moshiach ushering in Olam ha-Ba. Her 'G-d' is a Moloch named 'objective reality' - an objectivised version of her own tastes and whims which nevertheless announces itself as 'A is A' ('I am what I am'). The thirty-six (count them) inhabitants of 'Galt's Gulch' are her version of the Talmud's lamedvovniks: the 36 righteous people in each generation for whose sake the world is sustained.Rand herself is uncannily reminiscent of Shabbatai Tzvi, an earlier Messianic contender who was also insane and was popularised by an earlier Nathan (Nathan of Gaza rather than Nathan Blumenthal/Nathaniel Branden) who interpreted that insanity as a sign of divine inspiration. Like Shabbatai Tzvi, who claimed the authority to permit the forbidden, Rand engaged in an adulterous sexual relationship with the much younger Branden for many years and defended it on the Nietzschean ground that the usual rules of morality did not apply to 'giants' like her.These similarities are generally not mentioned because we are supposed to pretend we don't notice that her widest appeal is to disaffected, intellectual, secular Jews.Whether you believe in G-d or not, be wary of this secular cult and its new Torah.

Those who disagree with communism are cleary not open minded.&quot;Now substitute Rand for Marx and note that you have an &quot;Objectivist&quot; argument.

For a person that abhors mediocrity, Ayn Rand certainly has done a good job of making a mediocre book.In Atlas Shrugged, the characters appear as two dimensional at best and as afterthoughts at worst. The prose will have you screaming in your sleep (If I never again see the words: \\"...this was the only tribute he/she/they could offer\\" I will die a happy man). The plot will have you rolling with laughter. And the contradictions will cause your brain to explode.From beginning to end the book feels \\"rigged\\" to get just the outcome that Ayn Rand wants, not because it is the logical outcome of the events, but because she desperately wants it to be. Since, through the text, one can infer that Rand cares nothing for the opinions of others, we can only suppose that she is doing this to further her own self-delusion.The philosophy, while an interesting counter argument to socialism, would have been better served being presented in a straightforward manner instead of the intellectual masturbation that Atlas Shrugged becomes.The books only saving grace comes in the form of Hank Rearden. His is the only three dimensional character in the book, and hence the only story that is believable or inspiring in the least. Had Rand focused more on this character instead of Dagny, she would have had all of the elements to create a classic. As it stands, however, all that she has created is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read, not because the writing is poor, but because the viewpoints expressed are thinly vieled arguments for classism and social darwinism. Don't beleive me? Try this sentence:\\"I will treat you as I would treat a bum... I will beat you\\"(I was going to quote the page, but I forgot that I threw out the book)This book is based loosely; very very loosely, on the depression of the 1920's. Her book claims that this event was caused primarily by government inerference with business. While these hardworking businessmen are full of hope and foresight, the rest of the world falls by their wayside. Their is nothing wrong with expressing your viewpoint, and thoughtful revealing the problems with your own ideals before brining them to audiences; however this is not apparent in Ayn Raynd. Unlike Orwellian works, or \\"Brave new World\\", her villains never have an argument, and cannot support their ideas. They are mindless quibles who nervously about, running from hereos. As such, her words come out like gospel beause she allows nothing to challenge them. To mind spring other names of people who fought against challenges to their ideals: Joseph McCarthy, Joseph Stalin, and Adolf Hitler.I feel bad for Ayn Rand, and for the horrors she must have witnessed in Communist Russia. However, the problems we faced (and still face) in America come from more corporate scandal then from governmental vampirism, although that is present as well. Look at today's headlines, read up on the 1920's where corporations lied about business products, and kept workers in poor dangerous working conditions because it turned a profit. Example: sausage producing factories were so dangerous, that workers occassionally fill into the vats while they were running, and were immediately ground up and sold..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the worst thing I've ever read.

You can find similar writing all over the internet, usually with the same heroes, called Mary Sues. I don't think you could find a better comparison, except maybe the Bible. This is 1000+ pages of adolescent power fantasy, only interrupted by the sort of lecturing too hokey for the Troy Mclure videos shown on The Simpsons:\\"And you see Dagny, we use only silver and gold as currency because shiny things are inherently valuable.\\"\\"Golly, John! I always thought value was a subjective quality assigned by the observer?\\"\\"Haha!

Little did I know what I was getting into.Rand seriously messed up an interesting storyline with all of her political rantings and speeches. The mystery and suspense were really exciting for awhile, but as the book kept going and going, it really began to drag. I began skimming over the ten page speeches that the characters would say to each other in face to face conversation as it was the same old drivel over and over and over and over. No one talks like that in real life. Are you really going to sit down with one of your friends and talk at them for an hour without feedback? If you make it towards the end of the book, your in for a real treat... a sixty page speech over the radio. Us poor readers are meant to believe that everyone in the nation stopped what they were doing and listened to the droning mind-numbing drivel being drilled into their heads.If people choose to believe Rand's political philosophy, thats fine. However, she can't even seem to be consistent within her own book. Galt and company are sick of working to support the masses and leave. Big deal. However, in their new 'utopia' Galt's machine runs the whole enterprise. Without him, there would be no 'utopia'. So basically he's back where he started; just supporting a smaller group of people.Overall, the interesting premise failed because of Rand's insistance that EVERY action and EVERY idea falls into a black and white issue with no middle ground. A real editor might have helped her get her story straight (and 800 pages shorter), but as it stands, Atlas Shrugged is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Wow, Ayn Rand has finally solved all of our dilemmas, and, at the same time, has fooled millions into thinking they did it themselves. Atlas Shrugged has been geared to a certain audience, and has gained success in that audience. I keep reading how &quot;thought-provoking&quot; this novel is...yes, indeed, if &quot;thought-provoking&quot; means guiding readers, in a very partial and deceiving manner, to think that &quot;reason&quot; is what is written on its pages. there is no &quot;justice&quot; in her writing, at least true justice, because it is so partial. I felt like i was reading the transcripts to some political talk-show host - in a very bad guise of entertaining fiction. There is no reason in this writing, that is true reason. In one dialogue, where Hank Rearden is talking to his mother about his defunct brother, the language is so suggestive, it may lead readers to believe that the &quot;reason&quot; it represents actually exists. Where the mother (so out of voice for any &quot;real&quot; character) complains that Mr. Rearden has no concern for his brother's &quot;spirituality&quot; and only &quot;cares about profits&quot; by claiming that Mr. Rearden only cares about &quot;justice.&quot; &quot;Reason,&quot; at this point, escapes me. I felt like i was on jury duty again, listening to some lawyers underestimate my intelligence. This writing is a regurgitation of all of the imperialistic qualities of the great American Dream. THere is nothing new, nor profound. This book appeals to the American idealism. We are told by Ayn Rand's prophetic words that we all have the opportunity and the freedom to realize our brilliance adn should, and will, not be held back by anything or anybody, including our &quot;looter[]&quot; family we may have been so unfortunate to be born into. We, as brilliant people, can overcome this. This sounds very much like a &quot;brilliant&quot; religious philosophy, or a movement of free-thinkers? hummm. This book is intolerant, and, again, suggestive. It is very simple in its analysis of the truth that writers and philosophers all over the world have been looking for, for centuries. To keep reading, over and over, how Ayn Rand has &quot;told me,&quot; ruins any reasonable explanation to why this book really is about thinking for yourself. But, if you like it, that's fine...just don't shove it down our throats."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The objectivism of Ayn Rand gets one star, this book as a romance novel gets five, add them together and divide by two. As a romance novel, the book is sweeping, weaving together love, romance, big industry, mystery, and finishing with a heavenly Utopia. A must read.Yet one must never forget that this is a fantasy tale, describing a perfect society that this nation tried out in the 19th century and discovered to be a nightmare. R%and is a survivor of the Soviet Revolution of 1917, so her opinions are understandable. She forgets that it was the very laissez faire society she describes that resulted in that revolution and the horrors that followed.The primary fault of objectivism is that it starts out just as is says: objective, meaning that there is a real world out there and we can perceive it. It's fault is that it quickly devolves into a metaphysical fantasy where the value of gold is absolute and property rights a natural law. I won't even get into a discussion as to whether an element of the Periodic Table has an absolute divine value, but let's talk about property rights. The sad objective fact is that no one owns any property any further than the social environment says he does. Ownership is not a quality of the owner, but a quality of the society around him insofar as his ownership is recognized. That is a simple fact of natural law.We could cry out that a man deserves and owns the product of his labor, but who did the labor? Does a slave own the cotton he picks, or the slave owner? Does a wage slave own the rail he lays down or does the railroad company? The answer is that ownership goes to whomever the society says it belongs to. Yet it goes further than that, because even the society has no say in it if it cannot protect itself by force of arms. It's astounding to me that this nation's don't want to pay taxes while the working class military is out there defending their property rights by force of arms.So, Ayn Rand gives us a novel wherein the best and brightest \\"go on strike.\\" Perhaps we could have a sequel with this plot: A communist army invades the US and captures Reardon Steel and Taggart Transcontinental, nationalizing them in the name of the Revolution. Hank and Dagney escape with their workforce to a remote valley in Colorado to assemble their laborers into a great army to repel the invaders. Unfortunately, Dagney and Hank treated their workers like crap and only paid them 25 cents a day, so they go on strike and walk off, leaving the mighty industrialist pair with a couple of water pistols to defend their \\"property rights.\\"The title: Mars Shrugged"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have an old paperback copy of this book and have read it several times.

Rand offers no psycholigical insight into the heroes of the story, and doesn't even go into the mindset of the antagonists. The characters in Atlas shrugged are absent of any foibles and most closely resemble the princes and princess' of some hackneyed fairy tale.Also, because this polemic novel suggests to outline an objective morality based on laissez-faire capitalism it tends to drift into an incessantly didactic tone. This is especially evident in the middle-end of this prolix book when the voluble messianic pantheon, John Galt, recites his pleonastic spiel over and over again.What saves this tautological pablum from falling into the abyss is the simple fact that it does indeed provide a thorough introduction into libertarian ideology, but at the same time a 1000+ pg. novel serves as a very inefficient vehicle for that quite interesting trip.Read this book if you enjoy long, straightforward, and uncomplicated epics that expound theories that you would not have otherwise read about in a non-fiction format or if you are already familiar with libertarianism and are interested in seeing a battle to the death between laissez-faire capitlism and statism. Otherwise, for anyone else simply interested in libertrianism and received recommendations for Atlas Shrugged I would rather recommend that you read F.A. Hayek's \\"The Road to Serfdom\\", Thomas Sowell's \\"Basic Economics\\" (for the economics side of it all), \\"The Libertarian Reader\\" by David Boaz, or \\"What It Means to Be a Libertarian\\" by Charles Murray -- all good."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Propoganda...not quite. Atlas Shrugged is simply a fictional book promulgating a principle: man's self-reliance. It was written as an entertaining act of defiance against society's increasing glorification of a parasitic life style. As do all fictional novels, it has a moral intwined in the plot. The theme is ayn rand's philosophy. The reason Mr. Ganesan has reacted so belligerently to this novel is that it does not advocate some \\"share with your neighbor\\" idiom so commonly found in novels. It advocates a philosophy grounded in reality, which does not attempt to create a utopia, but a free, individualistic, moral society. Now, Mr. Ganesan may have trouble comprehending the implications of this, it may actually imply the desocialization of the American economy. People may have to get off their Butt's and work a little bit.As for the accusation that Ms. Rand spreads her philosophy by propaganda and not by the merits of her philosophy, what were you thinking, or not thinking. I must have forgotten how exemplifying a philosophy through a believable situation and believable characters and creating a plausible outcome is propaganda, not just a method of proving her point. Now i do not have time to recognize the blatant fallacy of the rest of Mr. Ganesan's arguments, but rest assure one can happily disregard them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A book that begins with great promise but descends into repetitive blather. Rand's philosophies are rigid and severe, but what's worse is how she beats you over the head with them. Suffers from a complete lack of editing. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"(...)like nietzsche, who unlike ayn rand i admire somewhat, she mistakes ALL morality as herd instinct and falsehood, and on this point they are both simply wrong. it is true that some morality is based in weakness and unhealthy emotions, but the faculty of sympathy and compassion in man is what makes him great and genuinely human, along with his intellect and imagination. anyone who is half decent will find this woman's so called \\"philosophy\\" chilling and disgusting. what can one say about a person, no matter how bright or literate, who actively campaigns against pity and concern for others? even when i was 15, not the most mature or well informed age for anyone, i realized after about three chapters that this lady had no aesthetic sensibility, no actual talent as a writer, and absolutely no capacity to entertain and hold the reader's attention. her characters are so cardboard that you expect them to fall over, and wish that they would so it would end the book. it is pure didacticism, but not interesting didacticism, just labored and pretentious. she made it her mission to root out and destroy all feelings of love between man and man, although in this as in everything else she failed miserably. but nonetheless we should despise her for corrupting impressionable and naive students of philosophy and literature everywhere. artists and thinkers should be able to recognize this kind of philosophy for what it is, truly evil and poisonous ethical relativism which, whether they know or not and whether they admit it or not, leads the horrifying motto of dostoevsky's ivan karamazov, \\"anything is permitted!\\" i would class her less with the serious, relevant and sensitive philosophers of the twentieth century, and put her more in the category of someone like max stirner or aleister crowley (the crucial difference being that while they are clearly depraved and utterly misguided, i can actually read and enjoy their work). if there was a satan (i am an atheist) spawned philosopher to inhabit the world, it would not be anton lavey, it would undoubtedly be ayn rand. (...)i may not believe in a controlling factor in the universe and i openly admit that there are no 'values in themselves', but i am hardly for this reason going to run with it and formulate a philosophy of egoism and hatred of the other. her notoriety and reputation as being a ground breaking writer is false to the point of madness, and her cult of objectivism will get weaker and weaker and eventually die out completely. put this down and 'shrug' it off."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is painfully long, so do not start if you do not have plenty of time to devote to reading.

Atlas Shrugged is neither the best book ever written nor the worst. Now that I've alienated 99% of you, let me give you my opinion of the book.Ayn Rand is without a doubt the century's most effective popularizer of the political philosophy now known as libertarianism. In Atlas Shrugged, she eloquently makes the case for the individual as the fundamental unit of society, for reality and reason as the individual's guide, and for capitalism as both effective and moral, based as it is on freedom rather than coercion. The morality of capitalism is too often lost on utilitarian libertarians.Rand also deftly skewers such collectivist twaddle as the notion that a need gives rise to a claim and that Truth with a big T is whatever fluffy-bunny emotionalism says it is. I had to laugh when she had characters like Jim Taggart talk about &quot;destructive competition&quot; that was destructive only of incompetent ninnies like him.Also, if Atlas Shrugged is so unrealistic, why do collectivist politicians so often act it out? If her villains are so unrealistic, why do I live in a metropolitan area of 4.6 million Lillian Reardens?The book is not perfect by a long shot. A good chunk of what Rand took 1,100 pages to say, Kurt Vonnegut said in three pages in &quot;Harrison Bergeron.&quot; Her heroes, unlike her villains, are totally unrealistic; she would have done well to relate her ideas more to everyday people and less to some council of superheroes. For someone who talked so much about fulfilling one's commitments, Rand treats adultery cavalierly in her books (as she did in her life).Still, the virtues of Atlas Shrugged greatly outweigh its vices, and it belongs on every thinking person's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am not an Objectivism fanatic. I do not follow Ayn Rand's philosophies, but I believe this is a very important book, especially in our policital times.This is one of my favorite, all-time books. I think that Ms. Rand brings to light some very important issues. I do not hate the world or society, as some others suggest fans of this book do. I think this book was written as a warning. A warning from someone who was not born into the American way, so can compare it to something else. A warning from someone who does not take America, and all it has to offer, for granted. I think that is one of the best points she makes... America and the American way SHOULD NOT be taken for granted.We are quickly moving toward more of a Socialistic society and away from a Capitalistic society. Ms. Rand saw this coming 50 years ago. The more we move away from individual freedom towards everyone being equal, the more true her story becomes.The bottom line is, whether you agree with Ms. Rand or not, it is a book that makes you stop and think. Our current society needs to take the time to stop and think and stop all of our knee-jerk reactions. It may be a little dated in some of its details, but those details are superfluous and do not mar the underlying issues."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It took a Russian woman to write a novel on the attributes of free market capitalism! This work explains why no socialist state has ever or will ever in the history of man accomplish greatness. The reader must at the end of the novel come to an understanding as to why the United States has so dramatically excelled beyond all other nations past or present. Miss Rand lived the horrors of the Soviet Socialist Republic. Her's is a voice of authority.

At the same time, it is a fast-paced mystery-adventure, with quite a lot of humor (which is hidden between the lines until one reads the book a second time). The protagonists are not people one would meet everyday, which is one of Atlas' virtues, rather, the characters are the sort of people one would wish to meet at least once in one's life. Rand's heroes were unabashedly heroic.Atlas, despite being an exciting read on the level of an adventure, is more fundamentally a book about ideas. These ideas are introduced not as floating, imaginary abstractions, but in terms of real concrete dillemas similar to those all people must eventually confront if they are to live a productive, fulfilling life.I feel a profound sense of reverence for this novel. Perhaps you will too, or already do."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Fantastic! This book is tremendous on so many levels. It can be wildly enjoyed as an adventure story and work of fiction, or one can easily base a life's philosophy on it. Many criticisms of this book focus on its length, poor use of language, and depressing subject matter. I would like to clearly state, that I have never read a more beautiful or uplifting work. While reading this book, never did I feel depressed or disheartened. The characters in this book inspire me (and enable me) to be a better person. I have never felt such pride for being human, and such excitement for being alive as when I read and re-read this novel. Atlas Shrugged covers so much ground, by establishing and introducing a complete philosophical framework, covering in detail, a rational viewpoint of: economics, politics, life, love, sex, beauty, humanity and life. I never found the length of the book to be an issue, until it finally ended, at which point I wished it was at least another 1,000 pages. The writing of this novel is clear and beautiful. It is truly the antithesis of writing by authors such as James Joyce. The writing is clear in its content, but possesses beauty and poetry even in the longest of speeches or philisophical discussions. After reading this book, I think clearer, walk straighter, smile more often, and enjoy life, like never before.Atlas Shrugged is truly able to revolutionize your thinking, expand your mind, and exhalt your soul."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

Politicians and Bureaucrats who think that laws are only for the little people are detailed marvelously.

The whole dirty nasty dance of corruption that our politicians engage in with their donors is explained in such a way that even Nancy Pelosi might understand it.Not a single conservtive of today can give a defense of why we should be free.

The first 400 pages are pretty boring, but once you get to Rearden's trial the book picks up from there all leading up to the amazing speach made by John Galt (that technically wasn't a spoiler...it's obvios).Ayn Rand majored in history and philosophy and she puts both of them to an amazing test in this book (as well as The Fountainhead which is worth a read as well)...she pretty much kicks all modern philosopher's in the ass with her logical philosophy of objectivism. For fans of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair...this book is the living proof that political economy is more effective with a capatalist mentality, rather than the communist mindset of Sinclairs advocation.The characters are amazing (especially Francisco) who all started out with nothing, and worked their way up to being amazing individuals...I'm sorry I can't say more but my computer has been acting up and I'm trying to rush through this as fast as I can...you can email me for a better review; eva02kienan@msn.comDefinately check this out! It's precious to any intellect, and worth a lot of thought!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Extroidinary literature but may not be the place to start if you are not acquainted with Ayn Rand.Anyway, after reading many of the reviews, I have noticed that even the people who loved the book have an erroneous idea of what Ayn Rand was saying.First of all, ethically selfishness or self-interest means you have a right to your own life, that you own it and can dispose of it as you want, without imposing force on others. It does not mean you have the right TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT OR TO IMPOSE YOURSELF ON OTHERS. It means you own your life, and are free to live it in the manner you deem right for yourself. In a political context, it means the government is prohibited from imposing itself on your life, by for example drafting you into the military, or prohibiting you from entering a certain career field.When Ayn Rand attacked altruism and its component part self-sacrifice SHE WAS NOT ATTACKING HELPING OTHERS, OR DOING GOOD THINGS FOR OTHERS, OR BENEVOLENTLY SPREADING GOOD WILL IN THE WORLD. What she was attacking was the fundamental principle of altruism that YOUR LIFE BELONGS TO OTHERS AND CAN BE DISPOSED OF WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.We see the consequences of altruism all over the world. People living without the ability to own their lives. Cuba is a prime example. The communist party and Fidel Castro are the owners of everyone's life. They control and direct it with impunity. One has little or no control.Helping others and spreading good will is as much a part of successful living as living and breathing, but when people are FORCED to sacrifice their lives in the name of helping others, state coercion follows, and this is the evil, Ayn Rand so eloquently refers to in Atlas Shrugged and her other writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book was published in 1958. It sells consistently year after year. I have read it many, many times and always find something new.If you are curious about the slavish devotion or hysterical anger that this book seems to inspire, the only answer is to READ IT FOR YOURSELF.Many inventions of our current world did not exist in the 1940's, when Rand began to write this book. That makes some people think of the novel as stilted (they can't imagine life without TVs and cell phones for everyone).We so seldom see heros in our lives, that many people are offended by the concept of a person striving to be his or her best and succeeding. It seems to be a cultural imperative that heros must have feet of clay.Well, some of Ayn Rand's heros make mistakes. And, they pay for them! The marvelous thing about Atlas Shrugged is these heros know how to acknowledge mistakes and move forward with their lives.Owr culture is steeped in Original Sin. It is the concept of Original Sin that Ayn Rand is rejecting. If you cannot consider that a human being is born in complete innocence, then don't bother to read Atlas Shrugged. However, if you have ever wondered why sin or its absence sometimes seems to be a consequence of your own actions, under your own control, and sometime not, this book is the answer you've been seeking.Many people seem to be afraid of this book. For me, this book has been a life-long friend, always challenging me to think for myself and draw my own conclusions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the only book I've ever read which has truly changed my life.

I was impressed by the subtle recasting of history and the twisting of Western philosophy to prop up a belief system that would carry many future greedheads to new heights of social irresponsibility. After finally finishing the book I have concluded that only someone who knew the truth could have pulled off propaganda this slick. However, I really did find this book very entertaining so Viva La New Corporate World Order."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand has finally done it, Atlas shrugged is a perfect tribute to individualism. Dagny Taggart and Francisco D'Anconia literally leap out of the pages and take up residence in your mind, influencing everything you do or say for the next few years. The story is perhaps an idealistic one but it cannot be described as impossible. Who knows... if the best minds in the world really do decide to go on strike may be they'll manage to create their own Atlantis. Galt's Gulch from Atlas Shrugged really is my idea of a perfect place. The flawless system is the one in which everything happens for a reason. You can't really tell why a person is doing something, unless you actually see what he is gaining from it. And everybody has something to gain.... The people portrayed as &quot;looters&quot; in the book make their own little profits under a well-glossed pretence of contributing to society. For all that people object to Ayn Rand'd theories, it is true that they apply to the &quot;real&quot; world as well. If society lifted a finger to help itself, a lot of chaos could be avoided. Ayn Rand characters have often been described as cold. Objectivism is not the same as coldness. A person who insists on getting the job done is an efficient invidual, not a heartless one. Anybody who dimisses Dagny Taggart as devoid of feeling, probably hasn't read the book properly... the people Ayn Rand upholds in her story are more passionate than their ordinary contemporaries. They have a zest for life that a lot of us could use. Perhaps such people do not exist....but I like to think that they do. Atlas Shrugged is definitely superior in quality to Fountainhead, I couldn't see any of Dagny's forceful character in Dominique. Although it is one of my favourites, I must add that certain parts of the book are not to be taken literally, even Ayn Rand can go wrong sometimes. But I cannot argue with the general philosophy...the mind IS to be held above everything else... to lose one's individuality is to lose everything."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The task of writing a novel that explains an entire philosophy while being entertaining is so daunting I can't believe anyone tried it. That Ayn Rand did it, and so well, is breathtaking in and of itself. True, the book is not flawless. It's not great literature, the characters may be a little stiff. Bear in mind, this is a philosophy book, not a beach novel, nor something so steeped in symbolism that school kids grow up hating it. It is here to demonstrate, to explain, and to predict. It is straightforward and plain. That it entertains and has an interesting story is the author's great glory. The philosophy is sound and well presented. Read it, and see yourself for the heroic figure you are. Read it, and contemplate. Don't take Rand's word for it, don't take mine. Explore the ideas in this book, look at what you're told and what you believe. Examine your premises. Really try to dig out what you believe and why. It's a lot of work, but it's quite rewarding. You will probably find that you've swallowed a lot of poison in your life. Working the poison back out of your life takes effort. I hope you'll be up to the task. I'm glad I was. Plato, Kant, Hegel, and the modern foolosophers can bite me. I may not be John Galt, but I think he'd take the time to find me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Romantic and inspiring.A novel of the highest magnitude. For me personally, I would have to say that this one novel more than any other singlehandedly focused and clarified many feelings that I had but couldn't bring together in a unified philosophy. In short... it literally changed my life. I definitely rate it as the greatest novel i've personally ever read and I certainly consider it one of the greatest single statements about truth in the world. However, I must state that just as Ms. Rand suggests that each person's mind is their own and for their own use and benefit there is a force that connects us all and a universal consciousness which belongs to us all which no individual may claim as his own. This force is responsible for all things be they manifest in the mind of an individual or in the physical world. We all, regardless of intellect or effort, belong to that force and owe everything to it. And that force belongs to each of us.So basically what i'm saying is that Atlas Shrugged is closer to the ultimate truth than anything else i've encountered in my limited experience but there is an even greater truth than is expressed in this absolutely breathtaking work.It is a book that should be read and reflected upon by all people."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading other reveiws you should know how much contraversy surrounds this book, and Ayn Rand. Here I'm going to try to side step the philosophy and just focus on the book.The Good- Ayn Rand can write descriptions well. From the opening tone of fear and desperation, to the triumph of Rearden at the forge, to wondering through the industrial towns now swamps, Rand proves she can write beautifully.- No one that I know of has done this plot before. Most stories of revolution feature the workers, the army, or a church rebelling never a rebellion of the industrialists as we see here. The scope is also wide enough to give it an epic feel.- Its nice to see philosophy given such weight in a novel, especially these days. Characters literally spend dozens of pages going into the rationality of their value judgements and looking for \\"the good\\".- This book also goes after alot of modern sacred cows and attacks them without mercy, an act that would have taken alot of guts back in the 50's when it was written.- On a personal note I find myself agreeing with much of the philosophy of the book, but hate its presentation passionately.The Bad- While it is well written on a descriptive level the plot, characterisation, and general tone were...outstanding. This book feels at most times like hideous propaganda maquerading as merely abrasive propaganda. Take the plot. What we have are the band of ideologically unified, pure unbelievably gorgeous and brilliant industrialists going on strike after ideologiccally insane, ugly, and generally slow witted socialist bureaucrats try to alter how the good guys do business during a recession. I mean that description literally - all good guys have the exact same beleifs, are brilliant, and handsome while all bad guys are described as ugly and dumb. Rand will sometimes spend a paragragh explaining just how handsome/ugly they are.Much of the plot involves some surprising turns into the absurd because of the propagandistic nature of the novel. The baddies will often be introduced as completly normal individuals - young men thinking of joining the Peace Corps, Wives, PR men - but will inevitably leap into the extreme absurd. The young man spits (or something like it, I don't recall exactly) at his industrialist family member after said industrialist asks \\"Are you proud of this metal stronger then steel that I made?\\". The wife of the industrialist is well, completly and totally off her rocker (like all dirty altuists are). The PR man is such a lier its doubtfull he knows his own name anymore.Meanwhile, the plot warps for the good guys to the point where they can have these types of conversations with the baddies -Goody - I don't care if a meteor hit your plant, I want those metal railings now you pathetic swine of humanity!Baddy - *sweats* But..but...*eats baby* Hank...we...*eats another baby*.....It goes on for another three pages.A really absurdist novel that still wants us to believe a word it says.- Yes philosophy is presented but in a very one sided way so bad it would make Camus turn in his grave. Long stretches of dialogue will go by where a Goody will educate a future Goody in some aspect of life, but miraculously the future Goody will not question obvious holes and contradictions. The Baddies are not allowed to speak logically. They are Baddies after all.Oh, and in the end the main character gives a 50 page speech with lines like this -\\"All through time the creators have been killed or enslaved by hordes of useless looters and moochers...\\"That is actually one of the lesser sociopathic delusions in the book.The philosophy in the book itself can ultimatly be described as a Capitalist Manifesto. If you want you can skip to Galt's speech at the end and see what you think of the philosophy that formed the excuse for the novel and make up your own mind on \\"Objectivism\\"."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged after THOROUGHLY enjoying The Fountainhead.

You've admitted that we should be altruistic!&quot; Not necessarily.What the advocates of &quot;altruism&quot; don't mention is that true altruism is voluntary. Isn't it ironic that the &quot;altruists&quot; advocate government redistributing wealth under threat of force, and then have the nerve to call it &quot;altruism&quot;? What's so altruistic about government forcibly taking a portion of your wealth without your consent? They say they advocate altruism, compassion, and caring. What they really advocate is government forcibly taking a portion of what you worked for.Perhaps Rand hated altruism in all its various forms, but I suspect she would have been perfectly willing to let someone voluntarily give away their own wealth to the needy, if that was what they wanted to do. What she ultimately rejected was the notion that an individual, or a collective, have the right to take what someone else earned, under threat of force, for the purpose of a &quot;good intention&quot;.You wanna help the needy? By all means, do so. I regularly give to local charities because I WANT TO. But don't think you have the right to take what someone else has earned just because you think it's for a &quot;good cause&quot;. I give of my wealth VOLUNTARILY, but I certainly don't have the right to take what you've earned just because I think it's a good idea.Forced altruism isn't altruism at all.A cannot be non-A.That's the true lesson of Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is a must read.The plot grabbed me.The heroes were likeable.Her writing style, her descriptions, her dialogue were all incredibly silly. They made me chuckle, they kept me reading.What makes this book so horrible to me is that it is taken so seriously by so many. It is based in a world that is totally unrealistic. The villians, apparently most of the government and corporate leaders of the world, are incomprehensibly idiotic. If you've ever imagined yourself locked in a heated argument against someone who was hopelessly stupid, you have imagined 60% of this book.In Atlas Shrugged, the \\"conflict between good and evil\\" is really the conflict between anyone with common sense against a million cartoon villians - which happen to be warped philanthropists.How could people who \\"don't want to make any profit\\" and \\"want to help the people\\", while actively trying to thwart anyone from succeeding in business and industry, somehow end up as CEOs of huge corporations and as government leaders?In our world, reckless philanthropist idealists don't climb the corporate ladder. They're not allowed. For sound reason. They get fired before they climb up from the mail room.In our world, strong and competent CEOs - like most of the heroes in the book - are NOT powerless to change law and policy.In our world, the average person wants to improve their station, even if they don't want to be productive. In Ayn Rand's, the world is falling apart because people seem content to wallow and sink in the mud.How could the philosophy stated in this book really be considered as apt for our world?If anything, this book is a dinosaur of the cold war. A thumbs-up to McCarthyism. In Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand shows she is paranoid and delusional - with a hysterical fear of \\"socialism/communism\\" as it was presented by US anti-Soviet propaganda.As I first stated, this is a \\"must read\\", not because it is a great piece of literature or philosophy, but because it will help you better argue against the many others who think it is."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Gag.

Just compare what is being reported by mainstream media and what our children are being taught in school and compare it to common sense.I believe that people need to be self-sufficient and not a burden upon society. I am not wealthy, by any means, but feel that I have an obligation to do the best I can and not take from others when God gave me the tools to take care of myself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am pasting from another review I did for the other audio version. Keep in mind this is a review only of the reading, not of the book itself.I want to insert just one additional comment. There are some reviewers who say this is not the entire book. It may have been only one of the two parts at the time the reviewers bought it, but this one is the entire book, sent together in two separate boxes, so if you're looking at an audio version, buy this one._________________________________________________________________________I know Mr. Brick has won awards, but this reading was intolerable to me. I made it through four CDs and gave up on it getting any better. At least in those CDs, Mr. Brick's \\"breathy\\" reading sounded as though he was reading it while he was having \\"intimate relations,\\" if you know what I mean.I've read the book, and I also own the other audio version. I liked the other audio version the first time I listened to it, but I didn't feel it did justice to the book. I bought this one because I love this book and wanted a choice of which to listen to, because I listen to it frequently.I will never get through this one, because I won't try again. It really is THAT bad.If you want an audio version, check out this one http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-two-parts-Rand/dp/0786161787/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1237854934&sr;=1-7 even though it's more expensive. It is well worth the difference in cost, and the minor annoyances I had with that version have completely left my mind now that I've tried to listen to Mr. Brick's version.Of course, actually reading the book rather than listening to it is preferable. It allows you to go at your own pace and form your own opinions more easily than the audio version. However, I understand the problems with reading it. Even if you love to read, and the size of the book doesn't intimidate you, the font is so small in the paperback editions that it's hard to get through more than a couple of chapters without getting eye strain.I first read the book in advanced placement, i.e., accelerated college, courses in high school. I didn't dislike it, but we read a lot of books I enjoyed more. I was simply too young to really understand it. It all seemed very far-fetched, not enough to be sci-fi, but too much to be reality at any point.A few months ago, I started having this feeling of deja vu. I kept hearing things on the news and thinking, \\"Where have I heard this before?\\"I'm a news junkie, so I started searching back through news, my \\"reality,\\" for parallels, and I couldn't find the things that were bothering me. I remembered it only because of a post on the Internet that I incidentally ran across, someone saying, \\"If you haven't read 'Atlas Shrugged,' you should.\\"It was a simple post, no detail, but it was the light bulb. \\"That's it! That's where I've heard it before! It wasn't even in the news; it was in that book!\\"I had the book, but couldn't read it. I tried, and then tried skipping around. The print was simply too small, so I ordered the audio version I linked you to. I've listened to it several times since then (43.5 hours), and it's still not sci-fi, but it's also not far from my \\"reality.\\" It's almost prophecy that's coming true.I very strongly encourage everyone to either read or listen to this book. If you take the time for it, it will make at least a small change in your life. It's a book you will carry with you in your mind for the rest of your life if you read or attentively listen to it voluntarily, rather than as an \\"assignment.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There is no other book that encompasses a whole philosophy and moral code as well as Ayn Rand does in 'Atlas Shrugged'. Anyone looking to find moral ground for the pursuit of happiness and the right to live your life as you see fit, this is the book.Rand outlines the necessity of the freedom of the mind and the soul from tyranny and oppression. She explains the virtue of individual thought and creativity to the advancement of the human race. The forces of evil and good are clear defined in this book. Ayn Rand creates heroes and horrible villains. It's an amazing book that is consistently overlooked at any level of the education system.Read-this-book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Long book, but well worth the time to read. Very prophetic of where our country is heading now."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My title does not refer to the world's destruction through selfishness and greed; rather, it refers to what happens when those who keep the world running are obstructed by the less talented and envious.Atlas Shrugged takes place in a future or alternate world where industrialization has stagnated, most of the world has turned to socialism and America is the only free and productive nation left on earth. As the novel progresses, America increasingly becomes more like the failed \\"People's States\\" throughout the world.There are too many fascinating aspects of this book to list in full. Firstly, in not one single place does Rand use the terms Marxism, socialism or communism yet it is plainly obvious what she refers to. She clearly dispels fundamental tenets of Marxist ideology such as the notion that uneducated, unskilled workers are capable of maintaining industries collectively, let alone developing new technologies.On the flip side, Rand succinctly refutes the old axiom that capitalists are exploiters. Rand points out that the capitalist provides benefits to the workers in terms of developing new products and industries which result in employment. The worker simply completes tasks which the industrialist could also do for themselves (and, in fact, many of the main characters serve as non-thinking workers later in the book). The underlying point is that the worker relies on the mind of the capitalist for survival. The capitalist gains nothing from the worker that he or she could not do for themselves.As revolutionary as this novel is, it contains some extremely serious flaws. First, the book is overly long. There are simply too many passages where little of importance is written. Some major narrative arcs take far too long to develop (Dagny's pet railroad project for instance). Much of the dialog is repetitive though, to some degree, this is intended to drive home certain points. Finally, there are serious problems in terms of characters speaking for FAR too long (and I am not solely referring to the 50 page lecture at the end of the book). Rand makes her philosophical points most effectively in the sections where dialogue consists of short exchanges between characters; the pages long monologues by single characters are not only unnatural but are irritating.Secondly, the characters of Atlas Shrugged have been accused of being one dimensional. This is absolutely true. The protagonists are also completely faultless. Among the heroes, only Hank Rearden exhibits imperfection during the course of the novel; however, even he becomes \\"perfect\\" by the novel's conclusion.My final criticism of the novel stems from the second: as there are no perfect humans in the real world, objectivism cannot work exactly as Rand would have us believe. Just as Marxism cannot function in its purest form because of human nature, human beings seem incapable of adhering to strict objectivism for any length of time. I found myself wondering how long it would take for society to revert back to looters and moochers if the heroes had there way.Despite these problems, everyone should read this book. Like all philosophical works, not everyone will like it nor is it in any way an easy or fast read. It is, however, a potentially life-changing read. I suspect that those who cannot muster more than a one star review for Atlas Shrugged have either never read the book for themselves or perhaps witnessed a little too much of themselves in James Taggart, Wesley Mooch and Dr. Stadler for their own comfort."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As Ayn Rand's immortal opus, Atlas Shrugged stands as a tome to a philosophy that is relevant today as it was in her time. Basically, the major moral theme is that there are two types of people in the world: the Creators and the Leeches.The Creators are the innovators who use the power of their will and intelligence to better humanity. The first person to create fire is often referenced as the paradigm for these people. In the book, each of the major protagonists also represent Creators improving the human condition with their force of will.The Leeches (my word) are the people who create nothing, but thrive off feeding on the Creators. In Rand's view, they are the bureaucrats, politics, regulators, etc. Throughout human history she tells us, these people have benefited through no ingenuity of their own, but merely from piggybacking on - and often fettering - the success of the Creators.Where the conflict in this book arises is when the Creators decide they have had enough and revolt. I won't spoil the book by describing specifics, but let's just say it causes quite the societal drama. For Leeches can't feed where there's no blood.All that is fairly significant and involved and worth the read to begin with, but where this book really stimulates me is in the fact that it is still relevant. Today we have Creators and we have Leeches. Some titans of industry and technology move our culture forward and others hold it back to their own benefit. I work in Silicon Valley and I see this all the time. That's why in many ways I consider this voluminous novel to be as important to a business education as Art of War.To cite other readers' posts, you don't have to agree with what Rand is extolling, but I think you'd be foolish to try and deny the existence of this struggle since it is ingrained in humanity. Yes, Ayn does get long winded and arrogant in parts as she draws the battle lines, but I don't think an author could have crafted such a powerful conflict without copious quantities of ego to accentuate the differences."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is one horribly long soap opera. It has elements of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;C-span.&quot; This book should only be read if you found you business ethics class entertaining, like soap operas and have a lot of time on your hands. This book drabbles on for over 1000 pages, with every page pretty much saying the same thing, I'm rich, successful and super intelligent oh how my life is so hard. The only upside to this book that I found was that there was a lot of philosophical ideas disagree with which made it thought provoking a good book to discuss."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, the book has its obvious flaws. The philosophy also has flaws. However, there are some ideas within the book that can be used to create a middle ground between those of capitalist thought and those who prefer socialism. It is obvious to anyone with half a brain that those in charge of corporations are not the same as the heroic characters in this story. Perhaps, however, they should be--maybe this is an example for such people, to strive for excellence and long-term success instead of &quot;drive up the stock and retire&quot; attitudes of many CEOs.On the other hand, people looking for fair compensation for their hard work are neither evil or greedy. That, too, I think is obvious to most people.Her philosophy does require dissection, to be boiled down and refined perhaps. To discard all of these interesting ideas, however, would be a mistake. I recommend that people who are even vehemently opposed to her philosophy should read this book, if for not other reason, than to know what you are talking about when you bash it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Objectivism is a new philosophy popularized by Rand, and this is the book that puts the philosophy to life. The book is filled with delightful subtleties and intriguing plotlines and characters. This is Rand's crowning achievement by far."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand might well have been writing about the political climate of today. The notion that the wealthy &#34;owes&#34; something to the under achievers of society. That the ultimate objective is that no one person should have more than any other and laws should be in place to reach those goals. Even to the destruction of the machinery that keeps society functioning. It is the same message we hear today. It is an eye opener and shocking when you realize it was written in 1957Some of the passages are long winded and I could not imagine anyone speaking as such but it is a work of fiction....or was...On page 262 one of the industrial elites who is tormented at the lack of humility by one of the giants of the steel industries, shouts, &#34;he didn't invent smelting and chemistry!...He couldn't have invented his metal but for the thousands of other people......everybody uses the work of everybody else....He didn't do it for any noble purpose, he did it just for his own profit!...Sounds a lot like our leader's rant to the business about &#34;You didn't build that&#34;.Still sounds foolish.This work is unnerving in the current political climate. I think it is a must read. There is a pretty good poke at spiritual beliefs toward the end of the book. If you read the book you will be moved.

Fancisco told you and told you....but you need that 2nd time to see it in a different light. This book will stun you with the relevancy to today, including the same regulations and laws....named a wee bit differently, but they are now here. For such an old book to see the future, and Ayn Rand did see the future through her past, you will be stunned. READ THIS. READ THIS. The most important book you will ever read.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what can happen when the government starts taking over peoples' lives; how it changes the economy, changes people, and how it takes away the incentive to be entrepeneurial."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"a fresh story but a continuation to Ayn Rand's philosophy that started out with books like \\"We the living\\" where she new something was wrong but could not put her finger on it. She progressed to books as \\"The Fountainhead\\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \\"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence your head can work without your hands yet your hands can not work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \\"Who is John Galt?\\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \\"Atlas shrugged\\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \\"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\\" and at the same time the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is changing my life.

I don't think people should go out and try to live by Ayn Rand's teachings but I make the assumption that, as fiction, that was not the point.

After a while, I found myself saying, \\"you said that\\" or \\"I don't care anymore\\"."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a brilliantly structured argument for Rand's objectivist thoughts.

This book is absolutely must read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is simply the most well-written book of all time. The author spend about 14 years on writing this book, and it surely paid off. It was first published in 1957 and it has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most influential books in American history. How come that you rarely see it being talked about in the media? How come that many Americans have never even heard about it or its author?Because it tells the truth!The book consists of strong and well-defined characters and the plot is flawless. The main parts of the plot are the proper and improper role of government, the source of American wealth and production and the individuals who represent the good and evil in the world and specifically in American society. You get to know good and evil in business as government like never before.Any person with an interest in politics, freedom, individualism and reason ought to read this book.

I am finally finished and I wish I wasn't, I guess I will have to start over again. This is a heavy book to read, not leisurely reading, but you will savor it. You don't have to be believe in the freedom of capitalism to enjoy this book, however, you might when you are finished. Amazing and applicable."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There is no need to go into a lengthy diatribe in regards to this remarkable piece of literature. If you want to be petty then, it might be a bit too long, Galt's speech could have been pared down a bit, and the place in Colorado might be kind of a Xanadu, but that is about the only negatives an unbiased reader could come up with for docking this incredible manifesto. Yes, it's a manifesto, good read, novel, and for many people a guide on how to think. It certainly provokes thought and stirs up the spirit as well. The nay sayer's and other types of critics of the same ilk, should really get over it and accept the fact that this is one of the most important and meaningful discourses of rational thought has or will be ever lain down on paper. There is something in this sprawling epic for everyone, especially every American. Don't use it as a bible or self help book, rather use it as a guide towards developing your own unique style of rational thought. Sure it's hard not to just be engulfed by the work of a true genius at their peak, for she was and it is her crowning achievement, but don't ever let somebody totally think for you, for the author did not intend or desire that to be the case, with Atlas Shrugged. Enjoy it, embrace it, even reject the parts you don't agree with it, but don't look foolish and try to dismiss it. This is an astounding work which justly deserves to be on the short list of any logical person's must read's, and will be cherished forever. I suppose the critic's of this book think the Beatles were just a fad and idealistic hoax, also! Tune in, turn it up, and stay sharp. Yes, this book is as good as people tell you it is, and very few things live up to their hype.

Moving, thought provoking, brilliant, and always relevant; this is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"While Ayn Rand presents what some might call a rather dismal way to view the interaction between people as well as human motivation, I find it is a very interesting read that unavoidably makes you reconsider many of the desicions you make on a daily basis-- whether you agree or not with her philosophy.

They're money and freedom are stolen as to provide for those who will not try, who will not live. Inevitably people look at you like your completely heartless.But this book, through one of the greatest stories ever told, puts it all down on paper. The premise that people should be able live there lives, free to do as they choose, provided they do no 'harm' to others, is the only true and just way for society to operate. T That is what i always believed, that that is what i think is the most important message of this book.That is what makes me so angry when i look at what's stolen from my pay every month and the money that is wasted by those 'representing' us in government.On a personal note, John Galt mentioned in the book that the only function of Goverment should be to enforce the code that men should interact with each other as traders, this reminded me of a question i asked people continuously in my grade school days, which was 'Why do we need a government mom, why can't the police just make sure that we don't do bad things to each other?'...of course i never got an answer...Read this book, it will open your eyes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book (which by the way is not too long). I loved it. Why? Because before I read it my own ideas were just half formed, nothing solid. Now I know what a hero is. A person who has integrity and intelligence and the courage to uphold it. So for all those self-righteous pricks out there who BELIEVE that they have a right to the money and goods that others earned, who BELIEVE that others have an obligation to help everyone, try thinking."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"People either love this book or hate it because Rand intentionally left no middle ground. And to the very end of her life she judged everyone on earth by their reactions to her work. (She even developed a &quot;theory&quot; of aesthetics to justify her practices: see THE ROMANTIC MANIFESTO.)Whether or not one agrees with her is the ONLY thing that mattered to her. For Rand, people were little more than receptacles for &quot;ideas.&quot; And the world divided very neatly into the select few who agreed with her vs. the evil majority.She would most certainly NOT have been more interested in the amount of thought and discussion that she has provoked than in the number of people who end up buying into her philosophy. In ATLAS SHRUGGED, everybody who doesn't buy into her philosophy winds up DEAD.Surely no one familiar wish Rand's work can realistically imagine her saying, &quot;Well, the world's gone mystical-altruist-collectivist-irrationalist, but gosh, at least I provoked some interesting discussion, and that's what really counts!&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am really fond of this so called \\"selfish\\" philosophy.Ayn Rands ideas are fresh, and even if you don't like them or don't agree with them, you'll enjoy reading it.In additioin, this book is so beautifully written that you'll enjoy it for the sake of reading even if you never realize that there was a philosopher behind it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not my favorite of Ayn Rand's novels - that would be Anthem. But it is still well worth reading. No, I am NOT an objectivist. I am, however, a huge fan of dark future novels. They tend to give great insight into character's minds. If you want to read Atlas Shrugged, but haven't read alot in this genre before, try first reading Anthem or Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 (both great novels) or We (a Russian novel by Yevgeny Zamyatin), or 1984.

You do not have to agree with Ayn Rand's views to appreciate and enjoy her novels."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I first heard of Atlas Shrugged, it was an assignment for First Year Composition. Looking at the size of this book placed an extreme burden on me to read it, however, it was a very interesting book. I do not agree with Ayn Rand's ideas and I think her &quot;world&quot; is very unrealistic. This book had some interesting events while others could be taken out and never missed. I would recommend reading this book if you have extra time on your hands or if you are a good reader. It will definately give you a view of a world that many of us could never imagine."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a mystery, raunchy romance and work of philosophy all in one. It may get you thinking for the first time about the capitalist system and the ethic of individual freedom which underpins it. It seems people like to love it or hate it, and if there was a list for \`most fascinating book of the 20th century'. The book addresses one of basic issues of existence: the degree to which one should be selfish. But this willingness to accept less, in order to accommodate 'human nature', was for Rand actually anti-human. One of her characters says something to the effect of &quot;...most people don't really want to live, but 'to get away with' living&quot;. The characters are strongly developed throughout the novel and introduce you into Rand's world where philosophy will pull you away. Atlantis is her idea of what she would want earth to be like; a place where power is worthless and everything is earned. At parts of the novel, She contradicts herself saying that she want communism over capitalism but the novel is full of selfishness and self determination.Atlas Shrugged runs for 1080 pages, and like the greatest novels, it is a world you enter rather than a book you read, and if you have the time that it takes, I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Basically this book sends the message that laisezz-faire and a free-market capitalist society are indeed the best and most moral systems of use, or at least in the eyes of Ayn Rand. Along with this idea through her writing critiques socialist and communist systems. Which makes sense, she having lived through the period. The philosophical aspects of the book are intriguing yet become too repetitious."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The title refers to Atlas, the giant who, in Greek mythology, supports the world, and the book asks the question, if the modern day Atlas-es, those who run the world, where to shrug, what would happen? Many people complain about the length of the novel,but once you start reading it, it was hard to not want to finish it because so many questions pop up into your head as to what will happen next. The characters, too, are fascinating. Francisco D'Anconia, the millionaire \\"playboy\\" (I put quotes around it for a reason -- read the novel) is someone I would love to know in real life, and I identify very strongly with the character of Henry Rearden, industrialist tycoon. Dagny Taggart, the heroine of the story, is also the only fictional character that you never knew what she was to do next. This is an engaging story, if nothing else. If you skip over the parts that drag, you will remain interested in what's going to happen until the end. I didnt like Rand's treatment of women in this novel. Although the main character is a woman, that's largely so that she can have relationships with the male characters. The only other women are either superficial, or victims of the evil ones. Besides Dagny, females in the book are irrelevant or the embodiment of evil in society (eg: Hank Reardon's wife and mother.) Even though most of the novel is unrealistic, overall, I would recommend that everyone take the time to read this book. You will learn valuable lessons of life, society, economic distruction, and power."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas shrugged is a wonderful novel yet very confusing.

There were certain things that I had questioned at the beginning, and wanted to find out by the end. I am not into politics, so that sort of kept me at a distance with the book. All my questions were answered by the end, but I'm irritated by the ending of the book. I didn't think that the ending was very good, there are probably better ways that Rand could've ended the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I thought this was a terrific book, and I agree with about 97 percent of the philosophy it adduces.To those who've blasted it, I ask: Can you recommend for us a comparable work that presents, in story form or with real-world examples, the functional advantages of some system other than laissez-faire capitalism? Is there such a book describing whatever prosperity and abundance result from communism?And I don't mean some manifesto that preaches how things should be. Let's see some narratives featuring realistic examples, with examinations of the characters' motives and principles, and illustrations of the productive achievement propagated by whatever alternative way of life is proposed.This book is an anthem to capitalism. What other system is preferable, and why? How come no other novel answers that question, in the same manner as Atlas champions capitalism?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, this is a book for the social/political/intellectual minds of the world to contemplate and discuss. It gave me a new look at several of my ideals. I just hated for the story to end.

Regardless of where you are on the political or philosophical spectrum it repackages some old ideas into an epic with a scifi twist. Before reading the book remember to take it with a grain of salt and that Rand's world of absolutes is only a \\"a could have/should have\\" societal fairy tale. I by no means consider myself an intellectual, so I am surprised by all the people who reference this book as some kind of economic/political handbook that \\"people need to read\\". I suggest if you want to delve into some of the ideas Ayn Rand skims over, sign up for philosophy or a literature class at your local state or community college. I was hoping to get into a fun book that got me thinking about our consensual regulation of each other, but it was light on the cerebral and heavy on a Gone With The Wind style drama between the main character and John Galt. Read it to be entertained, if you want an education in Utopian thinking I suggest aiming for something a bit more challenging and rewarding."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book was in brand new when it got to me!

Unfortunately, I found that Rand's follow-up failed to live up to my expectations.The main driving point with Fountainhead was its story and dynamic characters. Just the sheer dialogue was enough to keep my interest throughout. However, I found Rand too busy extolling the virtues of 'objectivism' here, for the same thing to work. Near the end, she even places a non-stop 60-page diatribe about the philosophy; in my opinion, had the story been more succinct, this wouldn't be necessary. Often, I felt I was reading more of a lecture rather than an actual story.Another problem I found was some of the characters seemed too fanatical to be real. James Taggert is so hysterical a character that many of his actions had me shaking my head in disbelief and questioning if any human being would act in such a way. Rand definitely makes it obvious where your empathy is supposed to lie and this keeps you from caring about many of the characters.This is not to say the book is a waste. Much of the story is facinating and Rand possesses an amazing ability to write crafty/compelling dialogue. Dagny is a powerful woman and it's a joy to see her deal with every obstacle which she is faced. And the world which Rand creates is always well thought out. Had I seen more of this rather than being force-feed numerous ideals, I would have enjoyed the book much more.In the end, if you're looking to experience Ayn Rand, I would strongly suggest you stick with The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"An episode of South Park inspired me to read Atlas Shrugged. In the episode in which Officer Barbrady finally learned how to read (The Chicken Plucker, I believe) he ended the show on a note that the book he had chosen to read (Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand) was \\"garbage\\" and not worth the read. I had actually never heard of Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand until I saw that episode. So, naturally, I decided I must find it and read it. Then I forgot all about it until I spied a like-new hard backed copy at the local library on the For Sale table for $1.00!! I bought it and started to regret the challenge when I looked at the tiny print and the 1168 pages. I sat it aside for a few weeks, thinking, \\"yeah, right, I'm going to read that\\". But, the challenge niggled at me and I began to read - and read - and read.I understand that Ayn Rand's uptopia is peopled by those with a pragmatic objectivism philosophy, which some reviews consider to be selfishness. I didn't get the selfishness part as such. I interpreted her objective in writing this book as being AGAINST Socialism. I felt this was demonstrated by the entire society's falling apart by all those that had made it having to give all they had to all those that hadn't made it. As the thinkers and doers lost more and more of their livlihood to those contributing nothing at all and taking all that they could - these people formed a new society on the premise that you should do no work you do not love and you take absolutely nothing without paying for it in some way. Therefore, everyone contributes to their society and that society becomes strong. The original society was coming apart at the seams and eventually totally collapsed without the giants of industry to do everything for them. Individuals in the original society were not allowed to think, nor did they want to. I did NOT enjoy John Galt's Manifesto (Part 3, Chapter 7 \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\", pages 1000 - 1070 in my particular book). After reading the chapter in its entirity, I seriously would recommend skipping about 68 pages of that chapter. It's a drone and you'll get the point in the first 2 or 3 pages of that chapter, anyway!This book seemed overwhelming in length and breadth, initially. But, I am glad that I read Atlas Shrugged, because it really does make one think. Think about things such as we have been under a President for almost 8 years that doesn't seem to want to think and our country and even the world seems to be in a really sorry shape. I kept thinking, as I was reading the book, that perhaps the current administration had read this book and were trying out for the parts of the political system described within. Heaven Help US!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have the book on my shelf but I read it on my Kindle. I also bought the Cliffs Notes on this book to help me focus. I forgot things in the book over 16 years. I believe this book is written in a style not common now or then, which may turn off some readers. Faith and feeling will never create prosperity for you. Your reason and logic is your only tool to survive. Ayn Rand believes this is not selfishness but self- fulfillment. The book is a story of what happens when the thinkers and achievers go on strike. Prosperity can not be demanded then paid for with nothing more than a wish and/or a prayer."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am not going to add in to the already voluminous verbiage on the brilliance of Ayn Rand But this book is worth the lengthy read,.. says much about the cannibals we are dealing with in the 21st century and considering it was published in 1957,.. amazingly accurate!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand takes a hell of a beating in our society. Her ideas are riduculed far and wide. From Southpark to Family guy (I'm the younger generation this is what I know) she is treated with disdain and general dislike. Without hesitation, I can understand why. Some of the things she writes are almost absurd. We are not Taggart's and Rearden's. We are normal people struggling with our lives and trying to find happiness in our actions. If we were to judge one another based on Rand's conceptions we would all be condemned.Whenever I read her work though I cannot help but think about a noble vision. Her novels are ultimately works of fiction. However, I love to read them. The temptation of Atlas Shrugged is like warm cookies and a glass of milk to me. I think the story is incredible. The character development is superb. Yes, I realize that sometimes she can be long-winded, perhaps better editing was in order. Ultimately though I believe the positives to heavily outweigh the negative aspects of this book.I think it is CRUCIAL when reading her work, this book in particular, to be reading with an open and very critical mind. Her characters are stylized versions of our own lives (Fountainhead reference anyone get that) but that does not mean we cannot strive to be at their level. I mean this on a very subjective level. I see things in Hank Rearden that I admire and wish to emulate like his work ethic and refusal to compromise. Other things, his anti-social nature and flat out wrong beliefs at time I do not relate with. Apply the useful and discard the meaningless.I will never give up my imperfect friends and live a life of \\"perfect\\" solitude\\" and \\"no compromise\\" because of Ayn Rand. However, I will struggle to do my job better and be a person of integrity. I think that Rand, In Atlas Shrugged in particular, gives a very solid framework about how to achieve a diamond-solid belief in your own judgments and actions. If ever a person should say to you that you should doubt in yourself and offer your power to another person or institution, RUN!All of what I have said culminates in the next few sentences. I love to read Ayn Rand because I have a deep acceptance of who she is and why she writes the way she does. She came from a communist country and her disdain for it is evident in all of her work. I think, though, that if you can read her work and discard the irrelevant and make use of the good you will be a better person for it. I understand why people would read this book and dismiss it as sensationalist crap but I think doing so would be unwise. When I read Rand, I feel a strong belief in myself and my own judgments that little else in life offers me.Give it a chance. Read it critically and ask, how can I use this to better my life. That is what she would want."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand has given us a tome of examples to understand why individuals do their best when they receive the good and bad proceeds of their work. She also gives us a clear understanding of people at their worst when forced to do what they don't love, without the good and bad rewards of their labor. There were many parts of Atlas Shrugged that had me reading on 'the edge of my seat' enjoying her story. I thought it would take months to read the 1168 pages, I read them outloud to my wife in a week. Bennett Nelson"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I first read this book I was amazed. I was amazed because it did not rely on anything to make its point other than what can be proven given acceptance of reality as an absolute. There are an over-abundance of people who hate Ayn Rand because she is 'compassion-less' and 'selfish'. Okay, fine. I do not agree, but what does that have to do with her philosophy? I have yet to meet a person who can prove to me that the arguments presented in this book are wrong, unless they are making a claim that reality is not an absolute. Frankly, if that is your beginning stance, we have nothing to discuss anyways. I choose to accept the reality of the world around me, and if it turns out that this all really is some type of 'illusion' it doesn't really matter anyways. If I do not eat, I will die of starvation. If it turns out that this is an illusion and I won't actually die but be brought to some other form of existence, great! However, I am not going to be the guinea pig to test that theory, because most likely, I'd just end up dead. Plain and simple, regardless of what I may want to believe, actions have consequences and in order to live morally I choose to live by this code of values.I think many people simply choose to ignore the arguments she presents because if they really looked at the facts through unbiased eyes, they would feel bad about themselves because they do not live up to the moral code presented. I will be the first to say that it is a hard code of values to live by and that I am still learning how to do it properly. However, I choose to do it because the reward I get both monetarily and spiritually (a word I only use to describe my mental state, and not any mystic force) makes it worth it. But you have to put the effort in first in order to get the reward, not the other way around.Now, I would like to dispel a popular falsehood that is one of the main arguments people use against Rand, and that is that she hated philanthropy. Nowhere in her books is philanthropy ever denounced as an evil. What is denounced as evil are two things: 1. A person who has earned their wealth by means of their mind being forced to sacrifice what is rightfully theirs; 2. A philanthropist who claims to do it because they ONLY want to help others. Don't get me wrong, I think most people actually do like helping others, but there is a keyword that is so often overlooked in that last statement, and that word is 'like'. They LIKE to help others, so in truth it is another form of selfishness. I like to help others for one reason, it makes me feel good to know that someone may have an opportunity they may not otherwise have had. I am not going to say I do it only because I wish to sacrifice myself for them, because that is not true. I do it because I get something out of it as well, and there is nothing wrong with that.If everyone chose to live by the philosophy in this book there would be no wars, no crime, no wrongdoing; there would only be honest people working for their own ends that follow a moral code which stated simply is:'I swear by my life and by my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.' - The Key to the PowerhouseBut, it is a choice one must make on one's own, and I write these words hoping someone may read them and see this philosophy in a different light. Don't get me wrong, I do not do it only for you, but because I want to live in that world and I am motivated by a rational self-interest to see as many people take that oath in their hearts as possible."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If I were allowed to read only a SINGLE book in my entire life, and having read many hundreds of books by now, this book would be my indisputable choice.

Some see that we are heading towards a dystopian United States (or World) similar to the setting in this plot and think this book reflects the reasons for it. Rand's point in stated in simple terms - Capitalism good - Socialism bad! In some respects, it may be somewhat dated because of the 1950's industrial settings, but that does not affect the overall plot and thesis. I originally read this book as a work of science fiction.

WE ARE BORG!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a captivating novel. The greatest \\"shortcoming\\" is that the book is over 50 years old. The heroine is the vice-president of a major railroad company, and most of the plot revolves around her desperate efforts to keep the railroad going. In the 21st century, when the age of railroads is long past, this is certainly dated. Indeed, Atlas Shrugged, although contemporary when written, takes on the feel of a grand masterful allegory perhaps like Dante, Chaucer, or Swift. It is just as much \\"fun\\" as Alice in Wonderland or Gulliver's Travels--and just as serious as the Divine Comedy. Yet, if you listen to a hour of local and national news on TV every evening while reading the book--half of the stories will sound as though they were lifted from the book--so timelessness and universal is Rand's story.This will probably be the most important book (to you) that you read in your lifetime.What is it about? It is often described as \\"Capitalism versus Communism\\", or \\"altruism vs selfishness\\"--but both descriptions seriously miss the point. What this book is really about is much more fundamental. It is about the nature of good and evil, and beyond that, the very meaning of life.\\"But I'm a good person, so what value is this book to me?\\"--you may ask. Answer: You have certainly noticed that adult \\"morality\\" is full of all kinds of exceptions and contradictions. The truth is, the world of \\"morality\\" we adults have constructed is a sham, a fraud. It is no more than \\"social convention\\"--which is to say, \\"what we all more-or-less agree to\\"--and actually, despite all the \\"moral\\" justification, has absolutely nothing to do with morality or right-and-wrong, and often little to do with common sense.Still, the question remains, \\"Why isn't simply accepting the current 'social norms' good enough?\\" \\"Go along to get along.\\" Answer: To put it bluntly, the greatest evil the world has ever seen has been done by folks \\"accepting community norms\\" who thought they were doing good, or at least who could justify their actions as being \\"socially acceptable\\".The truth is, you will be quite surprised when you learn the true nature of evil. Until you have read Atlas Shrugged, evil will remain a hazy mist floating just off your line of vision, which you don't look straight at, because you don't WANT it to exist. After reading Atlas Shrugged, evil snaps into sharp focus--and like a bully confronted--ceases to be a fear, and just becomes something distasteful to avoid.As Rand richly illustrates: Just as eating too much fat can clog up your arteries, thinking \\"too much fat\\" can damage with your mental health. Some mental illness is physiological. But most mental illness is caused by unresolved internal contradictions--caused, for example, by refusing to look at evil because you PREFER to believe that it does not exist. Reality is. You do NOT have the option of living in your own private version of reality. Nevertheless, many, perhaps most, people live lives built on thier own complex lies. That turns smart people crazy, and stupid people mean and crazy.How do you avoid \\"unresolved internal contradictions\\"? By knowing the difference between right and wrong, and never, ever, allowing a rotten board to be used in the construction of your mental house. The problem is the old \\"slippery slope\\". Lie to yourself just once, no matter how trivial the lie, and the next one will be easier. Before long, you realize that you can justify ANYTHING--and with the blessings of the popular culture. And before you know it, you've lost your soul.As Rand preaches, the meaning of life is integrity. Living without compromise. To live a life filled with joy and pride in yourself, made possible by being free of mental conflicts. To know, not merely hope, that your mistakes were honest mistakes. To live with the knowledge that you are the best you can be, while striving to be better. To be a joy and comfort to the people you love. To give generously of your time, wealth, and love simply for the joy of doing so. To be a person who has changed the world for the better when you have gone. That's what Atlas Shrugged is really all about. All ofthe other themes, even Communism vs Capitalism are peripheral supporting themes. It is precisely because the fundamental issues are so basic and primary, that the implications are simultaneously universal--applying to all aspects of life.The greatest real flaw in Atlas Shrugged is that Rand herself does not quite understand how her philosophy applies to inter-personal relationships. All of the heros in the story are flawed characters, because Rand's characters are based on herself, and are flawed because Rand herself was flawed. That is, Rand had such a horrible youth that her ability to love and trust was damaged. In her own flawed vision, she has largely substituted hero worship for love. Rand's heros are real heros to be admired, but not role models to emulate.You will also find many things with which you will want to disagree, but in your heart, you will know that Rand is right. How you resolve these conflicts will be the most important decision you will make in your entire life. If you choose the truth, simply because it is the truth, then you are on the way to a life of good mental health. If you reject the truth because you PREFER a different vision or interpretation of reality--then you have already begun to lie to yourself, and you will probably have an unhappy life and be a miserable person to live with."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If it had not been assigned to my english class by my instructor, i would have never picked this book for my reading. Number one reason being that any book that contained 1000+ pages of fine print would have been intimidating to me. Surprisingly though as i was forced to read it as a part of my curriculum i was very absorbed by the book, the setting of the book takes place in 1950 when communism was making its hold in some parts of the world, Ayn Rand the author had first hand knowledge of its evils as she grew up in Russia. Her philosphy and theme of her book is that true economy is capatilism and capatilism can grow on theory of objectivism. This book contains long and redundant philosphical views, suspense, political corruption, evils and disadvantages of communism, romance (open adultery) and of course Mr. John Galt.Ayn Rand book begins with blooming economy, then it moves on to show the devastating effects of the government policies on the production and domino effect on the other businesses, disappearances of the industrialists, fall of economy, panicking of government and creation of \\"Atlantis\\"Story and plot are gripping and carefully thought over, characters are strong and powerful, transition is poor (especially sub-chapters), some chapters have long redundant philosphical views which make it hard to stay connected. Ending is unrealistic. I felt it deserved three star rating."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Did I really have to struggle through this massive novel and be subjected to all of the one-dimensional characters, the simplistic ethical quandaries and the total unrealistic human interactions to understand Rand's philosophical intent? No, I didn't, but once I started, pangs of literary guilt prompted me to finish.I have significant issues with this book. First, the characters and dilemmas are so one-dimensional (i.e., very good or very bad, very productive citizens or totally non-productive, handsome and fit or physically unattrative and &quot;fattish,&quot; to quote Rand) that they become tiring. We all know real life and real people are not this black-and-white; I do wish it was this easy to see deceit, sloth and underhandedness, because it would be easy to pick out the bad guys.Also, the countless examples of the &quot;us-versus-them&quot; dilemma was too much. Too much, because even in Rand's fictional society where human leeches cling to the valiant few productive citizens, the enormously egregious examples of evil that some characters get away with would just not be tolerated or possible in a lawful society. Its too much for me to swallow (ever hear of the literary concept of &quot;suspension of disbelief?&quot; - Rand ignores this practice in her books). I mean, does every good character in this book have to be so heroic, almost Paul Bunyan-like? Why can't we have a few &quot;Joe Lunchboxes&quot; (to quote Mr. Burns from the Simpsons) who are just average guys trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents?Even if I can get past the stylistic problems with her writing, I just can't wholesale buy into Rand's precepts in &quot;Atlas,&quot; which I consider all 'in extremis.' An impressionable, and largely unread, friend of mine finished this book and tells me, &quot;Dude, things really are getting like this in our country.&quot; &quot;What are you talking about,&quot; I replied, &quot;have you looked around lately? The economy is flourishing, hundreds of millionaries are created every day, and big business is becoming the engine that drives the global community. What saint-like industrialists that you know of are being forced out of existence by inept and corrupted governments and being brought to their knees by parasitic citizens?&quot;Do not assume by my response that I do not recognize the continued failure of the federal welfare state, the attack on our civil liberties by religious zealots and our increasing tax burden. I am a self-described civil libertarian whom strongly supports the notions of self-reliance and self-governance.And while I may be a civil libertarian and support a more restricted government, that does not mean I am a fool about the very real damages and harm that businesses can impact on society. And I realize Rand's extreme examples are a result of her exposure to Communism. But I challenge all of Rand's devotees who believe that big businesses and these giant engines of wealth creation are the strongest beacons of freedom, creativity and national strength to read an alternative viewpoint, one that is real and not contrived, like Rand's.I challenge them to read John Steinbeck's &quot;In Dubious Battle,&quot; which was written about 20 years earlier than &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot; Its very short and highly entertaining; it is not a simplistic rant against the evils of orchard owners like &quot;Grapes of Wrath,&quot; but it asks the reader fundamental questions about good and evil, both from self-serving business and individuals."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is political doctrine in the form of a novel. Unsurprisingly, characters are psychologically flat. Everything is way too simple for the author, the people, the values, the economy. If you are a devoted Libertarian and like to indulge in the warm, fuzzy feeling that this young person's philosophy (gun-ho simplistic and optimistic), you will like Atlas Shrugged. Otherwise, you will find it difficult to deal with all the ideology that this book really is. I give this books two shrugs."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a monster of a book. On the one hand probably the best novel of ideas ever written, on the other hand strangely onesided with protagonists so wooden that you can hear them crack after a few pages. As a devoted father I wondered why there are never (struggling) parents or children in Rand's books - the heroes came to life in spontaneous self-creation?! In Rand's universe there are only grown-ups without any ties, living solipsistic existences on the brink to autisms (it's quite fascinating how often the author depicts her heroes as &quot;cold&quot;). Her's is a world of black and white: There are only a few entrepreneurial Titans, favourably big industrialsts (white) versus the rest of mankind (black), millions of underlings, struggling because they arn't great and egoistic enough. Quite a bleak existence. It's rather revealing how badly the protagonists (an the author?) come to terms with feelings (and sex, which can be experienced only in some form of subjugation and violence). Consequently Rand vastly overestimates the intellect and underestimates the importance of emotions. But apart from these human/aristic failures the whole notion of objectivism may be based on an error. One of their core believes is that you can base ethic on the fact of life. As one interpreter of Rand's formulated: &quot;You should be moral because you have choosen to live.&quot; This is an unbelievable mistake: No one has ever choosen to live! You can't will your birth. The only thing you can choose is NOT to live (or to accept the existence which has been given to you - by your parents, your genes, the cosm, God - as you please). Rand's followers believe that the crucial difference between the (rich) heroes and the (poor) rest of mankand is based in their character. Even if you tend to agree there is one problem: you have been born with your character and you will never be able to alter it fundamentally. To say it with a simple equation: personality = charakter + experiences. The character (your body, your abilities, your good looks, even the amount of your vitality and thus resulting ambitions were determined - and limited - at the very moment of yout birth) is the factor you are unable to alter. You can desire to become a basketball hero as much as you want, if your frame stops within 5 feet you will never succeed. Rand despises compassion and altruism (and, I'm afraid, democracy). Logically you can only stick with this view if you are convinced that you can will your *fate*. But you can't - you can only learn to cope with the limits you were born with. The psychological concept that you are borne as a blank sheet has long been falsified."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\`Atlas Shrugged' follows the lives of great Americans as their country deteriorates from a capitalist democracy into a socialist communism. It is not a joy ride. In fact, it is a grueling, plodding process, filled with convolutions, and ultimately ending in a chaotic mess. But the story shows us how such a disaster might occur and thus grants us a tool for avoiding it. Meanwhile, the book plunges headfirst into man's all-time greatest political, cultural, and spiritual challenges, offering a fascinating look at each if not quite resolving any of them.The central challenge focuses on where virtue is lodged. Is it in the Self or in Society as a whole? It is a staggering question when one really thinks about it and Rand sets up scenario after scenario to help us think about it, pitting a troop of protagonists for the Self against an army of antagonists for the Society.Of course, Rand has reached her conclusion before we sink our teeth into the question. Those for the Self are confident, logical, productive, and industrious while those for Society are pathetic, lazy, tetchy, and smarmy. There really is no question about which is right when you look at it through these characters and so there really is no conflict.This is unfortunate because people on both sides have good, well-founded arguments. Simply writing off all socialists as crass nincompoops may feel right to the capitalist, but it does nothing to resolve the differences between the two sides and certainly doesn't help the case for self-interested industrialism. Nor can one say that all capitalists have the virtuous motives that Dagny and Rearden maintain. There are those who support the free market and industrialism for the wrong reasons, and neglecting that fact limits the effectiveness of the argument. In the end, a conflict between two reasonable foes is much more entertaining than a conflict between a master and a fool anyway.Rand sees things characteristically in black and white; there are no shades of gray. At least, the grays that do pop up in this book are cut down by one of the two sides of the conflict. Such absoluteness defies modern standards of literature and many a grain of salt must be consumed while reading \`Atlas'.Granting it is in the Classical style, one can really enjoy the book for what it is. And it is Classical in every sense of the word. The story is heroic--you can take your pick among her many heroes and heroines although only one stands out as the flawless kind. Like a good Homeric epic, the narrative is long-winded and repetitive. One walks away with useful if silly clich&eacute;s--\`who is John Galt?', \`looters', \`A is A'. Actions are deliberate and spelled out for the reader and every action is related to the lesson being told with nothing irrelevant coming into view. And finally, the characters are very one-dimensional with no development or change whatever. These are charming aspects that can be appreciated by those willing.Less forgivable are the inconsistencies that arise in the philosophy. Rand is making a case for self-interest, but throughout the book one will find instances where the protagonists seek validation from others, often to the deprecation of the self. The most notable example of this is in the romantic relationships. The two love each other and will do anything for the other person even if that means becoming vulgar animals and sacrificing the integrity of one's work. The couple receives selfish pleasure from the affair, but it comes at the expense of self-dignity.Rand eliminates the only true way to resolve this inconsistency (is it a contradiction?) by rejecting the ultimate reason for romantic relationships: procreation and raising a family (completely absent from the book). This is the inevitable consequence of fusing self-interest with atheism. When there is nothing to strive for but material gain, the world necessarily becomes a contradiction. One fights the immoral with immorality and gains the respect of others by denigrating them.The latter is actually a central theme in \`Atlas'. Indeed, the protagonists who despise the masses require their patronage to be successful. Industry in general is worth-while only if there are other people willing to buy the product and enough people to make it useful. Even when it is not explicit, the need for validation is present. The driving force of the book, the strike, is designed to force other people to behave properly so that the protagonists can succeed. John Galt's speech is accusatory and insulting, underscoring the negative tone of the book. His purpose (as is Rand's) is to crush the looting society, which is rational because of the burden it places on the producers. But in the end, that purpose relies on there to be a society to crush--it relies on other people.By the time Rand endorses coercion in the most direct manner (use of guns and killing) toward the end of the book, thus completely contradicting her libertarian argument, the reader is willing to give up on her completely. But the extremes to which she takes her story should not undermine the insight she lends on man's great challenges. Indeed, it is her willingness to identify the faults in society and rhetorically crush them that frees us to be constructive and wholly creative.Despite its major flaws, \`Atlas Shrugged' is possibly the only fictional work that addresses the kind of challenges it does. You will need to work for this book, but it will be worth it. Read it and discuss as they might have done in Aristotle's day."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This fictionalized narrative of 1168 pages, in the process of setting forth a consistent philosophical worldview, fantasizes about what could happen when the most important humans - the thinkers, inventors, and producers -- go on strike. When it was written, in the early 1960s, the Cold War was in full fledge, and the scare de jure was Communism and other collectivist ideologies of the socialistic left genre.Today, the opposite concerns bedevil the world. The old concerns about socialism, collectivization, and communism have withered away in favor of today's much more serious concerns with the negative consequences of the \\"so-called\\" superior thinking races, the corporate classes, and their courtiers of the far right, who have taken over the world via lobbyists, globalization, off-shore corporations, outsourcing, privatization, and militarization. In the process, their superior thinking has set us firmly on the road to totalitarianism at the opposite end of Rand's spectrum, Fascism.Contemporary Fascism has raised its ugly head again in the form of: preemptive wars, global pollution, the worldwide proliferation of nuclear weapons, and bifurcation of the world into obscenely rich and obscenely poor classes and races, just to name a few.In any case, it was Rand's philosophy woven across the pages of the book that was important. She summarized it much more carefully and succinctly in her 1964 Playboy interview. The main themes of which follow:Ayn Rand's Philosophy is referred to as Objectivism. It is a carefully worked out, internally consistent worldview based on the metaphysic that an objective reality exists \\"out there\\" independent of a perceiver and especially independent of his feelings, emotions, wishes, hopes, fears, and myths. The most basic premise of the Objectivist worldview is summarized best in Rene Decartes \\"Cogito ergo sum:\\" I am thinking, therefore I am.\\" That is to say, man's only means of perceiving reality, his only guide to the construction of values, and his only guide to proper action (and thus his only true means of survival) is reason itself. Reason, in the Objectivist's worldview is that faculty which identifies and integrates the materials provided by the senses.The ethics of Objectivism is derived directly from this metaphysical premise: that since reason is man's basic tool of survival, rationality must be his highest virtue; and conversely, a man without thought as his mental guide, and without conscious purpose, is of the lowest virtue, or is the most depraved. To use his mind, to perceive reality accurately, and to act accordingly, is man's most important moral imperative. The irreducible standard of man's value is the thinking needed to survive. Therefore, according to the Objectivist worldview, man is a supremely selfish being, not an altruistic one. He exists for himself, for his own survival and for his own happiness, which is his highest moral purpose. Thus, in the cannon of the Objectivist worldview, self-sacrifice, altruism, compassion and fundamental guilt (or original sin), have no place. Man cannot be guilty, a priori; he has to earn his guilt through his actions.It follows from this then that all evil is derived from mental laziness -- as a consequence of man's failure to think; that is, through his evasion of, or his search for ways to escape reality, and thus in his failure to confront reality with honesty. In as much as this is true it is the man without purpose -- who has no rational basis for his values -- that is most dangerous to himself and to others. Such a person drifts at the mercy of his random feelings, unidentified urges, sublimated fears, and is thus capable of evil precisely because he is totally out of control of his life. In order to be in control of one's life, rational thought in the form of productive and creative purpose must be front and center as man's only proper imperative.A central creative purpose serves to integrate and organize man's life around a hierarchy of values weighted according to their relative importance. It galvanizes and focuses his actions and energizes him towards survival related pursuits and purposes; and as a byproduct of this purposeful action, man learns to enjoy life. Otherwise, without purpose and purposeful action, man's internal compass is rudderless. Without purpose, he will have no way of knowing what his values are; which ones are relatively more important; or how to judge them. He can only drift helplessly at the mercy of chance stimuli, emotions or whims of the moment. He will spend his life in an endless cyclical search of meaning.Rand notes that it is important to recall that emotions are not tools of cognition; they are affects (and effects), not first causes. What one feels tell him nothing about the facts of reality; they simply give him a rationalized and self-justified estimation of the facts. Emotions are the result of value judgments and assessments. However, this does not mean that emotions are useless. As long as man keeps them in proper relationship to his reason, the two can coexist, reinforcing each other and providing richer meaning in one's life. But when their roles are reversed, and emotions are put in control, and are taken as first cause, while reason is given a passive back seat role, only trouble can ensue. When man engages in this kind of role reversal, he is condemning himself to failure, defeat and ultimately to self-destruction.A good example occurs with the role of sex. According to Rand, sex is a capacity, not an instinct. It can be a profound expression of man's self-esteem, of his own self-value when used properly. However, a man who does not value himself, with try to reverse this process and try to derive self-esteem from sexual conquest. How man uses sex is a reflection of his values and of his own estimation of his self-worth.Man is born with certain psychological needs like the need for food and sex, and is equipped with certain mechanisms for pursuing them. But, not being programmed with instincts, he comes without any knowledge of how to use them. Using his mind, he has to discover how to satisfy them through experience. Without the use of his mind, man can neither discover nor satisfy these basic needs. Likewise, in the realm of values. Man's urges, emotions, and whims will not tell him what to do. Man has to determine what is right and wrong through thinking as a rational being.Objectivism is not a dogma -- something accepted on blind faith without rational justification or without being grounded in empirical evidence. It is exactly the opposite. It tells you not to accept an idea unless its truth is grounded in reason or solid empirical evidence. Thus Objectivist's hold that the world is black or white, good or evil, not tones of gray. Diluting good with evil renders everything evil, just less so. The lesser of two evils remains evil.With respect to economics, Objectivism equates \\"free trade\\" with a \\"free mind.\\" The dollar sign, is the currency of a free nation and symbolizes a free mind. In other words, \\"free trade\\" and \\"free minds\\" are corollaries of each other. One cannot exist without the other.On religion, God and the Christian philosophy make no sense to an \\"objectivist.\\" Religion is blind belief made into a tyrannical orthodoxy unsupported by, and often contrary to the facts of reality. Faith, by being the negation of reason, is extremely detrimental to human life. Christ, by sacrificing himself on the cross, sacrificed the ideal (himself) for the non-ideal (the sinner and vicious evil doers). The evil-doer is then supposed to understand and respect this sacrifice? Although Rand does not say so explicitly, to the Objectivist, religion is not only wrong, anti-human, but very dangerous.Although religion was invented to help explain the universe, and to give a coherent frame of reference to man's life through a code of morality and ethical teachings, it is the very negation of reason. And thus through its mythology and emotion-based orthodoxy, has done great harm to mankind. Rand believes that \\"faith\\" is a dangerous basis upon which to build a philosophy or an ethical system.In the Objectivist world, the whole process of living is about the achievement of values. If the values are great enough, sacrifice is appropriate to save them. But living for them is even more important than dying for them. Artists should shape and help challenge the values of their culture, not be passive followers of it. Objectivism then is an activist and a prescriptive philosophy. It projects the ideal man \\"as he should be.\\" Philosophy is just a means towards this end. Values based on rational judgment is the only authority. As a result, there can be only one proper function of government: the protection of individual rights.Rand believe the neo-cons (who rule the world today) are dangerous because they tie capitalism to religion. In order to accept capitalism, the neo-cons believe one must believe in God or some other form of supernatural mysticism.And finally, Rand believes that all of contemporary conflicts will remain \\"wars over ideas.\\"Although the novel is a brittle and sophomorish bit of craftsmanship, the beauty of Rand's ideas is that they are always sharp and angular -- \\"front and center,\\" no hedging, no political correctness. Whether you believe her or not, whether you accept her ideas or not, there is no confusion about what she means. Five stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The \\"Entertained Reader\\" wished for \\"God's mercy upon Ayn Rand's soul.\\" Has it ever occurred to you, ma'am, that \\"God\\" is an idea based on nothing but the need of man for comfort? I assure you, your God's consequences are of little concern to Rand's genius mind, especially because you created your God's opinions to mirror your own. The fact alone that you \\"believe\\" in something that has no basis in fact proves that you do not think, and so your review should be deemed irrelevant and irresponsible by those who have taken the time to read it.Then there are the whiny quasi-intellectuals to whom the book seemed too long. Wow. I can't even respond to that. These are the sort of people who watch MTV News because everything comes in short sound bytes and is accompanied by background music. I didn't know you people could even read...To the gentleman from Australia: Rand does not rail against second-handers sir, because she has a personal vendetta; she systematically destroys their scared, weak arguments because they are (now pay attention) categorically, OBJECTIVELY wrong. This means that your sad-sack emotions do not count. I didn't realize that the proclamation (and all that it entails), \\"A is A\\" is trivial.These reviewers attack Rand's style of writing and her symbolism, but notice if you will that there are no attacks on Rand's actual philosophy. Could this be because no one has the guts (or, more likely, the mind) to do so? Perhaps...To the reader who labels himself a \\"Former Objectivist\\", why are you so afraid of the truth? Who deserves existence? Is this a question that you are in a position to answer? Isn't the objective answer, \\"Those who want to exist\\"? Do those who live off of others deserve their lives? If so, why? The only way to exhibit one's will to live is to live for oneself, not forsaking others, but demanding nothing less than one's own committment to life.I think that the people who disparaged this book are afraid of what would really happen if all the productive people disappeared.You shouldn't read people's reviews in order to substitute others' thoughts for your own. All I ask is that you think, objectively, for yourselves, without fear. Without emotional meanderings.

The sad truth is that we need it more than ever. The forces that believe that it is correct to steal the productivity of creators from them and give them to the state are as alive as ever. The myth of Robin Hood is still alive. Just recently Hilary Clinton told a group of wealthy contributors, We are going to have to take some of your income from you for the common good. Common good??? Read Atlas Shrugged and the veil will be removed from your eyes that phrases like common good are used only by self-serving charlatans.Though I do not consider Atlas Shrugged a perfect literary work, reading it provided me with one of the richest reading experiences I've ever had."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am going to get the one negative part out of the way. The book is over 1000 pages long. While I think it is a great book it seemed to me that Ayn Rand often took the very long scenic route. About 200-300 pages in I started skipping sentences and later even whole paragraphs. I kept hearing my mind: Ok, I got it! It felt like how many times can you write about the same thing using different words. I even skipped half the speech. To me it felt like watching a movie and in the middle of it you have to listen to the entire State of the Union address....I wanted to get back to the story.The story centers around Dagny Taggart. She and her brother James are heirs to Taggart Transcontinental, a rail road. The story was written over 50 years ago, so it was James who took over the rail road, but it was Dagny who had the desire and was the one capable of running it. Yet she was a woman, and a woman at that time did not belong in a position like that, but she did not care about that. Her hard work earned her the respect of the workers and contempt of her brother.The book shows what happends when the ones who make this country great had enough of the ones who want to redistribute the wealth (other peoples wealth) and if anyone disagrees with their progressive views, they demonize them in public and call them greedy and selfish. I laught when I found out what really happened to the Rio Norte line. I thought to myself, good for you, when I found out what Ellis Wyatt did and I could not blame anyone who left the looters behind.What I loved about the book is that Ayn Rand had such a great understanding on how the world works and the evils out to destroy it. In the last half century nothing much has changed. The only reason this country is still great, is because there are still enough people who are capable of producing wealth who are willing to fight the looters and progressives of todays world. It was scary to read about regulations, forcing businesses to share even if it meant that some would be forced to shut down as a result. A directive, where no one was allowed to quit their job with no possibility of advancement unless the Unification Board approved it. Some of those job and freedom killing regulations sounded very familiar in todays world: Card Check, the fairness doctrine - nothing fair about this one, the proposed FCC's net nutrality rule regarding the internet.

Whether you agree or disagree with Rand (and she is not without her faults) this book will make you think. If you prefer to simply attack persons who don't ascribe to your narrow way of thinking, I don't expect this book could help you.

No offense to those of you who did not enjoy this book, but in reading many of the reviews on this page, it seems to me that we have a few John Galts and many James Taggarts, right here on this webpage. That in itself proves that Rand is right about the people of the world - there really are two types (three if you separate the looters from the moochers), and there's no changing which one you are.The people who love Ayn Rand's work are the ones that drive the world and who understand the loneliness of being a John Galt or a Howard Roarke in a world full of people who want to tear them down for having the audacity to take pride in work well done. I suspect the people who hate her work or say they &quot;don't get it&quot;, hate it PRECISELY because they DON'T see those characters in themselves - instead, what they see in themselves is a Lillian Rearden, or a James Taggart - any or all of those other characters - and they despise Rand for rubbing their noses in it.

If you are a visionary and want to change the world in a big way, be it a new product, or just bringing society into the 21st century, then this book is for you. First, I'll say that I don't agree with everything Ayn Rand says here, and in some points, she overdoes it, and does not explain capitalism rightly (she prefers Laissez-Faire), but it's a good book nonetheless. Although she wrote this book in the 1950s, and it was set in the (then) present, this book is timeless. It applies today as it did back then.Before going any further, it has been said that this book appeals to Republicans (which I'm not) and that the rich they are referring to in real life are like the heros in this book. They're not! They're the moochers! These people who find themselves in the position of CEO on Wall Street or a major corporation are not the heros in the book who either invented a great new product (Reardon Metal by Hank Reardon) or want to improve a railway company, making it a first class company once again (Dagney Taggert). No, these people in real life that you read so much about are simply people who got advanced degrees in economics, got into a high position, and left with a multi-million dollar severance pay in which they did little or nothing during their tenure. For example, a CEO from Exxon got a $400 million severance package, while thousands of workers were laid off. A coincidence? I don't think so. No, these modern day \\"rich\\" who try to pay little or nothing in taxes are the moochers. Where are the productive rich? Those who invent and prosper? Those who contribute, with a first class product? Do you see any of these around?Okay, I got that off my chest, comparing Atlas Shrugged to the real world of today, and exposing these real moochers for what they really are.Now, as I've said, the real heros are a steel duke (Hank Reardon), a CEO who is trying to upgrade her family's railroad (Dagney Taggert) but gets stopped, by of all people, her brother; a pirate (Ragner Danneskjold), who only sinks ships and destroys industries who themselves steal from the rightful innovators, the above mentioned characters; an oilman, Ellis Wyatt, and of course, a mystery man whom everyone is asking about, John Galt.While the world is telling all these innovators that they have to share everything they have, and play by the rules of the government, which is slowly strangling these productive companies, the executives start to disappear, one by one, until no one is left, and the world is left not knowing what to do, thereby drowning in their own poisons.This is putting it lightly, and I don't want to spoil it for you, but the plot is interesting. Also, Ms. Rand brings up amazing inventions. A new type of generator that can take electricity from the atmosphere, ways to get oil from shale (sound familiar?), and of course, Reardon Metal, much stronger than steel.With all this, one's own imagination can start to wander as he or she reads this book.Of course, there is the philosophy of Objectivism, which is simply the virtue of selfishness. Now many of the conversations that take place in the book are philosophical discussions, or even monologues. Much of this is drawn out, and these areas require several readings (refer to Rand's book, \\"For The New Intellectual.\\" They're all in there) but there are a few common sense items. When Hank Reardon's brother, who is a mooch, bitterly complains why Hank should be the boss of the house, Hank responds, \\"Because I'm the one who pays the bills.\\" Something every teenager should think about before arguing with his parents. Also, Rand simply teaches that one thing everyone has to learn is to say \\"No!\\" when necessary.The book is long, there is a lot of philosophy, but the plot is good. I don't think society goes as far as Rand depicts it by saying that everyone exists for the good of everyone else, but looking at what we are facing today in real life, we could be headed in that direction.Also, I don't think money is the cure-all or end-all. But it helps!This book is definitely worth reading. Even if you don't agree with everything she says, read it anyway. If you can, get the hard cover edition, or a trade paperback. If you get the regular size, the print is extremely small, but if you can read that (I could at 17), more power to you.If you haven't read Rand, start with \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Anthem\\" before going on to \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" It's worth it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is an excellent novel that I thought would take me forever to finish. Rather than weigh the reader down with obsessive amounts of detail Rand uses a perfect amount of information to tell her story. Although I personally do not agree with Objectivism, I found her novel very compelling and read for long stretches at a time. Her characters are very easy to picture, though can be hard to fully relate to.I recommend buying the e-book version. I have found that longer books are easier to read without the constant pressure to check how many pages you have left or carrying around a novel bigger than your head."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Considering this was written 60 years ago, the parallels to what is happening in our society today were amazing. Depending on your political viewpoint, you'll either love it or not bother reading it. The book could have been about half as long. There were three scenes that I thought were amazing but just went on a bit too long. When you read it, you'll know which ones they are. I just skimmed over them once I got the idea of the message. Took me a long time to get through the whole thing, but it was definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It took me two months to read this book and I enjoyed every word. If you want to fully understand what everyone who mentions Atlas Shrugged is talking about, and who the heck John Galt is, it is well worth the effort. You don't have to agree with everything Rand says and her philosophy of Objectivism to appreciate her genius in storytelling and the value of having ideals and standards.I have read reviews that complain about the characters being flat and unrealistic. I think you have to get over this and understand that every character is really a symbol or a tool to help the reader understand Rand's philosophy. You have to understand the format of the work and cannot compare it to other novels that develop characters in a different way. Personally, I loved reading the dialogues between all the characters, particularly Dagny, Reardon and Francisco because their deliveries were so cool-minded and controlled. I would love to be able to talk like that sometimes!I kept a long list of characters and companies and organizations as they were mentioned in the story and this list helped me keep track of the hundreds of references that appear. What I found most impressive about Rand was that, despite the 1070 pages in my version, there are no unnecessary references. If you meet a character or read about something on page 100, you can be sure it is important and you will see the reference again, even if it is 500 pages later."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Interesting and different from a lot of books I have read. Government, personalities and big business all play a part in this novel. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I can honestly say that this book was a source of great inspiration for me at a time when I really needed some. Last year, my junior year of high school, I was, for various reasons, suffering from a profound lack of intellectual self-esteem. I have always been a very bright student, but I got to the point of wondering if, perhaps, my parents and all the adults who knew me had made some sort of grave mistake. Then my philosophy teacher, as a sort of respite from the back-breaking work we had been doing, had us read Atlas Shrugged during the last two weeks of class (and not from a personal bias of his...he himself is a Marxist). I literally couldn't put it down; my parents told me off a few times for trying to sneak in little snippets of reading during mealtimes. When I finished, I had to, in a sense, \\"step back\\" in order to appreciate what I had read. The thing that hit me most was something that I think many people fail to grasp: Rand's great industrialists, artists, philosophers, etc. are not Nietzchean supermen. They are simply people who have worked to hone their abilities and be the best at what they do. Anyone capable of thinking is capable of succeeding.Seeing this presented to me in such a blunt, straightforward, rational manner was like a much-needed slap in the face. I realized that I had been a fool to think that I was incapable of success. I also gained new respect for humanity as a whole. Many people sadly spurn and reject their fellows when they read Ayn Rand, because they see others as somehow weak or evil. Let's set one thing straight: the only thing intrisic to human beings is being human. How can one feel disdain toward another human being while at the same time knowing the vast things that that person, as a human being, is capable of? Selfishness in the Objectivist sense is not the greedy, all-consuming obsession with oneself at the expense of everything and everyone else. Rather, it is working always toward what is best for oneself, realizing that one has the right to do so, and realizing that others have the right to do the same.This is not a novel in the conventional sense, nor is it meant to be. It is a treatise on a philosophical point of view and on its applications and repercussions. The reason for the length of the book is its thoroughness; Rand covers the application of Objectivism in literally every area of life, from business to friendship to sex. Yes, there are definitely flaws in the book. John Galt's famous 50-page speech could definitely have been cut in half, and I will confess to skimming after the first 15 pages or so. However, I don't think that this detracts significantly from the greatness of the book, and so I can let it slide.I do feel compelled to say that, while this book did wonders for me, that was a personal thing. It will not have the same effect on you, because you are a different person in different circumstances. My problem was purely psychological; I was not depressed in the medical sense, and so a change in my state of mind was what I needed and what this book was able to supply. Besides not being a panacea, this is not a book to take as dogma. To unquestioningly accept all the principles and premises of Atlas Shrugged violates the spirit of the book; remember, the highest action a person can perform is to THINK. Question the book, argue about it, dissect its arguments and see what makes them tick. If, after all that, you still find yourself agreeing with Rand, then you can consider yourself an Objectivist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Most people view this book as religion or doctrine. I just enjoyed it as a good read. The story is really superb. Yes, the characters do enjoy many 10 page diatribes. After the first 10 or so, I learned to skim these. They are all basically the same thing regurgitated one million and one ways.The characters struggles, all so different were the most interesting part to me. How John, Francisco, Hank, Dagny all got to the same place at vastly different times was great food for thought. I thought Hank Rearden was the most complex and interesting character in the book. The \\"evil\\" characters were all differently written and interesting--definately adding extra layers to the story. John Galt was a cult figure and written as one. He seems like a hero, but also drawn that way, a bit flat and one dimensional. I think that was intentional.The philosophy Ms. Rand raises is interesting and intriguing. I think that it is a bit idealistic. But the philosophy edge really raises the story to another level of entertainment. Not only do you get to enjoy a great read, but it's something you can think about long after the story is finished and talk about to others. That is what makes it truly great.Highly recommended. I enjoyed it the second time I read it. You get a lot of the hints she intersperses throughout."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It doesn't matter how you look at it - as a piece of literature or as a philosophy on life - either way it is truly a work of art. No wonder this book has been talked about for decades. I had never read such a lengthy novel before (and my only qualm with the book is that it truly could have been shorter without losing any impact) but I was incredibly glad I did read this one by the time I was finished.The protagonist is quite inspirational on many levels. Overcoming incredible odds in her job, her family, her life in general. The theme of the story has truth that will never get old or outdated.Pick up this book and stay with it through the end. It's amazing, and you will be so glad you did."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My experience with Ayn Rand began with my AP English teacher begging me to read the Fountainhead. A beginner to her Objectivist Philosophy, I quickly fell in love with her writing. I am only 17 years old and I feel as if Atlas Shrugged has forever changed my life. In our non-individualistic world today, Rand's characters are very much impossible to find. After reading Atlas Shrugged, I feel as if I have to strive to be someone like her characters. I believe, like myself, many others have felt this way after reading this incredible story. We may not be able to &quot;stop the motor of the world,&quot; but we certainly can try. I believe this book is a most read for all young adults, especially those in high school and college. This book is a lesson in the importance of thought and reason. In some aspects (especially in high school) the individual and his freedom of thought is not welcome because of social attitudes and overall ignorance on others parts. I can proudly say that this book has brought out the best there is in me. I AM AN INDIVIDUAL. I will never again rely on another man or woman instead of thinking for myself and following my own judgment. I recommend that anyone who has any true values and is a rational being should read this book. If you read Atlas Shrugged and cannot understand why I or anyone else love this book, than you are not a person of true values. In Rand's written words: &quot; I swear- by my life and my love of it- that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book to me was not quite as good as the Fountainhead and a little too redundant, but Ayn Rand has created a fascinating storyline...the people who seem to get upset at her philosophy seem to be the people who don't understand. For one thing, this is a STORY people, intended to prove a point via exaggeration perhaps. Her philosophy is black and white because how else can you so specifically define your views? Nobody is forcing anyone into narcissism...maybe just trying to elicit a redefinition of your basic priorities. This was an inspiring and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"(PP) As one reviewer on this page has already alluded, a quick page-down through the reviews of Atlas Shrugged provides an excellent proxy of how politically and philosophically divisive this book really is: Rand's magnum opus either receives a resounding affirmation (nine or ten rating) or a similarly resounding rebuke (one to three rating). There are both knee-jerk and considered comments from both sides, but as always the most puerile comments come from opponents of Rand. (PP) One common objection is that Atlas Shrugged is to preachy, too didactic, too boring. This is true if the book is read without an active intelligence and is even more true if it is not read as it was meant to be read: as a treatise of philosophy. The uniqueness of this work can only be fully appreciated when one understands that Rand advanced, in literary form, a system of philosophy almost wholly of her own creation and as part of that philosophy devised an epistemological system based on Aristotle's metaphysics that Aristotle himself could not extrapolate from his own massive, seminal contributions to the field (non-contradiction, either or, A is A--contributions which Rand respectively pays homage to in the three parts of the novel). As central to this new epistemology, she advances a flagrantly controversial yet devastatingly consistent theory of thought formation (measurement-omission), builds a theory of rational, ego-based ethics upon it (defending man's right to his own mind and body, the first such defense in history) and also unveils a philosophical defense of capitalism based on egoist ethics, a first in human history. She also refutes of the separation of man into either mind or body, passionately arguing that both are inseparable, exposes the true motivations of most collectivist philosophers, politicians, and artists, and shows that human knowledge is both hierarchical and contextual in nature, refuting the contextless philosophy of the logical positivists of the day. She manages to wrap all of this into a novel that is a tribute to her chosen literary style, Romanticism, and is a through-the-uprights thriller to boot. If this is boring to some readers, it is because they have elected to prejudge the book in order to comport to their idea of what they believe it is and what they believe it stands for; this rush to judgment all too common among opponents of Rand.(PP) The second most common &quot;objection&quot; to Atlas Shrugged voiced on this page should not be worthy of comment, but unfortunately it needs to be addressed and then exposed as the leftist/collectivist trash that it is. When a leftist/collectivist cannot refute an idea, he or she smears an opponent as hard-hearted, mean-spirited, and all too often as a Nazi. This term has long dogged conservatives and has also become currency among collectivists when arguing against proponents of Objectivism, which in their ignorance they regard as interchangeable with conservatism. This is not only an insult to true, philosophically consistent defenders of freedom (as opposed to the anemic, truncated and vague natural rights theory mixed with theology advanced by conservatives), but is also an insult to Rand herself, a Russian Jew by birth. References to Objectivists or Rand as &quot;Nazis&quot; or &quot;Aryans&quot; speaks to both the historical and philosophical ignorance of her opponents as well as their impotence in formulating any kind of cogent refutation to an articulated philosophy of reason. Then again, it's hard to argue with reality. To those who still think Objectivists have anything in common with white supremacists, or are some kind of apologists for Nazi Germany, try to remember that one of the first things Hitler did after toppling Weimar Germany and becoming Chancellor in 1933 was to collectivize (read: socialize) the means of production and get rid of supporters of democracy. Then he proceeded to get rid of Germany's weaker band of barbarians: the Communists. Collectivists are all cut from the same cloth; this is a fact that all dedicated readers of Atlas Shrugged are well apprised of. If those who casually fling about these bromides were to entertain a close, objective reading of Atlas Shrugged, I believe that we would see an end to callous, offhand references to Objectivists as anything other than defenders of freedom and true, consistent natural rights theory in the Western tradition.(PP) I give this book, as you may have guessed, an unqualified ten. It is peerless as an integration of literature and philosophy, and it is peerless in its influence on minds that take the time to imbibe its wisdom. In short, this book is one of the greatest contributions to mankind ever penned. Read it with awe and gratitude to its author and then go out and live it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It seems a bit silly to write a \\"review\\" of a book like Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand's 1000+ page &uuml;bernovel. To do so would be kind of like scrawling \\"I liked it\\" with a Sharpie marker at the base of the Statue of Liberty. Thus, what follows is not a review. These are just some thoughts. Atlas Shrugged is a novel that makes you think.Arranged in no particular order, and with no particular intellectual formidableness, here are a few wispy cirrus clouds of thoughts prompted by Atlas Shrugged.Plot spoilers: I've attempted to keep these thoughts free of plot spoilers, but if you want to treasure the pristine experience of reading the novel for yourself without outside influence, don't read on.Stories Are Awesome Communication Tools.My three-year-old daughter loves stories. She could sit for hours and listen to stories (if it weren't for my inability to think of so many stories in such rapid succession). I think that humans in general are wired to love stories. It naturally follows, then, that stories are great vehicles for communicating truth. The Bible is full of stories. Jesus told stories. Stories stick.Ayn Rand used a massive story as a way to communicate her philosophy. Atlas Shrugged is not just a novel. It is a philosophical novel. The story is her tool for communicating her philosophy. If it were just a philosophy book, written in the prosaic method that philosophers so love, I probably wouldn't have touched it. Packaged as a novel, I devoured it.Apart from multi-hour conversations and lengthy speeches sprinkled throughout, the plot moves quickly. Character development is entrancing. Dialogue is plenteous. Conflict is pronounced. Atlas has all the trappings of a novel, but the force of a well-stated philosophy.I'm convinced of the power of stories to communicate truth, and I think this is a principle I can carry into writing, speaking, and other forums of communication.It's More Than a Philosophy. It's a Religion.In Atlas, Rand is proposing more than a philosophy. She is teaching the foundational principles of a religion, complete with a doctrine of God (theology proper), doctrine of man (anthropology), doctrine of sin (hamartiology), doctrine of end times (eschatology), etc. She even has a doctrine of the atonement--\\"the rebirth of man's spirit\\" in the divinity of \\"rational self-interest.\\"This is a religion. This is a false religion.Some Christians attempt to patch up Rand's philosophy by putting a bit of a God spin on it. One Christian reader stated that Rand's ideas are actually consistent with the Bible's teaching to seek our own good and sacrifice for others. I'm not sure this works. Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy plus God does not equal everything's okay.It is not enough merely to add God to a philosophy, any philosophy, to make it right. Rand's philosophy is systemically antichristian from the very start. Let me provide just one example to prove my point. This is drawn from the structure of the novel. The structural climax (as opposed to the plot climax) of the book is when Dagny Taggart literally crash lands into a utopian society--a society which is thoroughly capitalistic and profit-driven. There is no government, no external control; there is simply capitalistic perfection in a microcosmic society. It is Rand's picture of heaven. At this point in the novel, the heroes of the story meet for dinner. In the lengthy conversation that follows, you can ascertain the subversive strands of a philosophy that is virulently antithetical to Christianity. For example, one character explains that we \\"ought not wait for heaven...We want to hear \`well done' from the people whom we love and respect.\\" Another says that he rejects \\"faith, hope, and charity\\" in favor of \\"proof, profits, and money.\\" John Galt, the novel's hero, asserts that he \\"refus[es] to be born with original sin.\\" The conversation among these major characters (\\"Atlantis,\\" Part III, Ch. 1) lays the theological foundation for the application later on (\\"This Is John Galt Speaking,\\" Part III, Ch. 7).In the novel, the good guys are the people who are greedy, selfish, and immoral. The bad guys are the guys who insist on social justice, and equalization. This is the moral tone of the novel. These are the tenets of Rand's religion.Economic Model and Life Philosophy Are Closely Intertwined.In the section that follows, I'm going to talk about capitalism and philosophy. I am not going to say that if you're a capitalist, then you're a reprobate pagan Randyan objectivist. Instead, I'm suggesting 1) that capitalism can sometimes stem from an anti-biblical philosophy, 2) that capitalism is not necessarily the only right or Christian way, and 3) some cautions against capitalism gone awry (which it has the tendency to do).Rand's economic philosophy goes hand-in-hand with her moral philosophy. Actually, the two are inseparable. Read this, the belief system succinctly stated by Rand in her appendix to Atlas. \\"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\" Thus, while Dagny Taggart, Hank Rearden, and John Galt are devoted to building business and earning profit (economic), they are also committed to fulfilling their passions (moral). The two are inextricable.Since man lives for \\"his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life,\\" then one's happiness is the ultimate arbiter in moral decisions. Where does this lead? It leads to this: Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden are involved in a long-term extramarital affair (otherwise known as \\"adultery\\"), which leads to a divorce. Francisco d'Anconia and John Galt are each sexually involved with Dagny as well. The moral tone of the novel endorses such promiscuous moral decisions. In fact, the novel actually defends and glorifies this kind of moral behavior. According to the philosophy lived out by the heroes of Atlas, such behavior is just and right.To sum up, Rand's politico-economic philosophy is capitalism, driven by human reason and personal happiness. Rand's ethic is self-interest, driven by human reason and personal happiness. The result of both is thoroughly counter-biblical and immoral. Economic greed and moral selfishness are derived from the same overall philosophy--rational self-interest.I've Seen This Before.I can see shadows of this (i.e., that economic model and life philosophy are closely intertwined) in American conservative Christian thought and behavior. Many American conservative Christians identify with right-wing politics and conservative economics. There is nothing inherently immoral or unethical in conservative economics, but like any human system it has dangerous tendencies. It is, I think, impossible to extricate one's political/economic philosophy from one's overall life philosophy. They are intertwined, deep within one's axiological and epistemological moorings. Thus, while one may espouse biblical Christianity as one's nominal worldview, there may be syncretistic strains of a counter-biblcal economic philosophy. Possessing a conservative economic or political viewpoint, is not the same as having a biblical or Christian worldview.The biblical worldview allows for other strains of thought, political theory, and economic philosophy. The biblical worldview does not preclude capitalism, appropriately constrained, but it does not require it. Biblical worldview does not require any single political viewpoint or economic theory.Although one's overall economic theory may not necessarily be pegged as moral or immoral, the decision-making and actions that flow from such theory may be either moral or immoral. So, let's say you adopt Rand's economic philosophy--capitalism. What actions does this lead to? In Atlas, the characters who adopt this philosophy are driven to wreck their homes, disdain their family members, curse fellow man, divorce their spouses, engage in piracy, blow up ships, kill people, wreak massive unemployment, commit immorality, break the law, and other bad stuff. Seriously. And it's all under the pretense of \\"rational self interest.\\" And in the philosophical matrix of Atlas, this is considered good and right.The Christian ought to thoroughly reject rational self-interest as a way of life.Danger, Danger, Capitalism.Alarmingly, much of conservative American economics and politics, so embraced by conservative Christians, has within it the propensity toward such actions. Capitalism, the preferred choice of so many American Christians, is essentially about making money--more of it. Can this be a good thing? Sure! Money (and love) make the world go round. But along with money comes a serious danger: the love of money. The Bible blares out this warning: \\"the love of money is the root of all kinds of evils\\" (1 Timothy 6:10). What brings contentment? More money? No, not if this is true: \\"if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content\\" (1 Timothy 6:8). Much of capitalism is about the desire to become \\"rich,\\" even if we drape that desire in verbiage like \\"higher profit margins,\\" \\"increased GDP,\\" and \\"improved standard of living.\\" Come on. This is nothing but the desire to be rich. \\"Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction\\" (1 Timothy 6:9).The materially pampered American conservative Christian capitalist &lt;what a string of descriptors!> hurries to add layers of explanation and disclaimers to such raw biblical statements, but the truth persists: wanting to be rich is to open yourself up to temptation, stupidity, and destruction. The money passage in 1 Timothy ends with a chilling reminder: \\"it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith\\" (1 Timothy 6:10).In the Bible, we have a stark warning against dysfunctional capitalism. If capitalism is one's personal economic viewpoint, it must be tightly regulated within these biblical guardrails. In Atlas, Rand has removed the guardrails, blown up the road, and paved a broad path to perdition in terms of her philosophy.I'm all about free market economics, limited government, and a fair-handed economic model, but I am driven to reject Rand's philosophy, the whole point of Atlas, and the dangers that issue forth from following her philosophy, even in areas as allegedly amoral as economics.So, What's the Right Way?In warning against capitalism, I'm not espousing some other system, whether Marxism or otherwise. Neither socialism nor capitalism provide a sufficient answer to the evils that is brought about by the love of money or power. Ayn Rand insists that capitalism is the only right way, stating in so many words, that \\"[capitalism] is the only moral social system.\\" In her essay on ethics (\\"The Objectivist Ethics\\") she wrote, \\"The moral justification of capitalism lies in the fact that it is the only system consonant with man's rational nature, that it protects man's survival qua man, and that its ruling principle is: justice.\\" Like Rand, many Christians assert that capitalism is the only moral way, insisting that it is 100% accordance with Jesus, the Bible, and, oh...well, you know, lots of other Bible references.When we think about capitalism, about economic theory, about money, we need to think about stewardship, one of the key biblical concepts surrounding money. Within a biblical philosophy of stewardship is a compendium of references regarding giving to others. Who are the recipients of this giving? The poor and underprivileged (regardless of how the poor and underprivileged became poor and underprivileged). Why, then, do we ridicule socialism and uphold capitalism, as if God were against one and for the other? Could we conceive of a God who is for socialism, as evidenced by the way that He employed a complex and thorough socialistic structure in Israel's theocracy? Red scare, I know, but I'm just musing out loud.I do not stand in opposition to the idea of capitalism as a theory. I stand in opposition, however, to any system which asserts to be, without warrant, \\"God's way\\" or the only right way. In order to ascertain \\"God's way,\\" we have to look to the Scripture. If the Scripture does not delineate a system, then we should not necessarily espouse one system as the best. In this, I am a relativist. And if so, then I am a relativist in the same way that the Bible is relativist.ConclusionIs Atlas Shrugged a fascinating novel? Absolutely. Is it a fun read? Oh yes. Do you feel like you should receive graduate credit for reading the whole thing? Ja.In critiquing the philosophy behind Atlas, I am not trying to engage in a throw-out-the-baby-and-bathwater fest. There are some sweet quotables, tweetables, and incisive passages. I'm simply saying that it is dangerous to embrace the philosophy en toto, and even worse, to say that adding \\"biblical\\" or tacking \\"God\\" onto the perspective makes it any more acceptable.Atlas Shrugged is a book that is dedicated to the elimination of God, and the exaltation of man. Rand said it best, \\"If a dedication page were to precede the total of my work, it would read: To the glory of Man\\" (Romantic Manifesto)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Great book . . . but how come it costs $18.99 for Kindle and $9.00 in paper back? Come on Amazon . . . that is highway robbery!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Since I grew up in the Soviet Union, it is not surprising I had never heard of Ayn Rand until the day my \\"liberal\\" coworkers told me I might like her writings based on my \\"conservative\\" and \\"capitalist\\" beliefs. Thanks to them I now have a favorite writer, Ayn Rand.Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, \\"the cradle of the Great October Socialist Revolution\\". She was \\"lucky\\" to live there for 8 more years after the revolution until she moved to the United States. So when she describes in her novel what happens when the looters come to power and the brains leave, she writes from her experience and not from her imagination.There are people who think that Atlas Shrugged is a utopia novel and the events described in it would never be possible in the United States. In my opinion, it's not about the geographic location or even the laws of the country. It is about the predominant beliefs in the society. When the people's belief system becomes distorted by the pseudo liberal ideas, the people tend to fall for the populist leaders who talk in slogans and read long and boring speeches from TelePrompTers. They feel for those \\"who never had a chance\\" and blame everything that goes wrong on the rich. What they tend to ignore is the simple truth that those \\"who have\\" will always be able to start from scratch some place else even you you take all their property and \\"means of production\\" away. And those \\"who never had a chance\\" will remain losers even if you give them all the property you stole from the rich.P.S. I also cannot help but notice that the people who identify with Ayn Rand's ideas are usually more creative and independent. They also tend to look younger than their age and are more attractive phisically. Good observation, Mrs. Rand!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read this voluminous book 3 times. Like anything else you take what is good from it. I was never an Objectionist, I just love the individulaistic ideals presented in the story and I loved the heroic characters who did what they felt was right in spite of the world being against them. To me that has always been the theme of the book. But what is amazing is how over the years I have seen the very frightening government policies which were parodies in the book come to life. In a way it has been quite prophetic. Ayn Rand herself was a very flawed character so I would never want to emulate her life. But the idea of individuals standing against a world which wants to destroy the sanctity of freedom of thought and ideas is very attractive in an age of political correctness and government intrusion into private property, businesses and lives."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I thought this was an excellent novel.

No deep meanings, no literary terminology, just a realization of what some people see as the only right way to go and how helpless we could all end up. I've never had a book change me before but this one did. It made me look at the way I live my life and decide, do I want to be a looter, or a producer?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Things I liked about Atlas Shrugged:1) It talks about people being creative in the kinds of jobs that are not considered to be so- engineering, smelting, dispatching,etc. and damned if she doesn't make it exciting.2) The sex is pretty hot.3) It makes some pretty great arguements that if a person is personally fulfilled and honest about their needs, they have more to offer the world.4) I couldn't tell what was going to happen next.5) The secret hide away- that was a cool thing, too bad they had to do work while they were there.6) The clever little ways the master plan was carried out-I love clever.Not so thrilled about:1) Hardly any kids, with a book so concerned about the future it came off strange.2) The &quot;One good woman&quot; syndrome. For most of the book, there was Dabney, with a bunch of really hot men drooling. Which was funny, because it's a fantasy that most(me)have.(Okay, her sister-in-law that commited suicide was &quot;good&quot;, but she died, so that doesn't count)3) The repetetiveness, and the everlasting long time it would take to read the whole of it. I skipped ALOT, pretty much whenever I saw a speech coming on-- I don't want to even talk about that last radio anouncement, I gave it a try since it was what she'd built the entire book on, but MY GOD (or MY SELF if we want to be objectivist) it was windy and boring, I wussed and skipped."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ATLAS SHRUGGED is one of the most inspiring, influential, yet altogether misunderstood novel of the twentieth century. I have found that most people who criticize it did not &quot;get it.&quot; I've heard arguments that to be completely selfish is rediculous and irresponsible. What these people don't understand is that they already follow this very principle themselves. They just don't know it. One hallmark of a great novel it that you learn something about yourself. This book wasn't meant to teach Objectivist Epistimology. It was meant to illustrate it. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. (I've read it three times!)

The way you look at the world changes when you read this book. Although as it approaches its end it appears fictitious and too dramatic. But there are some good characters and there is a lot to learn from this book. Nice!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In my younger days, I, too, was enamored with ideas of Capitalism, Social Darwinism, and work-your-way-to-the-top industriousness. Then I entered high school, and wised up a little. It was at that time I decided to pick up Rand's monolithic tome and look for some kind of justification of my previous worldview. Little did I know it would shatter it completely, and push me even farther away from its simple-minded philosophy.At the heart of the book is a logical contradiction so glaringly obvious I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone point it out yet: The industry and aquisition the book so heartily endoreses is inherently based on service and interdependence. The main character runs a rairoad, a SERVICE intended to get OTHER PEOPLE from point A to point B. His individual succes is defined by his providing something for others. He may be a \\"creator\\" to use the book's term, but what he's creating isn't for himself, or it wouldn't work. As it stands, he's spending his time and energy directing this effort and reaping the rewards. But that's ALL he can do. Someone else lays those tracks. Someone else builds those trains. Someone else runs them and maintains them. Someone else freshens the passenger's drinks and makes sure they have a pleasant experience so they'll come back. Someone else makes the uniforms, chairs, clocks, logbooks, tools, and all the other things it takes to run a railroad. Someone else mines the coal, mines the iron, smelts it, transports it, markets it, and does all the other things necessary to build the railroad in the first place. And someone else makes THEIR clothes, grows their food, builds their houses, and so on. Barring advanced nanotechnology and AI, All these things need to be done by people, who are just as valuable a part of the \\"machine\\" of civilization as the \\"Captain of Industry\\" at the top who collects the profits; the idea of his independence is a fallacy, and Rand's libertarian \\"Atlantis\\" could not be any different if it expects a standard of living beyond that enjoyed by, say, a squirrel.Our square-jawed Objectivist hero is no more and no less importaint than the mechanic who makes sure the trains don't fall apart in mid-journey or the conductor who makes sure the trains are actually useful. He's as much of a cell in the body of the company as anyone else and he's deluding himself to think otherwise. He is nothing without the people below him, on whom he relies to make his vision into reality, and the customers his railroad serves, who provide the rescources(namely money) needed to keep it alive. To discard them as moochers and looters is asinine and self-destructive, an anathema to any form of \\"self-interest.\\" It would be like breaking all your bones because they don't \\"do\\" anything.While Rand's idea of an individual striving to achieve all that he or she can is admirable, the repugnant selfishness and contempt for her Fellow Man completely sour that message and turn the book into a thinly-veild endoresement for dog-eat-dog anarchy. Rationalist objectivity, indeed! As long as humans remain a technological species we have no choice but to be interdependent or starve to death.I suppose I should also examine the book from a literary perspective, since, after all, this thing IS supposed to be a book review, but in the case of Atlas Shrugged it's not really a meaningful thing to focus on, seeing as the book is essentially just a vehicle for Rand's philosophy. It would be like analyzing the directing choices in an infomercial. Nevertheless, I found the writing competent and tolerable. While some of the dialogue and turns of phrase left me scratching my head as to how anyone could think they sounded natural, they at least showed some effort and imagination, and the premise IS relatively original. Ms. Rand displays obvious intelligence; it's a shame she hasn't paired it with insight."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The sheer number of reviews on this page is evidence of the value and effect her work has had on so many. I've devoured the works of Ayn Rand, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hugo, Shakespeare, The Bible, and she stands above them all. Actually, she stands with the founding fathers of America.The animosity and isolation some feel after reading her work is common. Her depiction of how things should be, makes many choices we witness in the world that much more unbearable. Rand's own declared \\"loathing for humanity\\" unfortunately was transmitted to her students who often do not have the intellectual ammunition to overcome the negativity. The constructive abandon the hostility and grow to Galt's stature while the poor thinkers ultimately have to abandon Rand, in pace with their abandonment of ideals.Seeing the many asinine comments new readers are subjected to, such as the idiot speaking of the male hero in the book who runs the railroad, making it obvious he didn't even read the book (Dagny runs the railroad and is a woman), the trite crassness of making her every character out to be a joke, the literary attack of those who could never equal her, or those trying to convince new readers that Rand's ideas amount to the exact opposite of the civil, rational, honorable truths they actually amount to, somewhat justifies Rand's hostility. To them I say, \\"We do exist. We have all the treasures in fulfillment and wealth that you desire and we worked for them, just as you've earned your position and all the self-loathing it generates.\\" Hate us because we're happy.What did Rand actually stand for? She stood for the spirit that built this country. She stood for the greatness of America and her best people; the hardest working, the most passionately devoted and the most honest dealing. If you want to learn how life is lived by those at the very top, from a moral as well as a day to day actionable perspective, there is no better fiction work to show you than Atlas Shrugged.I went through the negative phase myself and fortunately, through Moral Armor, I solved it. The anger is gone, the pure happiness described when Dagny met Galt for the first time is mine as a constant, and I've mapped out the way for it to be yours. The next step past Atlas Shrugged has been taken to simplify the structure of Western Philosophy and remove the isolationist barriers between all sects, by drawing a deeper moral parallel between men than has ever existed.Atlas Shrugged gave me more than I can tell you, though it widened the breach between Christianity and Western Philosophy that Aristotle (through Aquinas) had closed. Rand followers are closer to the goal, but both sides have a bit to learn. Join me, and together we will reach Atlantis."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It has been a great century for philosophy, we have had Frege and Russell and Wittgenstein. We have had the naturalistic fallacy and there is great work on ethics. However, Ayn Rand, having completely ignored these achievements and the achievements of other great thinkers such as Hume specifically, decides to dish out meaningless rubbish, poorly defined and meaningless. Unfortunately a large proportion of the human race cannot come to grips with the problems of belief and existence and of life and cannot accept the complex nature of morality and existence and conscience and the lack of an all encompassing theory and instead dogmatically follows this crappy doctrine of s***. It appears even the rulers of colony of America have succumb to it, one can only hope the natural strength of the British can stop this plague encroaching upon our shores.Moreover the book is horrendous. It is too bloody long, the prose is bland and the characterisation dull and bias. Foolish 99% protect yourself from this dogma!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"So disappointing. I loved Fountainhead but not this. Wading through the cumbersome speeches gave no more insights to Rands point. I got it the first 100 times"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The writing is not especially good. The underlying philosophy is contrary to Christian values (yet this is oddly very popular with conservative Christians). I honestly had to force myself to finish this. It is a cynical view of life that reflects an extreme \\"me first\\" view of humanity. How that meshes with the words of Christ (compare with the Sermon on the Mount, for example) or any religious tradition or humanistic view is totally unclear to me. Unfortunately, the children of the greatest generation (the baby boomers) have instilled a sense of extreme self-centeredness in our society. The hippies became Regan era yuppies and then morphed into angry and aging tea party members. The self-centered objectivism philosophy meets the needs of this very spoiled generation perfectly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book starts bad and ends worse. It's dull, preachy, and filled with flat charaters, who are either all good or all bad. At the end of the book she abandons the idea of writing a novel and just lectures on Objectivisms tennets for about 50 pages. Ultimately it just isn't worth it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First of all, she rips off Aristotle. Aristotle! the idiot who kept women and men in chains for thousands of years. As if a slave has the opportunity to be selfish! She also misses the point of Adam Smith's invisible hand, that ethics and self motivation go hand in hand. Second, her &quot;philosophy&quot; is so mind numbingly shallow, and politically motivated (!) that you have to be the least read person on earth to think it thought provoking. Worst of all, she writes like doo doo. IF you can get through the 1,000 pages, and good luck, you are the all time attention span world champion. Rand probably isn't all that controversial, just insipid and dull. The characters stink! The revelation: The Government is bad! Take care of your own needs! Believe in yourself! Self Determinism (tell that to the slaves, Aristotle). Capitalism ROCKS.LEAD US AYN, WE ARE YOUR HUMBLE SERVANTS. We live in darkness without you.You'd be better off reading Kahlil Gibran..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If your idea of Utopia is a society where the poor and disadvantaged are ground up like meat and thrown out like trash, you will love this book. If you have no compassion for your fellow man then this is your author. If you don't believe in God, you could care less if there are a billion abortions a year, then Ayn Rand is for you. This book is a disease, and if you ascribe to any faith or philosophy that involves compassion for your fellow man, you will be horrified. The fact that there are people that follow this tripe like it is a new religion frankly horrifies me. A follower of Objectivism is no different than a Satanist or Nihilist from a functional perspective. What a sad, sad world when this pedagogeury is passed off as philosophy. It simply appeals to the basest animal instincts and claims that the only thing that makes us truly human, compassion for our fellow man, is a failing. How very, very sad.Strangely, the book is very well written though. Ayn had a strong talent for the written word. Too bad she was so evil. After reading it, I thought it was a satire, a dark comedy.

It's best purpose is as a doorstop, or kindling.The plot is childish, the characters are thin, and writing is generally poor.It is apparent, that by this writing, English is Ms. Rand's second language, because she fails, in so many ways to convey her story line convincingly.Why so many people are using this as their political bible, is way beyond my comprehension. This is a book of pure fiction, and people want to base real life on it. This is quite absurd, in that there are few details on how all this should be accomplished in this book, which is on a level of reading and understanding which should be achieved in third grade."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Don't waste your time reading any of Rand's shrill garbage.

Anyone want to buy a Kindle cheap before I throw mine in the trash?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The fairest and simplest explanation of Objectivism is that its the philosophy of being a selfish jerk. It is self-congratulating narcissism esteemed as the highest virtue. If a certain part of society lack the intelligence or ambition to succeed well they probably weren't worth saving anyway so to heck with them.Rand equates anything remotely socialized in government as slavery and her ideal society amounts to...well, lets use her own quote:When I say \\"capitalism\\", I mean a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism--with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.Now hopefully I don't have to spell out the inherent problems in that, but it does seem eerily familiar to our pre-20th century society where everyone was stepped on but a few elite robber-barons who owned everything and treated the national economy as their personal playground to destabilize on a whim which is essentially the purpose behind John Galt and his group.Overall-Unlike some great books that are long and feel short because of the author's style and general readability Shrugged is long and feels longer. \\"Who is John Galt?\\" the speech is probably the best part of the book. It does a fairly good job of laying out the groundwork of the philosophy and I even find myself agreeing with parts but just because I agree with the book in parts doesn't mean I can't find the overall concept heartless and more then a little bit scary."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If Obama would be Rand's biggest nightmare, the resurgence of her philosophy would be mine. I was a fan at 17 (1960). Intellectually superior sex goddess heroines who dared to ...dabble in atheism - what wasn't there for a teenager to love? But I grew out of it. Atlas Shrugged is one of the worst books ever written, a slog to read and an adolescent philosophy. The knowledge that it helped to inform our fiscal policy (Alan Greenspan) for years, while explaining a lot of things, is troubling. The possibility that Paul Ryan may be the new John Galt is appalling. By the time I was finished with AS, I was finished with Rand as well. So I think we can safely assume that anyone over the age of 21 who still thinks it speaks to them is lost in late-adolescent wet dreams of power and an ill-deserved sense of superiority."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I heard that this book has influenced many of our political leaders. If that is true we are in a world of hurt. Rand's book is at heart an apologetic exposition on unrestrained self indulgence, worship of the individual, and loathing for any social norms or other constraints. It is no more a philosophical work than is a Superman Comic. If this is the depth of thought our leaders follow, then God have mercy on our nation."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book was so immature - so teenage angst ridden it doesn't deserve much time to review.The theme &quot;Nobody appreciates how wonderful I am so they can all go to hell&quot;.

The author Could have made the book about half the size if she didn't explain her theories from so many different angles and perspectives.

For example, John Galt's speech really does not need to take an entire chapter for the reader to understand his philosophy. Even after wading through all that, the book was still a good read.

Could not put the book down even though it is very long, but easy to read on Kindle."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot but there are some negatives that diminished my enjoyment of it.The Good:- I loved the protagonists (Dagny, Hank Rearden, Francisco). They were strong, intelligent characters and I was rooting for them right from the start- the story was interesting. I was anxious to find out how it would all end and it was gripping- the philosophical disadvantages of Socialism are well-presentedThe Bad:- it seems very exaggerated. I don't think the staunchest defenders of Socialism would identify with the \\"Incompetents' (my word for them) in this book- the antagonists in this book (James Taggart, Wesley Mulch, etc.) seemed to be the same person. They are one-dimensional with no redeeming qualities- it was very, very long. A few times I wanted to stop because it was so long but I really wanted to find out how it all turned out. John Galt's speech on the radio could have been cut down to 10% of its length with no loss of meaning or impact.Overall a good, enjoyable story and I recommend it"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The story is sometimes fantastic. There were moments where I was genuinely enthralled and couldn't put the book down.

I would rather die than live in her world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"We all have a primitive inner voice, some call it the \\"Id\\", some call it the lizard brain. It's been referred to with the most clarity as the \\"selfish gene\\": Not meaning that an individual has a particular gene that makes them selfish, but that we all have genes that demand to be passed on, and thus compel us to behave selfishly: to hog resources, to create as many babies as we can (for the males at least), to lie and cheat to clamber our way to the top of the evolutionary pile, or at least make sure that our particular genes aren't extinguished in this round.And it makes perfect sense. Obviously, in the stone age, those who didn't get enough resources perished along with their genetic code, and those who produced more offspring were more likely to pass the code on to future generations. The result: we're now in the 21st centure with an artifact in our brains telling us to do whatever it takes to maintain status, resources, and offspring.Now, what are the most base, shallow, crude, and salient indicators of reproductive fitness primitive man and woman would have looked for? Simple: Secondary sex charcteristics and wealth. The former needs no explanation, the latter indicates ability to survive, intelligence, power, etc. etc. Never mind that there are people who are incredibly weatlhy now who have little intelligence, wit, or work ethic (eg Paris Hilton) our primitive brain still sees all that wealth and says \\"good good, me likey\\" or just \\"oooohhh shiny\\".Now we have Ms. Rand- pseudo-intellectual poser writ large. With her bloated, pedantic, patronizing tome, glorifying monkey brain style status indicators and by god, your right to seek them at all costs. \\"Altruism is for the weak\\" shouts the Ape Queen. She towers over her drone-like followers as they worship at the temple of their own primitive drives, now given legitimacy (at least in their minds) by this and a few other of her \\"novels\\", snapping and salivating at any who may have the audacity to question the sanity of their philosophy.Can't we all agree in this age that this kind of dressed up selfishness just doesn't work? Sadly no."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The writing is primitive, the philosophy no more advanced than that of an ape, and the end result of the ideals espoused in this book would be the ultimate annihilation of everything. If you agree with this book then you have a problem. Part of the stupidity of the book is that if you buy into Ayn Rand's relativistic (ironically, she refers to it as Objectivist) philosophy, it is impossible to believe in anything, including Ayn Rand and her trash that glorifies greed. If you don't serve others, then your efforts are wasted because you, in the end, are nothing. Greed is the definition of futility."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"We all say stupid things. It is part of the human condition. No one is immune. Most of us try to avoid saying stupid things. Ayn Rand though has managed to string together twelve hundred pages of silliness. It is a singular achievement. Everyone should read this thing at least once. Don't let the 'sales' figures fool you. Ms. Rand's Society of Silly Thinkers distributes thousands of these doorstops each year attempting, one supposes, to identify every possible paranoid-schizophenic who suffers from an advanced persecution complex and reassure them, they are not alone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book will appeal to only the most inexperienced student of truth, the more discerning observer has no choice but to reject this work as a fictional fantasy novel projecting Newtonian phylosophical idealism and secular humanistic propositions disporoven long ago.Rand tries to promote Reason as the ultimate human ideal failing to recognize the link between reason and the corruption she denounces. In the real world her Atlantean heroes have joined the ranks of the looters, there are no maverick bankers and invincible lone Pirates with Military weaponry leading a resistance to restore righteousness.The corrupt are not foolish enough to leave such resources under the control of potential resistors neither do they lack the power to subdue them. Her book is a grand contradiction filled with narrow ideals void of pragmatismIn the real world the resistance has been neutralized its key components willingly synthesized, with Reason at the helm of destruction and the abandonment of faith its cause.Rand's political condition may have some future place if American society ever declines into the Russian morality standard but not until the heroes she describes have long vanished entirely from the American industrial scene and the power of Government and those in control of it have become absolute. The Atlantean hero solution however is simply Naive fiction.I would not recommend this book even for entertainment value, Rand is too naive to deserve a reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A very silly book. Interestingly, liberalism has been dead since 1980, and our political system is rotten with campaign pay-offs, revolving-door lobbyists, deserted factories, and corporations face down in the public trough...something like James Taggart's Washington! When Rand wrote this book, liberal politics made America the glory of the world. Now it's a sewer of blatant corruption.

It is based on the assumption that only a very few individuals have the ability to lead in the economy, and that if this group were to leave or go on strike, the economy would fall apart. If you believe that assumption, then you are probably a sociopath who doesn't understand the complexities of human nature.Here is the plot of the book:Corruption is everywhere. No one wants efficiency because there is no profit in it. The major industry leaders withdraw to their own little secret valley where they create the latest greatest inventions and technological progress without the intrusion of government socialism.However, the problem is that there is no mention of who is doing the menial tasks that this hidden utopia would require. There is no mention of anyone other than industrial geniuses in this utopia, but if they had to do all the work themselves , their productivity would be dismally low. It is a pretty standard flaw in many utopia novels.

She progressed to books as \\"The Fountainhead\\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \\"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence your head can work without your hands yet your hands can not work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \\"Who is John Galt?\\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \\"Atlas shrugged\\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \\"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\\" and at the same time the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book itself arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.

It predicts and foretells the results of any out-of-control administration, permitted by an ignorant electorate which finds value in a government that seemingly caters to all public needs and wants.I purchased this book for a friend. I was going to send him my tattered, 1084 page edition published in 1957 but it has become an old friend I couldn't let go. 'Atlas' is what some would call a tough read;Rand does take great care to develop the leading and suporting characters.If you like thinly developed plots and personalities this is not your sort of read. However, if you want or need a more comprehensive understanding of where we've been and where we are likely headed, you should read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as a reference text and warning."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand has received a lot of bad press over the years from reviewers in denial. What is probably the best defense of capitalism and the once great American way of life is now proving to be more prophecy than novel as the Republic spirals down into police-state socialism. Yes, it's a long novel and yes it's sometimes seemingly redundant in spots but I never tire of reading it all the same. For you younger readers out there that have become functionally literate despite a government school education, just ignore what you've heard about Ms. Rand and read Atlas Shrugged. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a lesson for our times. It helped inform my voting in the 2008 elections, and informs my vision as I read about the political and economic struggles of our country today. It can be a tough read at times as Rand waxes pedantic, and indeed the type is very small, but the insight gained is well worth the effort.There is a place for charity (\\"Are we not all beggars?\\" Book of Mormon Mosiah Chpt. 4 - http://scriptures.lds.org/en/mosiah/4/16,19,24#16), and we are not all a Gault, Rearden, or Dagny Taggert, but we all have a contribution to make, and an excuse is not a statement of value."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've heard most people say that they either love this book or hate it. I love it! Dagny Taggart is my hero. Her journey through the book battling the strikers and the looters is excellent. I've read through the book many times, but could only make myself read the 'John Galt Speaks' chapter once in its entirety. I don't think everyone in the world has the kind of personality to appreciate this book. It does, however, seem strangely appropriate to todays economic and political climate. One criticism of Rand in this book is that the characters she portrays all seem to be an extreme case of either looter of mover. There aren't as many characters that are just normal everyday people. Either way, I love the book. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It starts out slow due to the extensive character development, but when it gets going, wow. This book really changed my understanding of my own motives in life. The \\"morality\\" of Ayn Rand's philosophy is earth shattering. The story really helps you grasp her message. It's great to finally read a novel that has a real point.I've recommended this book to all my friends and family who aren't already too far gone...I'm not really hard on paperbacks at all, but by the time I was done with this edition, the binding was barely still in one piece. It's a really thick book which hasn't been a problem for me before, but this one wasn't made well. I recommend a hardback, or maybe try a different edition paperback."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I will get my opinion on the philosophy the book holds out of the way first. Yes, it is preachy. Yes, it is heavy handed. And yes, it can be long winded. Do I agree with all of it, no. But I think there is some value in some of the ideals that she lays out that are interesting.Moving on to the novel itself. As I titled this review, I consider it to be an \\"Engineering Thriller.\\" What I mean by this is that the book deals with a lot of Engineering problems and explains the problems itself and the path to the solution in a fairly descriptive way. Rather then take the back seat to the rest of the story, these types of problems in the book drive a lot of the story. The major players in the story, (Dagny, Fransisco, and Hank), are all passionate, interesting, admirable, and flawed. They are developed well and are very interesting to see progress through the novel.My personal enjoyment of the novel came from how Rand describes the world. She uses a lot of detail in many areas, some of which I feel many other authors leave out detail. She does a great job of explaining the details of facial and body expressions of characters, and takes it a step further and also outlines the character's intention behind the action and other character's perception of these actions. This amount of detail is also used in her description of dialogue in the novel, doing a great job explaining the tone used by her characters. That being said, some may not like this amount of detail and may feel that it feel too long winded and drowned in detail. I personally enjoyed it and found it to be one of my favorite aspects of the novel.Great characters and an interesting driving story really allowed me to delve into this book and I felt that I really enjoyed the experience a ton."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't know what I can add to the many reviews, so I'll try to think of something new. Like Michael Crichton, Rand mixes fact with fiction in a most wonderful and entertaining way. If you like M.C., you will like A.R.. Especially if you enjoyed M.C.'s State of Fear and Next. Heck, this book is a great love story alone! About four or more guys are in love with the female lead! She is always off on adventures, and meeting mysterious people. Oh, who will she end up with! So exciting and educational at the same time. The long speeches are interesting. I love long books, so that was not a problem. Most of the long 'speeches' contained very educational and important points which I copied into my notebook. I must say it. This book is a page-turner. The story gets better and better as one works one's way thru the book. Edge of your seat stuff.I ordered two copies from Amazon, since I'm reading a library copy which is falling apart from too many readings. This book is so important that I am going to donate one of the new ones to the library to replace the worn-out one I'm reading , because I want others to read it too.The book emphasizes reason, truth, pride, honesty, the mind as the ultimate private property, brotherly love, hard work, brains, and freedom. So easy to lose freedom."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"...you are wired a certain way. Since 1965 when I first read it and had my entire political philosophy flipped sideways, I've recommended Atlas to any person in whom I thought burnt an ember of independent judgment, appreciates the necessity of being reasonable and integral in their thinking, has an inherent belief in good and evil as they apply to one's own life, and enjoys reading a brilliant, culturally revolutionary novel. What I have discovered is the reader's response is wholly unpredictable (by me). For some, Atlas is a total life-changer. Others can't get past Page 2.What is undisputable is the book remains a best-seller and subject to impassioned responses both pro and con for over 50 years. And, like it or not, it is absolutely the most prophetic fiction in terms of today's headlines that you will ever read. If for no other reason, everyone should at least crack it open to learn what the enormous underground fuss is about (and you'll immediately see why the fuss has been, up until recently with the advent of Cable TV and the internet, underground).In conclusion, for me, my most valuable physical possession is my autographed 10th Anniversary edition of Atlas Shrugged...Jack GreeneCape Elizabeth, Maine"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you have never heard of Atlas Shrugged or Ayn Rand, do yourself a favor and read it. The novel is truly a piece of literature that will make you think and look at things from a different perspective.To me, I hold it as one of the more influential novels (fiction) of the 20th Century. While the book did not do very well when it came out some 50+ years ago, current sales of the novel are white hot. If you've read the book, this should not come as a surprise.The unprecedented and growing number of government interventions in the economy (TARP , bank bailouts, stimulus packages, Fannie/Freddie/AIG nationalization, GM/Chrysler nationalization, etc) have exploded the size of the federal government that it is hard to tell where private enterprise begins and government ends.Atlas is unique not just it's 1,000+ pages of fiction. The novel contains many complex layers of philosophy, ideals, and even treatises on private property and entrepreneurship through the lens of a very complex and opinionated author. While I do not want to make this post a book report since I do not feel particularly qualified to do Rand justice, I do want to illuminate the ideas and lessons that I think anyone can extract from her text and apply it the nation we founded some 235+ years ago.First, let me say that I do not agree with Ayn Rand's position on Atheism as I myself am a practicing Catholic. But, I do think there is a happy medium that can go hand in hand as a Christian with some of the ideas Rand preaches. So many critics and scholars have used her Atheism as a way to discredit her philosophy is misguided. Her staunch godlessness does not bother me since she makes a very good argument against many forms of altruism and their effect on incentive and motivation within a society.I agree with Ayn Rand that many Clerics and Clergymen use the false notion that altruism should be mandated in order to live a moral life and in accordance with God. Many argue that altruism/charity is the HIGHEST moral virtue. While I do think God calls us to help those who cannot help themselves, mandating or forcing people to carry out such acts (through indirect theft or by physical force) is not an act of virtue.Personally, I feel that owning and running a business by generating goods and services that people want in a voluntary free market exchange economy is the highest moral virtue. This is achieved by the axiom that there are scarce resources on this planet, yet we have unlimited wants. No matter whether we are poor or extremely well off, we all want something that we typically cannot have or currently possess (yet). This is not greed, but rather human nature. Naturally, this is how the free market is able to manifest these realities and benefit both the producers and the consumers in a medium of voluntary exchange.In Atlas Shrugged, the plot revolves around the actions of individuals pursuing their own rational self-interest of highly motivated producers who are all hard working industrialists (Dagny Taggart, Hank Reardon, Ellis Wyatt, etc) who become targets of the \\"looters\\" within society who feel that they are entitled to people's property and labor for the good of society. The \\"looter\\" (as Rand labels them) have an overwhelming influence from Communist/Socialist ideals who want evoke \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\" Marxist-style redistribution of wealth.The \\"looters\\" are those within big business cooperating with the state to exert the use of force by the state to nationalize industries, establish wage and price controls, control scarce resources through mass forms of rationing, and many other actions for the sake of the country and society and providing for the \\"public good\\".Obviously, common sense would tell you what happens when all of these programs and actions are executed. They all lead to the actual producers to mysteriously stop working since there is no incentive to succeed when every failed business is propped up and any company that profitably provides a good or service is scapegoated as an evil and greedy corporation taking advantage of others who are suffering. Self-sacrifice and altruism end up doing the opposite of what they are intended to accomplish and the reader is able to understand the continuous question and battle cry throughout the book:\\"Who is John Galt?\\"After reading this book, you will know the answer to this question and why it is so important.[...]"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged was given to me as a high school graduation present from a teacher with whom I frequently argued about philosophical issues such as charity and other topics which my Christian upbringing focus on. She never demeaned my arguments but provided reasoned, interesting rebuttals. When I graduated she gave me the book and said that she thought I was \\"ready\\" for it. I was a bit insulted as this sounded patronizing. I thank her often for such a wonderful gift. I have worn out my paperback copy and will buy a hardcover copy for future reads.The first time through the book can be a roller coaster ride. You will undoubtedly like parts and hate parts. Ayn Rand is quite verbose, particularly in some of the speeches or monologues of the book. It is tempting to skim over those parts but there are gems within the paragraphs. For example, there is a 75 page monologue from Francisco, one of the main characters. It is full of positive messages, such as the concept of \\"making money\\". I have gone back and read this section of the book several times.I have read negative reviews of Atlas Shrugged and I can see why some people do not like the book. It does not follow any specific political party line, but anyone with a liberal leaning (by today's definition of liberal) would hate this book. However it disagrees with a lot of the mainline \\"conservative\\" dogmas as well. I like to think of it more as a philosophy of life. My political beliefs follow from that philosophy.Give Atlas Shrugged a try. If you are honest with yourself you may very well like it, whether you agree with all of the concepts or not. It is a story and it is a textbook. It is a very enjoyable read and if you are not accustomed to such lengthy books, you will probably feel a sense of accomplishment from finishing a 1000+ page book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the most ambitious and intelligent novels of this century.

Clearly the state of our nation today has me wondering if the reduction of the productive minds of our country has come about through the active work of John Galt. No matter how we frame the destruction of our country's output, how we have slipped behind the rest of the world, how we have been reduced to a shell of activity that manipulates money and forces false appreciation of asset values while producing nothing of substance, we cannot explain how it came to be. Like the decline in Rand's world, we are following the same path. As a business owner for 30 years, Rand was the first person to ever truly make me feel good about profits, growth and my individual chase of truth. I hid behind my achievement, today I celebrate it. Today I see the work of the looters. The tragic wasting of minds as they are stripped of value through a government and school system that lives off them. I see where it will end up, but I now know that John Galt and the crew live on, in many of us and we will survive."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As a former member of the Objectivist movement in the 1970s, I can speak to this novel and its author with some personal experience. Many of the reviews I have read here seriously mis-state many of the book's main points and constructions. I cannot take the time to answer them all (but will answer specific questions via E-mail), but suffice it to say that the many psychological points made ignore the background from which Miss Rand sprang - a childhood spent under threat of death from the Russian military and desperation to escape Russia to the West. Certainly her childhood molded much of her adult thought concerning any form of state action or power - a point many reviewers seem to ignore.As for the novel itself, I am constantly amazed by its effect on both myself and others. It evokes polar reactions, perhaps because the novel itself is polar - and for a reason. Miss Rand chose to write to extremes because the subject matter and plot required her to do so. The novel, in exposing what Rand saw as the ESSENTIALS to collectivism vs. individualism, HAD TO be written from a black/white perspective. Good vs. Evil was one of the MAJOR THEMES of the novel, and Miss Rand did not believe that one could teach the essential nature of either position by dealing in shades of grey. This is one of the novels strengths - and weaknesses.I can understand why, after the Bible, Atlas Shrugged is the second most influential book in American literature (according to two major polls in the early 1990s, one by the Library of Congress and the other by the Book-of-the-Month Club. Also, When The Literary Guild conducted their online poll last year, 2 of Rand's works were in the top 5 most popular of all time, ATLAS SHURGGED easily outpolling the second-place novel, and THE FOUNTAINHEAD coming in 3rd). The work raised questions that one does not normally face during ones first 12 years of indoctrination in religion and 'education'. It jars the senses and forces one to confront questions that many would rather not see raised. That is the earmark of great works - the asking of questions not raised before.Personally, I find some of her passages momumentally beautiful in the images they evoke (most notably the entire story of the collapse of the Taggart Tunnel). I can literally see the story when Miss Rand is painting the surroundings and describing the action. The dialogue, however, is often troubling and difficult to credit - but when one is attempting to present a philosophical system in a novel, one is forced to use somewhat stilted and technical dialogue. Her dialogue in THE FONTAINHEAD was much better.Overall, this novel remains in print and widely read because it challenges previously held concepts, raised questions one has probably never considered before (Such as &quot;What would happen if the men of the mind went on strike?&quot;), and refuses to soften or cushion the blows her ideas inflict on the sacred cows of religion, emotion detatched from reason, and the idea that human action and thought is just a resource amenable to the use of force.In that, her works - flawed as they may be - will live forever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I would like to respond to the spotlight review posted by Kelly B Faltermayer on Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and on Rand's novel and it's implications in general. Any deeply held belief system tends to amplify whatever our current worldview is, if you are a kind and sincere person, strongly adopting any belief structure will tend to make you more of what you all ready are. Some belief structures are very ambivalent and allow people of many different dispositions to merely feel justified in becoming more disposed to those things, such as Christianity and Buddhism. A terrible person becoming what he considers to be a devoted Christian might get turned around, or he might become a right wing neo-nazi. A young person lost in existentialism might feel comforted by Buddhism or become even more nihilistic. However, some belief systems if strongly adhered to are difficult to reconcile with pleasant dispositions, such as Nazism and Stalinism. Others, like Objectivism, are hard to reconcile with existentialism and nihilism, let alone making one more so. If you question this, visit the wonderful web site of the \\"Sense of Life Objectivists\\" or watch the beautiful documentary on Ayn Rand's life, and tell me that you came away from either \`hating people'[...]A Sense of Life - [...]For some reason, some people, like Kelly B Faltermayer in her review, reveal that some of the worst thing about themselves became amplified by objectivism. As she says \\"I was 19, during the last phase of my teenage angst and hatred of life and the world\\" Is it not so unreasonable that she came to hate life and the world more? Is that the fault of Objectivism or of Ms. Faltermayer's background, experiences, and choices? Just as very few people come out of Stalinism loving the world and all it's people, so do very few come out of Objectivism hating life and the world. But there are always anomalies. Of all philosophies, only Objectivism is the most rational tool for living (which is what a philosophy is, after all) Only Objectivism advocates the self and the individual as the highest value. Most every admirer of Rand would not hesitate to say \\"Live your life for yourself!\\" and yet they are called \`Selfish' by people such as Ms. Faltermayer who do not know the meaning of the word. The Selfish person (with all it's negative connotations) is the person that demands you live for them! That is an exploitative and pejorative form of selfish promulgated by philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche. Rand advocates the use of the word Selfish as living a life of self-reliance and independence, of formulating your own opinions through rational evaluations of reality, of fully integrating a system of ethics based on objective reality and reason into your life. You do not demand others do things for you, nor do you let them demand it of you. For that, we are called selfish. But there is no word for living a life for yourself now that does not have the connotations of exploiting others, and this very fact is evidence that people think the very idea of living for yourself must hurt others and of the very subversive manner in which people attack Objectivism and individualism in general.Ms. Faltermayer also makes light of Ayn Rand's disdain for Communism when she says \\"...human race would plummet into oblivion and forever live in a gray abyss of selflessness, worthlessness and altruism - All because of the \\"Commies\\" and their evil ways.\\" One must point out that Stalinism and Soviet Communism has killed well over 100 million people this century. Please refer to the work of Rudolph J Rummel, a political scientist, author of 24 books, runner up for the Nobel Peace prize, and author of the most cited book in history. Rummel has studied, probably more than any man alive, how many people governments have murdered. Before Ms. Faltermayer attempts to downplay the evils of communism and altruism, she, and any readers interested, should familiarize themselves with it's monumental death toll.[...]Or Buy one of his books here on Amazon[...]Ms. Faltermayer suggests that by hating the world and everyone in it she was behaving like Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggert, two main characters of Atlas Shrugged. That she enjoyed being hated by people indicates the profound mistake in how she integrated Objectivism, primarily a philosophy of individualism, into her life. If she enjoyed people hating her, she was no better than a second hander, defining herself and her life through everyone but herself. She should not have cared if other people hated her, she might have understood this had she read \\"The Fountain Head\\" but she could not make it through the first chapter. All of Rand's heroes exhibit strong affections for people who merely live a genuine and sincere life of self reliance and focus. Hank Rearden's affection for the \`wet nurse'and Dagny's affection for Cheryl Taggert are very obvious and glaring examples that Hank and Dagny do care about people in the world. They do not care for those who demand they sacrifice themselves for them and they do not live lives dependant on how others think of them, which includes not caring if people hated them.Ms. Faltermayer then goes on to suggest that in some manner Atlas Shrugged or Objectivism wishes \\"death on 90% of the world population\\" AN objectivist does not \`wish' anything of the sort on the population, the do not wish anything except for that the world just leaves them alone to live their own lives.Ms. Faltermayer concludes by saying \\"I'm glad I read Atlas Shrugged, once. I know I couldn't do it now...it is tedious! I tried reading The Fountainhead a few years later and couldn't get past the first chapter. Objectivism represents a phase in my youth...a phase I'm glad to have outgrown.\\" There is a line in Atlas Shrugged that I am reminded of here that suggests that money does not corrupt people, people corrupt it. A murdering thief who becomes wealthy will use his wealth for murder and theft. Similarly, Objectivism does not corrupt people, people pollute its rational and honest guide for living, the best yet devised on this planet since Aristotle's Eudaimonia, with their own faults and failures, as Ms. Faltermayer clearly illustrates in telling her own story. If Objectivism results in Ms. Faltermayer hating humanity, the world, and wishing 90% of the worlds population would die, then she brought some clearly flawed premises to objectivism and corrupted it, not vice versa.As philosophies go, nothing beats a rigid adherence to reality, the rules that govern existence and the profound sense of self worth and enlightenment that comes from Objectivism. The sense of life that Objectivism brings is far more spiritually enjoyable than any other philosophy I have studied, but this is not what makes it right. I think it is far more enjoyable _because_ it is right. As a tool for living, nothing beats it. I recommend everyone read Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I purchased the CDs to get a \\"quick\\" overview of the Book ... about 1,300 pages. There were 50 CDs in the packet ... so much for a quick overview. But the CDs are wonderful! The speaker does an outstanding job of all the characters and it is easy listening. Although the writing is occasionally complex, every American should read the Book or purchase the CDs! It is amazing to see how what Ayn Rand wrote over 50 years ago is playing out today as we are building a complex, expensive and non-productive governmental body which will become our downfall. We deserve better and somehow we need to find our way though this current maze of false promises. Could all of what Ms. Rand describes play itself out today?

It IS many other things. It's a sustained metaphor. All the characters are cardboard inventions that are employed metaphorically to support this writers extreme agenda. It's also a sex fantasy. If you read commentary on the author's private life, you'll find that she had to idealize all her relationships and was hypocritical in her discussion of her husband. It's also a philosophic fantasy. She constructs a dream world that has never existed and never will exist.There are a multitude of characters, but when they speak, you can only identify two. What I mean is, it doesn't matter who's talking, there are only two character profiles. There is the SUPER-HERO image of perfection that is Dagny Taggert, John Galt, Hank Reardon, etc., and the craven cowards feeding off the HEROs, i.e. James Taggert, Wesley Mouch, Mr. Thompson, etc.Rand spent years on this book doing everything but editing. That's why it is so many things. But I promise you, there is not one person alive on the planet today that has conscientiously read every word in the book from cover to cover. Such anal attention detail in this case is impossible. The author says the same thing over and Over and OVER. If there were a literary award for exhuberant redundancy, Ayn Rand would have won it. She might have retired it.Because the prose is so laden with redundant philosophic argument, you will find yourself skipping words first, then paragraphs, and even whole pages. Then, you will come to the chapter, \\"This is John Galt Speaking.\\" and you will likely decide to skip the chapter in its entirety. Should you yield to this challenge--I forced myself to go back and read it through by itself--don't feel guilty. You will have read every coherent thought from that narrative before the chapter opens. And of course, Ms. Rand repeats it all in the action packed finale.The story offered by the book is very interesting; fascinating even. Altruism runs amok, and communist sentiments become policy, then later law. One over achieving SUPER-HERO decides enough is enough and walks out, vowing to \\"stop the engine of the world.\\" He accomplishes this by recruiting all the other SUPER-HERO characters from society sequentially, spiriting them off to his FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE where a Periclean golden age is being established. As each of these SUPER-HEROs exits the world chaos follows. First, localized chaos from the enterprises they abandon that, of course, no one else is competent or motivated enough to profitably continue; then generalized chaos as the cumulative effect of the departures and the looter mentality of the government combine to ensure nothing works as it once did. (SPOILER AHEAD)The book ends with the SUPER-HEROs planning a return to the world to reclaim and rebuild it, while the view of the world outside the FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE is terribly bleak and depressing. Rand, of course, would never employ the terms SUPER-HERO or FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE, but I feel this more accurately describes her story to you.This book doesn't work on ANY level. As a novel, it fails because there is no depth to any character, and because all the characters fall into pedantic speech patterns that are rhetorically execrable. You find yourself (not just me, I've spoken to other readers)skipping so much rhetoric that you miss actual action changes that are critical to the otherwise interesting story. YOU CAN'T FOLLOW THE STORY BECAUSE IT'S TRAPPED IN RAND'S PHILOSOPHY TEXT!As a work of philosophy its failure is even greater! Its premises are based on a worldview of the way Rand would have liked things to be, not as they were or are. In short, the OBJECTIVIST ignores reality. That's a pretty subjective place to be. The world includes all sorts of people. If they are to live together, the resulting polity must have a method of dealing with each and every one of them. The societies that have been the most successful either got more productivity from their lower classes, or were able to maintain them at the lowest possible cost, or both. Rands did neither. Rand wants a non-coercive society where everyone pulls his own weight and lives in harmony with his neighbor without any expectation that the neighbor will do anything for him that is uncompensated. A WORLD WITHOUT TAXES!!How does Rand think the world is going to be rebuilt by the SUPER-HEROES when the entire population is left-over looters and non-productive automaton semi-zombies (i.e. non-SUPER-HEROES). Surely, she must be aware of the possibility that some of these people, perhaps the armed ones, would be pissed-off!! Did she not live through the Russian Revolution, the ultimate expression of common people being pissed off by a rapaciously exploitive capitalist elite?The moral is, you may not have to do anything for anyone, but if you're sitting there with all the wealth and the majority of humanity is next to you looking on avariciously, YOU'D BETTER HAVE A PLAN FOR DEALING WITH THEM! Otherwise, you may get to join the Romanovs. What I'm saying is, a little altruism is simply good business, something Rand just never understood."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"An unfortunate script for liberal thinkers written 60 plus years ago.

Only against such contracts, is it morally excusable to retaliate with violence. To me this attempt at simple binary categorisation of coercion denies the smooth continuum of coercive techniques and the consequent continuum of reduction in their moral force.Criticism of the wooden style and \\"two dimensional characterisation\\" is misplaced in that the book is not an exploration of the character of individuals, but the characteristics of human society. It has more in common with \`Thus Spoke Zarathustra' than with \`War and Peace'. It is a polemic (or even a bible) as much as a novel.The John Galt radio speech is the longest \\"voice over\\" I have ever experienced. It's purpose is explicitly philosophical rather than dramatic.All books alter the minds that read them. Some books give me the sense that I will see everything a little different for the rest of my life, even if the detail of the text fades. Atlas Shrugged has \\"shaken and stirred\\" my attitudes - an experience reported by huge numbers of people over decades. The fact that it has been so 'actively' ignored by the \\"intelligentsia\\" while remaining so influential, feeds directly into the novels narrative."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just stated reading this, however have seen part one and wanted to get the rest, great info and amazing how true it is to our times.."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In Atlas Shrugged the U.S. is heading toward collapse as the government declares that profit is evil and that fair share is paramount. Key industrialists begin to disappear and the people that remain begin to ask \\"Who is John Galt?\\" referring to a mysterious figure who may be the one making inventors and creators of wealth disappear. The story will evoke many parallels to today. The resolution is highly satisfying.A key part of the book and one that many readers new to Rand struggle with due to its length is John Galt's speech. While I normally don't recommend this for other books, skimming the speech during the first read and returning to it as a standalone sub-book at a later time will not substantially affect the reading experience. It is a summation of the message of the book.Atlas Shrugged is a beautiful work of art. The book is highly influential and should be required reading in schools.

I'm sure it was the same length before, but then I had no trouble with long books. I just didn't remember. But the size of the print in this edition made me wrap it up and send it right back to Amazon. The print was tiny! (And I am still reading without glasses so it wasn't my eyes.)

Once you read the book you'll surely have an understanding of why big government presents such a problem. Where Ayn Rand leaves some questions on her philosophy (in this book) is concerning personal relationships. Sometimes it seems there are contradictions in how the personal relationships unfold if you take her philosophy to mean no one ever does anything for anyone if it doesn't help them in the first place. That would seem to make it so that her characters in real life would have very few friends if all they thought about was themselves. While her philosophy applies in full when concerned with government, she doesn't make a clear case that her view works in personal relationships. I think that's the part of the story and her philosophy that's up for debate. Overall the book will make you think. It will also make you shake your head and just think..wow we're doing the same foolish things in our government these days. For anyone that has a big government way of thinking I recommend you read this book. If you finish this book then you're still confused, I recommend you read Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto and when you do think about how his suggestions will actually play out. You should be able to pick out all the false and foolish assumptions Karl Marx used to sell his ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I love this book, many of the negative reviews are probably from people that think they disagree with her philosophy! The left hates this book, the right isn't exactly a fan. If you take pride in your work, live a moral life, this is a celebration of those virtues. When I was young, I was taught that you tried to be successful and like the guy driving the nice car and living in a nice house as hard work would bring that to you. Now we are told that person is a villain and should be shunned, an evil 1%'ER! I work at a job that is primarily commission, I eat what I kill! I take the money I make, I feed my family, I give it to other hard workers for goods and services that I appreciate and want to buy. I give some of the excess to charities and such, what is evil about this? It is pure and it is simple, people that think I need to give it to them for simply existing are wrong. I believe in charity, but not a federal compulsion to do so. If any of this rings a bell, read the book. This was written in 1957 and it is dead on to what is happening today, scary! But her thoughts were to enlighten the public to stop what she predicts from coming 100% true. After you read this, watch Ayn Rand in her own words and Ayn Rand and the prophecy of Atlas Shrugged.

Suggest everyone read it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I want to say from the beginning that one does not need to agree with a philosophy to appreciate it. Obviously most of the critics and some of the supporters have never read this work. One need not approve of communism to give the Communist Manifesto a high rating but it is certainly a must read.Ayn Rand's philosophy is known as objectivism. It is essentially having a objective reason and purpose for every action you commit.Atlas Shrugged is one of two major novels that outlines her entire philosophy while trying to show how it would be applied. That is why this book deserves a 5 star rating. Any philosopher can give generic ideas with no application. Rand puts it all on the line to show exactly how she means her philosophy to be interpreted.The student of philosophy will be able to understand her philosophy quite clearly after reading this. If you agree with her philosophy you should encourage others to read this book. If this book is so clearly wrong then you should encourage others to read it so they will see how clearly wrong it is. Those that want it burned or object to others reading it know that she offers some very strong arguments for a position they clearly do not want to be true.This book takes place probably around the 1950s. It is centered around the industrial sector of the U.S., the only government that has not become a People's State. The main character in this book is Dagny Taggart. She is a no-nonsense VP of Operations for the largest railroad in the world. She is intelligent and is solely driven to keeping her RR as the best.The times are dim and getting dimmer. In the beginning the country is in a recession of sorts and it is up to Taggart and others like her to save the country. There are two problems that are preventing her from doing this. One, the government seeks more and more control when it should be stepping away. Second, the men of industry are disappearing one by one just when they are critically needed. No one knows where they go off to.In the sense of a novel this is a good one. It is suspenseful and intriguing. Everyone can identify with the characters in this book. Most of the antagonists have been left rather shallow. That is on purpose. They are supposed to represent certain elements of society. This book can get dry at times. One man has a 60 page speech that can seem a little preachy at times but is wholly necessary within the context of the novel.Ayn Rand is perhaps the best known and widest read philosopher of the 20th century. If you have any interest in philosophy or economics then this is a must read. Don't fear her teachings. An open mind is a dangerous thing to some people.The most important thing to remember is not to take everything you read here as dogma. Think for yourself and apply whatever ideas make sense to you and ignore that which you don't like. Think for yourself. I think Rand would object to anyone blindly following her philosophy without actually believing in it. No one says you can't be charitable to others. Just make sure you do it of your own volition and not because it is expected of you or because you feel guilty."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"An earlier reviewer struck an important vein when mentioning that academia and media have left this novel largely untouched, while it has continued to be read via word-of-mouth recommendations. Why? Rand is provocative; the novel engenders both deep respect and vitriolic opposition. Why?To begin with, this is not an ordinarily structured novel; it is an overt statement of a philosophy. The plot, like many of those employed by Shakespeare, is not wholly original. (See an older book entitled &quot;Secret of the League&quot;). In any event, Rand uses the complex plot allegorically as a vehicle for describing her own unique philosophy and its consequences. Rand's philosophy, and it is clear enough upon reading, is a synthesis of Aristotelianism with more modern &quot;humanistic&quot; concerns, in the greatest and original sense of the term. Rand ties Aristotle's basic conceptions of logic to the workings of egoism and capitalism. She rejects Nietzschean irrationalism, Kantian ethics, and the kind of Pragmatism championed by Dewey. Her suggested replacement for these constructs is a body of thought which recognizes and responds to human needs and values, economic conditions, political necessities, and logical imperatives, even if incompletely at times. Oddly, her critics continue to tout her as little more than a &quot;pop-philosopher&quot;. On to her book.Atlas Shrugged is a fountainhead of skilled dialogue and monologue. Francisco's speech on &quot;money&quot; is insightful, and honest. Some prosaic passages, like Galt's enormous speech near the novel's end, could have used some editing. Nonetheless, such passages are meant to (and succeed in) conveying a rather thorough philosophy. Also adept at employing dialogue, Rand leaves cutting snippets and short verbal gems throughout the book. She distinguishes perceptively between 'what people commonly say' and 'what those words often covertly are intended to mean.' This making-bare is done through the frankness of her protagonists, some of which mere foils to reveal more probing insights. Those who would call her characters &quot;shallow&quot; may be correct if judging by contemporary literary standards which praise personal texture and ambiguity. Rand seems more interested in the kind of moral tale woven by the great Greek dramatists, in which characters are primarily vehicles of ideas.It was once said that the purpose of philosophy is to start with something that everyone takes for granted, and to end with that which noone will believe. Rand uses Atlas Shrugged to achieve this kind of ideational journey. No shallow fanatic, her novel is a work is also a great psychological study of the motives of several common ideas, values, and ethical standards. She constructs in Atlas Shrugged a powerful critique of collectivism, that thought which says &quot;We are our brother's keepers.&quot;I suppose one reason for the novel's continued popularity is that most readers are far too intelligent to be comforted by other kinds of books whose authors want them to think they are profound because they are difficult to grasp. Zservedah once called &quot;clear prose the conceptual tool of conservativism.&quot; Readers are probably tired of being asked to find beauty in the Emperor's clothes, in works of art which are ugly, and in books which are pessimistic. Atlas Shrugged is unabashedly lucid and candid; it is refreshing to find such confident and clear writing in this age of self-doubt, relativism, and academic obscurity.You will be a richer person for having read it.Are some of Rand's adherents sycophantic? Certainly. Yet if her philosophy were the kind of &quot;cheap trash&quot; critics claim it to be, why the vehemence of her opposition?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I thought I'd be ambitious and write an actual review of the novel, rather than a review of Ayn Rand or her philosophy, Objectivism. Although I hold both in high regard, I think any disrespectful ad hominems need no response.First let me tell you what this book is not. Atlas Shrugged is not a novel depicting ordinary people in ordinary situations. It is not here to tell you what is - it is here to tell you what could be and should be. That is why so many find the characters unbelievable, unreachable, even childish in their idealism.As for the ideal itself, it is personified in the productive giants of (then) modern America. Dagny Taggart does railroads, Francisco D'Anconia does copper mines, Hank Rearden - steel. For centuries, men have asked what would happen if the working class went on strike; Miss Rand asks, what would happen if the men of industry went on strike.What would happen if Atlas, a man whose shoulders held a world damning him a robber baron, shrugged? This is not a novel for the chronic skepticists who dismiss strong convictions as dogmatism, nor for the pessimists who proudly declare that they \\"grew out\\" of Miss Rand's \\"naive optimism.\\"For everyone else, though, I recommend Atlas Shrugged highly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've never seen any point in all the &quot;read this! buy this!&quot; stuff of customer reviews, but I felt compelled to respond after stumbling across all of the tripe posted here by the vehemently Anti-Rand. I noticed that one of the major complaints is the length of the book. This amuses me; I would hope that anyone who thinks themselves intelligent enough to argue the psychological premises of this book would be past the childlike complaint of &quot;It's too long!&quot;...when did reading become &quot;work&quot;? I thought we'd outgrown that, children... I am seventeen years old and I just finished reading this book for the third time. I wouldn't say that it changed my life so much as it reaffirmed my existing view of life as I always knew it should be. when reading this, or any of rand's other work, I am always tempted to underline, to highlight the countless passages in which she has described all of the vague notions that I could never quite put into words. I am baffled by those who call her characters &quot;shallow&quot; and &quot;one-dimensional&quot;; I have never encountered any characters in literature who are as deeply affected by the world around them as Dagny, Rearden, Galt, etc. (Their actions alone should be sufficient proof of this...did you people actually read the novel? How can you overlook an entire plot?). Others complain that the novel's premises are &quot;too black-and-white&quot;, saying that no one could actually go to such emotional extremes &quot;in real life&quot;. Is it any wonder, then, that such people completely miss the point of this novel? This is probably the most important book I have ever read. My only regret is that I did not purchase the hardcover copy (my paperback has become quite tattered). Pay no attention to the outbursts of one-star reviewers...I seriously doubt that they have any idea what they're talking about.One more thing: when did passion become a sexual offense? All of these &quot;rape&quot; comparisons annoy me. The term &quot;rape&quot; refers to consent, and the characters in this book are obviously willing. They are intense, yes, but violence and rape are not necessarily the same thing. I didn't know people could be so easily confused...such are the times, I suppose."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"That's right. It is the best business book ever written. Rand believed in the value of the individual. She believed that the state, the government, should have no control over a person's work and his or her achievement. She believed that no group should try to control the individual and that no person should compromise in an attempt to blend in.This is Ayn Rand's masterpiece. It expresses her complete philosophy in a riveting plot that takes place in the U.S. in the future. The economy is collapsing because of the strange disappearance of leading producers and industrialists. The theme is the role of the mind in man's existence. It demonstrates a new moral philosophy based on rational self-interest.In this wonderful work, Rand shows what the world would be like if the real producers, the productive individuals, would stop their work and their production. It is stunning and awesome.While the dialog is stilted and uncommon to the culture, it was Rand's unique way of crafting her fiction. Her characters lacked depth and emotion, similar to those of F. Scott Fitzgerald.While this may take away from the storytelling, it is actually merely the format for her presentation of her Objectivist philosophy. And, it is that philosophy that is the critical part of all of her work, including her fiction.According to Wikipedia, \\"Objectivism holds that there is a mind-independent reality; that individual persons are in contact with this reality through sensory perception; that human beings gain objective knowledge from perception by measurement and form valid concepts by measurement omission; that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or \\"rational self-interest\\"; that the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual human rights, embodied in pure, consensual laissez-faire capitalism; and that the role of art in human life is to transform abstract knowledge, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form--a work of art--that one can comprehend and respond to with the whole of one's consciousness.\\"But it can better be summed up, I think, by saying that it is the belief that a person owns his own mind and the production of his mind, i.e. his work. Furthermore, it holds that the individual has a right not to conform to the whims or desires of the collective, that he doesn't have an obligation to do his work as others wish him to and that he has a right to earn money for his work and not give any part of himself away for the benefit of others.The dramatic story in Atlas Shrugged brings this philosophy to life.An altruist would not enjoy this book. But if you read it with an open mind, you will appreciate the philosophy behind the words. You may or may not agree with the philosophy and you may not enjoy the book. But if you're in business, you should read the book. A business person who is not basically an Objectivist, is not a good business person but a slave.By the way, Alan Greenspan, famous former fed chairman, was part of Ayn Rand's inner circle when he was very young. He still considers himself a libertarian Republican. Rand's philosophy is an important one and should be read and studied by all who care about human production and human value."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a good book, definitely entertaining and thought-provoking. With over 500 reviews here, there's not much I need to add to that. Although I don't like this book nearly so much as I did when I was 18, I still think everyone should read it.My criticism of the book and of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism(the two are nearly inseparable) is that the psychology and the relationships are entirely divorced from reality.If you're inclined to use Rand's characters as models for your own behavior -- something that's at least as bad as modeling your manners on those of sitcom characters -- then check out &quot;The Benefits and Hazards of the Philosophy of Ayn Rand: A Personal Statement&quot; by Nathaniel Branden. This essay is posted on the web.Like a lot of people, I read Atlas Shrugged -- and all Rand's other fiction and non-fiction -- while young and so was provided with an outlet for my teen angst and with fuel for those all-night bull sessions in college. (Kids without jobs, and philosophy professors with jobs, can debate for hours whether or not the world exists.) Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead also gave me a lot of silly ideas about dating that I fortunately outgrew. And when I got to the business world, I learned just how unreal Rand's world is.A lot of people who read Atlas then decide that they also are misunderstood geniuses and act accordingly. Like Rand's characters, they imagine themselves to be absolutely right and the rest of the world to be absolutely wrong. I witnessed one Objectivist applying this to his job. He was smart and competent and young -- and convinced his way was the only way. He refused to listen to his coworkers, his bosses or his employees. He treated them all the way Rearden would treat any &quot;looter&quot; foisted on him in his own company. And, although his manager tried for a long time to teach him to deal with the real world, he ultimately found himself shown the door. He was still convinced that he had been absolutely right. For how could he possibly have anything to learn from other people? What was the point of listening to all these dimwits with their stupid ideas? Like John Galt, he was a law unto himself.A few reviewers have mentioned how disgusted they were by the &quot;rape scenes&quot; in the novels. Most of these scenes are just consensual rough sex, except for the Dominique/Roark scene from The Fountainhead. Here again is an example of how Rand's characters fail to translate to real life. In the novel, the sex was NOT rape. Roark did a bit of quick mind-reading and untangled some complicated psychological problems in order to free Dominique's warped love and sexuality. (In Rand's novels, &quot;no&quot; really does mean &quot;yes.&quot;) Like I said, this does not apply to real life.Most of Rand's sex scenes are adolescent and laughable. I'm sure the editors of Cosmo would love to know Dagny's secret to (can I say this on Amazon?) never-fail simultaneous orgasm. Then again, those often produced post-coital philosophical speech-making by the men so maybe it's better left undiscovered.&quot;Love&quot; in Rand's novels is equivalent to hero worship. This is fine if you take the novels as allegory, but not if you take them as realism. Rand intended her characters to be the latter. Dagny is in love with a man before she's ever met him, because he's the most brilliant mind to exist this century, if ever. Never mind such things as personality or compatibility. He's the greatest man in the world and she's the greatest woman, therefore their response to each other must be love. (This, incidentally, is how Rand justified her adulterous affair with Nathaniel Branden.) Instead of finding their own loves, at least other three men are left to pine for Dagny for the rest of their lives. She represents their highest value; how could they love another? (Branden moved on.)In short, you'll be missing a lot by NOT reading this book. But you'll miss even more if you decide to mold yourself into a Rand character."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just to clarify:I am holding this set of audiobook in my hands (I just ordered it and received it). I just wanted to clarify a few things for the benefit of other Rand fans about this particular release.It is the COMPLETE, un-abridged, audiobook of the COMPLETE Atlas Shrugged. For some reason, the title of the Amazon listing says \\"II part\\", which I assume means that is in 2 parts, which it is. But, you get BOTH of the parts with this purchase (update: since I originally wrote this review years ago now in 2007, Amazon has fixed/clarified the listed title... yay!).It comes in two cardboard boxes, plastic-wrapped together, labeled \\"Part I of II\\", and \\"Part II\\". Each box holds 21 audio CDs. The disks indicate \\"Tracks every 3 minutes\\", and it looks like it's a 3 minute average, not exact (the tracks are of various lengths, always *around* 3 minutes); so the chapters do not correlate one-to-one to tracks.The disks also indicate that this was published by Blackstone in 1991. So, my hunch is that this is a commercial re-release of the version that has been in limited availability as the \\"Library Version\\" for some time. The box indicates that it was digitally re-mastered in 2007.It sounds good. It's a bit different since I'm so used to Edward Hermann from the cassette audiobooks. But the funny part is that either Hurt or Hermann must have listened to the other, because many of the verbal characteristics of the characters are the same. It's oddly comforting if you have heard Hermann's version...Thanks Blackstone... I can't wait for the Fountainhead un-abridged audio that comes out in about a month! (update: I have since bought that, and it was awesome too...)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Everyone I knew told me that this book was bad. One time, I cracked open my dad's copy and accidentally flipped directly to the page where a bunch of people on a train are killed in a tunnel and Rand justifies each of their deaths, which understandably put me off the book for about a decade or so. Later, I read snippets of the money speech and decided for myself that Rand's philosophy was repugnant and easy to refute. But for some reason, after years of discussing philosophy with my friends, I picked up a copy anyway.What I discovered was astonishing.Yes, the philosophy goes against everything you've been taught. Yes, her approach to explaining her philosophy has the intensity of a tyrant, and is inappropriate enough to dissuade happy readers such as myself. But the story is actually incredibly engaging. I tried to think of a 20th century philosophy book to compare it to, but it really is incomparable, in terms of its life-giving drive. The modern reader has never had anyone explain philosophy to him in the assertive, challenging way Ayn Rand does, and the results for an open-minded person should be as inspiring as an in-person encounter with Socrates. I see the world in an essentially different way than Ayn Rand does. I got tired of the Galt speech after about 5 pages, and I wish that Rand had given her work to an equally intelligent editor, rather than basking in a cult of personality. But from the other 900 pages I took home a strong message, that I will carry for the rest of my life: the humanity that lived in the forest eating berries may have been happy, but it did not leave a mark on the world. Power and the symbols of power are not necessarily ugly; they can be more beautiful than any mud hut, and any hobo on the street can understand and appreciate that beauty.A few people read this book and believe in the cult of Rand herself. I can understand that impulse, although I would probably have a lot of trouble associating with those people in real life. Most people, I believe, read it and gain from the experience while maintaining a more measured worldview. I am willing to bet that most of the people who hate the book have never read it, for even if you struggle with her philosophy, the book itself is much more interesting than just reading Galt's speech.Thank you, Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's message is not subtle and she does not mince words, yet the novel is elegantly written with a passion and idealism that would seem stilted if there were not so much substance to those words. What is the meaning of life? Who do you live for? Who SHOULD you live for? Why? These are the questions that Rand attempts to answer (for whom is your choice), using (1) heavy-handed but logical arguments, and (2) the wonderfully flawed, yet perfectly human characters who encounter problems and dilemmas very similar (too similar?) to those found today. Reason, morality, and integrity are the true heroes of this novel, no faith required, no religion necessary. In a society where relativism and mysticism are unconsciously accepted tenets of so many people values, this novel provides and ARGUES (a lost art these days ...but I digress) another point of view.For those (such as myself) religiously inclined, Rand comes even more highly recommended, for I have found that reason and faith are not mutually exclusive concepts, and reconciling the two has led me at least to a more complete philosophy of life, where morality is guided by my own reason and principles, not by faith or the opinions of others. Perhaps this book will start you down the same road and the journey for you will be similarly rewarding.And if for no other reason, read it so you understand greedy capitalists :)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having been raised in the Soviet Union, I probably relate to Atlas Shrugged better than anybody born and the States. I definitely agree with the main idea of the book that individual freedom is essential for the survival of humanity; and therefore, capitalism is the only moral economic system because it is based on the freedom to produce and trade.This book has many beautiful passages, and I enjoy reading them over and over. What I don't like is the fact that Rand paints everything black and white. The &quot;tunnel catastrophy&quot; episode really struck me. I seemed like everybody who was awake on that train deserved to die because their ideas were wrong. There are many similar episides.The size of the book also had been blown out of proportion. Same ideas are repeated over and over. I think that Atlash Shrugged could have been a great book had it been more carefully edited. Despite some of its faults, I definitely recoment the book, especially to someone who have either lived in the Soviet Union or who is in any way sympathetic with the socialism.If you lived your whole life if in America, consider your self very fortunate.

In Atlas Shrugged, Rand argues that man should take moral responsibility for his own existence, actions, and future. Few understand that Rand divides the world between people who live morally or immorally - those who live for themselves, and those who live for others, rather than between people inherently good or bad. In Rand's world, greatness is a choice, not a birthright. Rand is not narcissistic, she simply understands what constitutes a fulfilling life philosophy. Hers is not political deconstructionism, but the ultimate expression of self-determination, human dignity, and sustainable morality. At the end of Atlas Shrugged, one can only stand in awe of Rand's greatness as a philosopher, writer, and humanitarian. Rand is capitalism's best answer yet to Marx."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When reading through the reviews of Atlas Shrugged, I couldn't believe how many reveiwers misrepresented Rand's philosophy, and it was coming from her supporters as well as her critics. I don't know if a lot of readers really understand that ALL of her philosophy was derived from the belief that the human mind is a rational and capable tool. Everything else stems from that. Anyway, I found it especially amusing when one reviewer claimed that Rand was just ripping off the Libertarianist view, when she her novels were the prime influence of the group's creation! Geez! Some readers are so appalled that they resort to mindless personal attacks on the author, when they, of course, know very little about her. The bottom line: If you're interested in the philosophy, read the book (and The Fountainhead). If you'd like to know the whole story, read Atlas, The Fountainhead, The Passion of Ayn Rand (by Barbara Branden), and My Years with Ayn Rand (by Nathaniel Branden)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read this book many times, and the more I read it, the more it moves me.

What a vision"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas is a precursor to the world of American entitlement in the 1930s thru the 1990's. In a sense it is republicanism in regards to wealth and individual rights to be free of excessive law and limits on action. It is big on personal responsibility. Then again it is hyper driven individualism for the personal gain of self and if others are helped then all well and good. Nations Ayn thinks fail when these principles are corrupted by redistribution of wealth or ideas when the receivers of such have done nothing to earn them. Dagney is the strongest female character I have ever read with absolute belief in her self to deal with her situation. It argues against large gov. democractic party fiscal priciples of sharing wealth based upon the need of people. It supports the right of people to live as they so desire socially no discrimination except by ability (very democratic)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You have to absolutely WANT to read this book in order to make it through. I have never read a book which took so much thought and effort, but it was more than worth it. Not only does this book make you contemplate the society in which we live, but it makes you rethink your own life. The story is completely timeless, as my father read it 35 years ago and found it just as relevant as I just did. While I love The Fountainhead as well, Atlas Shrugged is at least twice as deep. Prepare for a great experience."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Remarkable book. I was not a big reader in my youth. As I got older I got into technology and spent much of my adult life reading technical books. About 4 years ago I decided I needed to catch up on the books, more specifically the classics, that I had not read in the past. During that time, my political views were also changing. I found myself unhappy with the Republican Party and ANGRY at the Democrat Party. I started seeing many people towing their party's line. I saw hypocrisy when the left criticized the right for the same thing they had done and were proud of. I saw the reciprocal from the right toward the left. I started paying attention to the Libertarian party as a viable solution for me. Although I was not 100% on board with EVERYTHING they stood for, I found that I aligned more with them than with the Right or the Left. I listened to Ron Paul, Mike Church and read Reason Magazine as well. All the while listening to these same people talking about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and how it changed their lives. I decided to see what it was all about.WOW was I surprised when I started to read it. When I was younger some friends were looking at a Sterogram, they all saw a Dolphin in the picture where I just saw random dots. One day I jumped for joy because the blanket that covered my eyes was lifted and I too saw the Dolphin. My friends, this book made me see the Dolphin.The story is great. Very long indeed put I found myself feeling more anxious to get to the next part than board. It has love, hate, politics, morality, thought & principles. It put things into perspective for me. Other reviews I have read seem to be written by very smart people. I just wanted to write a review from an ordinary person that read the book and had it really change my point of view on life and people in general. It has reaffirmed the need to never give up. To continue, to press ahead as there is no such thing as a free ride.The book is long, but take the time, read it. I was at the movie premier and it was so nice to be surrounded by people who had also read the book. It is like a club :-) Not really.I had the paperback and Kindle addition which synchronized between my iPad and Android phone. Always had it available.Good luck and enjoy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Being born and raised in Soviet Russia and seeing firsthand the effects of government control of business and industry as well as the loss of individual rights. Ayn Rand foresaw the basic arguments we are debating today. Does the individual have an obligation to support and care for others or is each individual responsible for his own success and failure. What are the unintended consequences of well meaning legislation that punishes work and rewards sloth and reckless behavior? What happens to a society that, after punishing the job producers and innovators, sees them leave for more profitable parts of the world. (see what happened to Great Britain in the post ww2 era) Who will pay for the social welfare programs when too many people are taking from it and too few are giving to it.Certainly this book has exaggerated characters, but unfortunately the principles are real. An interesting read and a book worthy of the considerable time it takes to finish. Personally I think this book should be required reading by every high school student. The truths it holds are worth the effort to discover."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Like many other people here I'm not going to bother covering the plot because 1.) It's been pretty well covered; and 2.) There's almost no way to sum up this goliath of a book.Which brings me to the first major problem I have with this epic: IT'S TOO DAMN LONG! As other reviewers have stated you can cut 50 pages out when John Galt recaps the last 900 some odd pages you just read. This book could have been written in a much more manageable way that didn't attempt to run so many story arcs at once while beating you over the head with the book's central theme. Even if I had a greater affection for this book, its sheer girth would prevent me from ever trying to read it again.My next problem was the unrealistic characters. It was impossible to empathize with any of them because they were such heavy handed, single dimensional; archetypes that you want to slap the day lights out of all of them. The protagonists and antagonists are all so over or under flawed that it makes it hard for the reader to attribute real human feelings to them.One of the positive things I took away from this book is a better understanding of self-determination and how useless \\"life's not fair\\" thinking is. As an example, if you're not good at a particular sport you can't just change the rules of the sport to fit you better, or get rid of the score board so there's no loser. Life is a bloody, rough and tumble, full contact affair that doesn't care about your feelings; get over it.Another interesting facet of the story if the author's imagery of a stagnate, paralyzed future that may not be that far off if what I see on the news, in the papers, and on the internet is any indicator. Socialism or not, general laziness and ignorance in the average Joe is the greatest danger to the future of all humanity. Another good version of this sad future can be seen in the movie Idiocracy by Mike Judge.Pros:Well thought out and requires the reader to pay attention.It is a wonderful example of post World War 2 anti-socialism, anti-fascism literature that was very common, especially from European writers, during this time.The weak, whinny, \\"bad guys\\" are really pathetic and make you cringe when you hear them say things you've heard yourself say. They make you think twice about dwelling on fairness.Cons:TOO BLOODY LONG! The central theme of this story could have been discovered and explained in a narrative half the length.The \\"good guys\\" make you want to punch them in the face for just being \\"too much.\\" Despite capitalist rhetoric, business men and women are just as flawed as everyone else; they aren't supermen/women and most certainly aren't people you should look to for ethical guidance.I'm versed in economics enough to know that using gold as the only currency is a stupid idea. Gold is a limited resource that can be manipulated like any thing else to change in value. Also, gold doesn't really have an intrinsic value; we just think it does because it's pretty to look at."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read Atlas Shrugged in college over 40 years ago. Not an unusual event. Today I have three children in their 20's. We have a family tradition of arguing about politics. I am a libertarian. One son is conservative on most issues but worked on the campaign of a Democratic candidate for state representative. The other two, a son and daughter, are liberal leaning on most social and economic issues. All, as I, attended East Coast liberal arts colleges.I do not mind their liberal bent; I was somewhat the same at their age. (In 1972 I worked very hard to try to get George McGovern elected.) But, my children are open minded and I believe their viewpoint will change with maturity, maybe faster if I can convince them that reading 1,000 pages of often not-so-great literature is really worth their time.I only bring this up because the events of the past year have caused me to re-read Atlas Shrugged and I am urging my children and friends to do likewise.As we strive to understand how our country has degenerated into extreme political polarity, has been subjected to a series of inept administrations, and has had the intelligence of its citizens insulted in the extreme by things like Congressional \\"ear marks\\", gerrymandering, and limits on executive pay, I can think of no better guide than Atlas Shrugged.Read the passages where politicians, philosophers and syncophants expound their social and economic views, denigrating all those who disagree, and you can easily imagine the same tone and subject matter in the halls of Congress, in the liberal blogosphere, on CNN, or on the NY Times editorial page. (Unfortunately, the tone is often matched by the conservative voices on CNBC and talk radio who seem to believe that shouting louder is essential to winning an argument.)More important, read the speeches by Rearden, D'Anconia, Galt and, of course, Dagny Taggert and try to imagine who those characters most resemble today. Hard, isn't it? Gates? Buffett? The only one to come quickly to my mind is Bill Gore and most Americans do not know who he is. 75 years ago it was easy. Rockefeller, Carnegie, Ford, Sloan, DuPont, Kaiser, Edison. The list goes on.The wealth of our nation came from men and women who innately understood that both personal wealth and social welfare come from creating things that can be exchanged for money, and from our Founding Fathers who established rule of law and property rights that protected that wealth. The creative process and wealth creation must not be bound by the government tether or the nation will not be enriched, it will be enslaved.Ayn Rand witnessed the rise of socialism and communism in Europe and the Far East following the Russian revolution and the Great Depression. The US resisted the radical leftward movement but the tether grew shorter and shorter as entitlements grew and the free market shrank. First in The Fountainhead and then in Atlas Shrugged, Ms. Rand describes where she saw that trend ending.Today, progressive income taxes, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, lavish government pensions, AMT, the Earned Income Credit, food and fuel subsidies and a plethora of other transfer mechanisms result in over half our population being dependent on the rest of us to sustain their livelihood. Today we manufacture less and less every year, and borrow more and more to buy goods manufactured elsewhere.Eerily like the country described in Atlas Shrugged.In a perfect storm of economic turbulence, legislative control by the most liberal Congress in history, an activist judiciary and a messianic president, our nation appears to be rapidly moving toward the kind of country that Ayn Rand imagined so well in Atlas Shrugged.Will our fate be the same? Who is John Galt?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My first encounter with Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED was in college as a reading assignment in my Humanities class many years ago. When my professor placed the book on his desk and said it was our reading assignment, I could hardly contain myself. The horror of reading a lengthy philosophical theory spanning over 1,000 pages was a nightmare evident in my reaction. He looked me straight in the eye and said he guaranteed I would love it. Well, he was right.It's a book I keep coming back to. Putting aside the obvious Objectivism present throughout the novel (especially during Galt's lengthy radio address), this book forces you to think about Rand's ideas brought to life in her characters, and challenges you to define your own. The book questions our values, morals, and ethics bringing to light the qualities an individual requires to live. It also highlights the contrast between the looters who mooch off of others and a person who lives his/her life by their own abilities while expecting other to do the same.Each character in the book evokes a different response from the readers. Some you love, others you completely despise. Most characters are typically on one extreme end of the scale of morals, ethics, and values. With Rand, there seems to be no in-betweens. Having read other works by Rand, it is obvious that she does this to represent elements of society, capitalism, and much more. The book's heroine, Dagny Taggart, is a strong person primarily surrounded by individuals without talent, skills or basic common sense. Although some claim Rand's work is very radical - I'm sure the reader knows someone in this type of situation (come on, admit it). The John Galt character is the physical and intellectual representation of man's ideal; a brilliant man who passionately loves life, work and refuses to live for the sake of others.ATLAS SHRUGGED is a story of true intellectual substance that captures what would happen in the world if the genuine productive leaders decided to halt their contribution to the looters forcing the moochers of society to fend for themselves. Although a lengthy book, it is a great story filled with mystery, suspense, passion for work and life, love, and much more. If you can only read one book, then ATLAS SHRUGGED is an excellent choice simply because it makes you think."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's amazing that this great book was written way back in 1957. I guess it's true that the more things change, the more they stay the same.I too am getting tired of hearing &quot;The Rich Get Richer and The Poor Get Poorer&quot; and this people make it sound like there is something wrong with creating wealth.Atlas Shrugged makes a strong case towards not penalizing the rich, you know, the people who create the opportunities in this country. It makes a strong case towards capitalism.Unfortunately, the same people who give books like this one 1 star reviews and books by those self serving &quot;Nixonites&quot; 5 star reviews are also the ones who spend all of their e xtra money on lottery tickets or in AC or Las Vegas looking for a big win.Now that is called wealth without a prayer.Atlas shrugged is a good book and allof the people in our company, and I mean, top level people wholeheartily recommend it. So do I."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I grew up in a conservative house, but never really understood why. My parents would get fired up about politics and I would scratch my head. Years later in college, I shifted to the left because my friends and professors were liberal. I felt like I was compassionate and morally sound. Being left-winged made me feel like a good person.Then I promised my brother I would read Atlas cover to cover. It changed my life. This book opened my eyes to the world and helped me understand how it works. It uprooted my philosophy. I now have a strong political backbone.Since I read Atlas, I've been inspired to open my own business. Last year, I did so. I feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment knowing that I am producing something of value to people. I'm perpetually on the hunt to find better, more efficient ways of doing things. I believe working to achieve my dream and self betterment is making the world a better place. I feel like I'm doing my part to live Ayn Rand's philosophy.This book is an explanation of what has been, and always will be at the core of Americas prosperity... freedom and capitalism. It should be required reading to every American. All 1,069 pages are worthwhile. Hands down, Atlas Shrugged is the best, most influential book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book was not light reading and I read it one chapter at a time. The characters are black and white, but I think the author had no choice but to create black and white characters in order to get the theme across to the reader. The book's theme is about illustrating how much we all depend on the great industrialists and inventors, by showing what would happen to society if they all went on strike. A railroad president, a steel magnate, a copper baron, and a mysterious inventor are some of the main characters in the book, who believe in the unlimited potential of the human mind and human ability. Moreover, they believe that happiness is a choice, and is related to taking full responsibility for your choices. (Many of the characters in Thomas W. Cronin's Mars stories have attitudes similar to those of the main characters in this book. Ayn Rand would probably have approved of them. See my review of the latest: GLORY BE TO MARS.)I recommend ATLAS SHRUGGED as a thought provoking book. The author succeeds in inspiring you to take full responsibility for where you are at, where you have been, and where you want to go. It's not up to government, society, or your boss, or your dog to create the life you desire. Many of the negative characters in the book believe it is somehow their birthright to have others look after them, without having done anything to earn it. The book is sometimes very long-winded, especially the speech by the inventor John Galt."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I recently finished reading Ayn Rand's 1957 Epic: Atlas Shrugged. I had heard about it for years and at the urging of my sister to read it I finally started this monumental task. When I asked what it was about she really couldn't tell me, and after finishing it I now understand why. It is the story of a man who wished to stop the motor of the world. But what is the motor of the world, and more importantly, of each of us?\\"Who is John Galt?\\" This phrase is the opening statement, and question of the book. It is initially a statement of despair, hopelessness and frustration in reply to questions for which there is no answer. Throughout the novel many stories are told as to the origin of the saying, and although each version is vastly different, they are all correct. As the story progresses the meaning and importance of the phrase evolves into a statement of defiance, triumph and pride. John Galt is an Idea, a legend, a destroyer and a savior. But which aspect is he to whom? The answer is all of them, and none of them.Rand was an Objectivist, and truth be told her ideals are a sort of a homage to the Romantic Capitalist, where one's mind is his greatest tool. The world in which Atlas Shrugged takes place seems to be in an alternate version of the 1950s, where the entire world with the exception of the United States has turned into a collection of Peoples States, and those in power, both in politics and business, are scheming and plotting to follow suit in the guise of the \`Public Good' and \`Welfare of the Common People.' While they preach morality and selflessness, their actions are in complete contradiction to what they profess to be their motives. These are the \`Moochers,' \`Looters' and \`Cheaters' of the world. Amis the madness is a few individuals who hold themselves in high regard, and strive to achieve success completely on their own merit and skills. As such they become highly successful and become leaders in industry, however they are demonized as \`Greedy,' \`Selfish,' and \`Uncaring' by the public, their peers and even their own families.Rand preaches of the virtue of selfishness, which upon first glance seems backward and cold, but check your premises, one of them is wrong. The Selfishness she exalts is not in the traditional sense that one may think of as often described by the religious and pious, but rather to be true to yourself and ensure your motives are clearly understood by yourself. There is nothing wrong with helping others and working for the betterment of mankind. But do not do it under false pretenses nor at the expense of delusional self-sacrifice. In an amazing speech given by one of the characters, they state that what most people claim as self-sacrifice is done out of selfish deceit to stave off their own misguided sense of guilt. \\"'Sacrifice' is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which you don't...If you own a bottle of milk and gave it to your starving child, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to your neighbor's child and let your own die, it is.\\"It is a philosophical gold mine and I took something very important of great worth away from this read: Pride of my own abilities and a new sense of Self-Worth. As an entrepreneur I have started a venture from scratch, with nothing but a small startup fund earned from my day job and a few ideas in my head. While I had the amazing moral support of my wife, everything else was of my own desire. For a while I had reached a slump and I seemed to lose interest and could not find the motivation to continue on, and upon reading this novel I realized why, I had stopped creating for my own enjoyment, and began to create items that I thought would sell and what other people may enjoy. I had reduced myself to creating simplistic designs for easy reproduction and began to limit my own abilities, for the sake of others. I blame no one but myself, but as I read on I began to analyze my own motivations and began to uncover what was the true moral compass behind the motor of my being. Most importantly you must be happy with yourself, and you must live by your own moral guideline, not of what is expected of the outside world. Is the guilt you feel truly guilt? Or is it the illusion of guilt imposed by the outside world whose values they maintain mandate that you feel such things, even though you may not agree with the moral premise for their standard of existence?Most importantly, I discovered how much I valued my own mind, and what an amazing tool it is that we have been granted. No matter what is done or said, your mind is your own and it is the only thing that should not be stolen nor given away to those who cannot or will not use their own.Despite the length of the novel, it is a captivating read and you most certainly will identify and fall in love with characters. Personally I felt closest to Hank Reardon. If you have never read it, read it. Do not listen to what critics nor worshipers of this book say: get a copy and read it for yourself and form your own opinion on the philosophy and ideals presented in this epic. If you love it, spread the word and encourage everyone to dive into it themselves. If you hate it, suggest others to read it and see if they agree with you. Even if you do not agree with everything in the novel, you will take something from it, and hopefully discover something about yourself, how deep does the rabbit hole go?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Most of the positive and negative interpretations of this book read it as a critique of socialism, which it kind of is but really isn't. Atlas Shrugged, to any careful reader, is a critique of dishonest, greedy capitalists who use socialist rhetoric to rig the market in their favor by pretending to take the moral high ground of the \\"common good.\\" Rand gives us a choice between two types: the selfish type who lies about seeking the common good in order to enrich him or herself and the type who seeks to enrich him or herself and has the moral temerity to admit it and takes personal responsibility for the consequences. That's why this book speaks so strongly to the present moment. It should be obvious to anyone attentive to the bailout fiasco that it enriched the few in the name of the many, just as our new \\"socialized\\" medicine will do. Granted, I read this book through the lens of people like Chomsky, who point out that our mixed economy privatizes profits and socializes risk. But Rand is saying much the same thing. Rand demands--and it's quite a moral imperative, actually, and one hard to practice--that those who profit also accept loss, taking responsibility for their risks. It's not that hard to understand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I actually received the wrong book but they were very helpful in getting me the right one. I look forward to my next purchase knowing how hassle free it is."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"No doubt about it, Ayn Rand is one of the great writers. It's strange that she wrote so few books. The depth, breadth and astonishing insight she gives these characters is something I haven't encountered yet in too many other authors. Aside from the obvious attraction of reading and learning about her ideas on philosophy, which the book lays out within the story, that was the biggest enjoyment. You can really get a feel for her sharp intellect and marvelously profound way of describing what the main players are really feeling and thinking. I think I understand that she was basing some of the ideals of the book on her own romanticized version of the 'perfect man' or group of men as it were, so I'll overlook all the obvious hypberbole in the pages that she used in reference to the books lynchpin (Galt), and say that I never could get over the gaping holes of reality that SHOULD have existed in her version of 1940's or 1950's America, which I presume was the setting for the book, since they had the diesel locomotives....I couldn't get over the fact that throut the entire book, with everything going on , on a national scale, there was not ONE mention of the President of the United States...shouldn't or wouldn't he and others , Congress,etc get SOME kind of mention/take some kind of action when the entire country is going through the meltdown it was as she described it in the book? All you get as the head of the bad guys, was a Mr. Thompson ... Secretary of State I think, and his very small group of 4 or so hench men...And I literally laughed out loud , when Dagney Taggart, whom up until that point in the book, you knew as a smallish woman, who was the vice president of a railroad , suddenly was pilotting an airplane BY HERSELF that unbelievably just so happen to crash land in the fantastical , only-to-be-seen-by-the-smart-guys grand canyon, Atlantis styled retreat/resort. I suppose if the ultimate goal is really your opinion on the philosophy side of the book, you could overlook the glaring and obvious momumental disconnects from any sort of reality or plausibility, or I guess you could use omissions like that to question the validity of the reality Rand sets in the book (possibly her philosophy too) or maybe just look at them as the shortcomings of the storytelling.

There are 50 CDs, and one would think packaging could have been a little more substantial.Also - the reader Scott Brick has a strange \\"affected\\" way of reading the dialogue.

I'm mostly in the love camp for a few simple reasons. One is that Rand writes thought provoking fiction at a level that very few writers are capable. Whether you agree with every tenet of Objectivist philosophy is mostly irrelevant to whether you will enjoy this novel. Do you like to read challenging fiction that will cause you to think? And do you appreciate Rand's style (which even her critics have to concede is unique and passionate)? If so, this book is well worth your time. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\`Atlas Shrugged' follows the lives of great Americans as their country deteriorates from a capitalist democracy into a socialist communism. It is not a joy ride. In fact, it is a grueling, plodding process, filled with convolutions, and ultimately ending in a chaotic mess. But the story shows us how such a disaster might occur and thus grants us a tool for avoiding it. Meanwhile, the book plunges headfirst into man's all-time greatest political, cultural, and spiritual challenges, offering a fascinating look at each if not quite resolving any of them.The central challenge focuses on where virtue is lodged. Is it in the Self or in Society as a whole? It is a staggering question when one really thinks about it and Rand sets up scenario after scenario to help us think about it, pitting a troop of protagonists for the Self against an army of antagonists for the Society.Of course, Rand has reached her conclusion before we sink our teeth into the question. Those for the Self are confident, logical, productive, and industrious while those for Society are pathetic, lazy, tetchy, and smarmy. There really is no question about which is right when you look at it through these characters and so there really is no conflict.This is unfortunate because people on both sides have good, well-founded arguments. Simply writing off all socialists as crass nincompoops may feel right to the capitalist, but it does nothing to resolve the differences between the two sides and certainly doesn't help the case for self-interested industrialism. Nor can one say that all capitalists have the virtuous motives that Dagny and Rearden maintain. There are those who support the free market and industrialism for the wrong reasons, and neglecting that fact limits the effectiveness of the argument. In the end, a conflict between two reasonable foes is much more entertaining than a conflict between a master and a fool anyway.Rand sees things characteristically in black and white; there are no shades of gray. At least, the grays that do pop up in this book are cut down by one of the two sides of the conflict. Such absoluteness defies modern standards of literature and many a grain of salt must be consumed while reading \`Atlas'.Granting it is in the Classical style, one can really enjoy the book for what it is. And it is Classical in every sense of the word. The story is heroic--you can take your pick among her many heroes and heroines although only one stands out as the flawless kind. Like a good Homeric epic, the narrative is long-winded and repetitive. One walks away with useful if silly clich&eacute;s--\`who is John Galt?', \`looters', \`A is A'. Actions are deliberate and spelled out for the reader and every action is related to the lesson being told with nothing irrelevant coming into view. And finally, the characters are very one-dimensional with no development or change whatever. These are charming aspects that can be appreciated by those willing.Less forgivable are the inconsistencies that arise in the philosophy. Rand is making a case for self-interest, but throughout the book one will find instances where the protagonists seek validation from others, often to the deprecation of the self. The most notable example of this is in the romantic relationships. The two love each other and will do anything for the other person even if that means becoming vulgar animals and sacrificing the integrity of one's work. The couple receives selfish pleasure from the affair, but it comes at the expense of self-dignity.Rand eliminates the only true way to resolve this inconsistency (is it a contradiction?) by rejecting the ultimate reason for romantic relationships: procreation and raising a family (completely absent from the book). This is the inevitable consequence of fusing self-interest with atheism. When there is nothing to strive for but material gain, the world necessarily becomes a contradiction. One fights the immoral with immorality and gains the respect of others by denigrating them.The latter is actually a central theme in \`Atlas'. Indeed, the protagonists who despise the masses require their patronage to be successful. Industry in general is worth-while only if there are other people willing to buy the product and enough people to make it useful. Even when it is not explicit, the need for validation is present. The driving force of the book, the strike, is designed to force other people to behave properly so that the protagonists can succeed. John Galt's speech is accusatory and insulting, underscoring the negative tone of the book. His purpose (as is Rand's) is to crush the looting society, which is rational because of the burden it places on the producers. But in the end, that purpose relies on there to be a society to crush--it relies on other people.By the time Rand endorses coercion in the most direct manner (use of guns and killing) toward the end of the book, thus completely contradicting her libertarian argument, the reader is willing to give up on her completely. But the extremes to which she takes her story should not undermine the insight she lends on man's great challenges. Indeed, it is her willingness to identify the faults in society and rhetorically crush them that frees us to be constructive and wholly creative.Despite its major flaws, \`Atlas Shrugged' is possibly the only fictional work that addresses the kind of challenges it does. You will need to work for this book, but it will be worth it. Read it and discuss as they might have done in Aristotle's day."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\`Atlas Shrugged' follows the lives of great Americans as their country deteriorates from a capitalist democracy into a socialist communism.

Is it in the Self or in Society as a whole? It is a staggering question when one really thinks about it and Rand sets up scenario after scenario to help us think about it, pitting a troop of protagonists for the Self against an army of antagonists for the Society.Of course, Rand has reached her conclusion before we sink our teeth into the question. Those for the Self are confident, logical, productive, and industrious while those for Society are pathetic, lazy, tetchy, and smarmy. There really is no question about which is right when you look at it through these characters and so there really is no conflict.This is unfortunate because people on both sides have good, well-founded arguments. Simply writing off all socialists as crass nincompoops may feel right to the capitalist, but it does nothing to resolve the differences between the two sides and certainly doesn't help the case for self-interested industrialism. Nor can one say that all capitalists have the virtuous motives that Dagny and Rearden maintain. There are those who support the free market and industrialism for the wrong reasons, and neglecting that fact limits the effectiveness of the argument. In the end, a conflict between two reasonable foes is much more entertaining than a conflict between a master and a fool anyway.Rand sees things characteristically in black and white; there are no shades of gray. At least, the grays that do pop up in this book are cut down by one of the two sides of the conflict. Such absoluteness defies modern standards of literature and many a grain of salt must be consumed while reading \`Atlas'.Granting it is in the Classical style, one can really enjoy the book for what it is. And it is Classical in every sense of the word. The story is heroic--you can take your pick among her many heroes and heroines although only one stands out as the flawless kind. Like a good Homeric epic, the narrative is long-winded and repetitive. One walks away with useful if silly clich&eacute;s--\`who is John Galt?', \`looters', \`A is A'. Actions are deliberate and spelled out for the reader and every action is related to the lesson being told with nothing irrelevant coming into view. And finally, the characters are very one-dimensional with no development or change whatever. These are charming aspects that can be appreciated by those willing.Less forgivable are the inconsistencies that arise in the philosophy. Rand is making a case for self-interest, but throughout the book one will find instances where the protagonists seek validation from others, often to the deprecation of the self. The most notable example of this is in the romantic relationships. The two love each other and will do anything for the other person even if that means becoming vulgar animals and sacrificing the integrity of one's work. The couple receives selfish pleasure from the affair, but it comes at the expense of self-dignity.Rand eliminates the only true way to resolve this inconsistency (is it a contradiction?) by rejecting the ultimate reason for romantic relationships: procreation and raising a family (completely absent from the book). This is the inevitable consequence of fusing self-interest with atheism. When there is nothing to strive for but material gain, the world necessarily becomes a contradiction. One fights the immoral with immorality and gains the respect of others by denigrating them.The latter is actually a central theme in \`Atlas'. Indeed, the protagonists who despise the masses require their patronage to be successful. Industry in general is worth-while only if there are other people willing to buy the product and enough people to make it useful. Even when it is not explicit, the need for validation is present. The driving force of the book, the strike, is designed to force other people to behave properly so that the protagonists can succeed. John Galt's speech is accusatory and insulting, underscoring the negative tone of the book. His purpose (as is Rand's) is to crush the looting society, which is rational because of the burden it places on the producers. But in the end, that purpose relies on there to be a society to crush--it relies on other people.By the time Rand endorses coercion in the most direct manner (use of guns and killing) toward the end of the book, thus completely contradicting her libertarian argument, the reader is willing to give up on her completely. But the extremes to which she takes her story should not undermine the insight she lends on man's great challenges. Indeed, it is her willingness to identify the faults in society and rhetorically crush them that frees us to be constructive and wholly creative.Despite its major flaws, \`Atlas Shrugged' is possibly the only fictional work that addresses the kind of challenges it does. You will need to work for this book, but it will be worth it. Read it and discuss as they might have done in Aristotle's day."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"...Atlas Shrugged is revealed to be a relevant and prescient work by an uncommon mind. One cannot read the daily news, consider the recent election, or follow the current economic crisis without being astounded by the parallels to Rand's magnum opus. To anybody who finds themselves discouraged, disenfranchised, and downtrodden, I offer you proof that there are people who think like you do. Ability and intelligence will make a come back, they always do. That this book as enjoyed such massive circulation across four decades is proof."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For those who have never read Rand, the question is often: Should I read The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged first? Here are some things to consider:1. The Fountainhead is a better story, so if you are looking for a well written story, go with the Fountainhead.2. Atlas Shrugged is mostly a vehicle for Rand to promote her capitalist agenda. Even if you don't totally agree with her premise, I think you can still appreciate how she uses the novel to make her point.3. The characters of Atlas Shrugged are expertly developed - If you liked the Fountainhead character development, you will appreciate the same in AS.4. The sentences Rand creates are unbeatable - such fully loaded sentences with so much implied, yet so much available for interpretation - that is the beauty of Rand IMHO!5. Atlas Shrugged is long, and frankly overkill in my mind. The story at times verges on the absurd - which was a detractor to me. And I love Rand, so if you don't love Rand, you might really get fed up with the preachy aspect.In sum: If you are curious about Rand, start with Fountainhead first. If you liked FH, then proceed to AS. If you didn't care for FH, I would not bother with AS - because the story, itself, is not quite as good, and it is ALOT LONGER!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is amazing. How could this Russian-American foresee the downfall of America so clearly so long ago? She wove a beautiful story around a tragic theme. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone willing to fight for the survival of American ideals and the American country."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For starters, I'll say that I rated this book a 4 because I wanted to separate myself from all those others who have rated it 5. Having just finished it yesterday, I'm inclined to rate it a 5 but I feel that it's still too fresh in my mind for me to make a totally unbiased decision.I picked up this book because I was enjoying my first Philosophy class (freshman in Business School) and wanted to begin reading into it a bit more; this book was on display in the Philosophy section of Barnes and Noble. When I was about 300 pages into it, my professor offhandedly referred to this novel as a \\"children's book\\" during one of his lectures. Now, I have a pretty good idea about how Ayn Rand would feel about me allowing my professor's comment to affect my opinion of her novel, but I'm afraid that it has.As a work of literature, Atlas Shrugged has a lot of merit. The characters are often one-dimensional and the prose can become didactic, but despite its flaws it managed to keep me entertained for over 1000 pages. One thing in particular that I noticed about this novel is that it's an AP English student's dream; it covers just about every theme you could possibly write about, so if you can find a way to sneak it into an AP Essay you'll be thankful that you read it. However, Atlas Shrugged is not widely read because of its literary value; it's because of of the Philosophy.I won't get into Objectivism and what it is; you can find that in other reviews. I will instead discuss how the book left me feeling when I turned the final page. When I was one-third of the way into the book, I figured that my professor referred to it as he did because it's intended more for entertainment than it is for education. By page 800 I saw what he really meant. I feel as if Atlas Shrugged is a fairy tale for young adults. This is hard for me to say because I was (am) just as enchanted with the ideas Rand presents as I imagine anyone else would be, but I can see the problems one would face were they to live by her standards.Based on how it left me feeling - as well as the countless fanatical 5-star reviews that people have written - I can conclude that this novel has the side effect of making you believe that you're some kind of misunderstood genius in a world of mindless drones. This book is a faux-intellectual's dream. There are legitimate dangers that I believe one would face were they to internalize the ideas of Objectivism and live by them. Rand says that men who live by an objective code of values never have disagreements; but look at what happens to her world when some people aren't Objectivist. The only solution she proposes is to withdraw yourself from society and live entirely according to your own standards - a practice that, realistically, most people should be discouraged from.Is this book life-changing? I can't yet say. Is it worth reading? Yes, if you're willing and able to understand it for what it is, and nothing more. As for Objectivism itself, I'll have to do some more reading (of non-fiction) before I can make an educated decision about it. Rand makes her views look very appealing, but she only expounds upon Objectivism's virtues and none of its consequences. I caution readers against blindly taking Rand's word as Gospel; if you manage to avoid this pitfall you'll enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read this book in the mid-70s.

That's because it is well written and tells a good story. Near the end of the book there is a famously long speach. I found it a bit tedious and repetitive, but it is important. Rand's great service to the world is pulling back the veil on some of the easiest of today's cliches: big business, industrialization, modern convenience, and the rich. All of which are targets of hatred by politicians, media, religious groups both left and right, and your \\"old-fashioned\\" neighbor. But what lies underneath this hatred is not reason but just irrational hatred and envy. These things are productive good and have made even our \\"poor\\" rich by world standards.

Our government, colleges, and industry leaders have teamed up to destroy the country and books like this help show how it happens.

I would have read it on my own in due time. It is always nice to have to read a good book for class.The basis of the book is about industrialists and how they are faced with the turning public opinion on them. This in turn creates government regulations that discourage the industrialists to work hard. They begin to disappear one at a time and the main character Dagny Taggert then has to deal with a railroad she loves and the obstacles of keeping it running. First, she has government regulation against her and second she has her suppliers disappearing.Like the Fountain Head written by Ayn Rand, I felt like her love affairs were very weird. More weird in the Fountain Head than Atlas Shrugged. This is really hard to explain but if you happen to read any of these books, you should pay attention to this.I highly recommend this book. It shows that hard work is the way to go. If you allow government to consume everything you will get nothing but digested waste. I am not going to go into it any further so that I do not give anything away. One of my favorite parts is the term for government people: \\"looters.\\"And don't forget a movie is coming out from this book. Supposedly it is going to be Angelina Jolie and Russell Crowe.

I was amazed at how a 50 year old novel could hit these themes so perfectly. Rand has a unique historical perspective that she has turned into a fascinating novel that touches on politics, business, free markets, as well as traditional novel themes such as love and competition. This is a must read for any novel buff, and it is a timeless classic that every generation should be required to read.Enjoy!

For those critics who have asserted that the plot is unbelievable, the development of the plot and the rationality of the steps taken is a great part about this book. Ayn Rand's heroes are truly inspirational and the essenece of Ms. Rand's philosophy is made crystal clear - reason, purpose, and self-esteem, as man's values. This is a message that our society desperately needs to hear."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I heard recently about something called Poe's Law. This states that the more extreme a piece of writing is the more it resembles a parody. Thus Atlas Shrugged. All attempts to satirize this book will simply be taken at face value by the Rand fans - a depressingly strident bunch.I read the first 100 pages and encountered a whole new theology from Rand the atheist: the rebirth of divine power via the rich. In Rand it is the rich who can create everything, including themselves, from nothing. Thus Howard Reardon searching for an alloy that is infinitely cheap, infinitely powerful, and infinitely light (a capitalist wet dream if ever there was one). And he DOESN'T NEED ANYONE ELSE. Rand skips lightly over the little matter of furnaces, workmen, supervisors, builders, etc. She gives a passing mention to some scientists but makes sure that we see they were a useless bunch who needed Reardon's divine hand to guide them.Another Randian trick: - the \\"point of magical re-entry\\". This is where the super-rich - even though they are super rich - nevertheless really started from nothing anyway. Thus Dagny Taggart has a strange feeling that she will one day become the leader of Taggart Transcontinental. Observant readers may note that she has the same name as the business. Yes - it turns out to be a family business. And Dagny's prophecy turns out to be more in the nature of a foregone conclusion.But the real belter comes later when we meet Francisco D'Anconias. Here we have a wunderkind who reinvents calculus, masters a speed boat without instruction and sneaks away from the family mansion every day before dawn to do a gruelling job in a sweat shop - all before he gets to his teens. Later he makes a fortune casually juggling money on the stock market while writing an essay on Aristotle (no doubt while suppressing a yawn). He does all this while carrying on some sadomasochistic relationship straight out of those Fast Show Mediterranean soap opera sketches. At this point I could feel my brain seeping out of my nostrils and I had to quit.But a few weeks later, masochist that I am, I had another go. This time I got as far as the bit where Reardon, his secretary, and one of his clients face the ULTIMATE HORROR.Now what do you think the ULTIMATE HORROR would be? Hmmmm....well the Holocaust is the obvious historical example. Or on a more personal level - imagine you come home one day to find your entire family wiped out by a marauding psychopath. Well Rand has you beat. The ULTIMATE HORROR is a government regulation that restricts business!!!! Reardon, secretary and client are simultaneously aghast. Reardon later sits stunned in a darkened room trying to grasp the enormity of this soul freezing blasphemy. But he can't.Brain starting to liquefy again.NO MORE!!!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm not kidding, either. This book really takes some WORK to get through the whole thing, but if you have any serious interest in modern philosophical movements, then just plow through to the end and get it over with. At least you'll be able to say you read it, not just parts of it, or not just the Wikipedia summary or something.And while I'm not a big fan of Objectivism, there are enough little gems and insights in this thing to keep you going, although there are also lots of things that are pretty ridiculous -- which the author and her followers apparently take seriously -- so that you can have several good laughs along the way as well.For example, near the end of the book, at the beginning of the chapter entitled, \\"In the Name of the Best Within Us,\\" our perky heroine, Dagny, murders a confused security guard in cold blood, basically because he WAS confused and couldn't make up his mind -- and even though SHE was the one who confused him in the first place. Oh, but after all, she DID give him a chance, didn't she -- which was either (i) to obey her, or (ii) to be shot to death. Some choice, eh? (Isn't that the same \\"choice\\" most armed criminals give you when they rob you?) And since this poor average joe working as a security guard couldn't decide at HER command, while she's pointing a gun at his heart, she executes him on the spot -- as punishment, I guess we're supposed to surmise, for being confused.Uhhhh....riiiiight....uhhh, yeah, now THAT'S the kind of world I would really WANT to live in, the kind of world that pays homage to \\"the best within us,\\" an example of which is to be murdered for the crime of being confused. Say no more, Ms. Rand, you have convinced me (that you're loony, that is).Also, the whole thing with John Galt's big radio speech, which lasts for several HOURS -- the characters in the book act as if everyone who listened would take it seriously, and substantively, as if nobody had to go to the bathroom during that speech, or had to get a sandwich or a beer, or had to just turn off their radio because their favorite program wasn't on, and instead, there was some guy talking about how great his ideas are and how he won't live for anyone else, blah, blah, blah. As if that would EVER, EVER, EVER really happen -- I doubt that 99.99% of the radio audience would have made it through the first five minutes before turning it off and doing something else. But instead, the story continues after Galt's speech as if everyone who was listening at first actually sat through that entire speech and was totally mesmerized by it -- and understood it, to boot.Give me a break. Once again, Galt's big speech has some nice insights in it, but like the book itself, you have to suffer through pages and pages of torture to get to those little gems.Which is maybe the main complaint I have with Objectivism itself, assuming that the scenarios in this book are meant to portray the way it would be actualized -- it's not based in any semblance of REALITY.Which is kind of strange for a philosophy grounded upon the formula, \\"A = A.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged.

The other, of course, involves orcs.\\" from DKos"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First, let me say that I live in a town not too far from the one Ayn Rand used as her model to immortilize Gault's Gultch in this book. I have read every piece of Rand's fiction and non fiction. I have read every biography written about her and have read critical analyses of her work and have read her personal letters. When I was a young man I left this small town in Colorado and drove to New York City and the very first thing I did when I got to Manhatten was go to the offices of the \\"Objectivist\\" hoping to find someone with whom to discuss all the \\"truths\\" I found in Rand's writing. As I said, I was young and to paraphrase someone who was very wise...\\"When I was a child, I spoke and acted as a child. Now that I am a Man, I have put away my childish ways\\".This is how I feel about Ayn Rand and her body of work and her so called phiosophy. It is simplistic and childlish and if carried to its ultimate form it will destroy what is good about humans and that is their ability to have compassion for their fellow creatures. If you ever watched Ayn Rand in an interview, you will see how totally unbending, dogmatic and strident she was. However, in her personal life, she rationalized having an affair with Nathaniel Brandon (Her very closest deciple) all the while knowing that her husband knew what she was doing and yet not caring about him or what her infidelity was doing to his ego.Something that so many of the writers here would probably find surprising is that Rand was a staunch atheist. It is surprising to me how many modern day Christians find her work to be so in tune with their political and economic philosophies but at her core, Rand would have scoffed at these people.Also, It is so apparent in today's world that the last thing our species needs is more \\"True Believers\\" who thnk that they have found the Truth and that anyone who does not think as they do is somehow doomed to destruction. Most of our current world problems can be traced to this kind of unbending thinking and Rand and her writings contribute to this starkly black or white view of the world.To summarize, Atlas Shrugged is a nice way to find the \\"truth\\" according to Ayn Rand. But it is not \\"The Truth\\" that her followers want it to be.M. Scott Peck who wrote \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" said that he once was a devotee of Ayn Rand. And, then he began to analyze what troubled him about her philosophy. He said that it finally dawned on him that in none of her writing is there any mention of any children whatsoever. She never had children of her own. Anyone who has had children and has seen the beauty in their complexity could never be a true believer of Ayn Rand.Enjoy the simplicity of her work while you are young, but as you become a \\"Man\\" or a \\"Woman\\" you need to put away your childish ways."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I finished reading Atlas Shrugged today, and I must confess that, as highly as I esteem Madam Rand, and as much as I agree with her philosophy of Objectivism, she simply is not what I would consider a great writer. She can hardly be considered a literary artist in any sense, compared to such figures as Henry James and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Atlas Shrugged is certainly not, as some people seem fond of claiming, \\"the greatest novel ever written\\" (it cannot even be said to qualify next to, say, The Portrait of a Lady), but is actually a rather tiresome and redundant suspense thriller, written, with apparent intention, on a rather \\"dumbed-down\\" level in order to appeal to a wider audience (which, incidentally, seems to me a slight violation of Rand's own philosophy, if she did in fact do this on purpose). The book could, indeed, do with a thorough editing, and a couple-hundred less pages would not be entirely out of order. Additionally, I found it rather unnerving that, once the reader arrives at Part Three, Rand ceases to trust him to make the proper inferences from her narrative, spelling out every virtue that every action of every \\"good character\\" represents and every flaw that every action of every \\"bad character represents. The second half waxes a trifle sentimental and overtly romantic in a few places, and the novel as a whole comes up rather short with regard to subtlety. Yet, in spite of all my complaints, I am afraid I must recommend this book. It must be made plain, for anyone considering the purchase of this novel, that IT IS NOT, BY ANY MEANS, QUALITY LITERARY ART, but its religious defense of the rights of the individual is something one should not overlook, even if one never reads another word of Ayn Rand's work again. Many people call it a \\"life-changing\\" book, but I am afraid that, having read The Fountainhead and a great deal of The Voice of Reason previously, its effect on me was perhaps somewhat diminished. Thus, for one not acquainted with Objectivism, I suppose the redundancy is possibly warranted, as the transition from the typical humanitarianism-is-good-you-should-love-everyone-whether-they-deserve-it-or-not-God-loves-you-even-if-you-don't-deserve-it philosophy of our age (and all preceding ages, for that matter) to the simple, rational hero-worship of this philosophy is a rough transition, indeed. For the interested reader who finds himself lacking in free time, the infamous \\"philosophical speech\\" in Part Three is at least worth reading. Rand's shorter articles, such as those compiled in The Voice of Reason, are definitely deserving of the reader's attention as well. However, should the reader understand the philosophy before reading Atlas Shrugged, he will find himself cursing Dagny Taggart for not \\"getting it\\" sooner, as he does, and dragging him along for well over a thousand pages before she finally realizes that the \\"producers\\" and the \\"looters\\" cannot coexist. I know I am spoiling the book slightly, but one does not read Ayn Rand to be entertained and held in suspense until the closing revelation. There is, in fact, no closing revelation; the whole of the book's philosophy is presented well in advance of the climax.Altogether, it should at least be read once, whether one agrees with it or not. I certainly will not read it again for twenty years or so, but it was worth it the first time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I know Ayn Rand wanted to be a novelist first, and only used her philosophy as a starting point to write a compelling novel. Unfortunately, Atlas Shrugged is not a great novel. It's very difficult to get into, because the characters are personified ideals, and don't seem human at all. In the beginning I didn't care about the characters at all, and didn't really care what happened in the story; it all seemed ridiculous to me. I struggled through the first 300 pages (and it eventually took me a whole week to finish!). I'm of the opinion that novels shouldn't be this challenging.However, as a philosophy text, it's wonderful (regardless of your personal philosophy). If you've read philosophy, especially in its nonfiction, essay form, it's very hard to understand. Put the philosophy in a novel form with a story and it's much easier to understand the argument the author is making. If this were Ayn Rand's intention, it would have gotten 5 stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"...... and the world tumbled down !!!!\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is an interesting tale, almost with a fable-like quality in its use of metaphors.

I remember my friend telling me an amusing anecdote -- A friend of his was reading \\"The Fountainhead\\" in a busy restaurant in India. An old man walked up to him and said - 'Don't read this book. It will make you behave rudely towards people'. Just one incident which underscores the rift between the 'believers' and 'non-believers' of Objectivism.As an admirer of Miss Rand's works, it was (fortunately, some of my fellow reviewers would say) quite late, in my late 20's that I first read her works. And though I confess that in my earlier days, I did display some fiesty temperament towards religion, government and the 'mob' as such, it is only NOW after reading A.S. that I can fully comprehend my mental state in those tumutous years of youth. Unlike the majority of Ayn Rand followers, I firmly believe that the correct age for reading this book is not the teens, but the 20-30 age group when you can allow your personal experiences to \\"filter\\" the philosophic thought from the emulsion of \\"drama\\" ( as an aside -- I quite agree that her novels are quite 'dramatic' than 'melodramatic' ). In the hands of the inexperienced youth, the tools of Objectivism lend themselves easily to fanaticism -- a trait very commonly observed on the reviews for this book too !! Being a believer and a fanatic are two very different states of consciousness. Please learn to differentiate using your rational thinking.Though I do not agree with all aspects of her novels - for e.g. her potrayal of women who always 'look up' to the ideal man to save them -- I whole heartedly agree with the axiom -- \\"A is A\\". That \\"existence\\" is a fundamental property of the Universe, and that man is only aware of it through his faculties of cognition - his rationale.That A.S. has proved to be a very influential book on the lives of millions of people, and that it still sells in thousands every year --- is my one and only argument against those who raise the issue of it being 'good novel'. Remember- AR never wanted to classify her works as literature - she always considered herself as a 'novelist-philosopher'; and in that respect, I would consider her to be one of the best novelists of our times. That A.S. is second most influential after the Bible, is my case for the fanatical (and un-rational) behavior mentioned earlier.Objectivism, as is generally thought, is not entirely something Ayn Rand dreamt up one day. She did coin the term, but the ideas of 'individualism', and 'rational thinking' are absolutely not her brainchild. They were present in the works of numerous philosophers before her (viz. her favorite - Aristotle). But what sets Ayn Rand apart is that she chose not the tedious and rigorous literary path to explain her ideas, but the most conventional form of 'popular writing' -- novels. That is why she got the message across to millions of people, effectively.It would be an insult not only to her - but to the very concept of individualism - if we think of Man as an 'island' and treat others with lesser abilities with contempt. I would like to state a Malaysian proverb -- \\"Give a beggar a penny, and you feed him for a day. Teach him a job and you feed him for a lifetime\\". The need is not to antagonize the government against the intellectuals. It is rather the opposite - to operate (NOT co-operate) individually upon the society -- the government establishing a rational precedent, and the intellectual shaping the society by his thoughts AND deeds - after all a good businessman of money is no less a philosopher than the philosopher of truth.And yes -- I DO think of the cast of A.S. if it were ever made -- I think Jude Law would be perfect as John Galt, Gwyneth Paltrow or Charlize Theron (after losing some pounds) as Dagny, Ben Kingsley as James Taggart, Michael Caine as Midas Mulligan, Pierce Brosnan as Hank Rearden, Angelina Jolie as Lilian Rearden, Brad Pitt as Ellis Wyatt, Antonio Banderas (of course !!) as Francisco D'Anconia ..... well , if wishes were horses :-D ...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's simple.

Rand is brilliant. The scariest thing about this is how much of it seems to come true in real life. You don't even have to agree with her views 100% (I certainly don't) to benefit. In fact, I think anyone posessing an open mind should *want* to hear things that differ slightly from their own beliefs.And I wonder, could we ever get to the point of actually needing a John Galt? Would I be strong enough to join him? Dare I dream - to be him?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'd heard a lot about Ayn Rand before I finally picked up one of her books. Mostly negative stuff, cursing her and her selfish philosophy. When I read atlas Shrugged, I immediatly realized why it was so controversial. ... The storyline is outstanding and as the plot progresses, Ran'd philosophy comes through clearly. The characters are brilliant and Francisco d'Anconia will always remain one of my favourites.

I could go on, expound on the objectivist philosophy, but that is not the point of my review. Suffice it to say that I consider the reading of this book as a defining moment in my life.Why then did I rate this masterpiece as merely two star? Quite simply to deter people from buying the paperback edition - mine fell apart. I am by no means a rereader of books, in fact, the only books I've ever read more than once are Snot Stew (don't ask) and The Wheel of Time series (Robert Jordan). In the past two and a half years I have quite literally read this book to pieces. Three of them to be exact.So if you are considering buying the paperback version, please, reconsider and buy the hardcover. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Contrary to what some readers below have claimed, Ayn Rand never suggested that she published her book on her own, or that life consists of individuals producing things entirely of their own capacity. Read her books and this is clear. Every one of her heroes uses resources that other have produced. What Rand DID advocate is that individuals should have the right to exchange goods and services as they choose, and that no one should be forced or obligated to sacrifice his products to anyone else. That's what free market capitalism is. There is a great difference between complex interaction of independent producers and collective, sacrificial socialism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;... and traced out in space the sign of the dollar.&quot"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've been reading this on and off for about six months. Very interesting - I especially like the character Hank Rearden. I agree with Ayn Rand about everything, except the egoist thing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Suffice to say that I loved this book - the only reason it gets not the last star is that in a couple of parts - Ayn beats the reader over the head with her ideology and I found that a bit insulting.I am writing this however, to comment on the reviews written by other readers (and I know that this may be a breach of protocol here - bear with me). People either love this book or they hate it. People either agree with Ayn Rand or they disagree with her... and strongly. There is little middle ground. Her work has provoked a lot of thinking and conversing between these two camps of intelligent people. However, whether or not one agrees with her seems to matter not in this case. Simply that she has made people think about their lives and their beliefs to me is the most important hallmark of her work. She (I believe) would have been more interested in the amount of thought and discussion that she has provoked, than in the number of people who end up buying in to her philosophy. To stimulate such a great number of people to think so much about things of this importance is an incredible achievement don't you think?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has many great points. Most parts of it are very readable, and it does indeed force you to look at our society in a different way. However, there are parts of it which are exceeding long, including one certain stretch of dialogue/address that stretches on for massive amounts of pages. Get through that however, and you may well find you enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think this is one of those books that has to be re-read every so often. Yes the characters are rather one-dimensional, yes the author is repetitive, yes the book is lengthy, but hey, it's still a good read! If you think about it this book has just about everything. It's a sci-fi mystery thriller romance with philosophy thrown in to boot. I can see where all the people who level charges at this book are coming from except for one. How can anyone say this book is boring? The fact that there is so much polemic generated in these review pages would seem to belie that, don't you think? Give it a read, it's engaging to say the least. For those of you who complained about its length, take it on a ten hour plane ride. You'll thank Ms. Rand for the 1000 plus pages. Oh yeah, by the way, after all these years I'm still in love with Dagny."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is certainly not the best book ever published, nor is it the worst; although one might assume so from the previous reviews.It is the story of a group of industrialists, scientists, even a lawyer (judge) who decide to stop the world by &quot;going on strike.&quot; They withhold their creative energy from the rest of society which must have it, by hook or by crook, in order to continue. Rand writes a compelling plot in which her philosophy (called Objectivism by its advocates and &quot;trash&quot; by its detractors) is explained.Mind you, I did say the plot was compelling. Rand's writing, on the other hand, is tedious -- overdone and rather boring at times. One of the main protagonists gives a radio speech to the nation (the time of the story is less than clear, perhaps the 1930's, but it seems later). The speech does seem to rival one of Bill Clinton's for length, although it says much, much more.Rand does bring out some excellent questions for the thinking reader, and one should try to answer them honestly. Even if one disagrees with her philosophy, the underlying thought of those answers can be very revealing of one's self."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's great masterpiece is ostensibly a work aboutpolitics, ethics, and personal triumph. However, whilethese are obviously important themes, this is a book that accomplishes a task rarely even attempted: a thorough exploration of philosophy's link to the mind of man. In an era when so many are thirsty for meaningful and thoughtful belief systems, Atlas Shrugged offers an intimate view of how our values and beliefs can and should move our daily lives."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Poorly written, hard to believe, full of wooden characters and bad dialogue - totally terrible! And long-winded terrible at that.Espouses a bizaare theory of economics where just a handful of \\"industrialists\\" are actually the only important people in the world -as if markets didn't drive economies, as if the supply and demand curves weren't even involved, as if investments and team work and workers didn't have an impact on product development.As a capitalist and someone who loves both good literature and just about anything involving market theory, I was so excited to read this book. Then I read it and I found out two things about Ayn Rand: (1) she can't write, and (2) she also doesn't understand a thing about economics.Read it if you want, but wow, is it bad."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read Atlas Shrugged a few times, and it's become less and less convincing each time I read it. Rand's basic premise is that the United States became the greatest country in the world because of the vision of a few great men who pursued their visions without the inteference of centralized, collectivist, and confisticatory government. Rand believed that the industrialist and the businessman were modern, unappreicated heroes whose greatness was exploited by an altruistic philosophy that punished them for their brilliance. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand creates a world in which all of the productive members of American society are convinced by John Galt to \\"drop out\\" and form their own Utopia to protect their brilliant contributions from exploitation by \\"looters\\" and \\"moochers.\\" This results in America's ultimate collapse, clearing the way for the men (and women) of ability to return to society build a new America based on selfishness and egoism on the ashes of the destruction wrought by collectivism and altruism.There are two main problems with Atlas Shrugged. The first is philosophical. Rand ignores the fact that capitalism has survived in the United States because it has been supported, and often saved, by the government. The great economic achievements in America's history, far from being the product of a few unfettered and creative industrialists, were actually the product of government support and aid. It was government regulation that saved the US economy from itself during the Great Depression. It was government protectionism that protected nascent American industries during the early years of America's nationhood. The America that Rand imagines really never existed, except in theory.The second problem with Atlas Shrugged is the writing. The book is long, the dialogue unconvincing, and the characters unbelievable. Rand creates the greatest collection of straw men ever knocked down in print. James Taggart, Cuffy Meigs, Wesley Mouch, Dr. Sadler, and a cast of others are ridiculous caricatures. They are stupid, petty, and vindictive to the point of ridiculousness. The heroes in the book, by contrast, are individuals with seemingly superhuman intellectual gifts. Also, Rand should not be allowed to write sex scenes. They were completely out of place. Atlas Shrugged is a book with little nuance or subtlety. It is a thousand-plus page assault. It is often said that when your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. This book is a perfect example of that."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand, genius author of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is perhaps the most proific writer I have ever read. This is a book every American should read! She weaves a love story so elequently into a receipe for communism, the words jumped up off the pages for me. This is how it can happen and has happened in America. An ever-relevant example of how ignorant, greedy people can destroy a democratic republic. This remains a relative wake-up call for all Americans. A must-read for all freedom loving people! Bravo, Ayn Rand!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is one of those rare treasures that comes along once a decade or so. It is hard to believe that a book of 1,200 pages could be so captivating page after page and maintain a pleasant pace. Rand's style is among the best I have ever read. She is a true wordsmith and describes scenes, people and events with amazing attention to detail. Her dialogue brings human nature to light in a way that is insightful and believable. The larger-than-life characters are memorable and fascinating. This book is truly unparalleled in its scope and magnitude. I recommend this book highly, but it is not a book to be approached casually. If you are looking for some light reading before bed each night, this is not the book you are looking for. If you have a heavier appetite, then this book will be well worth your time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, this isn't an easy read.Yes, you will find yourself getting angry at many points while reading this tome.Yes, it is worth it.Read it.Think about it.Talk about it.Open your mind and look around at today's society and then read the book again.Think about it again.Keep talking about it.Then maybe, just maybe, the world will start talking about it and finally get it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand makes Charles Dickens seem like a pretty taciturn guy.When you have a comma in the number of pages of a book, it can be quite intimidating. But at 1,000-plus pages, Atlas Shrugged is worth the effort. Compelling writing, some profound truths about the nature of work and productivity and risk/reward. This is a book with rich visual imagery. I know a movie is being made of it, and wonder how they'll manage to bring it in under 3 hours.In any event, I'll see it, fascinated to get a glimpse at others' view of the world that Rand has created."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ok, this is nobody's idea of a fun, light read. It's a well-told story of a railroad mogul's two adult kids who are trying to keep the trains running in their own ways.James is a latent communist who thinks he can make everything work out by supporting rules and laws that punish achievement and elevate the \\"needy\\" in the name of fairness. His sister Dagny cares more about personal excellence than 'fairness' and works diligently to try to keep it all running.Eventually she discovers the relic of a legendary engine that runs on static electricity, which leads her to seek its creator. She finds him - and a secret underground of the nation's super-achievers who have dropped out of society because they are tired of society squeezing them because of their success.Ok, I know that Atlas is considered a political manifesto these days. As such, it has a lot to teach about Communism, Capitalism, Government, industry and personal excellence.Ayn Rand's characters are mysterious and their motivations well designed. Her style is a little long-winded, but overall enjoyable. I suppose if you are a communist or big liberal, you'll hate it politically, but I strongly recommend it for anyone who cares about any of these subjects, regardless of what they already believe."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Regardless of your political views, you cannot deny that Atlas Shrugged contains strong and valid arguments for a government that strictly exists only to protect the basic, fundamental rights of all humans - the right to life, the right to liberty, and the right to own property. The government upholds these rights by maintaining a military for defense, a police force for enforcing the laws, and a judicial system for justice. That's it.Yes, that's it. Government, in Rand's view, exists only to protect those rights, and does not exist for anything else. There would be no government involvement in providing healthcare to the poor, no public education, and not even government-funded roads and highways. Because of this, taxes would be extremely small, and there would be no economic regulations - no minimum wage, no 8-hour workday, and no unemployment and welfare.Atlas Shrugged demonstrates why this is the way society should be by demonstrating what happens when the American government gets more and more invovled in public life. The story begins with few economic restrictions, but the leaders of the country develop altruistic attitudes, and believe that each man has a moral obligation to help his community. They develop laws that, in effect, take money from the wealthy, sucessful businessmen, and redistribute to the poor, who, in Rand's view, do not deserve the money.The top businessmen, who have earned all of their money through their superior methods of production, begin to slowly quit working, because they are sick of, as a result of their ability to produce, having their money taken away from them in the name of altruism. Due of the absense of the businessmen, America, along with the rest of the world, begins to slowly decline, which prompts more economic regulations to be passed, which prompts more businessmen to quit, which prompts even more regulations....The economic regulations which are passed restrict superior technology from entering the field due to what is percieved as bad social affects. For instance, the heroine of the story, Dagny Taggert, manages to create a train which would run at 200 miles per hour. Because a railroad company with trains going this fast would naturally put all other railroad companies out of business, the government passes a law preventing trains from going no more than 60 miles per hour, limiting the capability of Dagny to deliver the maximum quality transportation.This 1000 page peice of fiction is filled with examples like the previous one that continue to reiterate why government needs to \\"get the hell out of my way,\\" in the words of one character. Rand takes altruistic government views to their logical conclusions, in which society is full of poverty, corruption, and crime, and the \\"men of the mind\\" - the ones who think and produce, and in effect hold the world on their shoulders, have been elimated.Although I disagree with many of Rand's views (privatizing roads, for instance, sounds unimaginable), this book presents an outstanding argument against altruism, against socialism, against any government invovlement other than the protection of rights, and reminds people of why we should work hard in this capitalist society instead of whine and complain and try to take the money from those who have earned it. Most people who despise Atlas Shrugged because of its completely selfish views still have nothing to say refuting the principals stated in the book, as you can see with the 1-star reviews here. This book is an outstanding read, it promotes unique and original ideas, and will continue to be discussed for centuries."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another, nor ask another man to live for mine.\\"This is the creed of the heroes of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", Ayn Rand's epochal novel about the triumph of the mind and the unlimited potential of human ability. In it, Rand provides a stark warning against collectivism and the progressive/liberal mindset that the producers of the country should be punished for their success and sacrificed for the \\"poor\\". This serves the essence of her \\"Objectionist\\" philosophy, a close relative to the Libertarian ideals of government and property. Indeed, Rand dedicates an entire chapter to postulating her beliefs via John Galt, an unheralded inventor who decides to \\"stop the motor of the world\\" by convincing those of mind to withdraw from society.Essentially, this is a novel where the successful producers of society show a collective middle finger to their leeches and let them struggle to subsist in their own cesspool of socialist ideals. This explores the extremes of collectivism, when the mindset of the looters, as Rand calls them, is that need trumps ability, ability should be punished, and a pursuit of self-interest is greedy and selfish. This novel has many elements that are too prevalent in today's society - the entitlement mentality, the guilty rich, junk science, just to name a few. The heroes of Rand's world are the unapologetic capitalists who ask nothing of others and strive to live life to the fullest, for the fulfillment of one's ego is an end in of itself. The \\"good of society\\" is a thinly veiled phrase used by corrupt powermongers to seize control of the country through mandates, directives, and regulations. The youths are taught that the \\"mind is the root of all evil,\\" that there is no right or wrong, and no black and white. Everyone is expected to obey - not to think. The dregs of society are elevated on a pedestal, while the producers are delegated to evil and greedy.This is an epic novel, both in length and ideals. Honestly, I could write pages and pages of essays about the various issues raised. However, I will say that one idea that resonates with me is that some people will dislike you, not because of your failures, but because of your success, be it in business, sports, or school. Undoubtedly, you should always strive to be the best, and let the others you leave behind be damned if they want to bring you down to their subpar level.Rand provides a powerful punch against socialism and collectivism. Indeed, most of Rand's ideas has been validated by the fall of the Soviet Union, although it seems like the lesson will never be fully learned. For those of the liberal/progressive persuasion, this book will challenge your dearest ideas about \\"social responsibility\\" and the roles of the \\"poor\\" and \\"rich.\\" Be warned, though, as this might be an unending torture if you are hostile to her ideals, especially in the voluble chapter in which John Galt postulates the Objectionist philosophy on a hijacked national radio broadcast.This is a book that is a challenge to read because of its length, but it is well worth the effort. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" may challenge the very foundation of your inner-self."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, named one of the most influential books next to the Bible, employs a biblical technique in the sense that Ayn Rand's entire system of beliefs and philosophy presents itself in the form of a parable, illustrating the stark juxtaposition of right and wrong in Rand's mind. A clear distinction between the \\"men of the mind\\" and those who wish to exploit/destroy the mind, paints in black and white Rand's definition of life, and what it means to live fully and without restraint. Evident in the laws of her fictional society, Rand's disdain for the idea of responsibility towards those less fortunate, and apologizing for success confronts common societal ideals and obligations, whilst portraying the intricate stories of a group of industrialists, led by John Galt. Galt is the ultimate symbol of the book's result - the absolute advocate for man in all his glory, as an instrument of production, a creator of theory and an entity unto and for himself. The reason Atlas Shrugged remains a major influence in literature is that the massive finality of Ayn Rand's philosophy forces the reader to be introspective towards uncovering his or her own beliefs and determining where they stand in relation to this bible of objectivism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged provokes, as you can tell from the other reviews on this site.

I had also watched the documentary on Ayn and she is a persuasive speaker and a clear thinker and her thoughts are presented over and over again in this book through various angles/situations.If you like philosophy, non-sappy female heroine and logical, rational arguments, this is a good novel for the beach.

Apply it to the current tax cut debate. By the way it is also a very engrossing story from the perspective of pure fiction, regardless of philosophy.It would be interesting if the ratings that this book received were broken down to reveal whether or not the reader considered themself to be &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot;.

She did make mistakes in her thinking at times and she did have personal shortcomings she let interfere with her objectivity. Her (or anyone's) life cannot a reference point for any other. BUT HER PHILOSOPHY IS SOUND. Atlas Shrugged cannot be read as a philosophical treatise: IT IS A NOVEL. This does not change the fact that Ayn Rand is the most powerful thinker to come along in far too many years.What we see in these reviews is the typical: a register of emotionally charged people, defending and attacking, willingly avoiding truth in the name of deep-set adoration or malice. Do they indeed avoid truth? Observe the gushing reviews of people who sound like they've had an overpowering religious experience, wearing out all the familiar words and generalities I've gotten well used to over the past year. Yes, Atlas was a remarkable eye-opener for me as well, but once your eyes are open you've got to start exercising them. And I can't help but laugh at the attacks. I can see that a lot of these folks have only read a little about the book, if that much, and seriously think that they have a case against Ayn Rand. One attacker from Austin spat all over a scene from the Fountainhead, thinking they were really referring to Atlas! You all seem to have your minds and emotions already tied up in other propaganda to effectively criticise Ayn Rand, or any other opposing view. Do I have this problem myself? I used to defend and believe in a view totally opposed to Objectivism. I got real.All in all, Amazon has recieved a poor stock of reviewers among its &quot;customers&quot;(why, yes, I AM an Amazon.com customer).I encourage all of Ayn Rand's detractors to read her book without beginning with the attitude &quot;what does this right-wing/libertarian rip-off/Nietzschian lunatic want with me?&quot; You'd be doing your mental health a saving grace.Thank you, Amazon.com! Keep up the great work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you have been confronted with today's socialist demands on your time, space and money, and have had no ready response to defend what you perceive is your own rights... If you hold an underlying guilt for trying to defend you rights, your property, and what you've worked for all your life, that you are being &quot;selfish&quot; and &quot;don't care&quot;... Ayn Rand, through the character of John Galt, will help you find those words, and help you understand why and HOW that guilt has been placed on your brain. Atlas Schrugged is one book that needs to be read slowly - but with an observer's eye of the overall scene being drawn by this artist. Don't stumble over trying to identify with the characters; try to perceive the bigger picture, the forethought and projection of the author's attempt to take you into the future... and see if it isn't coming into manifestation to a great degree today. Look at what is happening around you. After reading the book you may begin to see some of the characters from the book actually living and working right in your neighborhood, see them on TV and read about them in the newspapers. It is one of the greatest works I've found that helps one rise to the level of that of a reasoning soul or entity. Also, when very few books deal directly with values and morals, Atlas Schrugged is jam-packed with them; examples on both sides. There is a statement that 5% of the people think; 10% of the people think they think; and 85% of the people would rather die than think. This book shows that this statement if a fact. This is a book that actually digs deeply into the subject of &quot;love&quot; - all aspects - and may allow you to understand what love really is... and why that feeling of never finding it is so strong in many people; not knowing why. Additionally: read the strongly &quot;negative&quot; reviews of this book! You are actually hearing the mooching rotters from the book speak to you. They DON'T want you to read this book and will do anything they can to stop you. Why do they think they can succeed? Because they have! They have successfully halted you in your footsteps from thinking for yourself, with the help of their socialist cousins in the media, the universities and schools across our country and the churches.

The reasons/excuses used by the socialists in this book to governmentalize the various businesses are the same ridiculous arguments currently being used by the sitting politicians to privatize and socialize the corporations in order to enlarge and expand the government and its power. Which it has no business doing, especially when it created the entire problem to begin with. The democrats forced the banks to make bad loans to people who can't afford them because they decided that the American Dream was to own a house, which it is not. The American Dream is what this book is about. To make it on your own. Don't live your life on the welfare of anyone. The current American government is creating a nation of beholden slaves. People are slaves to unjust taxes being unconstitutionally stolen from them and given to people unwilling to work. Everyone should read this book, and hopefully understand how a truly free society could and should bless the lives of those who produce."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a book you'll probably either love or hate, depending upon your own personal beliefs. Academicians will no doubt hate it because the writing is awkward in parts and too preachy. Overall, I found Atlas Shrugged to be stimulating. Even though I don't agree with all the points made in the book, it made me reflect on my own life.Critics here who've cited Enron and WorldCom as examples of the dangers of under-regulated capitalism are missing the point. I don't believe Ayn Rand was saying that all business executives should be trusted or viewed as heroes. Those who've read the book know that Dagny Taggart's cowardly brother is a prime example of the incompetent businessman who takes credit for other people's achievements.There is no denying the influence this book has had. Modern Library put together a list of the 100 best novels. Ulysses finished first in the poll of board members, but Atlas Shrugged was number one among readers surveyed.Anyone looking for an insider perspective of the author should read Barbara Branden's book &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand.&quot; Branden was a disciple who later left Rand's inner circle. She made these comments in the introduction to her Rand biography:&quot;Those who worship Ayn Rand and those who damn her do her the same disservice: they make her unreal and they deny her humanity... She was a human being. She lived, she loved, she fought her battles, and she knew triumph and defeat. The scale was epic; the principle is inherent in human existence.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I first heard of Atlas Shrugged, it was an assignment for First Year Composition.

I would recommend reading this book if you have extra time on your hands or if you are a good reader. It will definately give you a view of a world that many of us could never imagine."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My aunt gave this book to me as a teen because she knew I was interested in political thought, and as a radical right winger, she thought the book would help me understand some of her beliefs. In that sense, the book was a success. I did get a clear understanding of Objectivism.The thing I didn't like was that the book was a political diatribe masquerading as a movel. Rand didn't need to try to mask her discussion of ideology in a novel; it wasn't a particularly interesting novel to begin with, in my opinion. There really wasn't much of a plot, and what plot there was seemed confusing and fuzzy. The characters were extremely one dimensional. I couldn't relate to them, and I didn't care about what happened to them. I was especially disappointed because I so enjoyed We The Living, another novel by Rand. The pace of the book was quite slow, and it was far, far too long -- over 1000 pages.I think there is value in learning about Rand's philosophy - she was an influential thinker. But this book isn't he best way to go about it. Read a book on objectivism, or a biography of Rand. If you want to see what Rand is capable of as a novelist, read We The Living."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's two most famous works, the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, express her fervent belief in the dignity of individualism. While the Fountainhead is a book that shows \\"one man's story\\", that of the architect Howard Roark, Atlas Shruigged is written on a far broader philosophical canvas -- it shows what happens to the world when the few creative and talented individuals, led by the engineer, John Galt, decide to withhold their talent from an ungrateful society.The book is fascinating in that it celebrates the ambitious individuals who, for a sense of personal achievement or gain, decide to make the world better. These are the healthy ones. Those who try to redistribute wealth, who act out of a misguided sense of fairness, or who downplay the individual, are revealed for what they truly are: \\"looters\\", who are living off the work of the few.Rand's personal life experience, growing up in Russia during the communist revolution, gives her a first-hand legitimacy in denouncing communism and socialism; her work is unusually prescient -- communism implodes in the real world just as it does in the world of fiction. She also captures the arguments used by the looters perfectly, and the tone of the characters feels eerily like today's Democratic party -- one feels behind their professions of virtue the iron fist of the culturally bankrupt mob.Although I enjoyed the book, and feel it is an excellent work in showing the importance of capitalism; it does seem to me that Rand's philosophy is a little narrow. Western culture has three great underpinnings -- Christianity, representative democracy, and capitalism. Rand rejects the first of these as being from the same redistributive font as communism, rejects the second of these as hopelessly corrupt, and instead places her faith solely in capitalism.Nevertheless, she makes a wonderful argument about the achievement and dignity of the individual, and her place in history is secure because of it. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My review of atlas shrugged is that it is very boring to someone like myself. I did, however, find the moral of the story and its concepts with each character very interesting. Ayn Rands philosophy is very broad but she does a good job in explaining in the story line. Her characters came to life with the words that she used to describe them and so did the scene of each chapter as well.

It is a long read and you have to give yourself time to get into the first few chapters. So much of it rings true... what obligation do we have to everyone else on the planet? Every reader and citizen of the modern world needs to add this classic to their library. (I would recommend &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; over &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; which is also excellent but which has not aged as well... some outdated treatment of women specifically).

This decision makes her character seem fickle and weak - when all through the book, her strength of character and beliefs are what keeps her going (this is the only reason I won't give the book 5 stars).

I'm amazed that the author can prove her point so well, for I've read books by many who don't. It's almost impossible to disagree after you've read this.

For all my 13 year life, people have teased me about how I'm &quot;too smart&quot; and always try (imagine that!) to stick out.

Down with \\"That Hurts my Feelings\\"!The premise of the book is that the doers of the world (the intellectuals and entrepreneurs) go on strike. They give to society what society desires. Since society feels that they get rich off of them the doers decide not to be a burden. Of course you can imagine what happens.The book is a story of love, power and greed.

I am normaly a fairly fast reader, finishing any book in a time faster then most.... But with reading Atlas Shrugged, that has been diffrent!!! I am still reading fairly fast, but only gaining 30-40 pages in an hour span, (which is faster then what my high school libarian is reading) Though this book is not the easyiest to get through, and at times it is a little hard to fully understand.

Its scope and grandiloquence are utterly breathtaking.The story details of a man of singular genius who said that he would stop the motor of the world...and did. As the world of modern man becomes mired in altruistic bromides, the men of ability become more and more burdened with the sustenance of other men.What would happen if those men of the mind chose not to participate in their own destruction? What would happen if those of ability and competence were to remove their sanction from the moral code that drives looters and freeloaders?_Atlas_Shrugged_ details the outcome of just those scenarios. It shows the reader--in unmistakable elegance and typical Randian eloquence--how the world would collapse if the victims who run it suddenly removed their sanction.If you are new to Ayn Rand, you may want to read _Fountainhead_ first. It offers a similarly driven protagonist, but its scope is much more digestable as an introduction. In this work, Rand's masterpiece, the reader will make a real investment in time (as the book is close to 1200 pages), but the investment just may change your life (as it has for countless others since its publication in 1957).I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is the only work that I have recommended as a &quot;must-read&quot; piece of fiction. Despite its size, I set aside some time every two years or so to re-read this milestone in human thought. Do yourself the same favor...you'll never be able to thank the person enough who first referred you!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whether you agree with it or not, this is a very readable book, 1000+ pages and all. This is a Great Russian Novel, and it is written in English. Apart from a few turgid multi-page lectures, it is, surprisingly, a real page-turner.Some elements of Ayn Rand's philosophy though haven't stood the test of time as well as the novel itself though, and seem a bit silly in the Clinton-Gates-Linux era. The novel is about what happens when entrepreneurs (the &quot;prime movers&quot; of the world) go on strike, protesting increasing government (&quot;looter&quot;) interference in the boardroom, especially evil anti-monopoly laws. The end result is that the good-for-nothing looters can't run the world, and beg the entrepreneurs to come back. The broad moral is that rational selfishness is the highest form of virtue, and the heroes of the world are self-made people who selfishly use their superior intellect for their own benefit (generally ending up as the founder-CEOs of big monopolistic corporations).I find this a bit ridiculous when it is applied to real people, especially today. Consider that great moral hero of our epoch, Bill Gates. Suppose he decided to &quot;go on strike&quot; like the characters in the book, and let the world suffer without windows. I doubt that the world would collapse. Also comparing him with the Linux people, I wonder who is closer to Ayn Rand's ideal. Gates' speeches and books are all fuzzy hypocritical stuff about his vision for society's (not his) future, and his products are plainly based on stolen ideas. Nothing wrong with either of these things, IMHO, but hey, reality check time. Compare with the Linux people, a bunch of selfish individualists who selfishly create their software for their own use, not even for the market, and whose commitment to open software is because they know that this is the quickest way to get a superior product. I somehow doubt though that Ayn Rand would have approved of them.On the whole however, I myself strongly agree with the individualist creed of the book. One should view the characters as representatives of ideal types rather than complex real people.Dittoheads reading this book for the privilege of dittoing it should be aware that it violently attacks both Christianity and conventional family values."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book helped me integrate the various apsects of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and thus helped me on the road to achieving a fully rational adult mind. Anyone old enough to handle a book of this stature should find it and read it immediately; it will either change your life or clarify what you've always thought implicitly. Truly the greatest book ever written."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have to give Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged a firm \\"thumbs down\\". This book was really tedious to read, the characters lacked depth, and Rand tended to get very preachy way too many times in this novel.I don't have any particular axe to grind with Ayn Rand. There's no question that she is a good writer, and that she is capable of writing a great and compelling story. I would place The Fountainhead, one of hear earlier novels, as one of my favorite books of all time. And I am fairly indifferent to her philosophy of Objectivism, so I'm not offended by her viewpoint.This is a huge novel about those who hold human achievement as the highest virtue of humanity, and those who would like to destroy those people by stealing, by mooching, and by force. Both types of characters are depicted as the extreme polar opposites of each other. As you can imagine, this creates a lot of conflict throughout the novel, but the characters are so extreme that they lack the depth of real human beings. This makes it quite hard to identify with any of them, although you become quite used to them and their ideas.Perhaps the most annoying aspect of Atlas Shrugged is how preachy Ayn Rand gets. Among all of the events of the story that depict how she feels about the world and about humanity, she has her characters go on rants for several pages about how achievement is good and how leeching and mooching is bad. The characters are not very creative with their rants, either. It's the same sentiment lamented over and over again, ad nauseam. Ok, Ms. Rand, we get the picture!If you're a rabid and staunch follower of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, then this novel will be a lengthy and grim fulfillment of self-affirmation. She spends over a thousand pages of very small font belaboring her point. I think part of her intention was to convert her readers by brute force. And isn't that how propaganda works? If you read/hear/see something enough, doesn't it become \\"true\\"? After reading The Fountainhead, I expected to read another compelling story that had a bit of her philosophy mingled in. Instead, I got a fictionalized manual for Objectivism. I take her philosophy with a grain of salt, and I can accept certain parts of it and put it into (what I believe is) the proper perspective, but the saturation of these ideas in Atlas Shrugged was so overwhelming to the point that it was, I believe, at the expense of the enjoyability of the story.If you're interested in Ayn Rand, I suggest that you read The Fountainhead first. Atlas Shrugged may ruin Ayn Rand for you, and you might have no desire to read any of her other works. I'm not sure why so many people regard this as her crowning achievement, because it made me shrug. I feel like giving it less stars, but for some reason I read the entire thing. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't great. If quantity was synonymous with quality, this would be worth so many stars that it would break Amazon's rating system. Just think twice before devoting the time it takes to read through this mammoth volume."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"TEN THINGS NOBODY TELLS YOU ABOUT \\"ATLAS SHRUGGED\\"1. You can skip Galt's speech, or at the very least skim it. By the time it takes place Francisco has already said most of it in monologues scattered throughout the first two parts. While the book does stand on its own merits as a novel, nearly everything that happens in it serves the end of demonstrating some tenet or other of objectivism.2. Hank and Francisco are gay. Consider the scene where Hank - at this juncture hip-deep in his affair with Dagney - moons around his hotel room fighting the urge to call Francisco when he finds out Francisco is in the building. Then consider the fact that both throw around the word \\"love\\" with regards to one another more than either of them spare it for Dagny. In fact, Hank is so tangled up in sex-guilt that he can't even acknowledge his love for Dagny at all until after she's already left him. Don't even get me started on that whole \\"my greatest conquest\\" thing. I find it amusing that all these Tea Party dominionists who want to cherry-pick away Ayn Rand's deep contempt for faith always cry about Hank's marital infidelity with Dagny - while this fairly blatant little plot element flies clean over their lily-white heads.3. If you try to approach reading this book as a philosophical manifesto, you will quickly grow bored. If you like steampunk and noirish melodrama, you'll have plenty to work with and will absorb the manifesto fairly painlessly. Ayn Rand initially tried her hand at screenwriting before becoming a novelist, and this book has several vividly-rendered set pieces that beg for cinematic blocking. Nearly every meeting that takes place among the bad guys has a \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" vibe. Hank and Dagny's romance is a fairly standard noir affair. Galt's Gulch reads like a technicolor fantasy ala \\"Brigadoon\\". The scene where Dagny addresses the workers in a skimpy evening gown evokes Maria in both of her guises in \\"Metropolis\\".4. It's not \\"selfishness\\", it's enlightened self-interest. Anyone who actually reads this entire thousand-plus-page behemoth, really reads it, will be able to make that distinction fairly easily, even if they have a huge problem with Aristotle and completely disagree with the economics this books champions (like me). The so-called \\"selfish\\" characters repeatedly admit that their own self-interest motivates them above all else, but they frequently risk their lives for one another. The bad guys preach altruism but knife one another in the back without hesitation.5. Overachieving college girls get hung up on this book. This could partly be because Rand's gushing, dated style reads like a college girl's writing, but it's probably mostly because young women, more than young men, are still indoctrinated into the idea that their greatest fulfillment in life will come from selflessness. This book does provide a bracing antidote to that school of thought, and in that respect it serves its function as a manifesto. Even today young women need to be taught self-interest, and Rand's near-pathological devotion to self-sufficiency is a potent counter-tonic to liberal womens' studies that tend to reinforce female victim status.6. Anorexics should probably steer clear of this book. Everybody who's awesome is lean and mean, while all the bad guys are as physically squishy as they are intellectually and morally bankrupt. Only the most evil of the evil, Dr. Ferris, is permitted to be good-looking. Lest you think I'm nitpicking about this trivial annoyance, notice that these physical distinctions are explicitly stated at least once per chapter. I'm not even kidding when I classify this book as a possible trigger for ana/mias - as a historical addendum Rand herself was dependent on amphetamines to maintain her trim bod.7. Dr. Stadler and Project X are based off of Rand's aborted attempt to do a journalistic piece on Robert Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb. Obviously the experience left Rand quite unimpressed with Dr. Oppenheimer, given that Stadler bears the dubious honor of being Rand's personal embodiment of pure evil. Further, Mr. Thompson is a vicious parody of Harry Truman. In this respect the book stands as a small but potent piece of history NOT written by the victors.8. Ayn Rand knew jack about math, engineering and economics. Trains, even modern ones, do not travel at an \\"average speed\\" of 100 mph in steep, mountainous terrain. They can't even reach that at top speed in those sorts of conditions. Rearden Metal as it is described sounds too brittle to work for railroad tracks, which require soft steel to accommodate the stress of heavy weights moving over it at high rates of speed at irregular intervals. As for economics, Ayn Rand may have learned the evils of collectivism at an early age when the Soviets seized her family's property in the name of \\"the people\\" - but she discovered late in life that unrestrained capitalism is the same evil inverted. Atlas Shrugged did not make Ayn Rand a buttload of money, and when she was diagnosed with lung cancer in her seventies she took advantage of medicare and social security to treat her illness. Some people say that because she used her actual married name of Ann O'Connor to receive these benefits, that meant she was trying to hide her turn at the federal teat from her followers. I don't see any evidence of this and it's beside the point anyway. No extreme economic philosophy works in practice. Pure anything leads to dictatorship; it's naive of Rand to act as though money isn't just as corrosive and corrupting a force as political clout.9. John Galt really isn't a good guy. Galt's strike causes just as much hardship and catastrophe as the policies it's meant to counter. This is a fairly major plot point that's glossed over: how much of the disaster that occurs in the book could have been averted if it weren't for the strike. And he makes no bones about the fact that he has been actively working for twelve years to undermine Dagny and effectively ruin her life. In fact as the whole picture comes together it becomes evident that he's a straight-up stalker. He convinces Francisco to leave her, gets a job on her railroad, lurks and watches her for twelve years, and cruelly ingratiates himself with Eddie Willers, whose definition of their relationship as friendship is apparently not shared by Galt in the slightest because it only serves his end of spying on Dagny. What happens to Eddie, incidentally, flat-out sucks, but the idea of a guy who'd rather die than end up permanently friend-zoned gave me a chuckle.10. A Danish philosopher-pirate who appears at random on dark deserted roads to hand millionaires bars of gold is never NOT hilarious."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The majority of people are not geniuses, though there are plenty of people out there who think they are geniuses but are mistaken. That the rest of the world should genuflect in front of all genius is an idea that belongs in a Marvel comic book or other superhero story publication for juveniles. How you treat others matters-- if you disagree, go beat up one of your friends for no good reason, in the company of all your other friends, and see how many you have left afterwards.This book takes you into a parallel universe. Not as if you were in a world where everyone is either \\"hero\\" producer or \\"devil\\" looter, but as if Nietzsche was translated from the German by Mickey Spillane. No, I'm being too kind. \\"Turgid\\" is an adjective often connected with Rand, and \\"philosophy\\" a noun, but sadly, Rand is neither Spillane nor Nietzsche with respect to those terms. The Perils of Pauline where the hero is an arrogant megalomaniac is perhaps a better approximation.That said, there is a lot of entertainment value in the Atlas Shrugged reviews here. A lot of the negative reviews seem to be rubber stamped with a completely canned response or two from the true believers. Well, I guess Rand demonstrates it amply in Atlas Shrugged, her definition of \\"productivity,\\" does in fact appear to be incessant repetition.And of course, most of the acolytes here proclaim (repeatedly, of course) how the rest of us just don't understand Rand. It's pretty ironic given the repetition with which she attempts to hammer out her ideas. She says the same thing over and over, yet we still don't, \\"get it?\\" Yes, Rand must be properly interpreted by the faithful, accompanied by the proper apologetics and usual accusations of ad hominem.What the believers seem unable to recognize, is the main reason Rand is so hard to \\"get\\" by the rest of us is that her philosophical message is just so unbelievably banal. That she could actually be serious simply stretches credulity too far, such that we must look further for a deeper message which, as it turns out, just doesn't exist. What you see is what you get, and that ain't much.Atlas Shrugged could be considered a Litmus test for those who can think for themselves. This is because there is only one set of ideas presented therein which are astonishingly simple minded. That simple minded ideas are often the most popular is obvious.\\"For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.\\" -- H. L.

Second, it shows how the evil, greedy industrialists we all despise have been carrying this country on their backs since the industrial revolution.The back-story in this case is really more important than the main storyline. The novel probably takes place sometime in the 1950s, and America is falling into an economic and spiritual slump. Communism is all the rage in the western hemisphere (though its never actually called \\"communism\\"), so the U.S. government finally decides to follow suit. Politicians, workers, and even businessmen are enthusiastic when successful companies become nationalized--its all in the best interest of \\"the people\\". Of course, bureaucrats don't know jack about running a business, so in their efforts to even the playing field for people who \\"never had a chance\\", they destroy multi-million dollar businesses that had been profitable for generations. Unwilling to see their life's work stolen from them and destroyed by looters, all the Rockefellers, the Atlases of America, start disappearing or sabotaging their businesses. By the end of the novel, the economy has collapsed and nationalized scientific research has produced a doomsday device--one that uses sound waves to make sheep explode miles and miles away.Ayn Rand thus proves that communism doesn't work. She follows the Marxist formula all the way through and no positive results are yielded: Workers are depressed and unmotivated; property and ideas are seized; the economy is destroyed; people and livestock are exploding. The scariest thing about all this is that it all sounds plausible. Even the sheep thing.

Hank, Dagny and Francisco all have self-confidence and they act on their desires.\\"Be a man of action\\" is a common theme of Atlas Shrugged. The idea that you can achieve your dreams and goals if you just go out and do it is awesome advice. I'm sure more than one person has unhappily sat on his or her sofa for far too long and lived to regret it. We tell children all the time that you can \\"be anything you want to be,\\" but this book illustrates that idea and allows the person to witness the truth of that lesson.The arguments complaining about a sense of elitism throughout the book are only partly true. Sure, the main characters want to live in their own ideal society, and they do, but they're not above letting a boy who works on a train into their society. The society is simply divided from the rest of the world because of philosophical agreement, just like any other society. If you don't like your current society, you can either change it or revolt. The main characters choose to revolt.The federal government taxing individuals to provide public facilities may not fulfill the entire definition of socialism, but it is an aspect of it. Rand realized that in order to escape socialism, there can be no compromises. Responsibility must be placed with the individuals of a society for the system of government to be fair. Rand wasn't arguing for a system of government with the end goal of a luxurious lifestyle. Her characters sacrificed a lot of their lives for their ideas. Hank sacrificed a decade to develop his steel. Francisco sacrificed most of his life, away from his love, to fulfill his goals. They weren't striving to be able to afford gargantuan houses, as apparent when Dagny visits the hidden town, but rather they wanted to live by how they thought was right. And to say one way of living is better than another is just an opinion.I'm just scratching the surface, but if my defense of the book sounds interesting, read it. If my defense doesn't sound interesting, read the book anyway.Despite the attention Atlas Shrugged receives for its philosophy, there's also gun fights and love spread nicely throughout the book like flavorful chocolate swirls in a homemade cake. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There is no better of a book to choose to read. Although it may seem intimidating at first, seeing as its 1100 pages of bible-sized print, it is an incredible read. Amazingly enough there are no weak or dull moments in the book, but only some of the most fantastic passages I've ever read.

The book is well planned and written. I could have done with a little less of the romance and completely without the authors disdain for religion. But that aside, it gives a very interesting and clear picture at just what could be on the verge of taking place here in the United States. Years ago I began to wonder at just what point do I get tired enough of having my hard earned money taken from me by the government, just so they can redistribute it as they see fit; most of the time being in total disagreement with what I think, so that I finally just say \\"that's it\\", \\"I've had it\\", and \\"I quit!\\" The government will no longer pay for their pork barrel projects at my expense! This is an excellent book to show the results of a capitalist society being forced to gradually accept the socialist, or state view of things. I highly recommend this book! Just ignore the atheist view regarding the Bible, tolerate the romance when it takes centerpiece, and concentrate on the real story of the book, and you will be well satisfied for having invested in this book!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This was a birthday gift for my sister who needed to \\"read\\" Atlas Shrugged but has ZERO \\"free\\" time between family, work and online schooling.

If you know someone who has been hesitant to commit to reading Atlas...this is the answer."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Once you make time for this novel, you won't be sorry. It is as pertinent today as it was in its initial writing. For Americans in particular, who in an election year face an unprecedented deficit, a deteriorating infrastructure system (bridges, electric grid, damns, roads, trains, subways), and rising commodity costs (grains, soy, cotton, metals, oil, gas, coal), this book is particularly thoughtful.Before getting into the details, I would first address those that find it \\"too extreme\\". While it is true, that Capitalism in its extreme is ugly and selfish; its roots lie in an attempt to inspire innovation and to advance society in toward being able to provide for the needs of all. In that regard, the setting of the early part of the century is necessary as it is difficult to see the importance of the argument she makes if one starts from the vantage of living in a modern economy where scarcity of resources is nearly non-existent and mobility is not an issue.However, what I find particularly interesting is that she separates the accumulation of wealth as a means to accomplish something from the accumulation of wealth for no purpose. This is often the part of Capitalism that is misunderstood by those that would go the other extreme. Indeed, for proponents of socialism, one should understand exactly what the dangers are that she so eloquently shows through her narrative. Any construct of socialism, which does not address the fallacies which she indicates would be subject to that she describes in the novel. In particular, she does an excellent job and showing exactly why that which is good for the \\"greater good\\" is often confused with \\"justice\\" or \\"right\\".There are so many takeaways; I leave it to the reader of her novel to discover them. Here are a few of my favorites.1. Equality must be equality. While many laws, organization/unions have arisen to protect against the \\"exploitation of the worker\\", the inverse is as bad. Systems which exploit the talent of a few without compensation or recognition are doomed to failure.2. The \\"greater good\\" when left to an uneducated, purposeless government, often resorts to fulfilling \\"immediate need\\", without consideration for long term growth, sustainability, or long horizon \\"greater good\\". I find this particularly interesting as we enter this new century in the United States where we see markedly failing infrastructure and a massive deficit.3. Most people are sheep. Regardless of how much wealth they or their families might have accrued, most blindly follow the lead/manipulation of others. As such, it is important that each individual make their own decisions and do their own research. Further, each person is accountable for their own actions and decisions.4. When you are focused on who is accountable, nothing gets accomplished. True leadership is taking ownership. However, that does not make you popular. Your desire to be a leader can not be driven by a desire for people to like you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is a Rand's masterpiece. It truly brings conservative economic theory to life. It does this is just under 1,100 pages, and about half of the book is filled with words that may not be completele necessary.

S. that is just as compelling today as ever. A true classic of American literature."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"So many are talking about this book that I decided to pick it up and give it a read.The novel reads easily for the most part. It's not overly challenging in tone or style, but entertaining and intriguing. The plot, generally, moves along quickly, essential for a book that runs over 1000 pages, and the characters are interesting, if a bit idealized.Even better, for a history buff, Amity Shlaes' (Non-Fiction) \\"The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression\\" reads like a prequel to this novel, setting the scene for the action and providing a logical intro.Still better yet, it is easy for anyone paying attention to current events to see how the novel, which is amusingly quaint in certain regards, relates to modern society and the political landscape of today.The real problem I had in reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was in the philosophizing. There appears to be much to admire in Ms. Rand's philosophy, despite an almost pathological rejection of religion, but it is presented very awkwardly at times. There are several long sections of the novel, culminating in a sixty-page monologue where the story just stops dead, and the reading becomes tiresome. I realize the monologue was supposed to be a critical point in the progression of the story, but it gets so repetitive and obvious that it feels like it takes longer to read than the rest of the novel combined.Personally, I felt the philospophy of Ms. Rand was better served in the actions of her characters, and most of the dialogue than in the diatribes scattered throughout. They made an interesting read much longer than it should have been."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a long book, physically and mentally.

It asks the provocative question, what would happen to the world if there were no creative, rational minds? The story takes place at some unknown time in America, and follows the lives of Dagny (the COO of the great TT railroad), Hank Rearden (the creator and manufacturer of a new kind of steel), and Francisco (owner/operator of the greatest copper mine)though the course of their lives.\\"Who is John Galt?\\", is the opening line, and has become a common expression of hopelessness in a declining America. While the current, statist government enacts increasing amounts of legislation which cripples the ability of creative minds to produce, it also seems that there is a great 'destroyer' that is slowly bringing about the dissapearance of those creative minds. Who and why would someone do such a thing?Profoundly a philosophical novel, Atlas deals with; altruism and egoism, individualism and collectivism, capitalism and socialism, facism, the role of guilt and morality, sex, what constitutes great friendships, the role of charity, the role of government, and the morality of money. (As an aside, The story of the 20th centurn motor company, broken up into several sections within the novel, is a particularily good critique of \\"to each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\\")In the great Romantic tradition, each line of Rand's epic is purposeful, contributing to the overall theme and driving the plot forward. However, unlike most novels, Rand's charaters are driven by the fundamental ideas they hold; this fact makes the characters deep in a way that isn't common. It is interesting that critics feel her characters are one dimensional; however, I think they confuse consistency with depth. Make no mistake, this isn't a modern, naturalist, slice-of-life novel, with characters holding deep and multiple contridictions; this is a highly stylized story with stylized characters that are put together as an intricate puzzle.Some of the depth of the novel can be gleaned from a fabulous podcast discussion found at exploreaynrand(dot)com.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In this cult classic, Ayn Rand tells the story of Taggart Transcontinental, Rearden Steel, and D'Anconia Copper, among other companies, in their trials and tribulations in running a business within the ever tightening confines of governmental control.

Riggio 4-28-10Having dodged reading Atlas shrugged in college, primarily because of its intimidating size and scope, recently, I have read many comments about how this book foretold current times in our country and world more than fifty years ago.Having set out to read this tome, I ordered it on Amazon, specifically ordering the hard bound edition. What I did not realize when I received this book that it was really a paper back sized book with a hard cover binding. Each page was filled with over 500 words, in your typical paperbound book sized font. With a total of 1,070 pages in this edition, we are talking over a half a million words. I read about 100 pages and struggled with my aging eyesight to grasp what was presented. I then searched several libraries to find a bona fide hard bound edition which came out in 1995. The print was a bit larger but still over 1,000 pages of text. I learned in my search for a normal hard bound edition that the 1995, 35th edition was the last printing of this book. The copy I bought from Amazon was the 50th Anniversary edition and came out in 2007. The original publication of Atlas Shrugged was in 1957, though it was written in the late 1940's.The book took me about 100 pages before I got a flavor for the worth of this book. When I got the library edition, it was much easier to read and my reading time was accelerated accordingly.Ayn Rand's character development was initially difficult to follow but soon took on a flow which captured and held my interest.The story is a complicated struggle between prominant industrialists from several industries concentrating on the Railroad and Steel business', and their struggle with government bureaucrats bent on social issues and progress.The capitalists represented what was bad for society and how selfish the industrialist were in their seeking profits. On the other side the beauractats were the \\"white hats\\", looking out for the concerns of the \\"people\\", both the working class and the non achievers in our society.As government became bigger and issued more and more controls over industry and transportation in an effort to create equalness, the white hats became the black hats and the industrialists the victims of opressive regulations.The bureaucrats developed into the champions of the non producers and the arch enemies of productivity and consequently creativity. The industialists are forced into an ever tightening corner in view of oppresssive regulations thus limiting and styming both production and creativity. The result is a complete withdrawal of producers resulting in the absolute failure of government.The hero of the story John Galt is for most of the book a near fictional character with many different stories about this existance and origin. Not until chapter seven do we actually hear from John Galt and his intentions based on his philosophy based on moral values to destroy the beauracrats, now being refered to as \\"looters\\" who have stalled completely any productive growth in any industry in the country and the slow but constant decline of companies and people.Dagny Taggart, an heiress to the Taggart Railroad is the idealist heroine who struggles against the looters and tries to keep the railroad in operation as industries are failing all around her. Dagny is struggling to find both meaning to life and her ideal of love. The post coital dialog between two lovers is the most interesting and somewhat astonishing verbal exchange I have ever read but notwithstanding the negatives of the conversation the two become true heroes of the book.Ayn Rand is both a suberb story teller, albeit with lots of words but also a philosopher advocating the the continued accomplishments of man while condeming the haners on. She would be appalled to see the direction our country and the world is taking today.My one criticism of her philosophy is that it does not truly recognize a higher power and man is a creation of himself and not a creature burdened by \\"Original Sin\\" therefore God's importance is diminished accordingly.The book is worth the read especially in today's political, economic and social struggles."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Great classic that applies to today.

It maybe a long book but well worth the message."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Short answer = One of the best novels I have ever read.This book reminds of Napoleon Hill's \\"Think & Grow Rich\\" in regards to its popularity. They both seem to fall into 1 of 2 categories: 1) One is aware of the title and has read the book. - or - 2) Never heard of it.I listened to the audio version and then soon found myself searching online for quotes from the book. I am an avid non-fiction reader and rarely indulge in fiction. Nothing against fiction, I just prefer to use my entertainment time elsewhere (revealed later). I listened to the unabridged version (almost 63 hours = 2.6 days = yes,a long time) in less than a week, even skipping watching a few college football games. Something I would normally label as a sacrifice, for it is one of my few indulgences. However, as made pointedly in the book in regards to the meaning of \\"sacrifice,\\" what I received in exchange was of greater value thus resulting in no \\"sacrifice.\\"Some reviewers took issue with the flow of the material. Perhaps because I listened to the audio version, I did not find the style to be old fashioned nor difficult to follow as sometimes books are that were written in a different era. As one modern day reference indicated in the review title, there were multiple occasions when today's politics couldn't be helped to be brought to mind. I can accept that some label the novel's theme as \\"selfish\\"; however, I would challenge their perception toward its meaning. Just as I have changed my perception of \\"liberal\\" to be used as: that of one whom is \\"liberal\\" mandating others relinquish their efforts (time or money) for the sake of a cause before actually relinquishing any of their own.Should you pick up a copy of this book?This novel probably won't satisfy your need for fiction if \\"Twilight\\" or \\"Harry Potter\\" is what you are looking for. However, there are well defined characters, an intriguing plot and enough romance within \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" that would make for a great read by most as long as they probably weren't a committed communist. It may even provide a spark for those that are hesitate about taking a risk toward fulfilling their true purpose."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If everyone in America read this book our problems would be small and insignicant.

It then dawned on me that I would have to read the only book ever published that's better than the Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged.

This book changed my life. As the ultimate champion of reason, logic and man's right to his own life, Rand defines a code of values that is consistent with everything that is beautiful and just in our world. I have tried my best to live as an Objectivist, and don't regret having chosen to do so. It is touching that so many young people are so attracted to Ayn Rand's book so many years after she first published it.Her philosophy is indeed idealistic. If all humans heeded Rand's axiom that no man has the right to initiate the use of physical force against another, there would be no such thing as war. If everyone accepted Rand's idea that each person has a right to their own life, America's relentless drift toward egalitarianism and socialism would cease.Even though people don't widely accept Rand's ideas in today's world, her Objectivist philosophy is by no means too idealistic to serve as a guide for practical living. Only through the use of reason and logic and a proper understanding of absolutes can truly complicated issues be resolved. By contrast, pragmatists and nihilists like James Taggert, Cuffy Meigs and their counterparts in America---liberals---have no clue about how to address complex societal issues."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the masterpiece of one of the world's most brilliant writer/philosophers, Ayn Rand. For those who accept the responsibility of becoming the new intellectuals, Atlas is of paramout importance. The plot itself is remarkable for its planning and execution. The thematic elements are of such a calaber that similar achievements in literature are rarely, if ever seen. Ayn Rand had a gift for expressing powerful philosophic concepts in terms, which anybody who was able to think, could easily understand. Atlas Shrugged relates the story of a world where capitalism is slowly being asphyxiated by governmental edicts, and the mind is regarded as a powerless lump of cells. The metaphysical similarities between Rand's portrayal of the United States, and the future we seem to be hurtling towards are both sobering and terrifying. This is a book for those who accept that joy is the natural state of man. Who believe that human life is only sustained through productive work, and that to deny a man the fruit of his labors, is to deny him life. This is a book for those who live their lives by reason, neither using emotions as a tool of cognition, nor looking to the supernatural for guidance. In short, this is a book for those who wish to exist on Earth."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"read the book and change the world and your life.

As of 11/8/2009, Amazon shows 42 posted reviews of Ludwig Wittgenstein's TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS, 26 posted reviews of his PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS, and 1,943 posted reviews of Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED. Posted reviews of ATLAS SHRUGGED thus outnumber those of Wittgenstein's TRACTATUS and INVESTIGATIONS combined by a margin of 28.57 to one. I have no fix on annual readership numbers for any of the three books, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that ATLAS SHRUGGED beats out the two Wittgenstein books by at least 100 to one. Although none of this has implications for the comparative statures of Rand and Wittgenstein as 20th Century philosophers [Dan Brown's 2009 readership dwarfs Rand's: is he therefore more important than she as a philosopher?], there's probably a moral in here somewhere, teasing out which I leave to my betters.Ayn Rand is no exception to the generalization that authors of utopian literature usually stack the deck to favor their chosen ideology. How often does it turn out that the viability of the advocated social-political order requires a population of ideal citizens? Given an ideal citizenry, of course, virtually ANY system works well.Literature-wise, ATLAS SHRUGGED competes favorably with Terry Southern's THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN as a piece of comic fiction. Characters and plot are figments of a third-rate imagination (case: a supposed-to-be-highly-talented walk-on who insists upon employment as a janitor for exclusively PHILOSOPHICAL reasons). Rand won't countenance for an instant the possibility that somebody might size up characters or plot developments differently from the way she intends; so she lectures her readers for pages on end about the ONLY permissible way to interpret her narrative. My favorite example: Rand strenuously insists that when her protagonist-hero John Galt rapes heroine Dagny Taggart, a transparent idealization of Rand herself as a genius with irresistible good looks, his action MUST be perceived as a purely rational act rather than an act of ungovernable passion. In Rand-World, you see, the good guys never get carried away.Rand's prose style is a hoot also. She composes a long, tangled counter-factual description of the way John Galt looks when he walks, a description that more or less amounts to saying: \\"He walked as he would have walked if he had walked exactly as he did, in fact, walk.\\" I sure wish I could write like that.Which brings us to the fundamental message of ATLAS SHRUGGED. The novel inducts us into Rand-World, which is populated with two kinds of people: Objectivists, who preach selfishness but go around doing things that benefit everybody, and Altruists, who preach brotherly love but go around screwing people. This is supposed to teach us that Selfishness is the TRUE philosophy and Brotherly Love is the FALSE philosophy. Deep. Really deep.The thesis that what's morally right is what serves one's own self-interest is called \\"Ethical Egoism\\". Rand publicly denied subscribing to Ethical Egoism. Nevertheless, by making the Objectivist characters in her novels advocate a MORAL commitment to their own self-interest, she encouraged every reader who would identify with those characters to think that the selfish life is a moral life--even though this leads to paradox (heinously selfish criminals, for starters, become moral exemplars). Rand conspicuously tried to give the selfish life a patina of moral respectability by implying in ATLAS SHRUGGED that the world at large benefits by the selfishness of Objectivists in particular. Now, to argue that such benefits are anything but accidental is an excellent way to establish one's eminence in the pantheon of laughable imbeciles. More to the point, to argue philosophically that benefits to others provide the moral justification for one's own selfishness effectively makes one an Altruist.Rand-World, whose optative ruling class is populated exclusively with ultra-rich, ultra-right-wing capitalist/genius Uebermenschen, is clearly intended to be morally and intellectually attractive. It's neither. The overwhelming majority of all the people who ever lived don't qualify for inclusion as anything more than limousine hood ornaments or lobby doormats for plushly-appointed corporate suites. Readers of ALTAS SHRUGGED are informed personally by John Galt in his supposed-to-be-climactic 60-page speech toward the novel's end, \\"WE don't need YOU.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I payed twice what the back of the book said a paperback cost and the book was in such poor condition that the first chapter of the book came out before I could start the book.

As for the views on Capitalism...They are very stupid. Capitalism is a system which is on the road to an eventual doom regardless of how it's been doing the last century. Marx claimed that only a nation which is fully and totaly capitalist to it's maximum degree can truely push people over the edge to communism, and that will be America 50 to 200 years from now. It's already begun, with the corporations having sunk thier teeth into the white house and forcing us to have the president they want in office, to go war for financial gain, and neglecting the peoples interests (like having our electricty work). But I'm not cheering communism, I'm putting down capitalism and Ayn Rands points of view...How can someone possibly look you in the eye and say J.Lo (who recently spent over $20,000 to have her hair done) earned all her money through talent and hard work?

One person in my life kept telling me over the decades that I HAD to read this book. Well, after many years, a great deal of maturing both chronologically and mentally, and loads of experience, I opened the cover and began.I hope that Ayn Rand gave this book to her psychologist/psychiatrist or was hoping, when this book was published, that one would take up the cause and approach her to offer his/her services. This has got to be one of the darkest, most cynical, and depressing novels I have ever read. And, I would be remiss if I did not say that it was loaded with sadism and masochism--if one is into S&M.; I know that some would say that my description of the story is true and was part of her point!I cannot believe that her editors didn't see their way clear to tailoring down the unnecessary amount of verbiage she spewed throughout the pages. How many different ways can one say the same thing and then say it again? Too bad Moon Struck wasn't around when this was being written so that someone could have referenced Cher slapping Nicholas Cage's face and telling him to, \\"Snap out of it\\"!After all this anticipation, I concluded that Atlas Shrugged was the most disappointing book I have ever read. Disappointing isn't a strong enough word for a novel that I waited until this time in my life to tackle. I almost laughed at myself to think that I believed I didn't have the intelligence or capacity of mind to understand this 'great' work--said tongue and cheek!To insure myself that it wasn't just me that had this reaction, I spoke to any number of people who I respect when it comes to the world of books and good writing. Two in particular, one being a professor; the other runs an advanced book group, had the same reaction.Just so I don't leave any doubt, I am not expecting every book to read like a fairy tale come true. I have great admiration for books that lure me into the dark side of the author's expression. This book missed that lure. Instead, I felt assaulted.I give credit to anyone that can get through this vast sink hole of darkness. I wonder about those who praise this work as they revere Ms. Rand like a literary goddess. Do they really believe this was great writing or are they part of the herd? But, then again, what constitutes great writing?Enough said. Just a word of advice--don't read this before retiring as you may have some nightmares."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I was a naive young man, I thought Rand's philosophy made some sense. Now I find it to be intellectual snobbery. But what is most intriguing to me is the bizarre \\"marriage\\" between libertarianism and religious conservatism that has been occurring since the early 1990's, when southern Republicans took over the House and Senate. Suddenly, two conflicting ideologies were embracing each other. As others have mentioned, Ayn Rand was a staunch Atheist right up to her final breath. It is hard to see anything in her works that embraces \\"Christian values.\\" But since Newt Gingrich, et.al., we are to believe that Christian values are intertwined with radical individualism. In my mind, this is why the Republican party has drifted so far off base - its \\"spokesmen\\" are extreme ideologues who are trying to make us (themselves?) believe that a country with little or no central authority is somehow related to conservative Christian values. Since most conservative Christians I have met are fairly dogmatic and rigid in their belief systems, it hardly makes sense they would approve of a society with no controls over \\"deviants\\" - that is, people who think for themseleves. Religions are about social order, not social chaos. I doubt many conservative Christians want anarchy in their churches, but apparently socio-economic anarchy is okay (which is more likely to happen when the federal government is seen as inept in economic and foreign policies). As I said, it is a strange marriage indeed, and one that I think is heading for an ugly divorce."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Why would people like Phil Gramm and Alan Greenspan constantly push push push to remove financial regulations that were put in the place after the Great Depression to prevent financial institutions from destroying our economy? Reading this book is ESSENTIAL to understanding the thought process of those on the right. Remember Alan Greenspan was an acolyte of Ayn Rand -- he recently admitted that his belief system (Ayn's Rand's) doesn't work in front of Congress.Recent events make this book required reading. I think I understand the human condition enough that in a system where the higher the risk, the higher return, people will always maximize risk, no matter how calamitous the results when things go wrong. Why don't some people see that, or if they do see it, discount it? The Great Depression, Long Term Capital Management, S&L; Crisis, Bernie Madoff, Enron, Cox Communications -- we constantly are reminded for the need for smart regulation of the private sector but some are always vehemently against this.In this novel, industrial firms are headed by brave, brilliant entrepreneurs who are very greedy. But, their greed and selfishness is actually good for the country. Interesting that this novel and the saying \\"what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.\\" came out around the same time period. In Ayn Rand's world, it is always better to let private industry do whatever it wishes and the government to stay out, because the government always makes things worse, and private industry and pure unregulated capitalism will always produce better results. No exceptions.Recent events have shown conclusively the failures of her philosophy. Although the mortgage crisis in the United States was certainly exacerbated by some government regulations and institutions, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the CRA (community reinvestment act), which encourages loans to people who may not be able to pay (the original Carter version didn't do that but it was changed during the less risk averse atmosphere with President Clinton), these problems were relatively small in scope and easily manageable. The main cause of the crisis was the hyper-leveraged and UNREGULATED betting by financial institutions on mortgage securities, which causes a 100 billion dollar problem to balloon into a 10 trillion dollar catastrophe. Individuals in these institutions were simply maximizing their profits, because maximum risk means maximum reward -- isn't that what Ayn Rand would want? The government stayed out of the way of these hedge funds and institutions, President Bush's SEC greatly increased the limits on how much financial institutions could leverage, Phil Gramm created an entirely unregulated marketplace for traders, and pretty soon we have so many derivative contracts between financial institutions that their combined value dwarfs the actual real world economy. Like Long Term Capital Management in the 1990s, the results from failure grow so large that without a massive government bailout our entire system grinds to a halt. Privatize the profits, socialize the losses.The second flaw in Ayn Rand's book and philosophy is that her utopian world reduces our country to a Banana Republic. At the top are the brilliant genius businessmen and entrepreneurs who create everything of value and are insanely wealthy. Everyone else is not very valuable and lives in serfdom. In her world you are either a creator and richly rewarded, a working peon, or heaven help you if you are disabled in any way and cannot work -- you'll be turned into soylent green presumably. In Ayn Rand's universe there are no blind people, no one is born with Down's syndrome, there are no drug addicts, paraplegic war veterans, etc. -- Note, I'm not implying these people cannot perform useful work in the real world, or even become brilliant creators, however their disabilities may restrict their ability to do certain jobs and therefore they would have much less value in Ayn Rand's world.I subtracted one star for two things: One, the ridiculous character names she chooses (on purpose I'm sure) to lampoon the buffoonish government characters. Come on, Tinky? It's hard to read it seriously when you're giggling. Second, her TOTAL lack of vision when it comes to the environment: she romanticizes smokestacks in almost a sexual way. When you consider that this book was written in the 1950s, a time when air pollution around industrial sites was very bad, it's a weird point of view. Of course government mandated pollution control goes against her philosophy. I would say, for example, that China, except for the massive corruption, is much closer to Ayn Rand's ideal world than the United States. Industrialists at the top make the most money and are very influential, there is a very large slave class of workers at the bottom, and environmental regulations are either weak or totally ignored. The result: rapid economic growth but also turning a beautiful country into one vast toxic waste dump, with some of the most polluted cities in the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think it's dangerous to underestimate her influence, but that doesn't mean her stuff isn't so calculatedly monotonous as to be almost soothing, and therefore \\"drive home\\" the \\"point,\\" thusly winning more \\"converts\\" -- all of which, however, is more a sign of a fixated consciousness (which she is then \\"imparting\\" to others, re-tooling their psyches) than a formidable attention span (which it would required to write/read \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,\\" or \\"Dhalgren,\\" say).Flannery O'Connor mentioned her ONCE in all her letters (by which I mean: you know, she BOTHERED to mention her once!).

Despite being published in 1957, the economic and philosophical arguments stated in this book are as relevant as ever.I was taken aback by the deep philosophical lessons in the book, including a 60-page monster speech by one of the characters that is a daunting yet enlightening read. However, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" wouldn't be \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" without this heavy focus on philosophy, and is presented extremely well alongside the economic lessons that are the foundation for the storyline. The 1,168-page storyline may be intimidating, but the pages will fly by.In contrast to other entertaining novels you may have read and have promptly forgotten, Atlas Shrugged has important and influential lessons underlying the story that will stay with you for many years.

In this book Ayn Rand has captured many of the truths of our world, many realities about the personalities that inhabit it and many unspoken rules about the way we interact. This book celebrates individual accomplishment and those who change the world through sheer personal will power.In regard to some of the comments I have read - this book is not by any means conservative leaning, especially in today's political environment. It actually attacks both political ideologies of the major political parties here in the United States. If you didn't catch that then you really weren't reading close enough.The book is very wordy and the ending isn't as moving as most of the book is. However, it is a great read for anyone regardless of ideology. Every person who thinks themselves open-minded should read this book. Afterward you will think twice about the laws that we have put in place.Atlas Shrugged is definitely a classic and one of my favorite books, although very wordy.

The opponents are those who think with their hearts, and those who think with their heads. By the time you get about 1/3 of the way through, you find that well-meaning people have deluded themselves and created a monster that is out of control. A central planning group, operating under the assumption that wealth should be distributed solely on the basis of need, is leaching dry the industrialists of the country, who invent, do, employ, and create. Before long the group is comprised of men who say noble things but act very very differently. The industrialists, crushed by the doom of regulation and taxes, start vanishing one-by-one, leaving their factories to whomever will run them.As businesses fail, society starts coming apart, and the central planning group compensates.What's remarkable about this book is that, while it was penned in 1957, it reads like it was written last week.This book is very thought provoking. It is not an easy read so don't expect to blow through it.My only ding is that Ms Rand needed a better editor. Sometimes, she seems to repeat the same ideas over and over.

He talks about this dreaming tree which he thought would never die but then one day it does.This character is truly the one character in the book I could relate too. In any case Im supposed to talk of what I thought of the book. Oh well Im 20 and I think I needed it more than anything else.Im curious , a friend once told me that if he could recommend me any one book , he'd recommend me Atlas Shrugged. He said he feared I would stop reading after a hundred or so pages.I finished the book some few hours back And I feel slightly sick. Not by what the end said but by the fact that it seems to go through a certain chain of predictable \\"unpredictable\\" events. No I wasn't looking for a fun/suspense laced fiction ride.There are things beyond our control in life. Atlas shrugged seeks to talk of things that we wish to act upon but can't because of the emergence of the basic fact that some of us might take RIGHT as right and WRONG as Wrong.It also made me understand myself. Yes myself,it talks of holding one's own verdict above everything else.I think I have lived my life this way and it sorta pushes me on the track of actual action that seems absent in my life thus far.Its not miniscule in its outlook. There are many characters in the book. A favourite of mine is this character called Fransisco. I think the description of his childhood and the relationship that develops between him and Dagny (the center character) was simply one of the most enjoyable things in the book.I was simply amazed by the level of absoluteness used to describe him. Almost flawless in its way of being. A destroyer?Read to know more about him.James Taggart is another one of my favourite characters. So what if he's a villain. He's only human and it seems I understand him because we run into a lot of James Taggarts in life. They might be mute but then they're what they are.As far as influence goes, I think more than influencing me it made me realise how the average human mind works. Its not blasphemy , not entirely but yeah it is quite an eye opener.It made me understand the way a human mind thinks or would like to think.I thought I must be darned to have not figured out certain things myself. I think this book is certainly quite influencing in its own \\"Choose your path\\" wayAnother interesting fact is there's a 14 year gap between Fountainhead and this book. Fountainhead came out before. Did she actually spend 14 years to make this mini-epic? I wouldnt know but I truly admire her thought process.It seems she did indeed run into a few of such characters in her life.The end of the book is something I havent formed a solid opinion on yet so anything I say wouldnt be fair.Its indeed quite unreal in its scope and the absolute creativity and enthusiasm used to describe characters. I might sound a tad too self-contradictory but then its just that I stand beside I everything I just said."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although I am not a fan of Ayn Rand or objectivism, I had to read this book out of curiosity. I must admit that I really enjoyed it. Though I disagree with Rand's opinion that man is the be-all and end-all and that logic and reason are all that is needed to save the world, I do agree with her capitalistic philosophy and thoughts on individual responsibility. The hostility to religion in John Galt's 3 hour radio address towards the end of the book was a disappointment. Some of the speeches in the book were a bit long and dry, but overall I liked it and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Maybe I should begin with the short version of my review: enjoyable story, but I really don't have much to say about the rest of the book. The philosophical portions simply did not engage me.Now, for the rest of the story...Rand's mammoth novel tells a story of hard-working capitalists pitted against communitarians who want equality for all and who produce nothing. The story begins with a railroad COO, an iron manufacturer, an oil producer, and other such business people who have built their own empires. Along the way, each is confronted with a changing political reality--that equality and good of the people are the new premises upon which all economic and societal decisions are based. Thus, railroads are told exactly how many trains they can and cannot run in a given state. Oil companies are told how much oil to produce. Steel companies are forced to turn over the ownership rights of their newest and greatest invention--Reardon Metal. And for hour after hour of reading, we hear about the decline in economic health and the frustrations this decline places on each capitalist character in the story. We also see the greed and corruption that quickly finds its way into governmental oversight organizations that are charged with running the country.In short, this is little more than capitalism versus communism. The novel, in narrative form of course, presents Rand's philosophical and clearly heartfelt criticism of communist (or centralized) societies.And then along comes our hero--John Galt. As is expected of any hero, John saves the day, embarrasses the centralized and corrupt government, and gets the woman. If you want to know how all this happens, you will have to read the book for yourself.I read this book for myself because so many of my students own it. I guess I enjoyed the story but cannot say I find Rand's philosophy to be very engaging. It seems seriously outdated to me. We know that market forces make better use of human invention, free will, and resources than can any centralized government. So a part of me is left asking \\"What is the point?\\" of this book in a modern context. For younger readers who maybe have not lived or thought through such questions yet, then I suspect the book could be quite engaging. Maybe that is why I see this book in the hands of several college students during any given semester.I am glad I bought the audio CD rather than the paperback. Twelve hours was more than enough to spend with this book. If a reader wants a better understanding of how market forces effectively manage and distribute human initiative, I would suggest \\"Against the Dead Hand\\" instead of this book. It is a better read and is based on fact rather than imagination.In the end I can't help but think of college students cheering at the end of a good football or hockey game. It may have been a good game, but the students still find a way to yell \\"overrated!\\" as the other team is about to be upset. That is pretty much how I feel right now. A fun story, but..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The best book i have ever read, i could not put it down. The philiosphical principles that this book and other ayn rand titles go into are excellent, don't think twice about buying this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This fiction work is one of the most important books I have ever read. It is fantastic because although feeling dated (it was written ... well, over 35 years ago) once your mind transitions to the setting (which it will, quite easily, because it is well written) it will just gel. Ignoring for a moment that its central focus is capitalism in a free market economy, or more to the point capitalists in a world descending into communism / socialism, the observation it makes about personalities, classed broadly into producers vs looters, are enlightening and apply to every day life.Using these observations, so much of your every day life will sync up and your resolve and confidence in your self will strengthen because you will do what it takes to find the truth. Assuming you are a producer.So, \\"misunderstood\\", for some reason at the moment with the \\"global economic crisis\\" likes to cite this book. There are obvious reasons because the book is primarily about free market economy driven by greed of capitalists. The problem with using it to explain GEC is this: greedy capitalists are in it to get rich ... extremely rich ... perpetually so. Further, companies in the book are headed by individuals who control the company. The GEC is a result of short term measures that resulted in unsustainable profit but that are required by foolish interpretations of law.Ignoring my own oversimplification, Atlas Shrugged is a form of capitalism apple, that compares to our GEC inducing capitalism orange. To oversimplify some more: greedy capitalists in Atlas Shrugged are not interested in making a quick profit, they are interested in creating a legacy. Their model of business is sustainable in the long term, rather than the law requisite inflation of stock / share prices that we have. Secondly, the GEC is significantly more complicated that Atlas Shrugged's crisis.Alan Greenspan, former head of the reserve bank said that he was wrong, his world view (based on the philosophy of objectivism, which is what Atlas Shrugged is all about) was wrong, which is why the GEC happened, and his explanation in his involvement. Personally, admitting to be wrong is something extremely rare (there are some excellent books on this, \\"Mistakes were made, but not by me\\" comes to mind), and it needs to be respected. But the problem is not that he was wrong, or that Ayn Rand was, rather the application was wrong to our world.So that makes it sound as though this is irrelevant. It is, very. But it isn't a template that can be applied blindly (i'm sure Greenspan did not) but it isn't something that can be used by one to guide a huge economy, it needs to be scaled up. The assumptions are fine, but knowing that 2+2 gives 4 does not mean you understand how to carry the one or do multiplication.Capitalism and free market is good. But it isn't what we have anymore. There is over regulation and as i make this statement i have to be honest in saying this: there are regulations i would keep. But Atlas Shrugged is not a book to fix the world, it is a story to make you think. You draw your own conclusions, and move forward from there.This book is of monumental importance. Everyone should read it once, even if you aren't a producer per se, just so you understand how others may react to you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Exciting story, fascinating characters, suffused with deep philosophical underpinnings if you care to think on them. I've read Atlas three times over the decades. Each time more slowly to savor the story, analogies, and philosophy - and finding new surprises. The story is so rich it remains fresh and exciting. My copy is now filled with marginalia exploring the intriguing ideas.For those interested in the philosophical explorations, Galt's radio speech is icing on the cake. If not, this is easily skipped. It is a jewel which we can refer back to and study at leisure.As literature, this is a great achievement and great read. Philosophically, Rand challenges 2000 years of fallacious philosophy - especially ethics. Harking back to Aristotle, she recognizes reason, rather than emotions, as man's guide to living and happiness.Rephrasing Jefferson, Rand would agree that man is endowed, by his reason, with inalienable rights of live, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.And true, if you care to think deeper on the events of the novel, beyond the mystery and adventure, it will prepare you for understanding our current culture, workings of the economy, and political errors."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's a bit too lenthy, and you might find some of Rand's thoughts hard to swallow if you are a socialist or a hardcore churchgoer, but Atlas Shrugged is one of the finest and most daring stories ever put together.The book is long but not at all dificult to follow like other novels written by philosophers. You cannot possibly miss the themse in Atlas Shrugged b/c Rand beats pounds them into your brain over 1100+ pages. Her philosophy is demonstrated though the characters, who at times go on rambling monologues and leave you screaming for her to get back to the plot, which is magnificent.Atlas Shrugged is divided into three parts and begins as a mystery. It takes place in an ambiguous time in America's future (Atlas Shrugged was written in the 50's), in which America is the only mixed economy left, the rest of the world having succumbed to communism and stagnation. Rand basically divides her characters into good and evil. There's not much in between.The \\"good\\" characters exhibit all the qualities that Rand espouses in her Objectivist philosophy- honesty, diligence, competence, ingenuity. The \\"evil\\" characters are basically government bureaucrats and corrupt officials who mooch off the good characters in the name of fairness, the public good, and equality. The moochers are continuously placing more and more restraints on the good characters, making it more and more difficult for them to operate as industrialists and make money. I won't reveal much more of the plot- you don't find out what is really going on until the last third of the book, but I will say that it is intriguing and completely original. Rand is a great storyteller and she describes human realationships in a way I have never encountered before.Not enough people have read this book. That is for certain. A handful of politicians come to mind who would clearly benefit from reading it because they have a warped sense of how society functions in our country. If you are a capitalist, then read this book because Rand provides an intersting moral backbone to capitalism. If you are a socialist, then read this and see if you can draw parallels to what happens in the novel and what is going on right now in America. This is an excellent piece of literature, and I hope everyone reads it and turns into a libertarian."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I reluctantly picked up this book to read. It was recommened years ago by a friend. This book is amazing. Not in how it is written, nor the story, although I found the setting and plot intriquing. What is the driving force of this novel, is the underlying philosophy, the message behind the story. I don't agree with every example in the book, but I agree, 100%, with the basic message. Everyone, starting in highschool, ought to read this book. It would enrich lives. Heck, it would even save lives. Read this book. Give it some thought. Try not to get bogged down in the details. See the underlying messages regarding values, helping humanity, selfishness vs. selflessness, etc. I'm certain this book frightens and/or angers many people. However, I have faith that the majority are emboldened by Ms. Ryand's philosophy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"you will not like this book. MOST people want to be kept and controlled and coddled and told what to think. If you are one of this unfortunate group, there is honestly nothing here for you.This is a book for individualists who are willing to take responsibility for themselves and for MAKING themselves and their world according to the principles upon which the United States was founded. NOT as the United States currently exists; but as it was founded and intended to be. The founding fathers -- especially Jefferson and Franklin -- would clearly be rather ashamed of how we have perverted their Republic into a Socialist Democracy._Atlas_Shrugged_ was DELIBERATELY written in the Romantic style. Rand DELIBERATELY chose the Romantic style -- making her characters relatively \\"one dimensional\\" -- so there would be NO room to mistake or rationalize or confuse evil and good. Her heros wear the proverbial \\"white hats\\" in this novel and her villians wear black. If you want proof that Rand was fully capable of writing a book with more \\"realistic\\" (that is, conflicted and \\"sympathetic\\") characters, and that she deliberately chose her style, read her first novel, \\"We the Living\\".I think she made the right stylistic choice -- the large number of people who attack her message because of her characterizations in this book, is something to ponder. Evil really roils at being exposed to light. In my opinion, we excuse way too much evil in this world on the grounds that evil-doers are \\"misunderstood\\" or simply the products of bad parents or good intentions gone awry. You may not be entirely responsible for where you are, but you ARE responsible for staying there.This is a life-changing book for those who are open to change. Depending on your inner nature you will likely either love it or turn from it with revulsion and bitterness.For those who mistake Rand's exhaultation of TRUE capitalists with fascist industrialists, I suggest you ponder \\"Who is John Galt?\\" John Galt -- the greatest \\"hero\\" in the book by far -- was NOT a \\"great industrialist\\" but, rather, an entrepreneur/creator/philosopher who found himself interrupted while on the path of his creation. I doubt Rand would have much adoration for Bill Gates and other erstaz \\"capitalists\\" who choose to \\"suck up\\" to the system -- to use the system and work the State -- in order to gain money by any means available. In the book, most of her \\"black hats\\" are reserved for such \\"pragmatic\\" folk.What else is there to say? All I can suggest is: Look. See. Tell the truth. Take authentic action. Maybe move to New Hampshire."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a book you will either love or hate. Very few people have middle of the road feelings about Atlas. Personally I loved this book. It has always ranked in my list of 5 books I positivly HAVE to own at all times. Read it and decide for yourself.

It starts off with the magical question, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot; That is probably the greatest catch phrase I have ever seen in a book. I was hooked from the start.A political attack on Socialism, the book shows how the Capitalist society and the rewards for doing &quot;actual work&quot; by the individual works every time.The book shows how society is always trying to stifle creativity and how the have nots always want what the haves already got without having to do any work.A must read for any political science student."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you judge a book by it's cover, you may find yourself cringing at the thought of diving into \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Resist the urge to put off reading it!!!I read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" surprisingly quickly for the simple reason that I could not put it down. I found myself identifying with the characters and pulling for their success and being drawn along throughout the story. It is very appropriate that Ayn Rand wrote this during the Cold War a conflict between the ideologies of productive individuism and redistributionism, between two societies -- the West and its value of the individual and rewards for acheivement, and the Soviet Bloc and its emphasis on the masses.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has the capacity to think critcally and analytically. I periodically lend \\"A.S.\\" to my liberal friends. I usually find that they defend their posistions with less gusto than before they read it. I only wish that I'd read this book when I was in high school."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My greatest regret is that I will never be able to wake up again and read Atlas Shrugged for the first time.... Most books are read and forgotten. We leave their meaning in some dark nebulous corner of our minds. Atlas Shrugged, however, is magnificent for its ability to shape our lives. If you give it a chance, one way or another it will have a profound effect on you. This book has been so influential that it has spawned political parties, think tanks, and campus organizations that are committed to adhering to the ideals that are set forth within Atlas Shrugged's pages. Do not be daunted by its size. If you approach this book diligently you will have little trouble finishing it. And what is more likely, if you give yourself a chance to really get a few hundred pages into the book you'll probably end up finishing it just because you won't allow yourself to do otherwise."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand wrote one heavy novel here. It was not the sort of piece of literature that you skim through. If you skim, you will miss so much of what she is saying.Basically, she simplifies people a tad, since few are as black-and-white as the characters. That's fine. Her message is complex enough, yet so simple once you understand, that to throw in a fully 3 dimensional character would confuse most readers.She used this fictional story to illustrate her philosophy. Basically, Socialism robs from the productive to take care of the non-productive, rewarding the latter and punishing the former. Her good guys are productive engineers, industrialists, etc..people who excel in their fields through sheer competence. Her antagonists are those who ride the coattails of the competent and suck them dry like ticks.It is a layered story with a lot that the close minded can miss. If you have an open mind, you may not agree, but you'll at least understand those who do agree with her philosophy....To sum up the book, when the individual is allowed to flourish, unhindered by government or others, he can build and create--providing work and opportunity for others who wish to work hard and be treated fairly.When the individual is hindered, the ramifications are disasterous (see the California power problems as an example).Thank you Ayn Rand, where ever your soul resides..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is very small.

Taken as prose, it's a terrible book - the story is a thinly veiled (and utterly ludicrous) excuse for Rand to natter on and on, her philosophical musings overtaking the plot for tens of pages at a time, until she remembers with a lurch that it's intended to be a work of fiction. The \\"philosophical musings\\" are essentially a direct refutation of the philosophy of Jesus Christ. Instead of \\"do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\\" Rand's essential philosophy is \\"whatever you want to do is right\\" (this is also called \\"egoism\\" or \\"ethical egoism\\").Worth a read (if you have the stomach for it) if you want to find out what our society's moral refuse use as justification for their actions, otherwise I'd stay as far away as possible."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's tirade against society and almost drooling adoration of greed, selfishness and arrogance is one of those, at first glance, inexplicably popular books. However after a moment of contemplation the truth appears without much difficulty. It appeals to bullied maths students and engineers and to those who feel, often correctly, that they have no say in their lives. It's certainly geek revenge porn with a hefty dose of visceral hatred thrown in. I would, in fact, argue that it shows that Rand was a sociopath - without a hint of compassion or any strong human skills. Her heroes, especially Galt but not limited to him, are held up as idols, when in any other context they'd been seen as the worst kind of tyrants, dictators all in the making. Indeed Galt would probably be suited to trial for crimes against humanity. It's certainly appallingly written as fiction; endless monologues and character development limited to the most absurd two-dimensionality.I can see why certain elements of the 14-20 year bracket could easily be swayed by it, but for those of us who actually live on Earth, it's best avoided. Much like any other extremist bile really."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Never should anyone pay a 50% penalty for reading on a digital device.

If you found any sort of philosophical merit or intellectual stimulation here, you're probably the exact type of faux-intellectual that enjoys Ulysses.Let me tell you what this book is now:It's pretty much a weird self-insertion fantasy wherein Rand has her self insertion character do light S&M; with MASTERS OF INDUSTRY with a light sci-fi slant. That she had the gall to call the philosophy the book espouses \\"objectivisim\\" when it's nothing of the sort makes me want to tear my face off and send her heirs the little pieces with a little post-it that says \\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE\\".I jest. I wouldn't actually do that unless I was off my meds.She pretty much just talks about how much better off everybody would be if businesses would run everything over and over. Truly it's staggering how she manages the rephrase the exact same thought sometimes twice in the same page. People have conversations with other friends about how good an open market is, then those friends have yet more conversations about the exact same thing, John Galt has a 100 page monologue that repeats everything the book has talked about to that point in the most boring way possible, the protagonist bones everybody because she's super modern or whatever.There's no literary merit here. The stuff she talks about is stuff anybody with any sort of critical thinking skills could tear down in five minutes. It's a Bad Book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading this book I understand why right wing loons like Rand Paul love it so much. In Ayn Rands fictional narrative there are only hard working industrialists and lazy parasites who attempt to cripple the noble efforts of the working capitalists. It's a libertarians wet dream. A magical place where all of their deluded pet theories actually work. In the universe Rand has created there are no people dying of cancer from having ingested water polluted with industrial waste such as cadmium and mercury. There are no thalidomide babies or stupid, greedy investors or bankers causing market crashes. Oh and greedy energy companies who ignore safety recommendations from consultants and cause enormous oil spills? Nowhere to be found in Rands world. All of the complex problems that must be dealt with in a modern civilization are nonexistant in Ayn Rand make believe.

So far it seems to be an allegory against Socialism and the need to make the poor work for themselves. The overwhelming message in the book is \\"greed is good\\" and \\"profits above all\\". It describes a world where the most profitable and most innovative corporations are brought to ruin through a system that requires that all \\"make according to their ability, but receive according to their need.\\"This concept rewards failing companies with government grants, makes the profitable companies pay penalties and share their patents \\"for the common good\\". There is also the same kind of government corruption that is prevalent today where the rich are rewarded with laws in their favor and the unconnected get taken advantage of.The part of the message that is lost in the anti socialist agenda of the book is the corruption being perpetrated by the rich that is as bad as the ownership of congress that we face today. Those with the most money always win.Greed and profit may sometimes be good, but not when there is not a level playing field for the rich and poor alike. All need to contribute according to their ability and reap their own rewards. The most vulnerable don't have the money to buy their congress members so they don't get any of the benefits.My major issue with the book is the overly verbose writing style of Ms. Rand. I find that every soliloquy runs on for far too many pages and repeats the point of the rant like \\"beating a dead horse.\\" I find myself skipping much of the repetitious speeches and moving on. I prefer authors that get to their point succinctly.I would not recommend the book unless you are a die hard Libertarian or Ultra Conservative that wants to cheer the books message.

To tax and regulate our products, ideas, and thinking contributes to the mindset that governments can do a better job of producing in our society.

The more the government interferes in the economy, the more things fall apart and more men of the mind begin their strike.Edward Herrmann does perhaps the best job of reading a book that I've ever heard.

This is repeated in \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" but with added elements of mystery.Here's the story in a nutshell:Every industrialist who's productive is slowly disappearing without explanation. This leads the government to declare all sorts of laws tying people to their jobs. It chronicles what happens when useful people go on strike. Thrown into it we have numerous subplots, stock characters, and the query \\"Who is John Galt?\\" is repeated ad nauseum.So why does this book make me laugh aloud every time I read it? Because Rand takes this \\"philosophy\\" entirely too seriously. It is funny to slog through 10 pages of a \\"worthless\\" playboy extolling the virtues of money AT A DINNER PARTY. Who does this?(Word to the wise: skip Galt's 80-page preachathon radio announcement. It's under the heading \\"This is John Galt Speaking.\\") It's great that Rand has so little respect for her reader's intellect that she creates transparently archetypal characters and stuffs their mouths full of unbelievably preachy and sanctimonious dialogue.There are certain good points to her way of thinking. I agree that people should have jobs based on their competence, not their \\"need\\" for a job, and I too love and appreciate individuality. Most businesses already follow this pattern of hiring based on ability. When was the last time you were hired to do a job because you \\"needed\\" one?

I actually had to stop for two weeks because it bummed me out with its simplistic disjunct logic. But, not wanting to be a looter I plodded on hoping it would reach a point, a reason it is presented as a defense of capitalism.

I Think it came before the estimated ship time and was in perfect condition.This review is really about the quality of material contained inside the covers of Atlas Shrugged.

This book has literally changed the lens with which I view society2. Yes, it is like 1100 pages; don't be scared; when you finish you will wish it would have been twice as long3. The attention to detail for small things like facial expressions, thought processes, etc is reminiscent of John Updike; at times it feels like a little much, but when you look back, it is what really makes the story unique4.

I had been meaning to read the novel since 2008, and finally decided to make the commitment to read it. For accessibility's sake, I downloaded it to my Kindle. I just love my Kindle's portability.I must say, the book had me hooked at the beginning! It was very engaging and pardon the cliche, thought provoking.It is not necessarily an easy read for most people. If you are craving a thrill packed adventure as the type of which movies with the flavor of the month actors are starring, this is not your book. If you are wanting a book that will challenge your political, economical, and ethical views, this is the book for you.The first two thirds of the book were my favorite. Rand weaves an excellent mystery surrounding the enigmatic John Galt.The last third of the book lost a little something for me, particularly with John Galt's manifesto.Not wanting to spoil the book for those of you who have not read the book, I won't reveal the answer to the question, \\"Who is John Galt?\\"Speaking in general terms, Galt as a character represents Rand's philosophy on many subjects, economics, government, and religion.On the subject of government and economics, I am quite the admirer of Rand. On the topic of the existence of God, Rand having been an atheist, I must simply agree to disagree with her. I can't rely on man being the final arbiter of right and wrong. I hold to the adage that absolute power corrupts absolutely, letting history provide evidence for that statement. Rand held the Constitution in high regard, but not agreeing with the Creator endowed rights of the document. She believed in the rights, but not the Creator. If man be the highest authority, then when man changes his mind that the Constitution is no longer relevant, then to whom is man accountable? In my estimation, man must look to a power higher than himself to have a solid foundation for morals and ethics. The framers of the Constitution obviously thought the same.To Rand, man is inherently good. In my lifetime, brief though it has been to this point, history and modern times has shown me too much evidence to the contrary.I look at and admire Rand, to some degree, as she looked at Aristotle, \\"I most emphatically disagree with a great many parts of his philosophy-but his definition of the laws and logic and of the means of human knowledge is so great an achievement that his errors are irrelevant by comparison\\".Atlas Shrugged, for being half a century old, is prophetic on many levels. So many of the characters I could almost identify in the current news today. It is a timeless tale on the importance of the individual and the dangers of collectivism. A tale of mystery and reality. A solid defense of Capitalism, and a solid rebuke of Socialism. If you want to understand Capitalism and Socialism and why the philosophies are at enmity with one another, this book explains it.I once heard a man say that two books changed his life, one being the Bible, the other being Atlas Shrugged. I now understand fully his statement and find myself in agreement."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a great book. I have the paperback as well as the kindle edition. This should be mandatory reading in the US. It is amazing how it parallels what is going on in the world today. Who knew that there was so much corruption in the government and unions that even then Ayn Rand saw the writing on the walls. This hits so close to home, specifically since we are small business owners. How the employees come first and it should be the business owner who suffers....at the hands of fairness and equalization of wealth...It is amazing that the government acts as if our tax dollars are theirs not ours and they can spend freely with it and never have to budget, just raise taxes when another \\"need\\" arises. Make promises for life to unions that cannot be upheld and then the taxpayer is on the hook again."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have had this on my kindle for a while now - and I was amazed. First - the format on the kindle works well, whoever did the transcription to e-format did an excellent job, and includes all the authors notes, etc. All in all, it was an excellent transcription.Now, as to the book... People usually have one of two reactions to Rand's writings - they either think its brilliance, or they think it's awful. Strangely, those people follow one of the 2 different beliefs found in the book. Yes, it's a long book... but, if you get over that it was written in the late 1950's, and look at it through those eyes (not of a early 21st centruy - for example, the emphasis on train travel is much as it was then, not now!) it brings a realism and engagement into Rand's Taggartian/Thompsonian alternate reality, regardless of which side of the tracks you are on. For someone who somehow missed out on reading it when I was young (it was required reading for a lot of high school literature or poli-sci classes for the kids of the 70's and early 80's) it really surprised me how much the book affected me.I laugh about the comment a friend of mine - a very left wing liberal with marxist ideals - made when I told him about my reading this book (most of it unprintable here!)... remember, Ayn Rand was the right wing darling of both the Reagan set and the Tea Partyists... but to him, I replied... for it is indeed a work of fiction, perhaps well written fiction, certainly, for me, engaging and thought provoking (and somewhat thought-schanging) fiction... to his disdain that I would, indeed, read this piec of classic American literatire... a book that, to me, would have been worth twice what I paid for it...\\"Who is John Galt?\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I find it an absolute \\"must read\\" item for all people interested in politics, social science, culture and modern problems.

Suffice to say, I enjoyed the book thoroughly but it is simply too long (the 12th longest book in the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets, according to Wikipedia).I wanted to give this 4.5 out of 5, but couldn't quite bring myself to round up."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Every few years I pull out Atlas Shrugged and read it again. Amid an intensely structured writing style with detailed characterizations that would make Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton blush (\\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"), there are economic, social and political descriptions that seem to mirror our times.These comparisons include a world where popular leaders are less concerned about the correctness of the ideas they advocate, but more concerned about the number of followers they can attract. A world where some highly publicized and popular ideas, if taken to their logical conclusion, would result in the eradication of mankind from this planet. And finally, a world where rhetoric counts for more than logic.Ayn Rand attempted to identify the root causes of these behaviors and propose a solution in an epic end-of-the-world story. To summarize, in some future or parallel world, everything is grinding to a halt. The primary producers are dropping out and disappearing. They are being replaced by people who are both humanistic and opportunistic, but not very knowledgeable. As a result, industry continues to collapse. Eventually the government steps in and in a series of directives are issued: each more severe and more socialistic. But each directive worsens the situation, until a dictator-like status is reached.Amid this crisis, the book primarily traces the activities of two individuals: Dagny Taggart, in charge of the operations of the last Transcontinental Railroad, and Hank Rearden, the last of the steel barons. Both characters are very intelligent, responsible, and highly productive. Other important characters move in and out of the narrative: the good, the bad, and the indifferent, but Taggart and Rearden are used to discover the root causes of the world-wide collapse.Near the novel's end, when the causes (according to Rand) are rooted out by both Taggart and Rearden, there is a long speech (Part 3, Chapter 7: \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\") that sums up Ayn Rand's philosophy. It is the notorious 50 page speech, which most people either skip or browse rapidly. Unless one is reading Atlas Shrugged simply for entertainment, I recommend that you take the time to carefully read the \\"speech.\\" There are a number of issues (especially her very anti-religious stance) that are spelled out and justified in that speech, but hardly touched in the book.I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the significant root causes of this double-minded world, but her solution (taken to the extreme that she advocates) is seriously flawed. For Rand, the problem can be distilled down to the fight between the romantic/emotional side and the rational/logic side. The descent into political, social, and economic madness has occurred because logic has been discredited by the elite, and decisions are made solely on how they appeal to our emotions.For Ayn Rand, the mind and the rational process take precedence. Her sense of morality is linked to the ability to produce. Religion, as is, is to be discarded, because it ultimately depends on a non-rational activity (the religious experience). So she believes that any morality based on a non-rational activity cannot be the basis of a moral code. However, Rand's use of religious terminology and illusions are scattered throughout this work. One cannot help but make comparisons to the \\"End of the World\\" and the \\"Second Coming\\" (of Christ or the Capitalist?) along with the \\"Sign of the Dollar\\" as opposed to the \\"Sign of the Cross.\\"As far as I am aware, no one has successfully described how to balance the emotional with the rational, and Rand does not even try. Rand's solution is that the emotional must be completely subjugated to the rational. Rand would redefine all emotional things, including Love, Hate, Respect, etc, in strictly rational terms.At this time in our history, when rhetoric is replacing rational thinking, especially in the political realm, it is obvious that we too need to rebalance the rational (a terrible shock to most Political Romantics), otherwise we too will face a collapsing world. But rejecting the emotional or trying to redefine the emotional in strictly logical terms is absurd. It denies our humanity and our history.I question Rand's attempt to define a purely rational moral code based solely on the ability to produce for several reasons. The first objection, I admit (ironically), is solely (and ironically) a matter of one's taste: the image of Dagny Taggart as a willing sex-slave to the highest producer (not based on love, because that is irrational). That's right, abolish love or redefine it so that it fits a rational definition. Rand's attempt to do exactly that is probably the most warped thing she proposes in this book.My second objection is purely practical: an atheist morality has one significant flaw, even Bertrand Russell acknowledged that weakness: Pride. The ability to compete, no holds bared, without having to acknowledge any higher power would lead to a dog-eat-dog environment that would be Hell on earth for the majority of mankind.I realize that Rand believed that (socially-evolutionary-speaking) that the dog-eat-dog world would eventually destroy itself and finally result (and then a miracle occurs) in a harmonious capitalistic society. Unfortunately, US History does not support her. We have a long dog-eat-dog history of capitalism in 19th Century United States and it was not pretty nor was it getting better until governmental regulation stepped in and laws protecting the laborer were passed.My third objection is historic: for every Ford (who paid his staff above Union wage and implemented work safety processes) there were several dozen Andrew Carnegies, John D. Rockefellers, and J.P. Morgans (who abused their workers, stole others' ideas, and manipulated stock prices to increase their own income). Rand would protect all the above, although I suspect that Ford was closer to her model of Rearden then the other Capitalists.Despite my objections, I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the imbalance between the rational and emotional as the underlying cause for the inability to produce or to solve significant political, social or economical problems. While she argues that the logical conclusion of the pure romantic (one who rejects all rationality) is nullity, I believe that the logical conclusion of the pure rationalist (one who rejects all emotion) is tyranny because co-operation among any competitors will break down once the means to bypass or control another is found.While Rand would like to believe that competing capitalists can cooperate, history has shown us a very different picture. After all, Capitalists, whether she wants to admit it or not, are only human and that means they do not suppress their emotions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"LIKE THE BOOK,EVEN THOUGH IT IS MUCH TOO WORDY AND REPETITIOUS.

TRUTH. Plain and simple."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is built upon an interesting concept and has the beginnings of a good novel. However, Rand's writing gets in the way. The characters are mostly one-dimensional. The heroes are all attractive, competent at everything, well-spoken, and really have no weaknesses of which to speak. The villains, on the other hand, are petty, incompetent sociopaths with no redeeming features. The dialogue is peppered with Rand's philosophy; that this should occur is not surprising given the philosophical intentions of the novel, but Rand does it to excess. The heroes speak like philosophers, all with the same speech patterns. The main hero, John Galt, is essentially Rand's view of the perfect man, free of all the doubts, vices, and character flaws that afflict the rest of humanity. At the end, he uses his insight into the truth to deliver a fifty page speech. As a work of literature, Atlas Shrugged is lacking. This is unfortunate, since with the help of a good editor it could have become quite a compelling novel.So much for its literary merits. As a work of philosophy, it promotes an objective approach to everything, sidelining emotion. Rand was fiercely against collectivism. The virtues of a free market and minimal government coercion get expounded here. The philosophy behind Atlas Shrugged is interesting and worth a look, but could have easily been condensed into a shorter form. My major criticism of her philosophy is, oddly enough, shared by communist philosophy she so despised--an utter disregard for human nature. Rand ignores the human factor, and for this reason her philosophy is impractical. Still, it's something that one should check out at least one in one's life.I would advise readers new to Rand's philosophy to opt for her previous work, The Fountainhead, instead. It covers many of the same philosophical points as Atlas Shrugged, albeit in less detail. However, it is much easier to read and works far better as a novel. I would recommend Atlas Shrugged primarily to readers who have read The Fountainhead and desire a more thorough treatment of Rand's philosophy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If the measure of the greatness of a novel is the broadness of the scope of its theme, the complexity of its plot and its relevance to the world in its ability to integrate the plot into the nature of human existence as it could be and ought to be, combined with an unmatched ability at characterization and the ability to tell an unforgettable story in a style extraordinarily unique in literature, then this is the greatest novel ever written.It's a presentation in novel form of the greatest philosophy ever discovered, the completion and amendation of the work of the world's greatest and most influential philosopher, Aristotle."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are those who produce the wealth, those who create value, those who make and act and do. Then, there are those who take, loot; those who are parasites and leave it to others to care for them, provide for them, share their wealth with them. That's the basis of this wonderful 52-year-old novel by the Grand Dame of the Libertarian movement (though she would not admit to being libertarian.)The novel has been criticized for being poorly written. If you judge it by novels written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna Ferber or Sinclare Lewis, it is quite different. But those writers were American from the start. Rand was a Russian. She didn't understand the American style of writing fiction. She was a formal writer. It sounds artificial to the American ear. But, let's face it, the American ear is accustomed to 6th grade writing. As an advertising writer, I write to that grade level because that's where most people, if they read at all, read.What happens when the producers, who are criticized and used, taxed and abused, who are despised, stop working? You'll see when you read this book --- and it's not pretty. You'll meet exciting characters -- leading business men and women. You'll meet people who make things run. If you think producers are treated well by society, you're wrong. See, here's the thing: Ayn Rand got it right long ago. She seemed to foresee what would happen -- what's happening now. She saw a beautiful capitalistic society on a hill taken over and ruined by socialism. The looters, the government, the welfare recipients --- they live off the work, the minds, of the producers. That's what's happening today. We must \\"share the wealth\\" is the popular phrase in Washington today.So, Rand had her producers go on strike. Quite. Blow up their factories. Spend all their money. Leave. Today this is called \\"Going Galt.\\" (John Galt from the book.)Just as many producers today are leaving New York because of high taxes on the rich and some others moving to Australia to get away from socialism, Rand's characters just quit. And, as a consequence, the looters, the non-producers, hurt. They lost their only hope of survival. They lost their meal ticket.You may not like the writing. You may find Rand dogmatic. You may find Objectivism a cruel philosophy. But this is one of the greatest books ever written. And the philosophy is a lovely, honest belief system to those who love liberty, who produce the goods and services that others enjoy and from which others profit.Today, as our beloved capitalism is slipping away and we slip into ugly socialism (if we allow it), this book is perhaps the most relevant reading we can undertake. I suggest if you care about liberty, you read it now.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I got this book because Neal Boortz keeps talking about it.

More than 1K pages were keeping me away of it! But from the moment I read the first 2 pages, I knew that this was going to be an amazing, thought-provoking book. And I was right.Ayn Rand found an incredible way of exposing her philosophy in an exhilarating novel that is not easy to put down.Basically, it is a sort of Capitalism Gospel, that describes the social and moral transformation of a country when its government begins to interfere with the natural course of the economy.Being a Latin-American, where intellectual circles are highly influenced by the so-called 'progressive' views, it is very shocking to read a book that preaches the virtuosity of egoism (sometimes being a little naive, in my opinion). However, I couldn't avoid feeling that my own country (Argentina in this case but could be Venezuela, Mexico or any other) was being described as the story progressed.To sum up, a highly recommendable reading.

This book is a great story about government destruction of business, a country, & the world economy & the complicity of many (worthless) businesses & businessmen who have power in it all.

(But I don't take such a hard view of charity as she does, except charity that creates dependence rather than encouraging individual responsibility and work). All the while it's a great philosophical statement. I almost completely admire Rand's stance, but I feel it's too bad she seems to have a distorted view of Christianity. For instance, work was given to man before the fall, not as a result of the fall (that just brought sweat & thorns) as she feels. :-) Her use of sex is possibly unnecessary, but it's fairly realistic, not graphic & serves to make a certain point - though crudely."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is not for everyone.

What was scary to me was that despite this book being written many years ago, I could still see many of the same ideas Ayn Rand discussed existing today.

And this is a great tale: part mystery, part detective story, part love story, a bit of science fiction, and even - although she was not renowned for this - a lurking sense of sardonic humour in the background.I have encountered a lot of the usual, sneering criticisms from the left and right that her characters lacked \\"realism\\" - which misses entirely Rand's idea of what art is about, and I generally reject those attacks. That said, if there is a flaw in the book, it is the character, or rather the lack, of character in John Galt. He is a cardboard cut-out, although an interesting one. Some of the dialogue is stilted, and I struggled, manfully, through the enormous and over-long Galt speech at the end. By contrast, Hank Rearden, the steelmaker, and Francisco D'Ancona, are wonderful creations. The latter is my favourite.The sheer, moral grandeur of this novel, of its message, of its importance to our culture and present predicament, should not be underestimated. I am delighted this book is getting more attention - mostly positive - than ever before. One can see this in the \\"Tea Party\\" protests in the US over the enormous bailouts under Bush/Obama.May the late Ms Rand continue to inspire true liberals everywhere."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's masterpiece, Atlus Shrugged, is one of the most influential and controversial books I have read yet. It may be said that all it is about is greed and selfishness, but that's not what it is about. Atlus Shrugged is about the struggle between the movers, the creators, the inventors, the people that get the job done right because they would be ashamed to do it any other way and the leeches, the conformists, the &quot;Let's do it all the same so that there is no competition and so that everyone gets their fair share&quot; people. Ayn Rand shows what the world would be like without the people that make things work. She shows us what happens when all competition and intuitiveness is done away with. Things stop. Railroads grind to a halt, factories break down, the &quot;world&quot; stops moving. Without competition, no one strives to do better. Without intuitiveness, no one sees problems coming and can't handle them when they happen. Rand shows us why we need people with vision, and what happens when either society gets rid of the creators or someone takes them away before the creators can be destroyed"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I sent 2 copies to my daughter and her friend.

The ideas advocated in a fictional novel should not be the ultimate measure of its greatness.

One can try to dipute her philosophy, but the more one lives life in reality, he realizes that she was right about nearly every thing she says. Great book, should be mandatory for all high-school English classes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This novel is imprtant. Important if you accept much of Miss. Rand's Objectivism, more important if you don't. If you do support Objectivism this book provides great insight as to how it would work in actual practice. If you don't than with luck it will convince you, if not you will at least have gained a truer understanding of it than you would by the misrepresentations it is given by oponents.Many People seem to understand only half this book. For example I see comments on &quot;selfishness good?&quot; I say yes, but you must understand selfishness. Selfishness isn't the cry of &quot;mine&quot; from a small child when told to hand over a toy that belongs to someone else. Selfishism is being primarily concerned with your own happiness. If all people worked form this perspective altruism would not only be unnecessary(as it allready is) but seem unthinkable. For example, my happiness is predicated on many things. It does not make me happy to see a man hurt due to factors outside his control, so I try to help. This includes such activites as helping organizations that help AIDS sufferers. Why do I do this? Not out of some fuzzy spirit of altruism, but because it gives me pleasure to help people who want to be alive, and be productive. I do NOT help with Habitat for Humanity, an orginization that seeks to give unearned property to people. It does not make me happy to help those attain what I have, without having to produce for it. Many people seem to think this means venerating a man who owns a business while hating those who work for him. Not so. If a man works his hardest and produces, as a sweeper, an industrialist, a business owner, a novelist, or anything he is a good moral man nad to be admired. The man who takes welfare and refuses a job at McDonalds becaus ehe feels it, beneath him, he is to be despised, not pitied, but despised. I am not a wealthy industrialist. I have a small theatrical production company. Does it support me? No, but I don't take pride in being a starving artist, I work. I work for money forty hours a week, and I work to make my company a sucess. A friend asked if I wanted to form a non-profit theatre company. NO some day my company will be sucessfull and I will make money from it. How do I know this, because I want it, and I will work for it. That's all we need to know. Who is John Galt? In a perfect society we all would be."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There are many reviews on this book, 611 at this point and probably growing. There are also many different versions of reviews that range in scope, from the strickly literary view, to the strickly philosophic view. While reading this book, you must take into account Rand's one and only purpose, to present a clear and unmistaken account OF WHY she has developed her philosophy.The &quot;OF WHY&quot; part is most important. Here is why.The &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; story is not a picture of realistic life as we know it. Our world only contains bits and pieces of the book.(So you know, Rand was a child around the introduction of Communism in Russia. She faced this reality first-hand. So her world may very well have been close to what can be found in the book)Having said this, I will make the following comments. Her book is a plot device to convey the points of her philosophy. The book has short-comings as do all pieces of litature. Her characters are archtypical and completely one-dimensional.The plot and characters are like many of the classic literature pieces, not reflective of real-life or at least people we know today. They(the characters) only serve to create the shape of her ideas. That is all. The protagonist characters (specifically Galt)only represent the ideals of her philosophy while the other characters represent the ideals of the socialist.Instead, Rand is trying to convey the point of looking for pieces of her characters in the enviroment you can relate too today.NO, Rand is not from academia and I'm sure you'll find many people making comments on construction of her philosophy. This is my opinion(as is all reviews) but I believe that Rand, like all FOUNDERS of philosophy, not people who study philosophy, wrote their beliefs in accordance to what they saw in their enviroment.Anyways, I believe if you read this book with this in mind, you will get the point she is trying to make, regardless if you agree with her or not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I rate this book as 10 stars!

It is one of the most devastating critiques ever written of big government and the liberal media. Rand's moral indignation is contagious; after reading her, most readers are forever immune to the enticements of socialism.It must also be said, however, that the militantly atheistic Rand had an unrealistic view of human nature and little appreciation for cultural values. Most people, however mesmerized by her they may be in their youth, outgrow Rand's philosophy, which Burke might have described as a theoretical construct rather than an application of the accumulated wisdom of mankind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Who is John Galt? A universal question. Who is this man that threatened to stop the &quot;motor of the world?&quot;Is capitalism &quot;evil?&quot; Is the desire to build a better mousetrap, and prove it, so bad? Is subservience, masquerading under the pseudonym of alturism, so noble?See for yourself, and make your own judgement.For me, as I read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, I found myself able to only read a few chapters at a time, having to put the book down, in anger at the situations presented in the book, and recognizing that all of us, whether we dare to admit it or not, believe that recognition should be earned, via our efforts, and not just platitudes to satisfy the masses.If only to stir the emotions of a true individualist, this should be must reading for anyone who is not satisfied with the status quo, but truly seeks a better world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"To state things &quot;objectively&quot; at the outset, I feel a rating should not be based on how much the reviwer agrees with the philosophy of the author; it should be based on its readability and the extent to which it provokes thoughts in the mind of the reader. And this book is extremely thought-provoking, especially to someone who has not read Rand's works before and is not familiar with her philosophy. At the same time, someone who is not in complete agreement with her viewpoint can get extremely frustrated (as happened with me) over her simplistic assumptions of life and people (especially painting people in black-and-white; the characters either completely follow her moral code or are in complete opposition to it; it follows that the negative characters are seldom able to make coherent and rational statements in response to the protagonists, which, in spite of all Rand says, CAN be made.).I must admit that I was disappointed with this book, having read Fountainhead earlier (which I consider to be one of the best books I have ever read, even though I am not in complete agreement with what she says). As so many other reviewers have stated, her stubbornness in not letting the book be edited makes reading extremely ponderous. This is especially true of the later stages of the book, where all pretensions of telling a story are abandoned to promote objectivism, her philosophy. The characters tend to sermonize (and they are pretty long sermons, too, the longest one being 60 pages of John Galt's speech) at the slightest excuse, and these sermons are extremely repetitive in content; the characters seem to forget that they have had those same thoughts about a person and have made the same enlightened remarks about that person a few chapters before. That is the only reason why I take away one star from the rating.Moral of the story: Ponderous though it may be, the book is a must read to get a different perspective of life.Caution: Consider her philosophy carefully, but take it with more than a pinch of salt. Spend some time thinking about it and considering how it applies to your world, rather than converting to it 100%."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Let me start off by stating that this is a book worth reading. In it, Ayn Rand propounds her philosophy of Objectivism (politically similar to Libertarianism) which, as she states, has the following core principles:\\"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\"--Ayn RandThere's not much to fault in those principles; and, it's easy to envision the benefit that could accrue from espousing them. Even the story itself has appeal: it takes place within an extremely socialistic society whose economy is foundering because all of its great industrialists are disappearing.My problem with the book, and what made it, at times, almost torture to get through, is that the action of the story happens between a seemingly interminable series of long repetitive speeches expounding Rand's philosophy. For example, toward the end of the book, a character gives an uninterrupted speech of almost 70 pages; and, even more exasperating than the sheer length of the speech is the fact that it's essentially just a reiteration of points made earlier in the book by other characters -- and earlier in the speech by the character himself. This book would've been made considerably better if several hundred pages of tedious pontifications had been culled from it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The ideas and questions I found myself pondering after putting it down have never really left my mind. To me this is a book of ideas that really gets your brain working. It's not a light read to take into the bathroom or bed. The central point is what would happen to the world if the thinkers, inventors and business men and women went on strike, simply refused to keep doing their work. Everything would be fine, right? The world survives on the back of the common man, after all...doesn't it? The reader is also introduced to Rand's philosophy as her characters ponder the moral ambiguity in the world that surrounds them. Rand's musing on issues of ethics seems very pertinent to the times we live in, given the current age of moral equivalence=political correctness. If you are looking for something stimulating, surprising and with lasting power, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Wow! There's a considerably divisive element permeating the reviews for this book. People either think it's a laughably bad philosophy novel (which I can understand, to an extent) or an indelible story of the inevitable triumph of the human spirit through Ayn Rand's Objectivism philosophy. A lot of the reviews here seem to eschew examining the content of the book itself, and direct their comments towards the philosophy. I will not do this. I guess this is unavoidable, as the book faces the reader with several radical philosophical and political viewpoints that are bound to offend some people. But I'm going to do my best to keep my own ideas out of this. Whether or not I believe in Ayn Rand's philosophy is immaterial; I'm just hear to review the book under the parameters established for what it is - a novel.Atlas Shrugged takes place sometime in the future (the exact year is unimportant) where most of the world's nations have adopted socialist political standpoints, with America standing as the last capitalist-oriented nation. However, as the book progresses, even America's economy is threatened, because the leading innovators and industrialists are disappearing. In fact, they are going on strike...a slightly fantastic premise, but crucial for the author to express her outlook on the world.Even barring that fantastic element, the entire book is mostly unrealistic. Her characters are strictly black and white, either good (according to Rand's view) or evil (again, in Rand's view). Many people seem to regard this as one of the book's most consequential drawbacks. However, I actually see it as one of the book's greatest merits. Rand's characters aren't \`characters' in the traditional sense; rather, they are symbols representing the gamut of elements in Rand's philosophy. For example, as a person Richard Halley the composer is not important, but what he represents is very much so (and that would be the integrity of intellectual art). The characters are not open-minded, because Rand's philosophy could not be denigrated by characteristic ambiguities. The antagonists, whom are largely the socialists, are similarly intolerant and obstinate, because they have to represent the evil in the world, again, without any equivocal elements. Rand clearly delineates the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; because it is imperative for her ultimate message.Of course, some of the villains/socialists are represented very poorly - it's obvious that Ayn Rand held a very inimical view towards that perspective. A lot of them are whiny and absolutely incompetent. The others are better; they are represented as intelligent folks...but at the same time Rand conspicuously betrays the rationale behind their standpoint because it must be lucid as to who's right and who's wrong.At times, Rand's philosophical banter can be overbearing. For instance, the MASSIVE speech near the book's conclusion where Rand's &quot;ideal man&quot; launches what seems to be every conceivable facet of the author's philosophy contained a few extraneous matters that were unnecessary (did it have to be sixty pages?). But at the same time, the discussions contained in this book are incredibly insightful and forces one to look at things from an all new perspective. It's completely understandable why this book is regarded as one of the century's most influential works. Whether or not you agree with some of the things that are said on its pages, you can't help but think about it. I would argue that the best books in history have been the ones that change the way we look at life.The plot is suspenseful, and creates a sense of urgency that is usually associated with mystery novels or books heavy on violent physical confrontation. But core genus of this novel is the adjunctive philosophy. Now that I think about it (err, it's actually pretty obvious), this is really just a philosophy book with the pretension of being a novel. Either way, it's a good read, and it's one of those books that everyone needs to read at some point in their lives. Rand's idea of the ideal man is truly inspiring, and this book contains many of the most powerful passages I've ever read. You might love it, you might think it's the worst book ever written, but it WILL change you. I'm confident of that."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm always amazed by the fierce love and hate this book inspires. There seems to be a all too common thread whereby people who read this book in their teens - and love the themes of self-reliance and heroism at the time - decide later in life that their enthusiasm was something to be ashamed of, and affect a cynical, and often astonishingly harsh attitude to the book that once affected them so much. It's a shame, though I can't be sure I wouldn't have done the same myself. Luckily I discovered the book in my later years, when I couldn't fool myself that my admiration for the book was a fleeting phase of youth.It is one of the few books that made an impression that has stayed with me ever since, and it made me proud of some of the qualities in myself that for a time I sought to suppress.A brief glance through the shrieking tirades written here against this book says more about their authors than about Rand. The personal attacks are baffling; I care little whether the authors I read smoked too much or didn't tip the doorman. Their arguments against what they misrepresent as her philosophy range from simplistic distortions to outright lying; Rand was a hugely influential and innovative thinker, regardless of whether this fact pleases them or not.As ever, Atlas Shrugged - and Rand herself - seem to evoke fury or admiration, and very little in between. As far as I'm concerned that's always a good sign. A wonderful book. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This question occurred to me as I was reading some of the other reviews here. I read Atlas Shrugged for the first time when I was 18 and it changed my approach to and way of looking at the world for the next 10 years. Any book with the ability to impact a life to such a degree (and clearly I'm not the only one) has to get the best possible rating - to do otherwise would be dishonest.I'm 44 now, and time and experience have taught me that few things in this world are as black and white as they are in this novel (or the Fountainhead for that matter). But that doesn't really matter. As a great novel it stands the test of time -- my own as well as the 1950's setting. As an ideal I encourage the new reader to view it as a quest for excellence in a world destroyed by mediocrity.Does it still hold the importance to me it once did? Yes, like the memory of a first love. But in retrospect it never would have worked, and neither would Rand's ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Imagine our world if the great industrialists all start disappearing. Anyone with a vision for the future simply vanishes into thin air. What would happen to the world? No one really knows what would happen. The world could do 1 of 3 things; get worse, stay the same, or actually get better.In Ayn Rand's brilliant novel she chooses to believe that the world will get worse. She effectively has the people that power industry and the economy at large go on strike. Sometimes this happens at a very critical point for the companies they run.Rand paints a portrait of bleak desperation for the rest of society. These are people that without someone inspiring them or giving them a sense of vision they have nowhere to go. Almost similar to Lord of the Flies but not quite so dramatic.I understand a lot of people do not like the philosophy behind Rand. They are either afraid of it or don't really understand it. From an objective point of view her philosophy seems extreme on many sides. The reason why I give this 5 stars is because she introduces a new type of philosophy and she does it in a compelling way.One need not be an advocate of Rand's to appreciate this work. I read the Communist Manifesto and thought almost all of it was bunk but still believe it to be a 5 star book as well. It is for the ideas introduced that it should be rated high not whether or not you agree with them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, Ayn Rand admits to writing differently. Yes, she tends to be redundant on the main thesis of her book. But never once did I feel bored or annoyed. The Speech of John Galt in my opinion is Atlas Shrugged's climax. Never before did I feel as relieved as when I read that speech and finally got to hear at least one person speak out with a loud and clear voice and with intelligence twinkling in his eyes.Yes, Ayn Rand is talking black and white and never grey. So what?That's what you do when you talk philosophy. You define right and wrong. You tear symbols from reality and project them on a wall. Not life-size but bigger than life -- lots bigger -- so people way over there still can see and reflect.I'm not interested in the shades of grey that you may feel you have to live your life in. I'm interested in truth.If your main concern is that there's people in the world that are neither good nor evil, or that not everyone is born &quot;productive and smart etc.&quot;, or that there's only a mere 1% Randian Bigger-Than-Life people out there, fine. You are right.But we are still talking philosophy. It's ideals, black and white. Galt's Gulch is the Objectivist's ideal environment. Nowhere does Rand claim that hidden away somewhere in some remote mountain range really is that valley so rich of natural resources and the greatest of people. Nowhere does it say that only said greatest have a place in an Objectivist society. Of course we need bakers, assembly line workers, messengers, mechanics and whatnot.It's just that John Galt is right, too, when he feels, that he owes nothing to nobody. He is not born with the original sin. He is born free. He is born a human. Nobody has the right to make him do what they think is right, and be what they think is a good person. Nobody should be throwing stones at him. It's just that he should be exempt from sh*t.What Ayn Rand has sold to me is a glimpse of her ideals and ideas. Where we go from here is in our own hands. In how far the book changes my life is my own concern. Or rather it should be. Only they won't let me.While you may say individualists don't make a society, they are your pillars. While you are the static force, they are the driving force. If after all you still don't want to give credit where it's due, i beseech you, please, at the very least,Get out of our way.Thank you, Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Fabulous.

The clash between government regulations and capitalism that is exaggerated by Ayn Rand is more relevant now than ever.

In Atlas Shrugged Ayn Rand repeats things so they serve as guides through the book. It is imeaserably powerful to repeat an idea from the book over and over again; especialy when the plot changes.

For those who found 11 September, 2001 almost unbelievable, 'Atlas Shrugged' will leave you breathless, and not too convinced that the motor of the world can't be stopped.There are humans who exist that have the capabilities to stop it...this novel is'nt too far-fetched, and THAT is frightening.This is a gem amoung much lesser efforts in the literary world. I'm now a huge fan of Rand. Treat yourself to the genius of Ayn Rand's world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has had a significant impact on my life. While Rand was pretty extreme in her views on government and the duality of humankind, the book provides a thoughtful message about the importance of striving for meaning in life. The book celebrates achievement, big and small, and should encourage people to take pride in the accomplishments of their lives. Atlas Shrugged should not be taken as an endorsement of monopolies, it should serve as a reminder to people that we should not be satisfied with just getting by."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, this is a book for the social/political/intellectual minds of the world to contemplate and discuss. It gave me a new look at several of my ideals. I just hated for the story to end. The &quot;larger-than-life&quot; characters with the romantic twist were better than any I have seen in movies or read in books in years. I have been trying to figure out who would play John Galt if they ever make a movie."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am one of those romantics drawin in by Rand's ideas. I won't speculate here whether characters were realistic, they are not. The philosophy of 'Atlas' was more interesting than the fiction. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is by far a better literary work. To her credit, she gives religion and altruism a deserving smack in the face. She also lays the groundwork for her philosophy here. Her significant contribution to philosophy was the &quot;Rand Razor.&quot; &quot;A&quot; is &quot;A.&quot; Contradictions cannot exist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although the book was only a framework for Rand to prominantly display her philosophy of objectivism, it was rather interesting. Very convincing to the naive--I could even feel the persuasion tugging at my mind. However, I feel the characters are too cold. Big business is glorified unrealistically and altruism is spit upon. The virtue of altruism is certainly exaggerated but it shouldn't be spit upon. If someone gives a starving child on the street a piece of bread, should this person be chastised. yet this is altruism. I say everything in moderation, and Randists go too far in one direction."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had to agree with all the positive remarks made about this book until about 3/4 of the way through at which time I couldn't believe how &quot;unbelieveable&quot; it all became. I felt the pain and frustration with the characters and hailed Ayn Rand for her courage and insight most of the way through. But then all at once she fell far from the mark in my estimation - totally one sided - out of balance with unreasonable conclusions. I found her lack of touch with the reality of human psychology and intimate relationships almost maddening. And as for that 50 page speech - so boring and further more incomprehensible that anyone would sit still to listen to that endless, repetitive summation of &quot;true value&quot; etc. let alone an uneducated general public. I loved the first of this novel and wanted so badly to claim it as one of my all time favorites, but I just can't do it based on the final chapters. A must read though - despite the disappointing conclusion."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand was truly a visionary. It's amazing (and apalling) to see what she wrote about in the 50s coming true today. This is my &quot;if you were stranded on a desert island and could have only one book&quot; choice. The Fountainhead is also fantastic, but this is even better, so I recommend reading Fountainhead first.Though this is truly a classic, it's not surprising that you never see it being assigned in school. The ideas in this book inspire the reader to be anything but a &quot;sheep,&quot; and I don't believe there's room in that system for a lot of free-thinkers.The bottom line? Read it and it will change your life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ms. Rand has outdone herself in explaining the moral issues involved with pursuing one's interests in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. This story has a futuristic setting like non seen in Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. The story focuses on Dagney Taggart, owner &amp; operator of an expanding transcontinental railroad organization who's faced with the United States's economic deterioration.The underlying idea to the story is Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. She illustrates, through Taggart, Galt, etc., how one's self-interests are what make up the soul of the individual. Furthermore, she expresses to the readers how individuals are responsible for thier actions, and how we must fight to keep true to our ideologies, even if it means letting others suffer for thier wrong-doings."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My experience with Ayn Rand began with my AP English teacher begging me to read the Fountainhead. A beginner to her Objectivist Philosophy, I quickly fell in love with her writing. I am only 17 years old and I feel as if Atlas Shrugged has forever changed my life. In our non-individualistic world today, Rand's characters are very much impossible to find. After reading Atlas Shrugged, I feel as if I have to strive to be someone like her characters. I believe, like myself, many others have felt this way after reading this incredible story. We may not be able to &quot;stop the motor of the world,&quot; but we certainly can try. I believe this book is a most read for all young adults, especially those in high school and college. This book is a lesson in the importance of thought and reason. In some aspects (especially in high school) the individual and his freedom of thought is not welcome because of social attitudes and overall ignorance on others parts. I can proudly say that this book has brought out the best there is in me. I AM AN INDIVIDUAL. I will never again rely on another man or woman instead of thinking for myself and following my own judgment. I recommend that anyone who has any true values and is a rational being should read this book. If you read Atlas Shrugged and cannot understand why I or anyone else love this book, than you are not a person of true values.

The only thing I do not care for is that it has a lot, 40 or so, of cd's"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whether you agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy or not, Atlas Shrugged is an excellent book in its own right. It is written masterfully with twists and turns everywhere. Her characters are strong and very well written. Her style of writing can get a tad wordy, and some chapters can be bit lengthy, but writing style works very well for this kind of Novel. The book is a monster, with over 1,000 pages it takes a while to get through as well as fully understanding everything that Ayn Rand is saying about the story and her Lifelong philosophy, Objectivism.Ayn Rand presents her philosophy through her characters very well, something that a lot of writers can't do very well. Some of her characters represent Capitalism while others represent socialism. And then some, of course, represent her main philosophy. Personally, I enjoyed trying to predict who supported what, and who was a \\"bad guy\\" and who was a \\"good guy\\" And Rand's writing either gave it away or left me stunned, waiting for more answers. The twists and Turns in the story really helped the book read like a story, instead of on essay on a certain philosophy. In Atlas Shrugged there are plenty of these little twists and turns every chapter which really helps normally boring parts of a book go very fast.I would recommend the book to anyone who wants a bit of a different take on Life. While I personally don't agree with what she says, the books themes are eerily similar to what is happening in today's world. I enjoyed every twist and turn and overall it was a great book (even if it is made up of several books). Atlas Shrugged is Ayn Rands masterpiece and it is pretty apparent why, it combines every element that a good story should have and while it has a few flaws it is a good read on a philosophy that isn't really talked much about."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas shrugged\\" is second to nothing!You cannot criticize it, you cannot find anything wrong about it.....You just sit down and read it.You will see one and the same world in different ways.This is Ayn Rand's masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This, I think, is Ayn Rand's best. I love this book. You do have to get past some of the 'preachy' areas but the philosophy is spot on. There are some parts that get a little windy (as in long-winded) but a must read anyway."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm only half-way through this teriffic audio book. It is well done in every way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If this book was a staple of high schools, the world would be a better place. If you like logic and critical thinking (and economics) this books is a treatise on capitalism and the disaster that ensues when its gutted. A preachy ending spoiled the punch, but otherwise highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This was an interesting book written in 1930\\"s and many things in it arestill true today. Weird that people never change and keep making the samemistakes in life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a classic - a (very) long novel that puts forth a cohesive presentation of her conservative point of view. Now, fifty (50) years later we can see the reality of her brilliance with the crumbling of our government and society."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Book should be a must for anyone who intends to use their mind and to create...anything - and those who dont too! Atlas Shrugged is honest, accurate, truthful and profetic - Are you confused by what is happening to you? your company - your country - the world? Are you a Moocher or Looter. If you are not one of these - you'd better find out who they are, how they talk and why they do what they do. The book on tape is great way to get through this huge accomplishment for the first time. An exelent and entertanining reading by Mr. Hurt. After the tape? - read the book!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is certainly one of the best novels that I have ever read. It is highly entertaining and is well worth reading by all.I first read it about 20 years ago and thought it was phenomenol. I recently reread it and thoroughly enjoyed it again.The basic story is about the thinkers and doers of the world going on strike when the fruits of their labors are confiscated (stolen) by the government and redistributed to those who don't produce.It explores the free market vs. socialism, personal responsibility, and excellence in the entertaining medium of a great novel. It is probably longer than it needs to be as Rand tended to be a bit repetitive and had some very long speeches in the text. Nevertheless, those only reduce its appeal a slight amount.I'm not an objectivist and disagree with parts of Rand's philosophy. That being said, this work was certainly a great predictor of the future effects of socialism on the American and world economies.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in important ideas and/or entertaining novels."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Wow, this is nasty! I have to admire a writer passionate enough to say what she really believes, with absolutely no consideration for political correctness or intellectual fads. It reminds you that there was once a time when it was OK to create dialogue with offense. It's crude, but it's fascinating. Now, you'll hate this book if you think the term 'conservative intellectual' is an oxymoron. That's basically it in a nutshell. If you think that, by definition, intellectuals MUST be open-minded, politically-correct, liberals you're gonna hate this. It's none of those things. If you can look beyond the fact that polemical writing is a legitimate literary device used by many of the world's finest writers and not just by 'pop philosphers', you may actually get something from this book. I challenge you to ignore the hackneyed claim from many a review that Rand is nothing more than a philosopher for teenagers and really THINK about what she is saying. You may find that it's possible to be conservative AND intellectual too, God forbid.And if you like this book, you'll also like the more arcane and subtle Czeslaw Milosz work called THE CAPTIVE MIND."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading Hugo's Les Miserables, I never thought that I would ever read another book I would like as much as it, let alone more. But a friend convinced me to read the paper-weight that is Atlas Shrugged and I am eternally grateful. Based on literary merit alone this book would be a classic, but the ideas are what sets it apart from everything else. This book is so inspirational, that it actually changed my direction in life, and how many books can you honestly say that about? Even today, 50 years after its original publication, the events that occur in the novel are eerily prophetic. The book is not for everyone, as I can attest. Many people read this book and see part of themselves in the most detestable characters and it pisses them off. However, if you love what this country was built upon (not what it has become), which was unregulated free-market capitalism, then this your Bible."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's amazing to see that, almost 45 years after its publication, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; still has the power to invoke such violent extremes of response (just take a look at the posted reviews below to see what I mean). Rather than disappearing into obscurity, this book seems to be gaining more and more relevance as we move into the 21st century...the Microsoft trial could have sprung directly from its pages!To me, the most interesting thing about her works is not their message (although it's an extrememly powerful message); rather, it is the way she is able to make her readers examine their deeply-held beliefs. Love her or hate her, one thing remains universally true: Exposure to Ayn Rand's ideas will change the way you view the world. I've never met anyone who remeins completely unaffected by what she has to say.The real challenge in reading Ayn Rand is to form your own conclusions...her ideas are so compelling that it is easy for many to be swept along unquestioning by them, hence the charge that Objectivism is a &quot;cult&quot;...for some, it has been. For others, she can produce such violent revulsion that the result is knee-jerk opposition, without giving her ideas the serious consideration they deserve. Are you intellectually strong enough to read this book and form your own defensible conclusions? Get it and find out.No, this is not light reading. But I defy anyone to produce a book containing ideas of this weight, that are presented in a more entertaining manner than this one. Along with her other book &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, this book remains one of the most influential of our century (and its influence is stronger today than ever, as evidenced by the prominence of one of Rand's greatest supporters, Alan Greenspan). Read the book and make up your own mind, if you can!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a great book that I would love to have on my kindle but the price is just to high. Why would I pay almost twice as much for a digital version?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Just finished reading this, and for the past week, every bit of news that I've watched has been interpreted through my reading of this book. OK, today's world is not the same as what Rand develops, but the \\"Someone should do something\\" or \\"Where's my share?\\" mentality is so much more obvious having read this.Really enjoyed it, and will need to go through it again to see how much of it I agree with, but it certainly has started me thinking about a lot of issues I wouldn't have otherwise - what more do you want a book to do?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Wow! This book explains it all. Can't figure out why this country is in the mess it is in now. Well, then you will want to read this book. If you are a second hander you will not like this book at all. In fact, it will make you quite angry. If you are an entrepreneur or producer of wealth and don't understand why the second handers continually whine about their situation and blame you for it, you will enjoy this book. If are one of the men of the mind that keeps working, producing and creating new wealth only to be degraded and vilified for your efforts and achievements, then you will get much pleasure from reading this book because it recognizes and appreciates your contributions. This book was written over 50 years ago and it is still relevant today!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is about the world right now, this very second. Its like she wrote the book tonight, after watching the evening news. I normally dont read fiction, but this book is a must read by any thinking person, if any are left."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although I had been ignorant of Ayn Rand's work, I was curious to read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" after a discussion in which it was discribed as \\"fiction become prophecy\\". It is brilliantly written and, almost incredibly, a \\"page-turner\\".The book documents the pitfalls and traps inherent in the responses to the political and economic changes currently sweeping the world. That it was first published in 1957 yet it's themes and substance remain so contemporaneous marks \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as one of the rare modern classics.Read it, you will be very impressed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading Fountainhead, I was told to read Atlas Shrugged. It was better, the suggesting parties told me. But, is it?The dialogue is equal. The story line is similarly intricate. But, it is less believable than Fountainhead. This is quite an accomplishment as Fountainhead is less believable than most fiction. And, it takes about twice as many pages to deliver its message.So, what makes an almost 1200-page book worth reading? The dialogue. Great dialogue. Pithy. Contrarian. Quick witted. Each character has its uniquely beloved voice and tone. Each party grows on you. You evolve to hate or love them. There really is no indifference allowed. Anyone explaining themselves as indifferent is not reading the book or delivering the truth.Many say this is one of the three greatest books in the English language -- at least for the 20th century. It is good. It is great. It deserves to be on any list of the 50 best novels. Top three? That is more of personal question.But, read it you should. You must. This is not for the faint. But, the view of 1957 to that of today is amazingly similar. Even though the politicians and others of the book may be attempting to deliver America in different directions from today's real life politicians, you find so many similarities that it is astounding. Insightful. Genius.This book has lived almost 50 years as a great selling novel. Do not be surprised if it lasts many many more."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand wrote a book filled with heterosexual arayan aristocrats (some born into money, some born in poverty) battling the only &quot;Evil&quot; in the world: Communism! Rand states that there is only one way in which to be happy, and that is through productive work. there is an objective standard by which all ideas, art, architecture and decisions can be gauged as &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot; &quot;Crimes&quot; that are not rooted in an economic basis and aspects of life and nature that call into question the perfection and infallability of objectivism are conveniently left out of the book's 1075 pages. All who do not adhere to the aforementioned philosophy are deemed immoral and irrational, and are not to be dealt with. Does this sound like a free-thinking novel that glorifies the individual? In my opinion, it does not. It sounds like a work of propaganda, touting a rigid ethos just as myopic and flawed as that which is deemed &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;Collectivist.&quot; Of course the Capitalists prevail in the end, Ayn Rand was a capitalist, and she held in her hands the typewriter with which she could play God. In closing, Ayn Rand was an adamant opponent of anything subjective, but I ask the objectivists: Does it not stand to reason that if we, as humans, are all individuals that should live by no ideas other than our own, why should we live stringently by a set of rules and a suppposed blueprint for happiness if we, as individuals, have not come by this &quot;knowledge&quot; throgh our own experiences? What are we if not a composite of (and reaction to) our subjective experiences? Perhaps your Great Leader would not have been such an advocate of Capitalism had she prospered under Communism.

The thing that I was wrong about was that people like you - you &quot;morally and politically justified&quot; looters - couldn't exist. How Wrong I Was. I have been irrational, but then again, not so irrational as you. And another thought for Monty in Texas, John Galt in a salt mine, how fitting. That wouldn't really have benefitted the looters, now would it? In fact, I think that that is just the job he would have taken had Dagny Taggart owned it. Oh, and Bob, keep trying, you'll get it right some day.

So don't take any ratings here as serious."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Listen: I am in agreement with Ayn Rand's philosophy, for the most part. I do believe in (small \\"L\\") libertarian ideals, and I believe that socialism is fatally flawed. I think she over-simplifies things, and ignores many facets of political realism, but I don't think she's that far off the mark overall. This is to be, however, a literary review:This is a truly awful book. I mean it is horrid prose. The characters, the dialog, the ridiculous plot, interaction and simple-minded storytelling in this book are just dreadful to read. It's like a bad, bad romance novella, except that it is an excruciating 1200 pages of close-set, small type with very little margin. It is a brick!Ayn Rand's philosophy could be well covered in a few pages (technology is good, personal achievement is good, profit is good, etc.), and I would challenge any of these other reviewers to say that they'd still love this book simply as a piece of writing, and not as a manifesto reflecting their own beliefs."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a book of science fiction. The good guys have almost magical powers of accomplishing things because they are the good guys and the plot requires it. The bad guys are totally evil. etc. Typical space opera stuff in a sociological context. Not a problem for me.My problem is that this is an awfully badly written book (like a lot of other SF cult favorites). Booooring. And mean-spirited. When I first read it as an adolescent I was surprised by the intensity of my dislike of its meanness. I tried to reread about 40 years later. Same reaction. Mean and boring.My recollection of Rand herself on TV shows is of a certain dominatrix type charm(this is said positively, I remember her on Carson). She seemed likable but hardly to be taken all that seriously.As for this philosophy stuff (Objectivism). Get real. It is not \\"a philosophy\\", or philosophy, or intellectually respectable. It may be a good mechanism by which a bunch of intellectually lazy poseurs can pretend to be \\"intellectuals\\". That is their business.One star. Two or three were it not for the meanness factor. But I can see how space opera fans might love it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You are going to have to do alot of thinking if you are going to read this book. Think very hard about Ayn Rand's premises. If you are going to take the time to read this book take the time to learn how Capitalism works and what some of its problems are (if you don't already know). If you don't then you have to take for granted that what Rand tells you about economics is true. This makes for a weak premise. What one must especially be careful of is taking what is true for Rand's world as true for our world. Our world and her world have very different settings and very different people. For instance feeling that it is ok for common people and politicians to die in a train wreak because they are the same as the people in the novel would be a big mistake. This is an obvious one but some are not so obvious. I found that Rand had some good and important things to say but that most of what she said was wrong and unfortunate. But to each his own. This is definetely an important book if only to make people look at what they believe and why they believe it.P.S. Remember that while selfishness may be a virtue in economics it isn't neccisarily a virtue in other aspects of one's life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In answer to questions reguarding my previous critique, this book was apparently written as a vehicle for the circulation of Ayn Rand's personal philosophy, i.e., \\"objectivism.\\" Though Leonard Peikoff's introduction provided an outline of the motivations and intentions behind Atlas Shrugged, it wasn't until I was well into the story that the implications of objectivism began to crystallize for me. Objectivism is sort of an ultra-capitalist form of fascism that justifies itself in existentialist terms. In other words, the idea is really nothing more than an excuse to treat people badly and proceed through life as a ruthless tyrant, so long as you can do so \\"honestly,\\" without becoming dependent on anything other than the pursuit of your own self-interest. It is much like dyanetics or scientology in that it espouses a predatory approach to social interaction. The story line itself lacked dimension, as an objectivist world doubtlessly would - while the characters, some of which initially seemed interesting, degenerated into mere caricatures of virtuous self-delusion and blockhead folly. I ended up hating the heroes worse than the villains in this book. Rand's ability to portray a gloomy scenario for the characters is only surpassed by her inability to remedy their dilemmas without resorting to miraculous devices such as the \\"image refractors\\" used to hide \\"Atlantis\\" in the mountains of Colorodo from the outside world, or the \\"secret motor\\" that runs off of the static electricity in the atmosphere. This is not the real world, so objectivism functions quite well here - when you run into trouble all you have to do is make something up to get out of it. Rand ties all this in with her own slightly sadomasochistic fantasies by allowing the heroine, Dagny Taggart, to win the undying devotion of every man she sleeps with. But no sooner does she get the man of her dreams, than she's off on a romp with someone she likes even better. Of course there are never any hard feelings on the parts of her rejected lovers, because like all good, obedient objectivists, they realize that they weren't good enough for Dagny in the first place and they are just glad to see her with someone better than they are. If you have not already read this book, keep these points in mind, you may not want to waste your time, or if you do, you may not want to get sucked into the confused idealism it is selling."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The beauty of the Internet, electronic books and all of the efficiency's gained by not printing should be reflected in price, but alas the greedy Penguin publishers think that they will charge more and make up for the poor sales they have recently. The poor sales which are not reflective of their product being stolen, hijacked or share online like the recording industry can truthfully state, but rather they are reflective to the poor quality of the product they have put out. Junk, illiterate nonsense and generally disregarded trash and rather than develop new authors they try and make more money from an old classic. And I would fashion a guess that this behavior is their way of snubbing their nose at amazon.com who is one retailer who has saved them not hurt them. So who wins here. Amazon does not get the sale. Penguin does not get the sale and \\" who is John Gault\\" never gets discovered.Good job Penguin. You certainly have scored a victory."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Maybe Rand had something interesting to say. Maybe not. Who can tell? Either way, her trademark novel is so stilted, so drawn out, so hypnotically boring, so irrepressibly repetitive, you'll never make it to the end, I promise. The most laughable part of this novel is her obsession with the Gold standard. Heck, what is gold but a highly conductive non-corroding metal? What is so magical about gold that it might somehow prevent the global economy from crashing and burning due to greed and stupidity? Why not use some other commodity upon which to base a currency? Why not use sand? Why not develop the Sand Standard whereby people deal in tons of sand instead of ounces of gold? Or why not use titanium, or bismuth or pork bellies or dung? This gold thing is just one example of Rand's supposedly ultra-rational view of reality (Objectivism) that turns out, when sufficiently examined, to be little more than some sort of fetish of hers, some kind of personal bias cloaked in a mange of so-called perfect reasoning. It's silly at its best, boring at its worst."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This particular copy is about the size of a thick paper back with hard binding. As such, the type is quite small and difficult to read.

The old saying, \\"the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money\\" rings true in Rand's story, and equates perfectly to modern times (and arguably any times).The big let-down of this story was John Galt's climactic and famous speech over the radio. For the entire length of the book, the plot and story line masterfully build a perfect case against \\"big government\\" and how eventually it will destroy a nation (i.e. its ability to produce). So the reader is poised for a great speech that will poetically articulate the ills of \\"big government\\", but wait, what do we get?.... we get Rand's atheistic philosophy with bold accusations of how theism / Christianity is somehow to blame for big government's ills. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? Left field if you ask me. So what could have been a \\"conservative masterpiece\\" ended up being an authors lame attempt to pin socialism's problems on theism and specifically Christianity's original sin doctrine (among others). That is so wrong.In addition (and ironically), Rand's world of adults leaves no room for the love and self sacrifice required for children to reach adulthood. If the Galtian Creed \\"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine\\" were adhered to by the parents of this story's main characters, the main characters would never exist. A similar case can be made against the aged.This book, often referred to as a conservative classic, whereby Ayn Rand's \\"objectivism\\" philosophy is weaved into a plausible application (as near plausible as can be conceived) provides incredible insight into the dealings between the private and public sectors. I am torn by how much I agree with her desire to be loosed from the chains of governmental parasites (the looters) and by how much I disagree with her conclusion that somehow theism is to blame for the government's desire to feed on those who produce. In reality, the Christian philosophy makes no such external demands on free enterprise (as accused by Rand) and embraces the work ethic and the rewards that follow. Christianity however does not tolerate the exploitation / abuse of labor in order to reap excessive profits, so free enterprise should always bear in mind the dignity of the human person.In summary, I've never read a book that has so much right and so much wrong within the pages of the same book. I'd rate this book a 5 star for conservative (& anti-socialism) insight, but a zero for unrelated (& unecessary) anti-theistic philosophy infecting a good story line.

Rand DID write some very helpful things, but also some nonsense. There is a lot of evidence around that she was not a very pleasant person to be around unless you treated her like a omniscient prophet. The problem is that her legacy has been transformed into a dogma by some people who refuse to see her dark sides. I strongly urge you to read Jeff Walker's The Ayn Rand Cult. It's not a great book, but I believe his research is sound. He has read most of the literature about Rand, as well as interviewing Objectivists and ex-Objectivist that knew Rand. Then ask yourself this question: Which one is most truthful, Jeff Walker's book or the hagiography Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life? I guess reason requires you to read both before you make up your mind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I couldn't get through much of this book. Her contempt for anyone not wealthy and privileged was so obvious, it made me physically ill to read it. I threw it in the trash after the first chapter. No way was it going in my bookshelf. Ayn Rand is what fundamentally selfish people read to make themselves feel better about being themselves. I'm also laughing here at people being mad at the Kindle price for the book. OMG seriously? Her whole philosophy was about selfishness and no government beyond police and military (nevermind who was going to make the laws that the police and military enforced....tosh). BUT YOU CAN PROBABLY GET THIS BOOK FROM YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY FOR FREE.

Rand simply thinks that a completely capitalist world would actually be able to function, and better yet, would be a utopia. I disagree strongly. If a completely free market emerged, I would sense life would be hell. Workers without rights, child labor, large gap between rich and poor, no envirorment regulation leading to destruction of the envirorment, and basically good lives for the few &quot;haves&quot; and horrible, meaningless lives for the &quot;have nots&quot;.An objectivist would read this book from an elitist point of view. Constantly thinking they'd be the Reardins, or taggarts, or d'anconias. However, that is simply not so. Not everyone could be the heros in Atlas Shrugged in a real capitalist society, as a matter of fact, only a few would be able to. Capitalist hierarchy only promises advantages for a small percent of the population, and exploitation for the many.In the book, Rand proclaims that the ownders of production are the &quot;atlases&quot;, and without them the world would collapse. I would dissagree. For example, during the Spanish Civil War, the trade unions took up production. There were no bosses or CEOs, responsibility was divided between the workers. There were over 6 million people involved in this, and it was successful. Without the workers, these capitalist parasites would collapse, not vice versa.therefore, i do recommend this book, as it is an interesting book to read. Just don't take every idea put forth by it seriously."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A striking irony concerning Ayn Rand's work is that it generally appeals more to the mindless and ignorant, rather than the free-thinkers she claims to champion. I suppose one reason for this is that her philosophy leaves no room for dissent or original thought - you either take it all or nothing. Even Rand herself has trouble overcoming her lack of ideas as she struggles (rather unsuccessfully) to fill out an original monologue for each of her heroes through the course of the books 1000 pages.As for those willing to read Rand objectively, the most I can say for her is that she makes sense -- sometimes. Rand starts off simple enough (&quot;A&quot; is &quot;A&quot;), but soon thereafter cooks up such a furious mess of twisted logic that you'll either write it off immediately or become hooked. Don't worry though- like any fine narcotic, Rand's effect will wear off once you realize you've become miserable and peerless. Just don't overdose."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Was there ever a more vile and monstrous piece of literary excrement foisted upon the world? I don't know of one. Rand claimed to look up to Hugo, well she must have used a very big telescope to even catch a glimpse of him."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Almost 700 people have written reviews of Atlas Shrugged, and not one of them has actually defended the novel. Most of the five-star reviews are just streams of insults directed against anybody who dares the question the holiness of that almighty Goddess, Ayn Rand. A few more sophisticated readers have claimed that AS is a philosophical work, so it shouldn't be judged by the standards of literature. Actually, it is a failure both as a novel and as a work of philosophy. I will try to explain its failings in both areas.Atlas Shrugged could serve as the definition of long and tedious. Not only is it packed with lengthy, boring speeches, but there are many characters who move through the exact same plot devices: they are exploited at the start of the novel, but then \`wake up' and realize the importance of individuality. Several of the superfluous plotlines involving minor characters could have easily been eliminated without harming the overall novel. Beyond that, the writing is high-school level, with a few big words like \\"sustenance\\" and \\"obligation\\" thrown in to give the illusion that the author is well educated. The dialogue is cheesy and unrealistic, while most of the plot events feel contrived. For example, when the Comet gets stuck at a red light for no reason, Dagny just happens to be in the right place to save the day. Now what are the chances of that?Many posters have already pointed out that Rand's characters are entirely one-dimensional; they have as much depth as comic book heroes and villains. Rand fans arrogantly defend Atlas Shrugged by insisting that her heroes represent humanity not as it is, but rather as it should be. While the idea of a perfect human might be entertaining I fairy tales, it has no place in great literature. Meaningful books must deal with gritty reality, and feature characters with the same strengths and flaws as real humans. Even great literary villains such as MacBeth and Ahab are still well-rounded, realistic characters with understandable motivations.But the real purpose of this train wreck (yuk yuk) of a novel is to pound home Rand's personal philosophy. In fact, she makes her point with a sledgehammer in almost every paragraph, and it's all done with a level of self-righteousness that would make Jerry Falwell blush. Rand's philosophy can be summarized quite easily. According to her, the world consists of two groups: a small band of hard-working geniuses who are responsible for everything that goes right in the world, and a majority of wicked, lazy hangers-on, who want to destroy the good people out of sheer evilmindedness. Not surprisingly, the few virtuous people happen to be the ones who follow Rand's political philosophy to the letter, while everyone else might just as well be shot. Several posters have remarked that Rand appeals exclusively to 18-year-olds and a handful of academic elitists. This is easy to understand when you consider the tendency of most young people to avoid responsibility while pinning blame on others. Atlas Shrugged appeals not to reason, but rather to short-term, stupefied emotional satisfaction. If you want proof of my characterization of Rand followers, simply read any of the five-star reviews that decorate this web page. Not only do they all employ remarkably shallow emotional arguments, but most of them are also rife with spelling and grammar errors.Rand's simplistic views on economics and politics boil down to one statement: government is bad. Needless to say, if her principles were applied in the real world, disaster would result. Objectivists constantly remind us that Alan Greenspan is a fan of Ayn Rand. However, Greenspan's job consists of using the power of government to control the economy. If he spontaneously adopted Rand's brand of free-for-all capitalism, we'd all be in big trouble.If you've realized by now that Rand's philosophy is a classic case of a victim complex, give yourself bonus points. Rand makes the bizarre claim that American businessmen are currently undergoing the worst persecution of any group in history. In Atlas Shrugged, evil bureaucrats devise wicked, restrictive laws for the sole purpose of spiting entrepreneurs. Needless to say, the objectivist thugs are unable to provide any real-life examples of such legislation. Our government allows the wealthy members of the business community to shelter their income from taxes and then gives them multi-million dollar handouts, paid for by the poor and middle class."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am all for philosophical thinking, and have no problem with a book designed to deliver a message, but the writing here is just ridiculous. The problem with Atlas Shrugged can be summed up by this brief dialogue between the three character types in the book. This is entirely made up, but could just as well be a direct quote from the novel. Here, Person A believes in an entirely capitalistic society, Person B has allowed even the tiniest notion of socialism to enter their mind, and Person C is an unenlightened American public citizen.PERSON B: Sorry I'm late, I tripped over my own two feet on the way in to the office and landed face-first in a conveniently placed cream pie! Then the pavement collapsed and I fell into the sewer system!PERSON A: That's funny. I was greeted at the door by two supermodels who handed me a comedically large check and the \\"Most Amazing American in America, Ever\\" award. Then I won the Olympic Gold for 100m dash and saved three children from a burning building on my way in to work.PERSON C: Gee, I wonder which of these people I should choose for my role model...?PERSON B: OH GOD MY HAIR IS ON FIRE!In case you didn't get it from the first 1000 pages, Person A goes on to make a 50 PAGE SPEECH outlining Rand's philosophy in excruciating detail near the end.It's disappointing because there's actually a fairly interesting story of corporate intrigue here, but it's completely ruined by the one-dimensional characters. Every plot point is totally predictable, you already know the outcome of every confrontation before it begins, and the science isn't even remotely accurate. Rand just uses the weak story to beat you over the head repeatedly with her philosophy. Considering the size of the novel, this leaves quite a headache!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I loved this book. It was all that so many who love it say. But, since it is a philosophy being presented quite seriously as a basis for how one should live one's life, it is open to criticism at a much deeper level than most novels.Objectivism is an atheistic philosophy. It's fundamental axiom is that the individual owns the results of one's labor and that one is personally responsible for oneself. It is essentially a subset of Nietzschean existentialism. It explains nothing of where the world came from and it doesn't provide any moral basis or meaning for existence. Basically, it is incomplete in its most important aspect. It's taproot to a fundamental axiomatic truth which explains life in terms of meaning and first causes simply does not exist. Therefore, it is difficult to see upon what John Galt bases his philosophy of life with any more certainty than personal opinion provides. This is one problem with any atheistic philosophy. Such philosophies produce truth which is purely tautological since all elements of the philosophy are self referentially defined.The theological basis for Western philosophy is Christianity, and regardless of those who own the arrogance necessary to attempt construction of a philosophy which leaves faith out of the picture, belief in that which provides meaning by providing truth originating external to the symbolic logic set that we are bound to use as human beings is required for a cogent philosophy. Christianity serves this purpose in the West due to its emphasis on the individual. Each individual is responsible for his own salvation and the idea of collective salvation which we hear being bandied about these days is entirely inconsistent with what we need to believe in order to resuscitate America. This is perfectly in line with Objectivism's conclusions in the material realm. But Objectivism by itself provides no basis for why it is correct.The progressive movement which began over one hundred years ago has slowly undermined the original basis for America's greatness and as the Creator's role in that greatness has been reduced to the point where today, we are discouraged from even uttering a reference to Him in public. Atlas Shrugged is a very good novel, but its philosophy is dangerous due to this one fatal flaw. The reason it is dangerous is because since it does not recognize axiomatic truth based on faith in a source which is external to our self referential symbolic logic, it is subject to being no more true than the progressive interpretation. This is a very subtle distinction, but failure to understand it is why our nation, and the West in general, are deteriorating."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have the overwhelming desire to turn a cartwheel, to celebrate the completion of the chore of reading Atlas Shrugged. And there's no mistaking it. Reading this 1168 page tome was a CHORE.Why did I take it on? Number one: It was the October selection for my book club, a group of women I cherish. Number two: It's been on my bookshelf gathering dust since 1992. (Do the math. That's 17 years).Perhaps slightly changed by reading this rich story of American industrialists in a capitalism vs. communism struggle, regardless, I want my life back--my productive, happy life. Because I had both the hardbound version and the audio version, the story and the characters rarely left me. The good news is that I didn't just sit on my arse and read. While listening, I was a productive member of society and created an entire jewelry line using precious metals and copper. I'm not sure, however, if it would have earned me an invitation to \\"Galt's Gulch\\" (Rand's version of Atlantis). In fact, I had a hard time sorting through all the larger-than-life characters to find someone to whom I could relate.The heroes are all, perhaps, too perfect and the \\"looters\\" are all too pathetic. Dagny Taggert is a brilliant and beautiful engineer who runs a railroad. One of her many lovers is Hank Rearden, who creates a new, industry-changing metal. Another is Francisco d'Anconia, of the d'Anconia Copper family. And then, of course, there's the most significant character of all, about whom we are asked from beginning and throughout the story, \\"Who is John Galt?\\" The king of the pathetic looters is James Taggert, Dagny's moronic brother, who is one among a host of government-directed 'officials' who systematically take steps to destroy the country by imposing and acting upon a series of directives/acts.The story is fascinating and the characters are incredibly well drawn, albeit highly unlikeable. First published in 1959, some aspects are dated, and yet, current political and governmental activities, particularly relating to corporate bailouts and economic stimulus plans, make Atlas Shrugged eerily prophetic and certainly worth discussing in intellectual circles.Its biggest detriment is the length. Characters don't dialog. Instead, they engage in proselytizing speeches that go on and on and on and on and on to the point of mind-numbing repetition. I think Rand could have easily gotten the same message/information/story across in half the number of pages.Now that I'm finished I don't regret the reading experience. I can't help but admire Rand's accomplishment and her amazing focus. I recommend that you make sure you have plenty of time available to dedicate to this book before you take it on."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Those who are against Capitalism could definitely use this novel as a learning tool. Unions go on strike with little consequence, but think about what would happen to the world if the employers did the same.Those with children will also like to read about what happens when Dr. Seuss meets Ayn Rand in a book titled: An Island Called Liberty. It's a beautifully illustrated book that warns children about the dangers of big government."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"At the simplest level, this book is about the realization of dreams. A man rises from a worker in a steel plant to the owner and operator of one of the largest steel plants in America. The same man spends ten years of his life working on a formula for a revolutionary steel alloy. The book is about the often lonely and difficult trek towards the realization of the values we cherish most and about the different reactions to those values by a wide spectrum of humanity. The book is about a woman who meets the man of her dreams, however it isn't the typical and trite fairy tale where Prince Charming magically appears without any connection to value or merit. In this story, the man of her dreams is an embodiment of everything she holds dear and has lived by; and she finds him as a direct result of her values, not merely haphazardly. The book is about the congregation of men and women who cherish their lives and who cherish the values that create productive, fulfilling lives, not the boring sob stories of drug addicts, pimps and other lowlife. This isn't a book for people who are looking to feel better about their sordid existence by escaping into lives even more sordid than their own.Most poignantly, this book succeeds in imparting a powerful and luminous experience of reality. There is no way to express the kind of light that comes across from reading the stories of success and unwavering integrity in the lives of the novel's heroic characters. I wonder if those who cannot appreciate this book, at least for its luminous aspects, are so removed from an ability to experience the world, that only a strict diet of depravity can move them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In my life, I have read quite a few books, but very few have I read twice. The first book I read twice was Snot Stew (I was 8, had the flu, grabbed something from the bookshelf, stumbled back to bed, and didn't have the energy for a second trip). This was the second book I have read twice, and a third and fourth time since. This book has redefined life, liberty and the pursuit of my happiness.The book is not perfect - an editor with a little more will might have helped (though I am not sure anyone would have been able to stand up to Rand). Also, perhaps due to her absolute rejection of communism, I feel that Rand placed too much emphasis on money and power as the source of self-fulfilment, at least in this work. That, however, is a discussion for someplace other than a book review.In any case, this is a book that should make anyone stop, think and perhaps approach life a little more intentionally. I highly recommend that anyone with even a modicum of intelligence read, contemplate and react."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"um seriously, when i first started reading this book, i was really interested and enjoyed it emensely...later, someone decided that it was imperative that i know the ending of the novel. if anyone ever tries to spoil the ending of this book for you, try to avoid it, it will ruin your entire take on the book and it will not be appreciated the way ayn rand wanted it to be. now, from where i am, i still think that the book was worth reading, it would have been much better if i didnt know the ending, but that is not the writers fault and the book itself should not be judged based on that. atlas shrugged made me think about a lot of things. although it was based in a i guess you could say fantasy world made up in rands mind, it really doesnt differ too entirely from the way that things are now. everyone can identify or sympathize with at least one character from the book and can understand the writing. every problem faced in this book may not be real, every solution to these problems may not be real, but all the emotions of these characters and their actions are very real. unfortunately this is true, and thankfully the world and time in which rand sets the novel is completely fictional, because if it wasnt, may god help us all. once the end of the book is closing in, it makes you think very hard about what you know and what you wish you didnt know, once you see what happens in the story to all of the people in the story who did know anything and what happened to those who dont know anything, it makes you believe that everyone deserves to be ignorant. no one should know what kind of greatness there can be. no one should know that everything can be fixed if you care for nothing and for no one. because nobody can fully understand that concept. everyone will be too selfish, or too caring. there is never a happy medium with anything. think of a time you knew something more than anyone else did, you alone knew how to save something or do something wonderful, or prevent something terrible, but you could do nothing about it, once whatever it was that you knew about did or didnt happen, you wished that you never knew about it in the first place, didnt you? theres always that risk of knowing too much, therefore ignorance is bliss, and everyone desreves to be ignorant."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Let's start out by saying I liked Atlas Shrugged. I thought the book was so engrossing because it was so &quot;alien&quot; as another reviewer put it. I agree with Rand when she claims to have done something new, to have stated a new theme in an entirely new way. Psychologically speaking, the majority of us are raised to believe in the doctrine of original sin and all that it entails. That we should feel guilty for everything we do for ourselves, etc and that to sacrifice yourself for another is the highest virue. Regardless of whether Rand's opposite extreme has any more validity, the fiction itself is compelling and as I said, the characters are interesting even if they are just puppets for stating the tenets of Objectivism. Many good points about the failures of communism/socialism but of course she ignores the basic problems of capitalism, especially laissez faire. Perhaps her own experience justifies her prejudice, but then she wouldn't be being very objective, would she?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If Atlas Shrugged is a book Rand wrote for the elite few who could appreciate it, then how come the writing is so unsophisticated? Atlas Shrugged has more in common with a hastily-written potboiler than a work of high literature or philosophy.The prose is purple (at many points so bad it made me wince); the book's &quot;message&quot; is shrill, unrelenting, and without nuance; the earnest love scenes read like they came straight out of a drug store romance novel.It is not because of a vast left-wing conspiracy that Atlas Shrugged is never taught in college literature classes (or, for that matter, college philosophy classes); this is simply not a novel of the first rank.If you want to read sophisticated works about the dangers of &quot;collectivism,&quot; try George Orwell or, better yet, Arthur Koestler. If Rand's &quot;philosophy&quot; is what interests you, read Nietzsche and Adam Smith--which is what Rand read and tried to graft together.Apparently, it didn't trouble Rand that her new intellectuals would have no taste or background in the literary arts!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I purchased this book because I never read this when I was younger.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's accomplishment has never been equaled, rarely approached. Rand has written a novel of philosophy which praises the heroic in man.In her master-work, Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand draws out every logical implication of her philosophy. A railroad executive, Dagny Taggart, is confronted with a mystery which takes on metaphysical proportions as she investigates it. Why is her railroad business failing? Why are men of ability disappearing from the Earth? Why does society stand by silently, or, worse yet, applaud, when the best and brightest among them are reviled and destroyed? To answer these questions, Dagny must first discover the source and the meaning of the greatness of man, the source of knowledge, the meaning of reality, and the core of morality.The answers lie in the philosophy the book preaches. It is Rand's view that man's reason is his only tool for dealing with reality; reason requires freedom to operate; therefore man must be free. Man must be free of government regulation in the area of economics; free of mysticism in the area of thought; free of the ugly meaninglessness of modern art in the area of beauty.No other novel treats with these large issues in a logical and consistent way, yet with the pace of a detective thriller. Every epic written in the past had knights, princes, and demigods as their heroes, which is to say, fighting men, destroyers. Atlas Shrugged is an epic for the modern age, whose heroes are the creators, businessmen, industrialists.There are those who liken Ayn Rand's philosophy to communism or nazism. Such reasoning usually contains an error. Ayn Rand was an atheist; communists are atheists; therefore Ayn Rand was a communist. By the same logic, Hitler had a moustache; Charlie Chaplin had a moustache; is it correct to conclude therefore that Hitler was Charlie Chaplin?It has also been said that Ayn Rand was atheist, and therefore was a nihilist. A nihilist is someone who believes in nothing, has no passions, and has no convictions. Ayn Rand could perhaps be criticized for being too vehement in her convictions. She spends many pages saying again some point which she has already made clear earlier. Readers must be patient with her repetitiveness, however, since, from reading her critics, it is clear that she has not been repetitive enough.It has also been said that Ayn Rand did not know economics. This is mere humbug. The economists of the Austrian School and the Chicago School, including the great Ludwig van Mises, as well as Nobel-prize winning economists such as Halzitt, confirm Ayn Rand's conclusions in every particular. Economists of the schools of Marx and Keynes are no longer well regarded, except, perhaps, in the isolated and other-worldly groves of academia. Recent history shows the downfall of communism and nazism in Europe; state-run industries are being sold into private hands all over the globe. Living proof of the fitness of Capitalism as the only moral system for human life, and the deadliness of Socialism, shines from every corner of the globe.Ayn Rand's anger and righteous indignation is directed against communism, nazism, and every form of what she called \`collectivism' i.e. the believe of the supremacy of the group over the individual. She believed in the absolute sovereignty of the individual, in the freedom of man, and she preached the moral goodness of the free market. She condemned using violence or force against any other human being for any reason except in self-defense, and that, narrowly limited to stopping only the aggressor. Ayn Rand can be accused of certain flaws in her writing, but to accuse her of being the diametric opposite of what she is, shows that no accusation of substance can be made.For a critic to see her anger and indignation, and, from that, to conclude she is a nazi, is a rather poor conclusion at best, and does not seem to fit the facts. Anger is the proper emotional response to one's attackers; indignation is the proper and wholesome emotional response to those who praise vice and condemn virtue. Till Ayn Rand wrote, the righteousness and anger had all been on the side of the enemies of the free market, the foes of individualism.It is about time freedom and individualism had an unabashed champion. Atlas Shrugged is the anthem, apology, gospel, and the rallying cry for those who believe heroic ideals."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had never heard of Ayn Rand and knew of Atlas Shrugged only because I was broadly searching for a really good book and saw this noted on various best book lists. I read it as nothing more than a book about innovative industrial entrepreneurs taking large risks in attempts to succeed despite the government and the general public trying to leech the rewards. Rand did an excellent job of writing a compelling story that kept me glued to the pages. While I never fell in love with the protagonists (though I sympathized with them), I certainly hated the antagonists.Contrary to some reviewers, I didn't exactly feel the book was about selfishness and greed, rather allowing people to make decisions for themselves (as opposed to the government or public opinion making the decisions for them). Much of the giving in this book is not a result of people genuinely having hearts, and really doing any good for society, it's born out of group think and fear of appearing greedy. Their fear to appear as anything other than virtuous is causing rapid innovative and economic decline to simply appease the masses.Naturally, things are up to interpretation and if I had interpreted this book in a similar fashion as many of the negative reviewers had, I, too, possibly would have found this book to be absurd. But in the manner that I have interpreted it I find it to be an excellent story with very valid illustrations of the possible (and probable) unintended consequences of doing things for an undefined better good without thinking it through, particularly with a groupthink mentality - and I find this aspect of the book extraordinarily relevant to our current global state of affairs.This book is most definitely not an easy read and it took me about 80 pages before I got used to Rand's style and in a reading rhythm. The style of this book is quite verbose and frequently goes into very fine detail with some tangents to fill in a little back story going on for pages. However, once I did get in that rhythm I couldn't put the book down (and thoroughly enjoyed the sub-stories that filled in some background) and have since searched for books as compelling and addictive as I found this one. I enjoyed this book so much the next two books I read after this were Fountainhead and Anthem (neither I found to be as good as this, as each are simplified versions of Atlas Shrugged)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, it's huge, and could've been shorter.Yes, Rand belabors the point sometimes.Yes, the characters are a bit shallow.But these flaws are more than compensated for by the fact that this book has a powerful message that everyone needs to hear. ESPECIALLY in light of current trends toward a welfare nanny state of government hand-holding and interventionism.In its simplicity, this is a story of the able versus the incompetent--the producers versus the moochers and whiners--and it illustrates beautifully that while nobody is perfect, the world keeps turning thanks to a small percentage of its population.There are many other great reviews that break the plot down and talk about the characters so I won't bother, but I have to mention that I truly loved Francisco's \\"money speech,\\" which was a beautiful argument for free-market capitalism (not the crony thug capitalism that our government and many of the Fortune 100s are engaged in), and Galt's famous monologue, which was an honest plea for people to stand on their own two feet and take pride in their abilities.My only real criticism with Rand's philosophy as presented in this book is that I disagree that one should only live for himself, and that one does have a responsibility to help his fellows...BUT...this can't be socially enforced and it can't be done at the expense of one's own survival.Overall, I feel that everyone must read this book. In my company, I pay people bonuses for reading it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"READ THIS BOOK!!!I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. He was required to read this book for a college economics class. I absolutly fell in love with this book. I do not read much, so an 1100 page book is a big undertaking for me. I will pass on what my friend told me: The first 200 pages will seem slow because of the character discriptions and history. Give it those 200 pages and you will be hooked and it will read a lot faster.It is amazing that one person could compile everything that is in this book. What a work of art. As a reader, you will definetly start looking at the issues surrounding you in a different light.Only negative: \\"The Speach\\" at the end of the book. It's way too long winded and over the head. Suggestion: Listen to this speach on youtube to help get through it.READ THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"AYN RANDS BOOKS ARE SOMETHING I REFER TO EVEN TODAY AS THEY ARE VERY RELEVANT AND SOME OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"OK, I am going to start this review by saying that if you have never read this book before, you're going to want to buy it in physical book form. I read this on my Kindle and the editing was complete garbage. It seemed to be as if the pages from the book had been scanned in and converted to digital via a computer or something. I am not sure how that works, but as someone else has mentioned, there were many instances in which \\"Galt\\" was written as \\"Gait\\" and I don't think \\"D'Anconia\\" was ever in the text in its correct form.Moving on the the actual substance of Rand's magnum opus, though, I have to say it is one of the most influential books I have ever read. While this is a novel, it's important to realize that this is essentially Rand's philosophy of Objectivism written in the form of a novel. A lot of people will say that the philosophy overshadows the characters and plot development. This is true in some instances, at points it is SO blatantly obvious that I just had to roll my eyes. It seems to me that the editing of this book was less than stellar. It is QUITE a long read, and I had read that there were actually entire sections of the book already left out. It could have used a bit more cutting, and I feel like an abridged version of this book might be more suiting for its needs. By the time the fourth or fifth major disaster happened and Dagny and Rearden had to save the day, I was ready for the book to just end already.Keeping that in mind, I feel like the prose and plot of the story weren't as important as the message Rand was trying to send to her readers. The MAIN thing that readers should take away from this book is that one should NEVER live one's life for the sake of another. I won't go into that too deeply, the importance of that is for the reader to discover on their own. The second thing to take away is that communism can NEVER be a viable system for people to live under; A is A, and existence is identity. If you deny reality, you're denying existence, and if you cannot accept that, the sum of life becomes null.This novel didn't change my life by telling me something I didn't know, but it did give me a way to put it in to words. One last thing I will touch on is that you can't use this book as the standard for living your life. This is a good foundation, but don't think that just by reading this that you are superior to everyone else. While the point of this novel is that individualism is superior to collectivism, it's important to remember that by supporting people who you value and share similar ethics and values, you are ultimately supporting yourself. I think that by reading this novel, some people take away the idea that they are superior to everyone else, and should only do things that concern themselves.I know this review has gotten wordy, but I just wanted to get the point across that this book is DEFINITELY worth a read. It's absolutely phenomenal and I recommend it a thousand times over to anyone who wants to have a better understanding of egoism, individualism, capitalism, and rationality. Just don't let it go to your head."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A few years ago, the title of this book kept popping up as a great read. I brushed it off though and figured it was similar to any number of other books I had read in high school, which were mostly tragedies. I decided to finally give this book a shot after it was so highly recommended by many people. I had no idea what was in store for me. This book is epic! The storyline is so intriguing and compelling. It's a book about philosophy as well as a suspenseful mystery novel. The book covers numerous topics. It boggles my mind how much of a genius Ms. Rand must have been to have created such a well written and intricate story.I must say though, I had to get 100 pages (the book is over 1,000 pages) into the book to really get into it. I know today's society is hard-wired for instant results and pleasure, but give the book a fair chance. Once you really get into the story and involved with the characters, you'll find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I can't say much because it upsets me too much. With perhaps the richest of all written traditions behind us - a tradition which contains many, many, nuanced and powerful discussions of the ideas Ayn Rand is so well known for defending - we celebrate a work of such striking mediocrity as a philosophical classic! It just shows how little appreciated the philosophical tradition is - how little we value anything which challenges us. I have been teaching courses in moral philosophy which include lengthy discussions of 'ethical egoism' (the position Rand defends) for fifteen years now - of course it is not remotely helpful to use Rand since her views are better expressed and defendended by others. The popularity of ethical egoist positions in a country that delights in thinking of itself as 'united under God' etc. etc. is enough to make you weep. If you are impressed by the idea that to focus exclusively on your own interests is justifiable because that is what is best for society at large then you should realise that you are not an egoist at all, but a kind of utilitarian who has a very implausible theory about how best to advance the common good. If you care about the common good and you care about your own interests, that commits you to the difficult and demanding business of deciding, case by case, when they conflict, and what to do about it. Rand would have you believe that there is no conflict here at all because the right thing to do by your fellows is to forget all about them. Both nasty and poorly argued."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book is interesting as a political statement, but it reads like a real estate contract. That it is over 1000 pages long made it pure torture to read. I started this book hoping to learn something, but the only thing I got from it is the pride one feels when finishing an arduous task that few others could complete. If Ayn Rand were still alive I would send her some punctuaion marks. The sentences are so interminably long that I thought she was trying to conserve periods. Interrogators will sometimes play acid rock music over and over to browbeat their subjects into submission, this book is a written version of that."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"WARNING: To anyone seeking to make money and be successful, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! In Atlas Shrugged Ayn Rand demonstrates her complete lack of knowledge of economics and business. It appears as if she never even took a high school level course on economics. She was not an executive; she was a fiction writer. Although she attempts to glorify capitalism, individualism, ambition, and hard work, she fails. Sure these qualities are worthy of celebration but to write about them in such a common, uncreative way will not make people agree with her ideas. Stylistically this book is on the literary level of a Danielle Steele novel. The language is flowery and wordy. Furthermore, her fanatical rants (such as John Galt's several page speech) sound like nazi propaganda speechs. Also to any girl who has any sense of self-respect, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Rand's distorted views of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;romance&quot; are offensive and degrading to women. Please never let yourselves be treated like Dagny Taggart let men treat her. For those of you who really value success, individualism, and money I'd like to reccommend some books that might motivate and inspire you. Two very good fiction writers are Nietzsche and George Bernard Shaw. For non-fiction I'd reccommend The Prince by Machiavelli, The Autobiography of Bejamin Franklin, How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, and The Myth of the Robber Barons by Burton W. Folsom, Jr. These are just a few that I've read that I think you may enjoy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's 'economic theories' were last tried in France, circa 1789. How'd that work out? Yes, putting the yoke of oppression on the common man so that the Masters rise ever higher is the recipe for social decay and, eventually, outright revolution."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The two books that most influenced my life are the Bible and Atlas Shrugged. It is a fantastic book; made laugh and made me cry.But I hate the CD's. The audio on the CD's is in the format of one large track, so it's not divided into chapters or any other discernable blocks. Unless you are prepared to listen to each CD all the way through without interruption, good luck finding the spot where you left off. Very, very inconvenient. I can't believe the publisher was so stupid to release it in this format."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was really into Ayn Rand in my younger days. Recently I picked up a copy and began to read. How I have grown up.Rand's central problem is her reliance on massive psychological ad-hominem attacks against all who do not agree to worship capitalism.But I guess I have to be more specific, since the free-market fascists have gratuitously eliminated well-constructed arguments from public debate: some refer to ad-hominem as a personal attack. A person's psychological motivations have nothing to do with the evidence and logic of the argument. The massive recurrence of this fallacy in this book is only a distraction which, intentional or not, only serves to cause hatred of those who think unbridled free markets belong in the historical display of failed theologies, next to Marxism, Communism, and Fascism.Not surprisingly, nowhere in this book is the actual definition of capitalism even remotely explored. Since nobody seems to remember, capitalism is the act of owning assets that generate income even when you are not there to operate them. And to own enough assets generating enough income to live on, most people have to inherit them-or trick the government into giving it to them, the standard practice used by most of today's \\"corporate heros.\\"There was once some use in the corporation: it was a tool for socializing risk, for which investors were duly rewarded. But the railroad companies so admired by Rand were some of the first to run crying to the Federal government for free handouts while hiding thier lobbying with PR campaigns about the \\"free market\\" and \\"competition\\" and \\"individual initiative\\" even as they ruthlessly stomped the \\"competition\\" they professed to admire.As a final note: To any free market fascist reading this, I really don't care what you think. My job is to reveal this \\"work\\" for what it is: rhetoric-driven fundamentalism, serving to obfuscate the quest of the rich and privileged for the endless aggrandizement of more wealth and privilege.\\"All for ourselves and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind.\\"--Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, Book 3, Chapter 4, Paragraph 10."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I simply cannot understand how people can take such juvenile rantings seriously. I really do wish the moochers who call themselves \\"capitalists\\" would go Galt all the way.They'd be eaten by bears.Seriously, a 64 page speech at the end? Galt = Castro.One can only imagine the PowerPoint version of Atlas Shrugged. It is one book THAT DESERVES to be made into a Really Bad PowerPoint version.Rand's \\"philosophy\\" is idiocy, by the way. Go read some real philosphers instead of this garbage."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You may be able to finish this story if you are the most patient person in the world. My time is valuable to me and this long-winded never-ending story doesn't get to the point. I don't think I can finish this."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"this is one of my FAVORITE books. even at its length, the story feels like a quick read because its so easy to want to fly through the chapters. this books, being her final masterpiece.the story is about capitalist-minded business owners mainly Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden. Dagny is heiress to a train enterprise and Hank created a factory that produces his own entrepreneurial invention Rearden Steel. they and some other characters exemplify Ayn Rands ideal contributors to society; the \\"prime movers\\" of the world. But slowly some of the prime movers begin to vanish while at the same time, the government turns increasingly socialist, making regulations on business that Dagny and Hank find increasing harder to manage productive companies under. the book demonstrates how these prime movers can only do their best in laissez faire capitalism, and how the socialist and collectivist rules take from these companies and expect to SHARE their services and products without fair compensation much less profits. eventually the whole countries economy freezes and america turns into a third world country. the only shining light at the end it the prime movers who set out to go back into the world and rebuild it.Atlas Shrugged demonstrates Ayn Rands philosophy in individualism, capitalism and objectivism. her characters also show how mankind ought to be in its ideal and abstract; mans spirit.this book is inspirational and spiritual. As you read this book you will read through a prophetic story for America while also learning her inspiring and spirit exalting philosophy. what I love ( and what most people criticize) is that you find Ayn Rand speaking through her characters throughout the story. its as if, pieced throughout her novel is her self-made bible of individualism, capitalism objectivism and egoism. therefore you will must likely enjoy this book if you also enjoy non-fiction, particularly philosophical and political ideas.I love this book and have already started re-reading it!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I greatly looked forward to reading this book. I have not. The paperback mass market ed. came today in the mail and I find it unreadable.The typeface is small and the layout on the page is tight and with an astonishingly small number of paragraph breaks... (meaning) the page to the eye is a block of tiny sentences that go on and on and on.I'm over 40, so my eyes aren't great. Keep that in mind. BUT, whoever laid this book out... well, like I said, it's unreadable in this format. I'm going to have to see if I can find another version.I still am looking forward to reading this."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Simply the best book I have ever read. I don't want to say to much, lest I not give this novel the credit it deserves. I'll simply say that it changed my life forever.

For those of you who don't: you MUST read it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged was given to me on by my Grandmother without a comment when I was 19 years old. I asked about what it was, and she said to read it. The book after completing it over a summer connected every thought about politics and economics together that I had thought. I never thought I would say that a book would change my life, but this one did. This is must read for anyone who is young and ready to take on the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was 25 when I first picked up this book. In college we were required to read one of Rand's shorter novels. Seeing how I was all caught up on my Clancy books, I decided to try Atlas Shrugged. I say try, because this is a huge read. 1000+ pages, but each one is better than the previous. I won't go into the story that much, cause I am sure it is done to death by other reviewers. I will tell you that this is one of those books that you will easily relate to. For me, I must be able to associate myself with a character or be completely fascinated with the character's individuality to be engrossed in a book. I almost lost me job staying up late 'cause I couldn't put this book down. Not only did I associate myself with several characters (rarely can relate to 2 characters in one book,) I understood them and yet was wildly fascinated with them. Everyone, no matter age, sex or race should be able to get into this book.This book also clearly, but not bluntly or over the top, brings out Rand's theory of Objectivism. Basically, her thoughts are that everyone is different, yet when everyone is viewed as being the same, problems will arise. When too much government interefernce dictates how we go about our daily lives, what will happen?John Galt - finally I wrap up my review by looking, for a moment, at the focus of this book, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot; John is a man who believed in his principles, so much in fact, he walked away from everything in an attempt to find a far better place. When asked where he was going, his only response was &quot;I am going to stop the motor of the world.&quot; I got chills when I read that line each time in the book, and I still get them just writing it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't know if I liked this so much because it just seemed to throw concepts that I think about in a day to day basis, or if Ayn Rand's incredible characters come up with ingenious plans that remind me of the end of the Shawshank Redemption. Anyways, if you want a book thats got a great plot, and don't mind thinking about some philosophical views, go for it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When we first started reading Atlas Shrugged for my Economics class I thought the book was too long and too boring. But now that I see Dagny fighting to save Taggart Transcontinental and the conflicts between her and John Galt, I had come to like economics and understand it even clearer. Rand's writing style may be a little grandiloquent but the points she makes about society and how people are punished for their virtues makes me personally want to fight harder for the things I want. I may not agree with Rand's views on everything but if people can learn to work hard and work together then maybe society can work a little better."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is an exciting novel which illustrates a philosophy of life. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a great story and a great title. The four stars are five for a great story and minus one for overbearing philosophy. I don't particularily care for Ayn Rand's philosophy, but the amazing depth of the plot and characters makes up for it and makes for a fascinating read. However, a word or two of caution is advisable. This book reminded me of the Communist Manifesto in that it looks good on paper. It is almost understandable, though, when you consider that Ayn Rand grew up in Russia in the two decades before the Russian Revolution and wasn't much older than I am when it exploded.Being one of the young, tender, impressionable high schoolers that one of the reveiwers further down is trying to protect-- I understand that this story was carefully constructed to portray the morals and wisdom of Ayn Rand. She was a master story-teller and not to be forgotten, but perhaps used as a cautionary tale? This will not happen here any time soon. I found it interesting to note that the obvious symbolism of the characters in the story does not have to be interpreted to such an extreme as it usually is. The book almost sounds like something that could have been written recently by someone venting about modern politics (and exagerating, of course). I find comfort from the two radical differences in oppinion of her works in a quote from Wise Child (I paraphrase) &quot;Those that are really special don't flaunt it&quot;."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved but have never been able to reach. ...The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it's yours.&quot; - Ayn Rand, Atlas ShruggedIf you have not yet read Atlas Shrugged, I'm a bit jealous, because I would love to be able to experience again the exhillaration of reading this novel for the first time.This is a timeless book which adresses the fundamental questions of mankind, and which will be read as long as there are people who care to ask such questions. At the same time, it is a fast-paced mystery-adventure, with a heck of a lot of humor (which is hidden between the lines until one reads the book a second time). The protagonists are not people one would meet everyday, which is one of Atlas' virtues, rather, the characters are the sort of people one would wish to meet at least once in one's life. Rand's heroes were unabashedly heroic.Atlas, despite being an exciting read on the level of an adventure, is more fundamentally a book about ideas. These ideas are introduced not as floating, imaginary abstractions, but in terms of real concrete dillemas similar to those all people must eventually confront if they are to live a productive, fulfilling life.I feel a profound sense of reverence for this novel. Perhaps you will too, or already do."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is still a good read after all these many decades! I'm glad I waded all the way through this again!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think this should be required reading for every registered voter. While the characters and activities may seem extreme, as an engineer, I understand the importance of limit analysis and it applies well in this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ms. Rand is in some respects a gifted writer, and I found myself drawn into the story despite the long-winded ideological rants. (A strong-willed editor would have been so-o-o welcome!) I happen to enjoy oddly-formed oddball rants by people whose ideologies I don't share, which is what gave me the patience to slog through this tonne-weight tome. Where I really have a bone to pick with Rand is in what I consider to be her intellectual cowardice. Presenting her ideology via a work of fiction allows Rand to create a world in which she is always right. The entire world is pressed flat between the panes of her two-dimensional ideology, with her champions intelligent, articulate, and morally pure, and her enemies bankrupt on all counts in equal measure. Some of history's greatest and most influential thinkers have somehow managed to reason their way to positions antithetical to Rand's, yet despite her apparently extensive knowledge of philosophy the best words of counterpoint she can put into her opponents' mouths are unintelligible gibberings and awed, uncomfortable silence in the face of the Profound Truth her various interchangeable mouthpieces espouse. It's like watching Mike Tyson beat the snot out of Pee Wee Herman for several hours while Pee Wee cowers in a corner begging him to stop. It proves absolutely nothing, except that mismatches lack all entertainment value, and sheds no honor or glory on the victor. Or in Rand's case, no verismilitude."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I found a book with a list of things you need to do before you die. One of the items said, read Atlas Shrugged and try not to let it change your life. Challenge accepted! I purchased the book the next day and tried reading the first few pages. I couldn't get into it and it sat on my bookshelf for a year collecting dust. The next time though, I pushed. And I discovered I didn't have to push that much. Within 20 pages, I was hooked. I was expecting a political/philosophical book, but instead found myself immersed in one of the greatest love/suspense stories of all time. It was really fun to read- something I don't usually attribute with the classics.And the best part is that it is really long! How many times have you wished a good book would keep going? Well this one does. A certain plot line might seem to come to a close but then you look and your less than halfway through the novel...and it just keeps getting better.It's a great book for men and women. I really enjoy a good love story- this had three of them wrapped into one. I also love mystery and suspense- and this had those elements as well.Politically, it might polarize you but in my case, it made me think and question myself. Sometimes you have to take her words with a grain of salt and sometimes they seemed spot on. I should also say that I'm very independent, enjoy working and living for my own happiness, so I was most likely predisposed to enjoy her view point. It's not for everybody but in terms of a piece of literature- it's an extremely well written and beautifully crafted novel, any my absolute favorite. I took the challenge and it changed my life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After first reading The Fountainhead I dove head long into Atlas hoping for a similar experience, but about a third of the way into the book it began to drag and I had to take a break because it was just so slow. I kept thinking about the book and after about a six month break picked it up again and started fresh. Think of this book as a nice long TV series as apposed to just a few episodes. The story is well written, if all be it a little sluggish at times, and the characters engaging. Rand's ideas will get you to think and think a lot. It's almost more relevant today then when it first came out. I was shocked when I was reading the book because things happening in it are happening in real life. It's a book that made me angry at things going on around me and think about how we got to where we are. Not a fast read, and Rand tends to make a point that could have been told in a paragraph or two go on for a page or two, but that's a minor complaint compared to the eye opening experience reading this book was. I do think one should start out with The Fountainhead to get used to her style but then by all means read this."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I find it amazing this book was written in 1957 and not 2009, as it so closely describes our current \\"welfare society\\". Our culture punishes those who work for a living and rewards those who want hand outs. Makes me want to buy a copy for each of our congressmen and president, though I have little hope of it making a difference.Terrific story line...very compelling reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The Devolution of our society had already begun in Rand's time, as progressive globalist thinking had already entrenched itself in the Ivy League institutions, the same institutions responsible for molding the vast majority of our nation's leaders until the present day. While her critics see the work as the ultimate treatise on selfishness, I view this work as one of the noblest humanitarian contributions of mankind. This was a warning of the most dangerous enemy to human happiness and fulfillment. Today this enemy goes by the names of \\"progressive, communitarian, or globalist.\\" In the past, the enemy went by the name socialist, fascist, or communist. It doesn't matter what the looting class calls their philosophy, it's always reduced to the same theme and that it to steal from those how contribute most to society and give it to those who contribute least. Rand's critics view it as a viscous attack on a defenseless poor. The fact is, we see the looting classes across all socio-economic classes, just like we see producers across all classes. The fact is, the political and corporate looters are far more destructive than the looting poor. Just look at where all the bailouts are going. They are not being given to the poor, but to the richest failures on earth. These bailouts are given to corporate leaches at the expense of all those who have a net productive impact in our society, whether they be rich or poor. The sad part is that the productive poor and middle class are those hurt the most, though the injustice is equal in severity across the classes. In the next couple years, the affects of this corporate/state looting will become apparent as we suffer first massive deflation (we are already seeing this), then massive hyper-inflation as goods become more scarce. When there is $10 per gallon gas and milk in this country, it will hurt the poor the most. The rich can still afford to buy $10 gallon gas and milk. The looting in this country has reached unimaginable levels and still the \\"progressives\\" can not claim to have fixed any social ill. In fact, social problems just seem to get worse as more of their policies are implemented. Ask yourself if Ann Rand's thinking goes beyond theoretical philosophy and into the realm of LAW.I'm sorry to say that I think most of Rand's critics are the looters themselves. Most of them are probably academics, public educators, government employees, or some other looting class. These people are the great drains on society and the reason mankind hasn't progressed far beyond what we can imagine. In fact, we are regressing. You know it, I know it. The difference is that the progressives will say it is the evil capitalists to blame our world's downward spirial."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The two most important people in the last century were Russian, Ayn Rand and Alexander Solgenitzen. I first read Atlas Shrugged in 1969 and now am completing the fourth reading. Each time, more of this book comes true. It is prophecy in our time. She foretold the rise of government, the welfare mentality which has taken hold in the USA and the coming stike of the producers. This book is a romance, an adventure story, a political treatise and a philosphical work. It can be read on each level enjoyably. The book has shaped my thinking and life since 1969 and I could not recommend it more highly. Everyone who values their liberty needs to read this book, more than once."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whether you agree with the philosophy of Ayn Rand or not, Atlas Shrugged is a thought-provoking book, to say the least. Just take it with you on a bus or on a plane and witness the different conversations that you become engaged in. The responses to my simply carrying the book with me ranged from, \\"That book is poison for the mind,\\" to \\"Isn't it incredible?\\"I found that it shaped the way I thought for months after I finished reading it. It didn't define my thinking, but rather informed it. It described such a radical departure from the way I thought about the world, how could it not.I would hope that people of faith who have considered reading this book are not persuaded not to for reasons of faith. It's true that Rand spares no words discrediting faith in God and charity and many other principles that many hold dear, but learning about the philosophies of men can and should ultimately strengthen one's faith."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a difficult book to rate. In some areas it is truly outstanding, while some aspects leave much to room for improvement. Overall, I think 3 stars is fair. Read on for details - no spoilers, you will have to read the book for the ending.ContentThe message in this book is positively frightening. It should be required reading for every member of every state legislature as well as our Congress and House of Representatives. They should all be required to read it once a year. Forget the fact that this book was published in 1956. It talks about the welfare state we have created and a very probable outcome if we continue on our present course. Conditions in the US are very close to the conditions at the start of this book.I know there are those who say that we will never become a socialist welfare state, and there are others who see nothing wrong if we do. Those are precisely the ones who most need to read this book. If they can still support those positions afterwards, we are truly a lost society. The rest of us need to find our own John Galt - if we want to survive, that is.On content, I have to give this book a 5 star rating. Thought provoking, though difficult to wade through, the insights gained are worth the struggle.PresentationI realize that this was written in the mid-50s and that the editing process was far more tedious than it is now, but this book would certainly have benefited from at least one good scrubbing by a hard-nosed editor.The dialog is frequently very stiff and artificial, besides being repetitive. Even in 1956, real people did not talk to each other like that.Repetition does not make the point clearer or make it any more likely that the audience will believe. Especially when the same point is repeated many times throughout the book. To the same people. Summarizing the point of the book in a 60 page - not a typo, the speech is 60 pages in length - serves no constructive purpose. The few believable dialogs are like a breath of fresh air and very welcome.So on presentation, I'll be generous and give it a 3 star rating. Just be prepared to tough it through - the message is worth the pain.ImplementationHere, the best I could do is give this book 2 stars. At least I didn't have to scan the pages and convert it to Kindle format. Typos abound - the most glaring and annoying is the sequence 'Ay.' Anywhere in the book that this letter sequence appears, the A is capitalized. In the middle of a word, at the end, wherever it appears. The least the publisher could do is run a global search and replace. Oh, sorry, that would have required a proofreader."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's amazing how some books can change your entire viewpoint in life. I had similar views about capitalism and government intervention prior to reading this book, but seeing the way the government communicates the &#34;urgent need&#34; for more of their intervention, it is amazing how this book told the story so many years in advance. I listened to the (very long) audiobook primarily, but wanted to have a physical copy as well for my bookcase (both as a reference, but also a conversation starter). I can't recommend this book enough, and it's definitely worth the time it takes to read!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a dynamic story of an American government going too far in terms of federal power. Although it was written in the mid 1950's, it reflects what can happen when the federal government becomes too powerful, i.e. like a dictatorship. The book can be particularly aimed at the current government which is gaining more and more power at the expense of the States and the people. It is a wake up call for those who read the book and see it as a way to reflect the way the country is going politically on its present path. It will hopefully be an instrument of reversing the current political trend by returning power to the States as the US Constitution was proposed, ratified and amended to date."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I approached Atlas Shrugged with great expectations, after having become familiar with Ayn Rand's reputation. What a let-down! This work is vastly over-rated for the following reasons (if not others as well):1. The basic philosophical and social arguments are simple and could have been developed effectively in a short story. They certainly did not need to be repeated through 800+ pages.2. The character development is simplistic to say the least, with everyone divided into heroes, victims or looters.3. Each type of character spouts the same speech ad nauseam, according to their category of character.4. Ayn Rand doesn't even spare the poor \\"five and dime\\" shop worker,Cherryl, from speechifying. I laughed out loud when I read the high-flown speech attributed to Cherryl (right before her accidental death). Even Rand has to qualify this speech as words that Cherryl would have thought -- presumably if she had been cast as a hero, instead of an almost-hero.5. We have to suffer through endless descriptions of the tightening and loosening of characters' facial muscles, as each gets ready to suppress a smirk or hide their pain. Enough already!6. The sun is always rising or setting and casting appropriate light or gloom over the scene, as though Nature is in sympathy with the long-suffering heroes.7. When we finally see a glimpse of Atlantis, the new home of the heroes, it is remarkable that there are hardly any women there, other than our heroine Dagny. How is this model society supposed to survive and thrive with only male heroes present? Will these heroes teach their precious skills to their sons and daughters, if any?8. Why do the heroes all come from dysfunctional families? Why do they not experience any loving relationships with other humans? Why don't they have any children? Despite being such vaunted \\"doers\\" and \\"inventors,\\" sadly they remain one-dimensional speech-makers.9. Ayn Rand apparently had little understanding of warm human relationships built on honest emotion. Her heroine Dagny bounces from physical \\"love\\" / \\"worship\\" for one hero to another, aware only of physical or mystical attraction. How can anyone credibly claim to dedicate their life and love to someone whom they've never met (Galt), only idealized in an overly cerebral personal life?10. Finally, I am personally horrified that such a deficient piece of literature should be routinely presented to high-school students in the US. Is it not surprising that impressionable youngsters should come away with the idea that the (American) world is divided into only two categories \\"winners\\" and \\"losers?\\"Ah-ha, note to self: Maybe this philosophy explains the unethical behaviors of businesspeople associated with the collapse of Enron, Arthur Andersen, the US mortgage industry, Wall Street banks, and even perhaps the disgraceful response to Hurricane Katrina?In conclusion, this is the most over-rated book I have encountered in a long life of reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is just flat-out terrible. There's no other way that I can put it. You would think that in a book over 1,000 pages long you'd have characters that show certain degrees of subtlety, nuance, and growth. Not so with this book. Absolutely everything is in black and white terms, and the result is something closer to a religious text than a novel probing into the mind of man. I came away from this book hating every single character in it. The \\"dialog\\" is the flattest I've ever read...it's nothing more than Rand spewing her philosophy out of characters that might as well be wearing white hats and black hats as in an old Western film, in case the good/bad distinction wasn't made clearly enough for you. There are some decent parts, such as the first run on the John Galt line, but nearly everything is ruined by Rand's literary version of stamping her feet and screaming \\"if you don't agree with me, then I'm going to take all my toys and go home!\\" It's a great endurance test, and I do take a certain snobbish pleasure in saying that I finished one of the longest books ever written, but overall this book was a huge waste of time.I would like to state one last thing: I happen to agree with certain parts of Rand's philosophy, and I've read Anthem and The Fountainhead. Someone responded to a review I wrote of Anthem stating that a historical perspective was important. Yes, it is important, but all the historical perspective in the world isn't going to make this a good book. You don't need historical perspective to enjoy Don Quixote, or Candide, or the works of Shakespeare. You don't even need to like the characters to enjoy a book: Lolita is a great book, but I disliked everyone in it. I also know Rand's background, how her knowledge of Socialism was a lot deeper than most other writers at the time. I can understand why she would feel the way she felt and why she would write the way she wrote. Still, taking everything into consideration, Rand was still a lousy writer, and Atlas Shrugged is still one of the biggest loads of garbage I've ever wasted my time reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Beware of those who want to burn books. Six out of 5 stars!! This book bears the truth of modern humanity!Atlas Shrugged should be REQUIRED READING for all high schoolers. It blatently points out how Socialism is morally wrong. I believe he book is predictive of how the USA is on it's way toward it's downfall: In the book, you'll see in it many of your family, friends and acquaintances that believe that it's OK for the majority to soak off of those of us in the minority who have a desire and will to be productive.Admittedly, Ayn is Godless and long-winded &amp; over the top at times. Skip over the redundancies. Maybe listen to the audiotapes! Her message needs to be pushed for people to hear it! Quite often, the truth hurts.

If this book is so &quot;influential&quot;, how come I never heard of it until Sophmore year of high school, from a crazy teacher who follows the philosophy hardcore, with the soul purpose of promoting it. I think the only influencing this book has done, is telling people what not to do. I think someone summed up her philosophy best when they said &quot;Screw Your Neighbor; Do What YOU Want and Take Whatever You Can.&quot; Thats basically the whole point of the book. Oh yeah, and worship money, specifically gold.Somehow I get the impression Ayn Rand never passed Kindegarden, when we learned how to share, and we could all have a fun time. Without sharing you cant have love, and without love we are no different from the animals.She also says &quot;Dont worry about anyone else, just yourself be completely independent.&quot; Uh, hello. We never were and never can be completely independent. That is a very foolish outlook. We all come into this world as babies and are dependent on our parents. We can never be completely independent either, we always depend on nature for our food.And if everyone only cares about themselves, were would all the safety regulations be? Who would chase down criminals? Who would hold open the door for you when you have your hands full?No One!!!!!In her book she claims that money isnt the root of all evil, and maybe shes right. But excessive greed and lust for money is evil (example. Bank Robbers) and her philosophy advocates that!Call her philosophy genius if you want, but if I had a choice of our current world and Ayn Rand's utopia that worships money, I'd definately choose the current world. By the way, the book is also incredibly boring, long, drawn out, and the plot gets really really stupid when you make it to part III."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After having read, and seriously enjoyed The Fountainhead (in spite of the obvious gags in the philosophical theory of Rand), I took Atlas Shrugged with excitement with the anticipation of a great book. However, the description of the characters is no different that the one found earlier in the Fountainhead, and even worse. What really annoy me from this book (something that you can already perceive in The Fountainhead), is the number of times that I have to read the same statement (rephrased, and sometimes not even)throughout the book. Being more of a disertation about the purpose of life, and less of a novel, you could, and if fact, will focus your attention in the never-ending logical inconsistencies, the poor structure of Rand's thinking, and on the poor quality of her writing. On top of this, this anticomunism manifesto is, as it comes, old fashioned (although this is not her fault), and it is dissapointing to see how her backgroung makes her thinking very much expected. Finally, the book is a never ending book. NEVER BUY THE PAPER BACK COPY, OR YOU WILL END UP BLIND"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Read deeper and you will find that Atlas Shrugged has NOTHING to do with conservative politics. Ms. Rand would despise the current climate and I beleive would applaud President Obama as a man of rational thought and intelligence. The current thugs who rant against the President prove my point. The moochers and leeches all seem to gravitate to the pundits and lash out with \\"feelings\\" and what they \\"want\\". The President uses logic and does what is right, not easy, not popular, he is rational. Ask who is John Galt? I say President Obama is closer than any conservative. Read without the bias. Read with rational thought and logic. This is an anthem to the individual. To always exhalting our highest, best self and to trusting our own judgement over anyone elses. Who asks us to do that? President Obama. Who tells you what to think, how to live and what to believe? Limbaugh, Palin, Beck, O'Rielly...they are the ones who are ruining American, and undermining rational thought."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a timeless book about human nature and society. The plot is engaging and interesting, but Rand's portrayal of the socialists and capitalists is extreme and can get repetitive and irritating at times. Even though it is a work of fiction, it is quite creepy that what happened in her book also happened in communist countries, such as Red China. On the other hand, pure capitalism also has its evils, as we witness with \\"big business\\" in America. Rand claims that one can't compromise one's principles; you're either a socialist or a capitalist. I beg to differ. I think that any principle or belief taken to an extreme will result in tragedy.This book is an intriguing, thought-provoking read. When and after I read it, I couldn't help but see the everyday things from a more cynical and scrutinizing angle. On the one hand, I can understand why Rand is so pro-capitalist; on the other hand, her anti-socialist beliefs makes her out to be selfish and egotistical. Overall, it is a universal story and is a must-read especially for students of the social sciences and humanities."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is probably my most favorite book.

Endless drivel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book, separated into three parts, is three books under one cover. It is very long but worth reading.A descriptive writer, Rand describes everything, literally everything. In addition to what her characters are saying, Rand writes what they are thinking and why they think as they do and why they do what they did. She keeps you interested throughout, even though it is tedious to read at times because of the length.What happens in this book is what could happen in the United States unless people come to realize nothing is free, you should work for a living and the majority of jobs come from big business.Ignorance by choice in the US is frightening and appalling. If the people continue to be easily lead and believe everything they hear without listening to facts, we are doomed. If they continue to hate big business and the rich who worked to become wealthy and employ thousands of people, they will regret it in the end.If the government continues as it is, what happens in Atlas Shrugged could happen in the US and the people will be the ones who suffer in the long run, because of their lack of interest and looking for a free handout or drug fix.Read this book, you will learn something.

My new favorite book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read my previous review, and I am sure it is not particularly helpful to non-informed readers, so my aim now is to divert potential readers from adopting this book's ravings as their philosophy.This book argues for the valuing of things over humanity.The one person I know who lives by these &quot;teachings&quot; has studied no other philosophy and spouts such gems as, &quot;If someone is dying of hunger in front of me, and my $5.00 could save their life, I am under no obligation to help them.&quot; &quot;Abortion is okay because the fetus is a parasite, and you'd certainly kill a tapeworm, wouldn't you?&quot; Enough said, I hope. The entire class, including the intellectuals and dim-bulbs, ended up hating this guy. No, not because he was obviously superior and we were all jealous of his mental splendor. Anyone who has any caring for human beings in themselves cannot tolerate such dismissal of human life.Please do not let the underlying cruelties of this philosophy go unnoticed. It is all too clear the people who embrace it already have a disposition towards conceit combined with low self-esteem; this sad conglomeration results in seeking the &quot;proof&quot; of your greatness in the &quot;non-human,&quot; lowliness of others.If you want a genuine look at the possibilites for your own worth, read Francis Didion's SHORT work on the subject. Your self-worth does not lay in the immolation of others or messianic tendencies ending in seclusion.A blatant paradox of Rand's work is too painfully obvious: if she was content in her beliefs and their soundness, and didn't give a flip about the well-being of others, why did she write and &quot;preach&quot; so much, anyway? Not for the sake of other's lives, we know that. For the reinforcement of her own self-image and the need for worship from others? I think so.You want to reach your full &quot;human&quot; potential? Follow reason, but allow for compassion and empathy. Reason does not have to be devoid of Rand's hated &quot;feelings.&quot; You are fooling yourself if you believe Rand and her flock of sheep act on &quot;rationality&quot; alone. They are following something that resonates originally with what they WANT to believe. Their &quot;proofs&quot; of &quot;rationality&quot; are only secondary, and they are not even good proofs, at that.People capable of true human love and connection will not like this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It bothers me when die-hard Rand fans assume that if you do not like \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" that you must be of low intelligence, a total idiot incapable of grasping great literature. Nevertheless, I do not think \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is the great classic many proclaim.First, I do believe Rand has talent as a writer. I am not here to bash her writing skills. However, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is poorly organized in large part because of the length. The beginning flows smoothly, but about 200 pages into the 1200 page beast, things start to get a little jumbled. Because Rand viewed this novel to be the one to showcase her philosophy, I think she became too emotionally involved to let the story unfold in a realistic, riveting way. It is paradoxical to say an author can become too involved in their novel, but in this case I truly believe that this novel would have been greatly improved had Rand stayed out of it more. The climax, in the form of a 60 page speech by the infamous John Galt, is stunted because she gives us too much beforehand. We are bombarded with the same themes and ideas so much that John Galt's speech,instead of being liberating, comes across as annoying and pretentious. Indeed, the speech itself reads like a poorly organized essay.Also, the characters are flat. By flat I mean their personalities do not possess enough depth for me to sympathize or believe them to be real people. The heroes are superheroes and the villians are totally evil. That's that. There is no gray area. There are no flaws in the heroes, no good qualities in the villians. The protagonists are all described as good looking, resourceful, intelligent while the villians are the opposite-ugly, stupid,etc. The novels I enjoy the most (and this is just me but maybe you too) have flawed heroes and villians who are not totally evil. It makes for more interesting dynamics between characters, but this is not the case in Rand's novel.I am not going to argue the validity of Rand's philosophy though I have my own opinions. Based solely on the literary merit of the book, I have to say \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is far from a classic."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand's work suffers because she was so full of herself that she refused to let the publisher change a word. Bennet Cerf at Random House knew she was serious, and that they'd lose a ton of money if she took it to somebody else. This is a book badly in need of editing... after while nothing she or anyone says is a surprise. Her attitude that corporations should be free to do whatever they want as long as they make money is horrifying: witness Enron, Microsoft, Big Tobacco, the oil companies.It took her four years to write John Galt's radio address. What a pity. Immediately seeing it for what it was, I just skipped it. She'd said it all before."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is Ayn Rand's &quot;masterpiece,&quot; as they say, and despite the book's popularity with legions of rabid fans, practically all PhDs and literary and social critics of any consequence completely ignore it. Why? Because &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a failure on so many levels, and ultimately has nothing to say that will have any resonance beyond coffee-sipping pseudo-intellectualism. The book appeals to people for a few reasons -- it's long, detailed, and describes an easy-to-understand philosophy that seems tempting on first glance but collapses into callous absurdity under any real scrutiny. All in all, people like this book because it smacks of &quot;classic.&quot; But in fact, its poorly written, narrow, and strikingly cold, filled with a sort of &quot;isn't this so revolutionary?&quot; self-importance that seeks to cover up Rand's complete lack of philosophical skill (her non-fiction books that detail &quot;objectivism&quot; are laughable). You'll never meet any student of literature who worships Ayn Rand as many in the populace do, because once you have even a vague notion of actual &quot;literature&quot; you realize how toe-curlingly awful Rand really is. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is philosophical fast-food, but delivered in such bulk and mock-intellectualism that it manages to dupe many a book-shopper into believing that it has something to say. The pity is that too few leave it on the shelf to seek something more challenging and substantial."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After reading this book I can say it has more pages than it should have.

Really. It is indeed as important in advancing many concepts as its proponents state.But... I have to say the characters themselves are horribly developed and completely unbelievable.

The story of the auto manufacturer alone has really helped to distill the fundamentals of many concepts for me.So as an approachable and important philosophical work, A+.As a fiction novel... maybe C+."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If Atlas Shrugged is made into a movie it should be shot in high contrast black and white. The use of shades, hues and texture would add an aura of reality to the scenes that would render them silly. The setting should be the Gotham City world of a 1950's comic book.Atlas Shrugged seemed like a 1000 page comic book sans pictures. To bad that Ayn Rand couldn't draw since she could have reduced it to the thirty or so pages it deserves by doing it as a comic book. Like a comic book it is a Miracle and Mystery play for the 20th century, simplifying everything into a parable without conflict.It would have been refreshing to have seen a real communist in the mist of one of the scenes. As I pointed out in the first paragraph adding a little bit of the color red would have made the scene look silly. All of the characters were Objectivists probably because Rand can not conceive of anybody except one. Whether a protagonist or an antagonist every character moved only in their self interests. True some of them voice clich&eacute;s but only to provide cover for their selfishness.The self that Ayn Rand understands is one dimensional. I don't think that she can conceive of a self that is more. Consider a self that is part of the human race with its nobility and frailties. Consider a self that is a citizen of a nation based on the values and struggles of its forefathers. Consider a self that is a believer of a religion which gives them answers for the questions that are unanswerable. Consider a self that is part of a family that gives them a continuity of purpose. Consider a self that is a parent which gives them their chance at immortality. All of these selves would be foreign to Any Rand.I see all of those selves existing simultaneously in a person and it often leads to conflict. It is from those conflicts and their resolutions that great novels are born. No such conflict is present here. The characters all proceed in their narrow self interests without any comprehension, much less conflict, with the self as a whole.So why did I subject myself to read it? The answer is that a book allows the reader a glimpse into the mind of the author. In her case so many people seem to be of a like mind that I wanted to understand how they view the world. To that end the book was of use.In the book I found a perfect metaphor for Ayn Rand's philosophy. It was the oak tree that Eddie Willers remembered early in the book. It was the symbol of strength and stability. When it was laid open by a random bolt of lightening it was hollow at the core. That I believe describes Rand's philosophy; hollow at the core."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My advise is to stay away from this paperback edition. I purchased the book new through Amazon. The pages are improperly clipped and ragged on the edges and some of the pages are diagonal. The paper also appears to be the acid type or at least low quality.This is a poor excuse for a bound paperback Centennial edition of such a great author."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is an excellent story, readily adaptable to real-life situations. I strongly identified with several of the characters within the story which at times made the book difficult to put down. This was the first Ayn Rand book I've read but I can't honestly say that I'd ever read another one.Rand seems to have an aversion towards writing as people speak. Significant parts of the book are dedicated towards various soapbox orations by the characters. Real people in the same situation may have a relatively brief conversation that covers all the bases; Rand's characters go on and on (and on and on and on...) covering not only all of the bases but also all of the gridirons, courts, greens, and raceways. It gets monotonous very quickly. You will find yourself skipping ahead several paragraphs (or pages) just to get to the end of an oration which could have been nicely and clearly summarized with significantly less effort. At times this is EXTREMELY painful to wade through. Such attention to detail is better suited towards a technical writer, not to an author of fiction.That said, the story was great but the writing is in serious need of better editing. Rand needs either a severe lesson in the efficiency of brevity, or a new editor that isn't afraid to cut out a few hundred pages of soapbox oration."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged will most powerfully move you if you aren't afraid of being alive."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I just re-read Atlas Shrugged, which gets better each time, and can say with certainty that it is the greatest achievement in history, in part because it provides the fullest identification of what makes all the others possible. It is a hymn to unfettered human intelligence.It is also the most spiritually rich work of literature I have ever read. A lot of people are turning to it now because of its prescience, but its description of political control and economic collapse are not what's most important (Rand herself, far from aiming at being a prophetess, regarded as one of the novel's strengths the fact that it wasn't even particularly realistic but rather her most fully Romantic work). In an interview with the author of one of the recent biographies of Ayn Rand, Jon Stewart winkingly referred to her novels being filled with lots of \\"dirty, dirty sex.\\" Those are, in fact, the best scenes. Francisco and Dagny learning together about the wonderful pleasure their bodies can give them the summer after she begins her first job on the railroad as night operator of the Rockdale station; her affair with Rearden beginning at Ellis Wyatt's house after their first run on the John Galt line; and, of course, the encounter in the underground tunnels of the Taggart terminal...it simply doesn't get any better than that.

The passion of the book and the intrigue are somewhat lacking in this version. The basic plot is there but most of the extras are cut out. I had expected the majority of cutting to be done in the long speeches instead of cutting characters, event and memories, but it still gets the basic pricinciples of the book across. I bought the abridged version instead of the full because of the price, and it will serve its purpose well - which is to get my father, whom I consider to be about as close to Howard Roark as one can get, to listen to the book. Also, since he is going to listen to it on a road trip with my mom and younger brother, it works well that the intimate scenes are cut down (though, I do think my mom would prefer the full version, hopefully it will entice her to read the entire book, or atleast The Fountainhead or We The Living!) If you have read the book and want to refresh yourself on the plot, the abridged version is fine to get, and a lot cheaper too; but if you want to listen to the book, you need to either read it again or fork over $80 for the unabridged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Mr Miller apparently didn't read the book very closely if he thinks the characters would start killing each other off as soon as the book ended. 'I swear by my own life and my love of it, not to live for any man or expect him to live for me'(paraphrase-I don't have the book in front of me). This is the basic principle that Mr Miller claims to have gotten a headaches from his being bombarded with it by Rand. This is the basic moral and ethical code that the entire book is about. This is the basic moral and ethical code that the protagonists of the story all believe wholeheartedly in. It is through this basic platform that we know they will not start killing each other for their 'stuff'. We are left to assume that the world will become 'Galt's Gulch' on a much grander scale.The society she projects at Galt's Gulch and, in turn, the society that we believe the rest of the world will develop into is the exact opposite of the jungle. It is a world where rational self-interest is the guiding philosophy. If you find this 'evil' or anarchistic, think about a world of irrational self-sacraficers.Long story short, this book is not considered realistic because no society has ever reached the point that Rand describes. It is rather the logical extension government planning(statism, communism, socialism; take your pick). It is unrealistic in the sense that no state-planned economy has made it to this point because these governments either collapsed or reformed before they got to this point(or they haven't gotten there yet). The reason is that the everyday people in the real world are not as irrational as those in AS. Some are; most aren't. It is because of this fact that real world governments are unlikely to make it to the point of AS; simply because the people would revolt before that point. Rand simply suspends belief and creates a society where the people don't revolt, but rather allow the government to expand its powers to their logical conclusion.I would recommend this book to anyone who is in favor of government programs such as welfare(including corporate), SS, national healthcare, etc. It will definitely help them to step back and question these beliefs and at least make them think about the consequences."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Simply the best-told story and most enjoyable read I've ever had.

The book starts out with great mystery and human drama of an epic scale and seems to be headed for a 5 star rating, but... halfway through turns into a bizarre sci-fi yarn that is dated, to say the least. I was left pondering many philosophical issues, including the value of a good editor who can trim off long winded self indulgent passages for a more streamlined novel.Having said all that, the book is still quite an achievement and a page-turner for the most part. It's well grounded in the mid-20th century, and is a fine relic of that era."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I figured a short review for a MUST read would be the best:Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged has quite possibly been one of the most influential books in my life. In the book, Rand paints a dark view of the United States, which over a small period of time becomes socialistic/communistic. She shows how without individual initiative and entrepreneurial spirit the world would grind to a halt. In addition Rand effectivly advocates the philosophy of objectivism through the main character Dagny Taggert.The book is truly riveting. There are countless plots and subplots, the characters are all very well developed, and the book espouses a philosophy that more people across the globe should follow.On a personal note I have read this book 6 times, everytime I read it I learn somthing new and it helps develop and add new ideas to my own philosophy. Everyone from age 14 and up should read this book, it is a true classic."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read this novel three times (every word), each read being a few years apart. Yes, I was fully conscious as I molasses-ed my way through every page. (Love gingerbread!)I will read it again whenever I get to the point of needing a total soul recharge (when I've run out of shrimp & peanut butter).Through every reread of this novel it seems to live in my mind on a grander, higher scale.In interviews and in some of her nonfiction books, Rand has said that the purpose of a novel is to entertain, to tell a good story. In ATLAS SHRUGGED she has accomplished this purpose, possibly better than any other novel. I haven't read every other novel; I don't want to read every other novel, so I won't attempt to say or prove this with certainty. I will say with certainty that ATLAS SHRUGGED is not a good story; it's a great story.Reportedly, Rand's intellectual friends were continually asking her to write her ideals into nonfiction (maybe so they could digest them better); yet her soul lived in stories painting the heroic in life. She believed we live in a beneficent universe and that human beings were meant to achieve great joy, and to feel that joy in every moment.In ATLAS SHRUGGED, Rand proceeded to dramatize (not to intellectualize) her concept of why we have thoughtlessly allowed ourselves to pervert this beneficence, and how to get back on track.Many would say that a 50 page speech, given to the world by John Galt over secured radio waves, is more intellectualization than dramatization. I read that clear radio voice as drama perfectly staged within a well executed plot; I saw it as well earned, actually necessitated, by the complex weaving of multiple mysteries building unequivocally to the dramatic enlightenment presented in that speech.The first time I read Atlas, in 1986, it took me a few months to get through it. It had taken me years prior to that to get past the first scenes of Eddie's \\"causeless uneasiness.\\" I would read carefully to the point of him recalling the magnificent oak tree which was rotten inside, and I'd put down the book. Eddie's gestalt was so depressing and confusing, I couldn't push forward, couldn't go beyond this budding and painful awareness in Eddie, a seeding of consciousness which felt as if it had nowhere, no way to blossom.Maybe I sensed the plot would move slowly, complexly, mysteriously, dramatically ... backward ... into the darkest night of the soul of the human race, before it would be ready to lift into any type of healing light.It took me a while, a bit of growing, to be ready for that backwards, downward soul drop.Yet, when Atlas lifted the reader into Galt's Gulch (Mulligan's Valley), I soared.I soared higher than I've been taken by any work of fiction.Is it a great story when an author takes a reader into the bowels of human culture, into the primal, absolute absence of true thought, paints that dank sewer-of-a-world brilliantly with the deepest, richest, most frightening and heart-wrenching color and clarity, then surges the reader suddenly upward on the strongest wings available to an embodied human form? Is that a great story, or what??I'm speaking beyond the airplane ride Dagney piloted to break through to a small setting where a tiny, almost toy-like railroad was a more true-to-life example of that industry than the ugly, gritty, dark world beyond Galt's location.When I say, simply, that there are true CHARACTERS in this book, I might have to set that statement against a contrast which would have to consider that there may be no true characters in any other novel. But, I don't want to say that, exactly. I merely want to exalt as it deserves, Rand's executed skill as a novelist.I love stories. I love characters. I consistently read books I'm able to unfailingly and honestly give 5 Star reviews.But to read ATLAS SHRUGGED is to be temporarily diminished in ability to fully enjoy other novels. This is why I hesitate to read it again right away. The contrast in the depth of characters, the complexity of plot and subplot machinations, the beauty of the mystery which unfolds in pacing so perfect it cannot be called pacing, it must be described as a natural, living sequence of cause and effect, all this honoring of the true form of the story, of a saga, is almost too rich to exist in the same time frame of other examples of human art.Even as I exalt Atlas, however, this time I will be able to return immediately to my culinary cozies and love the heck out of them. Why? That's for me to know and you to find out, if you're interested.For a placement of my customer review of ATLAS SHRUGGED on Amazon.com, I chose the cover of this novel which was taken from a painting by Ayn Rand's husband, Frank O'Connor. He was an artist; he gave a worthy image for his wife's novel. (I also placed a copy of this review here under the edition for which the majority of reviews on this novel have been collecting in brilliant communication.)I do admire and appreciate every artistic version of this book, every exquisite cover presentation; the book's gestalt has the capacity to draw greatness from anyone who attempts to capture any nuance of it. But, I wanted to honor Rand's husband's contribution to her career as a novelist, a contribution which went beyond what most of her readers would be able to imagine. And I love O'Connor's red sun setting, his glowing, straight, steel rails heading toward that day's end. I love the deep greens and iron rust red of the sun ball, and more.I will stand, spine straight as possible with arthritis, and salute Ayn Rand and Frank O'Connor. They lived. They suffered. As all of us, possibly they suffered unnecessarily, as a matter of maturing as a race, as a matter of growing in consciousness about cause and effect. In their art, Ayn and Frank transcended the pain and left us gifted.Live enthralled within this book as a story, as a novel, first. Then begin thinking your own thoughts, making your own living, one you're able to enjoy as who you are, not as Ayn Rand, not as Frank O'Connor. As you. A simple person rich in capacity to enjoy the most basic of moments, to feel the grandness of human life in every breath. Remember the perfect flavor of that cheeseburger Dagney relished in the small diner which almost magically appeared on her hardrock route to nirvana. (And you wonder why I love culinaries?)Maybe that's what Rand wanted to accomplish all along. She wanted to give each of us that unique individual inside, terrified of shining, filled with shame (afraid to eat, even). Maybe she wanted to tell us, no, to show us that we have made no Original Sin. We were born free.Now we must each live free, in our own way. And, to be a hero might not mean to conquer impossible dreams which we honestly don't want to reach. Maybe it means to enjoy each day and do what we can to live as who we are, to know who we are. Inside and out. As unique individuals, each unlike any other, yet coexisting with other individuals who are interesting to know in their variety of faces, not masks.Who is John Galt?Who are you?I know who I am. Sort of. I'm gaining on the concept daily.Rest assured that life was meant to be abundantly benefic, not a pain in the patootie.For attempting to paint this awareness in words and oils, I thank you Ayn Rand and Frank O'Connor. Wherever your souls reside, beyond the graves & crematoriums, live long and prosper,Linda G. Shelnutt"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has changed my aspect of life.Nobody should ever dare to speak about life before reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I couldn't in good faith recommend this book to anyone for casual reading. Rand's belief, that the evolution of a neocortex erased 60 million years of evolution and changed apes into rational machines who's primary function is to think and produce wealth, makes for some real boring and unbelievable characters and some terrible, and I mean terrible, long winded dissertations about how the pursuit of love/sex is the same as the pursuit of money. Meanwhile the novel reads like a bitter woman's revenge at the world as the low self-esteem non-Thinkers of the world split their time between humiliating themselves, dying, and begging for help from the heroes, while Dagny Taggart, heroess and only major female character in the novel, splits her time between refusing to let her railroad die and choosing between the men, including the main hero, that have chosen her to be their only love in their life ever. I'd say more on this, but you have to read it to believe it.Still though ... Rand's ideas about the importance of self-esteem and the (judicious) use of the mind are the core of this novel, if taken way way way way too far. And they are great ideas. This is what most people find influential and memorable about the book. If you're willing to read 1070 pages to get to these points (or you could always just read the chapter &quot;This is John Galt Speaking&quot;), this book is for you.Personally, I fell in love with the book right away, but my interest died at about page 500. Part 3 got me going a little, but my suspension of disbelief had been permanently trashed by a certain monologue which convinced me that Rand was really crazy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I got to hand to the author on how she was able to come up with new words to say the same thing over and over and over and over and over, again.

It was pretty simple to figure out what was gonna happen and who was who."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I was in my twenties (1973) I have read the books of Ayen Rand, awsome and inspriing.

To be honest there were some things in the story that surprised me. I thought that the story would have been a little different.

Ayn Rand's uncanny knowledge of the future of America is amazing considering this was written so many years ago. The sad part is so much of it is all coming true. Who (and where) is John Galt?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand's most outspoken critic, Whittaker Chambers, reviewed Atlas Shrugged in his essay \\"Big Sister Is Watching You,\\" calling the novel primitive, and suggesting that Rand's work calls on its readers to head for the gas chamber. Needless to say, many critics have praised her work than those condemning it. Yet, aside from the character development, and the introduction of a new, brave philosophy delivered through a quasi-populist approach of a novel, rather than the ivory tower of the philosphy graduate seminar, Chambers ignores the true importance of this work. He concedes that it draws on Aristotle and Nietzsche, embracing feminism, as other critics have observed. The greater point here is that it turns a business person into a hero.This novel is more important today than it has ever been because we are living in a time when being successful is becoming somehow shameful. We seem to recognize people for \\"giving back\\" as opposed to just giving (and as opposed to accumulating wealth. This is a dangerous path for those of us who study history. Atlas Shrugged is a must re-read!Yuri Vanetik"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One of the best books of all time ... I didn't want it to end. Though I admit, \\"reading\\" this thousand plus page book would have been a challenge, listening to the unabridged recording was fantastic. It took some time importing the 50 cds to mp3 format, but well worth it! Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I loved the vast majority of this book...sometimes the repetitiveness was a bit much; however, the plot is so incredibly good, I was compelled to continue. It is on just about everyone's \\"books you should read\\" list. But 1168 pages can be a bit daunting and since it isn't light reading you have to pay attention, it isn't a quick read even if you're a speed reader like me.Written in 1956 and published in 1957, it's an especially good book to read right now in 2009/2010. The plot is original: what happens when a free society loses its freedom due to government controls which are prejudiced against businesses and the men and women who create jobs causing the inventors and risk-takers to go on strike.Ayn Rand, the writer, must have been brilliant! She crafts a complex message creating a story to drive home her philosophy. She writes about economics, personal responsibility, not blaming failures on others, the virtue of working hard & being productive. It reinforced my own sense usefulness and productivity as a business owner and employer in a fast-paced industry. Rand writes in detail about a variety of industries such as: railroad, coal, steel, oil, ore, etc. Her research must have been incredibly time consuming, and she did so without the aid of a search engine! Boy am I glad those days are behind us :)I don't agree with all of the messages in her story, I for one would hate to think of a world without selflessness. Nevertheless, this book is well-written, has wonderfully developed characters, an original plot that keeps you plowing through all 1168 pages, and it makes you stop and think about your beliefs on personal responsibility. And its a good illustration of the consequences of an anti-business government...are we paying attention to the potential lessons learned from this book? I guess we'll see soon enough. - Todd Fleischman"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Bought Atlas Shrugged in the audio version. I was amazed at the similarity's with the countrys present situation even though more than 40 years have passed since this book was written. Found a movie documentary at Netflix that contained interviews with Ayn Rand, helped explain how she came to write about John Galt and company. Superb book, five stars from me!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book will tell you what happens.I started reading this because I was inspired by some of Rand's essays. I continued to read it because I was so excited by what she was writing. Never have I read a _novel_ with the kind of real world quality that this has. Not only does she keep everything realistic and believable, her language and ideas are very accessible.In this book, Rand exposes so many of the things that rely on morality. Morality is like plumbing, we don't think about it until it's broken. What Rand is trying to do is show us that our plumbing (collectively) is broken.As a whole, our moral code is not something that we consciously contemplate (well, not everyone), but we must. Following the plumbing analogy: Do you think about what you flush down the toilet? Pour down the kitchen sink drain? Why would it be any less important to ponder the results of choices in other aspects of our lives?Writ large is what happens when we consciously decide to stop thinking about the \\"Why?\\", in regards to actions and motives. People live and die by the choices they make, and, as Rand illustrates, even more die by other people's choices. What's wrong with this picture? These people don't have to die! They're dying because the choices holding their lives in jeopardy are being relegated to the least competent people.Rand may be labeled as \\"cold\\", \\"cruel\\", \\"vicious\\", and \\"in-human\\", but we would live in a truly dark world if that were the way we felt about all the people who give 100% with the expectation of a reward worth exactly as much, nothing more. Rand isn't telling us to revolt, she's telling us to demand what is rightfully ours: pride! Pride is the recognition that the products of your labor are valuable, that YOU are valuable. Anyone who tells you to work twice as hard so they can eat is taking food from your mouth. What Rand doesn't do is call this what it really is, slavery.In the end, the biggest messages that Rand is sending is that selfishness IS NOT a crime, excellence IS NOT a crime, pride IS NOT a crime. The world relies on you, but the world doesn't care about you, YOU must. Rand doesn't hate the working class, she says that the greatest to be expected of anyone is for them to do the best that they can, nothing less will suffice, even if the best they can offer is their labor. BUT, only if you are furthering your own interests, anything else is coercion."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I will be brief; I will not go over ground already covered by so many others. Atlas Shrugged is one of the very most important books anyone in the current age could read. It's only a shame Ayn didn't live long enough to see the ultraliberal excesses and wrong-headedness of the Obama administration, because then she would truly have known how astonishingly prophetic her writings were. In an age that finds itself in delusional paroxysms of retreat from the whole notion of personal responsibility, we need Ayn Rand's clarity of vision. My only regret is that I didn't read this myself many years ago. But better late than never; this is a work that can change your life. READ Atlas Shrugged!! And re-read it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Could have been written about the times we live in. It sums up many issues occurring in todays liberal swing of the pendulum, where there seems to be more and more people wanting a free ride on the cart and fewer and fewer left to pull it. This book shows what could or maybe should happen when too many parasites (moochers and looters) feed off the work of others.This book was written by from the heroins perspective and not surprisingly, a little verbose for my taste. I found myself speed reading through some parts while re-reading others several times over because of their clarity, insight and applicability to todays world. I would very much like to have known the author, brilliant read!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is outstanding. I read it, just to see what all the fuss was about, and I fell in love with it. There were parts that were a bit dry, and a few things that need to be viewed in a historical perspective, but I just couldn't put the book down. I don't agree with all of Rand's philosophy, nor its application in the book, but as a novel, this is an excellent work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's writing style is overtly feminine and long winded, which I hate. But the strong character and moral progressions makes the book a fascinating classic.

Heroes! Like Tolkien's larger-than-life heroes that never take \\"No!\\" for an answer and always fight for the good, no matter how great the odds against them.But Atlas Shrugged does something that no fantasy novel does. Atlas Shrugged is about heroes that don't have magical powers. And they don't live in a fantastic world. No! They are just like you and me... or rather, just like you and me MIGHT and OUGHT to be.Atlas Shrugged will play on your emotions the way your favorite music can, or your favorite painting. If you want to be in love, you will feel the grandeur of that emotion. If you want to admire intelligence, creativity and ability, you will walk alongside people who will make you wish you could jump into a story the way you pass through a door into a magnificent cathedral.So why is Atlas Shrugged the most influential book after the bible? Because as Atlas Shrugged shows you a world of heroes and all that man can and should be, the story will hold up a mirror to your own mind and heart. It will give you the intellectual tools to shape yourself into one of these heroes.You've heard it said (in inspirational quotes) that each life is a hero's journey. If you are ready to forget what other people told you and to start your thought process with a blank slate, then Atlas Shrugged will show you (not lecture you) a way to live your life like the heroes of great stories; a way to make your life really count; a way to find happiness, purpose and meaning in your place on earth.It's a tall order, and there's only one book ever written that delivers a pro-life philosophy for man, here and now. And that book is Atlas Shrugged. But if you have the pure mind that can delve into this book and discover its wonder, you will never be the same again. You will start your journey on the road to becoming a self-made hero.It's not always an easy road to travel. But no other road will ever compare.

So, what might happen when personal initiative is reduced and excellence is redefined, made a slave to serve the lowest common denominator? Atlas Shrugged is the story of what happens when all the best minds refuse to play the game we call social engineering and feel good politics today. I found in the pages of this book a creative release for emotions shared by many envied and misunderstood people, those who are the engines of a productive world. I purchased a dozen hard bound copies over the years and gave them to a few of my friends, entreprenueurs and leaders who are fighting to create and realize their visions.

Because that's what AS is about, isn't it? Black and white. The truth is, this book is the embodiment of her philosophy &quot;Objectivism&quot;, and great for those readers who otherwise wouldn't read philosophy and are kind of wandering around dissatisfied and trying to put their finger on *why*.It's a great read. Yes, the heroes and villians are both exaggerated caricatures of good and evil. The good has no evil and the evil has no good. The charity cases deserve nothing. But if you don't take the characters too literally, understand that they just illustrate the two extremes, and that the vast majority of people will fall in the middle somewhere, there's a great book in there for you.I'm a little confused about the &quot;changed my life&quot; aspect of some reviews, how some readers use this book as a template of how to live their lives. Isn't that exactly what Ayn Rand described the gullible public as doing? Just listening to what someone tells you to think and taking it on as your own personal philosophy? How can one espouse free thinking if they say &quot;I read this book about free thinking and it changed my life and now I want to live *exactly* as Ayn Rand says is the ideal. Because the heroes work hard and think freely and the others whine and snivel. And I have to choose sides so I choose the good one.&quot; But how can you be a free thinker because you follow Ayn Rand's thinking to the letter? hmmmm... (does this call to mind The Gallant Gallstone for any of you Fountainhead readers?)But if this book makes people want to go out and work as hard as they can, achieve and produce, (and it does), more power to it!! And the philosophy that you should be proud of your achievements and expect compensation for them is right on. And let's face it, this book is illustrative of the horrid mess our health care system has gotten into. There are certainly worse philosophies for people to take literally and try to live by.I enjoyed this book a lot. I found a lot to bring away from it, but I wouldn't get too carried away. Stop and think for yourself a few times along the way, and yes, skim the Galt radio speech, it's the philosophy over and OVER and over and kind of like a Cliff's Notes for the philosophy in general.I recommend this book because it apparently has the power to make a great cross section of the population think, and that's an accomplishment.

Her fictional account of John Galt, an epitomized version of the perfect genius/capitalist, and her endearing, realistic, powerful and intelligent heroine (four adjectives in a rare combination in American fiction) would make this book captivating and a true must-read if she were not so intent on converting all of her readers to Objectivism.

That's for me to know and you to find out, if you're interested.For a placement of my customer review of ATLAS SHRUGGED on Amazon.com, I chose the cover of this novel which was taken from a painting by Ayn Rand's husband, Frank O'Conner. He was an artist; he gave a worthy image for his wife's novel.I admire and appreciate every artistic version of this book, every exquisite cover presentation; the book's gestalt has the capacity to draw greatness from anyone who attempts to capture any nuance of it. But, I wanted to honor Rand's husband's contribution to her career as a novelist, a contribution which went beyond what most of her readers would be able to imagine. And I love O'Conner's red sun setting, his glowing, straight steel rails heading toward that day's end. I love the deep greens and iron-rust-red of the sun ball, and more.I will stand, spine straight as possible with arthritis, and salute Ayn Rand and Frank O'Conner. They lived. They suffered. As all of us, possibly they suffered unnecessarily, as a matter of maturing as a race, as a matter of growing in consciousness about cause and effect. In their art, Ayn and Frank transcended the pain and left us gifted.Live enthralled within this book as a story, as a novel, first. Then begin thinking your own thoughts, making your own living, one you're able to enjoy as who you are, not as Ayn Rand, not as Frank O'conner. As you. A simple person rich in capacity to enjoy the most basic of moments, to feel the grandness of human life in every breath.Remember the perfect flavor of that cheeseburger Dagney relished in the small diner which almost magically appeared on her hardrock route to nirvana. (And you wonder why I love culinaries?)Maybe that's what Rand wanted to accomplish all along. She wanted to give each of us that unique individual inside, terrified of shining, filled with shame (afraid to eat, even). Maybe she wanted to tell us, no, to show us that we have made no Original Sin. We were born free.Now we must each live free, in our own way. And, to be a hero might not mean to conquer impossible dreams which we honestly don't want to reach. Maybe it means to enjoy each day and do what we can to live as who we are, to know who we are. Inside and out. As unique individuals, each unlike any other, yet coexisting with other individuals who are interesting to know in their variety of faces, not masks.Who is John Galt?Who are YOU?I know who I am. Sort of. I'm gaining on the concept daily.Rest assured that life was meant to be abundantly benefic, not a pain in the patootie.For attempting to paint this awareness in words and oils, I thank you Ayn Rand and Frank O'Conner. Wherever you are (somewhat against your precepts, I believe your consciousness still exists), \\"live long and prosper,\\"Linda G.

But allow me to try to surprise you a little...Atlas Shrugged may or may not be a good novel--opinions vary on this, and I can't guarantee how you'll feel when done. You may hate it.The philosophy presented in Atlas Shrugged, Objectivism, may or may not be correct--again, opinions vary, and wildly, and violently. You may decide it is the devil's philosophy.However you ultimately stand on these two issues, and no matter how your friends/family may feel about Atlas Shrugged, and regardless of what the other reviewers say, you owe it to yourself to give this book a read.Yeah, I know, it's LONG. True. But it's also very important, and very powerful. It was written decades ago, and seems to draw a new review about every third day. Think about that. I believe that we all owe it to ourselves to confront the big questions of our times, and also to hear out the differing answers that people have to offer. With Atlas Shrugged, and in Rand's larger work, she offers some answers to the main questions of our day that you simply will not get anyplace else. Some people, not all of them stupid, even believe that these answers are right. I would recommend Atlas Shrugged just as I would recommend that people read those that disagree with Rand, and then: decide for yourself. When you're done, and if you've understood, you'll realize that Rand herself wouldn't have had it any other way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a compelling novel that parallels a likely reality, unless individuals, particularly entrepreneurs, unleash their potential. And, it was once cited as the \\"second most influential book for Americans today\\" after the Bible, according to a joint survey conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club.Ayn Rand tells an astounding story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world -- and did. Throughout her novel she tells a story not about the murder of a man's body, but about the murder and rebirth of man's spirit.America is becoming complacent about its economic engine and is allowing, through non-production and over-consumption, itself to be overtaken by once lessor nations.While it is a novel, Atlas Shrugged provides a vast amount of information on how \\"producers\\" create the world we live in. Throughout history it has been entrepreneurs who transformed our world from mere existence to modern luxuries. Through human thought; scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs unleash human greatness thereby raising mankind's standards of living exponentially.It is the quest for money that drives entrepreneurs toward achieving greatness. According to John Galt (leading character) Capitalism, is \\"mutual trade to mutual advantage.\\"One of my favorite quotes from Atlas Shrugged is: \\"Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper's bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another-their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.\\" --Ayn RandThis is definitely a novel for those truly seeking greatness.Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is about people who love to think and create useful ideas and processes. They decide to go on strike because they are tired of being used and attacked for being alive. Moochers, thieves, governments, and other looters go crazy and lose out in this story.Prior to reading this book the first time (I've re-read some passage 2,3 or more times), I had always found myself with few people worthy of my full friendship and value. After reading this a couple of years ago, I finally knew what kind of people I prefer to deal with. This is not some book that will do anything to you at all. It may spark your mind or piss you off. Had I read this in middle school or high school, it would have little effect on me. Of hundreds of books read, this one made the biggest influence (that includes the Bible).To not deal with heroes of the story allowing contradictions, was great. You will most likely enjoy this book if you have problems with any of the following: welfare, taxes, loss of freedom, increased powers of police, increased power of government, democracy (U.S. is NOT a democracy), helping the needy, liberalism, use of force (not in defense), non-thinkers, the U.N., censorship, liberal arts, cultural supremecy, and those that say there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.If you hate rich people, businesses, those that disrespect nature, and hate people that are greedy. If you think we should all love and/or serve others, repent, follow a higher power, give more to the &quot;unfortunate&quot;. If you are any of those just mentioned, don't waste your money, you will hate it. Don't buy it because it will make your brain hurt.This book helped me realize a couple of important things: I have a right be happy. I have a purpose. I will pursue my goals and dreams to make as much money as I can earn from my ability. I am, therefore I think.

As long as you accept that, you will use reason to find out that taxes are destroying our smartest, richest people. If we keep taking their money, they will build an invisible force field in Colorado and hide behind it in a meritocratic utopia while the rest of the world is destroyed.First, the good:I loved this book when I first read it while on summer break from college. Atlas Shrugged is usually criticized as humorless, but I thought it was brutally sardonic and hilarious. The showdown between \\"good philosophy\\" and \\"bad philosophy\\" was like watching Mike Tyson beat up Pee Wee Herman. A total strawman, but I was laughing out loud each chapter. Plus it gave me a different perspective than those \\"liberal\\" professors and students, and it felt good to be unique. I'm also thankful to this book (as well as a business professor) for giving me confidence to start my own business during my junior year, which has grown into something I love and run to this day.Now, the bad:I recently tried reading it again, but couldn't get past the 3rd chapter. The characters are flat (in the literary sense), her few ideas are repeated ad nauseam, and worst of all, it's no longer funny to me.As for the \\"philosophy\\", psychology, ethics, politics, etc. espoused by Rand - I can't pinpoint one thing that made me toss aside most of her ideas (or Nietzsche's ideas), but coming from a family of scientists, I'm unable to ignore data and statistics. Year by year I came across studies and events, none of them supporting my beliefs. For example, social mobility by country, the effects of welfare on poverty, global warming, Greenspan's admission to the house committee, charter school performance, living conditions in FTZ's (free-trade zones), etc.Looking back, and considering some of her plainly outlandish claims like the \\"objectivity\\" of art (impressionism is evil!), or the immorality of lesbians (a=a will lead you to this conclusion), I realized that I'd been reading works by someone with a serious disorder.I leave you with a quote from Ayn Rand's diary,\\"...the amazing picture of a man with no regard whatsoever for all that a society holds sacred, and with a consciousness all his own. A man who really stands alone, in action and in soul... Other people do not exist for him, and he does not see why they should. [He was] a brilliant, unusual, exceptional boy, shimmering with immense, explicit egotism.\\"Who was she writing about, Roark? Galt? Neither, it was her real-life hero: serial killer William Edward Hickman, who had just raped and dismembered a 12 year old girl. He mocked the girl's father by sending the child back home, minus her internal organs and limbs.Rand had one regret about the murderer, \\"A strong man can eventually trample society under his feet. That boy [Hickman] was not strong enough.\\"Ayn Rand, like the killer she idealized, was mentally ill."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is considered the second most influential book (The Bible is #1) because it delves deeply into the on-going struggle between producers and parasites, the power creators vs. the power grabbers, and the 'feelers' vs. the 'thinkers'.If you want to understand what is going on in America right now, and do something about it before we are destroyed from the inside, read ATLAS SHRUGGED and put what you learn to work in the next election."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is right-on...

Rand was a polarizing figure as well. When the book is kept in context it is a great work of fiction.

It does start out a little slow at first with a lot of background on the main characters but it builds the story up and them(the characters) more personal and easy to relate to. Once you get to the heart of the book you will really feel like you are there and you will not want to leave. This book does change your perspective of thinking after reading it, I know it did for me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"While the book will take most readers more than a weekend to read, it would be wrong to judge a book by its size (anymore than it's cover), unless we are prepared to condemn the Bible for its lack of brevity.Readers of Rand's Atlas Shrugged may be interested in viewing old video clips of Ayn Rand on Youtube, including an interesting interview by Mike Wallace.While I came away appreciating Rand's literary skills, I'm perplexed by her conflating of religion and faith with throttling man's ambitions. I consider myself a follower of Von Mises and Friedman, and I question the depth of her contempt for organized religion, which is the bedrock of reason and purpose, industriousness, trade, individual and property rights. Her belief that faith is contrary to reason ignores thousands of years of scholarly opinion that finds faith and reason quite compatible, for science cannot prove first causes, lest it become a religion unto itself. It is unclear what set of moral standards Rand is preaching here: will to power, according to Nietzsche, needed a new religion and I don't see one offered here by Rand.Rand's book contains some glaring contradictions. For example, Reardon's divorce from his wife, on a crude, material level, is akin to a breach of contract, which he never would have done (unless forced) to a supplier or customer. If Reardon didn't intend to remain with his wife, then forming the marriage contract was bad faith. Rand alludes to lack of consideration as grounds for a divorce, but courts look to whether consideration existed at the inception of a contract, not after one party claims they received less than expected.Rand mocks the argument that humans are inherently evil. If they are not evil on some level, then perhaps she could explain the blackmail, extortion, blame, corruption and contemptible wickedness of her characters played as the \\"looters\\". Human nature created the system of dependency and malaise she scorns, but she fails to explain why we should continue to put our faith in human reason alone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When I was in high school, I was a far-left liberal, believing that people were entitled to anything they wanted. But always in the back of my mind there was something that wasn't quite right with this philosophy, yet I could never pinpoint the incorrect premise in my head. Then a customer of mine gave me this book, and I couldn't put it down once I started reading. It has absolutely changed my life and opened my eyes to the false logic I've been using all my life. I put a lot of time and energy into my work and my projects, and nobody deserves to profit from that but me and me alone. It's not right that millions of people indirectly get my money through collection of taxes and fees which are redistributed through ridiculous programs such as welfare. If everyone in this country started following Rand's philosophy, this country would be in a much better state than it is now. Sadly we're letting it slip away and fall to the level of all the other communist and fascist countries in the world (and the numerous countries which are quickly moving toward those states).This book has made my life goal to make a difference in the world. I hope to stop the motor of the world, just as John Galt did."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is truly a masterpiece. What more can be said about Atlas Shrugged that has not already been said? The book itself is hard to describe and takes a little while to get into, but I promise that it is worth it. I've never seen such a brilliant weaving of a philosophy into a novel. Rand will make you think and challenge many of your assumptions about the world. Even if you're on the left wing side of things, if you read this book with an open mind, it'll make you think. Although Rand's philosophy was a bit extreme to me and I don't agree with all of it, Atlas Shrugged is still one of the most inspiring works I've ever read. It will inspire you to strive for excellence and at the same time lay out why socialism/communism will always fail. As a side note--Hugo Chavez's fate is spelled out in the book and he doesn't even know it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"True students of philosophy and readers of fiction will enjoy this book.Some of the character's speeches are a bit windy,but tolerable.There are plenty of subplots to keep the pages turning.The best thing about Ayn Rand and Atlas shrugged in short is that her belief system..known as \\"Objectivism\\" highlights and defines it's opposite \\"Subjectivism\\".By defining out Subjectivism,the Subs are forced to defend their position like any other school of thought and are unable to simply foist themselves as The Standard Of Rational Ethics.That's why Ayn Rand gets short-changed in the Recognition Dept.Her staking out of Objectivism automatically labels the opposite as Subjective.And they don't like that label at all.Fountainhead is another must read although that Dominique can turn even a strong stomach like mine sometimes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Like \\"War and Peace\\", or \\"Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\\"; this is one of those really long books that all \\"big-time readers\\" should tackle at least once in their lifetimes.While there are some overly long-winded and boring parts - most notably Galt's speech near the end of the book - the book manages to keep ones interest, and there are some decently exciting moments... and I got a laugh out of Francisco's hurried response to the Guard's question; \\"What's your business?\\" - \\"Copper Mining!\\".If you are really left-leaning, you will probably find this book insulting, as the government and anti-business types are made to look like dopes, weasels, and/or out-right thieves.In any event, the basic premise of the book (of looters, moochers, and beggars taking advantage of the producers) has merit, and there were many instances when I was made to think about real-life analogies.You know, I'm willing to bet that Ronald Reagan read and enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a great book, but by no means perfect. Most of the reviews draw it in black and white (which would probably have appealed to Ms Rand) but both are wrong. Both are wrong as most of the reviews are so ideological that those that favor her ignore her faults and those that hate her ignore her virtues.Her virtues include much much better writeing then most of her detractors give her credit for (simple crap like each white hat good, admirable, etc has his polar opposite who is shifty evil ect, Check out Stadler v. Akston) or the idea that her heros are all handsome viral etc v evil, ugly villians (tall handsome aristocratic James Taggart), that no one develops ( the \\"wet nurse, Dagny, Hank ( more than anyone), and to many others to mention), better stucture than average ( rising tension ) the aforrmentinoed character changes as plot points ), and some subtle and humorous lines ( Gualt telling Dagny not to look back at New York ( lest she be turned to a pillar of salt.)However, the problems with Ms Rands philosophy are identical to the problems in Marx. Both presuppose a change in human character ( Marx at least admits this). That illusive \\"true\\" communism requires a fundamental change in human nature so that man will help his fellow man and take his pleasure in that. This would do away with the best argument against communism, the coersive nature of it. Unfortuantly Rand also has an overly idealistic view of capitalists, that they only want what they fairly earn. For Rands hero's there would be no deception, no excuses, and no taking of (unfair) advantae. If Dagny ran your cable company the cable guy would show up when he was scheduled to or she would make it right and he would be out of his job. Alas, real capitaliara take advantage not only of stock holders but they also sell penis enlarging herbs to morons. Both ideal capitalism and ideal communism require a change in basic human nature.Of course a furthur problem with Ms Rand's philosophy that was not obvious during her writing years ( as a novelist not a polemisist) was the idea that some things, under any system, are held in common. Air for example, as we can not devide it up, we all have an equal interest in it. That is to say, we all own it. Hence Dagny's cost of doing bussiness, if she is as fair, just ect, as Rand makes out, would include compensating me, and averyone else on earth for the loss ( suppose we set the rate low, say one ten-thousandth of a cent to each person per train run, today that would be about six thousand dollars a train.) If I have to choose between capitalsim and communism in the current state, I choose capitalism. Without the change in human nature required for \\"true\\" communism, capitalism is the champion of rights, justice ect. Unfortunatly, without the change in human nature required for Rand's idealized capitalism, (ethics, universal reason, etc), it seams that the best bet is still a mixed economy. ( don't think I am being simplistic, I could expound on this ( both sides ) for ten times the amount of space available here ).I admit however, on reading Marx I laughed and thought what a pipe dream, people like that, where as with Rand I was wistful and whished the world was what she thought.There are some other thigs to keep in mind while reading this for the sake of a deeper understanding. Her slavish devotion to Nietzsche early on (We The Living), her attempt to break with him(The Fountainhead), and her failure in that regard (Atlas Shrugged), I think she deomonstarted fairly well that her stolen philsopophy is the ideal for the individual but at least more questionable for a society. Keep in mind to that great products ( the products of great men? ) are of great benifit to society as a whole, (maybe). For example a graet word processing program that costs you two hours worth of salery may save you an hundered hours of work ( over time) what do you do with those hundered hours? Spend it with your family? or do more work.Read this as a well written example of loyalty to an ideal, just question that ideal as you go."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was pretty skeptical about this novel when I first flipped through it. If it was so great, why hadn't it won any prizes or anything? Reflecting back now, I realize what a silly way that is to measure a book. If there was ever was an author that deserved the Nobel Prize in Literature--it's Ayn Rand, for the masterpiece created in Atlas Shrugged.Atlas Shrugged begins with the question, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot; Dagny Taggart, the &quot;real&quot; president of Taggart Transcontinental (but hiding under the name of &quot;Operating Vice President&quot;) runs her railroad inpeccably. Taggart Transcontintal is truly the best railroad in America, running from coast to coast.Slowly, things begin to change. Her power-thirsty (but not money-thirsty! No! He's there to serve the public welfare. It's all about the people!)brother Jim Taggart (&amp; Co.) slowly begin to destroy the nation's economy as they rasp and yell about &quot;public welfare!&quot; and &quot;the triumph of the little man!&quot; Taggart and his friends tie the noose around what is left of America. One by one, the great industrialists drop out, leaving no trace behind. The newspapers scream of the victory of the poor people--ah, what horrible greedy people they were! The nation sinks into a huge economic problem. People starve. Huger riots continue. Gangs of 'looters' raze the country, burning houses and taking all that is left.The book is haunted with eternal questions that linger: Who are the real producers? Who are the looters? Who is John Galt?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's jerky literary style is a touch hard-edged. It doesn't have the poetic flow of a Kerouac or Hemingway. The dialogue is not witty and the characters are just a touch wooden.However, the story is beautiful. It teaches one to rise from the pool of mediocrity that is failure. The plot is one of triumph over tragedy and victory over bleeding heart drama. The book also makes an almost unarguable case for capitalism. We watch the decay of our country as the government grips tighter to save our society, only to see it slip through their fingers like sand.The book is a necessity for all those who treasure the freedom that most have taken for granted, the freedom to think. Though not exactly a piece of art, Atlas Shrugged is a manifesto for the true intellectual, teaching that each and every person should build their lives in pride, disregarding forces that would rob them of their free will.There are points in which Ayn Rand has flung aside some necessary rubbish of humanity. Spirituality for instance. Her very own characters are an argument for the importance of faith in dire situations, such as the hobo that jumps her train. He has criss-crossed America working in one closing factory after another, and he has hit the end. The man has no where to go and nothing to live for. Here is where he should put his trust in himself, faith in his ability to survive, in the very wilderness if he must. I suggest reading \\"The Cliff Walk\\" for more thoughts on this.Also, though only briefly addressed in Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand downplays the importance of raw human emotion in art, but I say what is the point, for then you've removed humanity from the humanities."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a 1000+ page book largely devoted to convincing the reader that Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism elevates humans to the highest level of existance.The major flaw of this book is that it takes place in a fairy-tale world that purposely ignores any real-world dynamics (and personal emotions) which would reflect poorly on her ideas.Said another way, her ideas are not tested fairly in this book. It is a systematic propagation of her ideas using 1-dimensional characters to support her viewpoint.This is the definition of propaganda.I give it 3 stars because I do believe it is an important work if nothing else but for the discussions it evokes.However, I feel this could have been a much more compelling novel had Ayn Rand defended her philosophy against a more intelligent set of arguments, rather than hitting the reader over the head repeatedly with concocted situations that shows why capitalism and trickle-down economics are superior to socialistic ideas.I would have enjoyed seeing her ideas more fully challenged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The overall plot of this book is good, and there is a lot of analysis here about what it means, but this novel could be cut by about a third and still make all its points. There are just too many rants for be to get this 5 starts."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I cannot add anything to what others have said about \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" However, I was a bit dismayed with this particular edition and the tiny typeface used.It's a great book, but the tiny type is annoying."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"From a different, country, a different time---she lived a full life then died before I was born... deja vu...I think this is the most moving and important book I've ever read... perhaps the real story of Armageddon."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Despite the ramblings of those who are hostile to Ayn Rand, and her passionate defense of human liberty, the fundamental issues she addresses are not that difficult to understand.Do you believe that your life should be the property of others, to be disposed of as they see fit, or not? Ayn Rand took the stand that your life belongs to you, to be lived as you see fit.Critics of Ayn Rand must agree, at least to some extent, with folks like Adolph Hitler (and his beneficent National Socialist party) that the individual should be considered the property of others (in this case, the state). These people really should think more carefully about the company they keep, at least on an intellectual level. But, then, what's a \\"little\\" slavery?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I approached this book nervously, as i have watched many people be effected by it in questionable ways, and also have heard it quoted in contexts that i now believe to be not entirely...valid.Ayn Rand saw things in black and white, which is i suppose necessary if one wants to state things didactically. That being said, her world is not the real world, not the way things are. Unfortunately life isnt black and white, and the self made man doesnt exist in quite the way she leads one to believe, at least not in this day and age. I have heard it said that much of our culture has been influencenced by Any Rand and i suppose i can see that but i believe that if our current corprate and governmental state is partially modeled after her philosophy it has been grossly missused. She was not a fan of the man who makes his money by being born into a wealthy family, gains his power by being the progeny of a powerful man. That form of familial preferance, not having to work for ones success, or working by bribe and compramise was something she put in the \\"socialist\\" catagory.That little personal rant being out of the way, the story...Ayn Rands writing is similar to that of a good dime novel. it's fairly addictive, very predictable and packed with ideas, some of which are very interesting. The first 900 or so pages are very hooking. the life force of the world, the business men, the industrialist, the people who make things run, are mysteriously vanishing to a destroyer that nobody can see or find. Mrs. Rands characters are a little two dementional, Dagny Tagart being a very thinly veiled version of i think mrs. rand herself, with most of the male characters of substance in love with her. Mrs. Tagart is highly idealistic, ambitious, and efficiant, also apparently very good in bed. The Hero, John Galt (Mrs. Rands \\"perfect man\\") I found to be very arrogant adn obnoxious. Hank Reardon also was less than appealing, although his family was so ourtrageously obnoxious and \\"socialist\\" as to be very comical. The Pirate, who's name i'll never be able to spell, and Fransico d'Anconia, the copper tycoon, playboy/aristocrat, are, however, very intruiging. Mrs. Rand gives both of them some very intersting speeches. d'Anconia's speech on the nature of sex i found especially interesting.i read the reveiw of Atlas Shrugged that said John Galt gives a 50 page speech on the evils of \\"socialism\\", and i wanted to correct that, it is, in fact, exactly 60 pages. And i have to agree with that reviewer, that speech is definately overkill. The ending is rather a letdown in my oppinoin. Very anticlimactic and unrealistic, although by the end she has definately made her point. On the whole it's not the best piece of fiction i've read, although it is very interesting philosophy and definatly a classic that demands reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is by far the greatest book I have read.

I purchased the &quot;hardcover&quot; version only to receive a small paperback version glued in a hard cover. I was expecting higher quality paper and larger print normally associated with hardcover editions, but this was literally the same paperback version that's in my local library, but with a hard cover. It's outrageous to call that a &quot;hardcover&quot; in my opinion. If you're looking for a traditional hardcover edition, don't bother with this one, unless you want to spend $3.99 in return shipping for the pleasure of seeing the worst &quot;hardcover&quot; ever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I recieved this book from my mentor as a high school graduation present. Since then, I have read it about 5 times (my graduation was about 2 years ago) and each time, I pick up small details that I have not noticed before. Rand's use of metaphors is absolutely brilliant. A perfect unity of physics and philosophy (okay, philosophy more so than physics), it explains the relationship between work and money as being in ideal balance when following the three laws of thermodynamics. A must-read for the modern intellectual."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A is A. If your like me, your at this point going, well that's nice, i think i could have figure that out for myself, well could you?We live in a world where feelings over power logic, we live in a world of glorified medocrity, and we live in a world where our \\"greatest minds\\" question whether or not they exist. Everyday, someone somwhere is jumping of a building thinking, what's the point of all this? Why did i bother to get up this morning....I've been that person. I didn't try jumping off a building, but from personal experience there's many other ways of trying to end your life. Reading this book was like a slap in the face. It was someone screaming at me: \\"What are you thinking?! of course there's a reason to live, are you perfect?\\"There's so many messages conveyed in this book, almost all of which i agree with. One of the main ideas is that there is always going to be something left to do in this world, you just have to do it. There is always a manner in which you can make things better, more efficient, more profitable, happier. You are never going to run out of things to do, unless you let someone else do them for you, which by the way, leads me to another of \\"messages\\".You don't rely on other people. We can all sit around on our asses, lamenting our world, or we can go out and be sucessful. We can beg from the people around us, be looters, or we can try and make the money, honestly, for ourselves. We are taught from a very early age to \\"feel sorry\\" for those less, fortunate and to \\"give\\" to them. Our society endorses pity towards those who've made mistakes: Achoholics Anonymous, Drug Rehab, Anger managment. To quote directly, we have no pity for the pain of the innocent. We give millions each year to people through welfare, what are we doing? We're making them dependent on doing nothing, we're encouraging a world in which people settle for relying totally on others and never making progress of their own.Yet another message adressed at great length in the book is the fundamental merit of capitalism. In the dog eat dog world of business, there is no \\"but that's not fair, he has more then i do!\\" Ayn Rand asks you to think, for a second, what the world would be like if every man aimed to have a monopoly, and did it honestly. People would constantly be forced to improve their product, and hence there would be constant progress. Even should one person gain completel control of ann industry, it would not render the rest of that world jobless, because no man can operate a whole enterprise by himself. He needs the men turning the bellows, sitting at the desk, or choosing a spot to drill. There is always a place for others expertise, and they will continue to profit from his need of their help.A last thing that Ayn Rand point out is our societies disturbing tendency to worship the medicore. No body wants to see someone better then they are, but Atlas Shrugged asks: why? Can we not appreciate that someone has more talent or innovation than we do. Something to think about...So, there we go with a few paragraph explanation of an over 1000 page book. Saying that i suggest you read it is an understatment. At risk of sounding corny, this book changed my life. While it showed me many of the harsh realities and the worship the underserving in this world, it showed me that until this world is perfect, there is no reason not to be in it...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The author (Ayn Rand) makes a case for the value of individual responsibility and rewards, but it's got serious holes.For instance:1. She would have us believe that all needy people are lazy leeches and communists. This simply isn't true. Our outcomes do not always reward our effort. Some people are hit by tragedy and we should feel some obligation to help them in a way that gets them back to self-reliance as quickly as possible.2. Her \\"ideal\\" world would ensure every act, down to the smallest gesture of kindness, is financially rewarded. Research shows, however, that people will often work harder and more joyously when working under a \\"social contract\\" rather than a \\"business contract\\". Her world would be stiff and dark.I do believe we would be better to move closer toward her view of government's role, but she goes much too far. We do have too many ill-advised government handout programs, which often do more to undermine the self-reliance of the recipients. She, unfortunately, doesn't provide a viable alternative in this book.It's too bad she took such an un-nuanced approach because, philosophically, I think she's in a better space than today's public-pandering politicians."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Great book for today. Glad I heard someone speaking about the book. It's just amazing it was written 50 yrs ago. Glad I decided to buy and read it.Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book should be required reading to excite discussions about the mystery of what it is to be human on Earth. I first read it as a teenager in about 1969, and it has always impacted my point of view. Here's how...I deplore people when they are opportunistic: freeloaders, copycats, swindlers, cheaters, lazy people, etc (I think of them as bloodsuckers/leeches). Rand's book depicts a world where these sorts of people control and destroy by their demanding drain on those who DO. Rich or Poor, you'll find them everywhere and they destroy trust and compassion.That said, I believe giving people a helping hand is a good thing, but when people DEMAND/EXPECT it, then they fall into the leech category.The world is not so black & white as Ms Rand portrays. When a society becomes imbalanced - like a poker game or monopoly - those who are winning might need to let go of some of their resources (ie $$$) to keep the game going - not half, but SOME of it. If not, the \\"game\\" ends - at some point those who have won just about everything become THE PROBLEM. So this is where I depart from Rand's world created in Atlas Shrugged (nuances are not clearly addressed).Rand herself escaped from a Communist society which explains why she feels so strongly about her point of view. Yet what caused the Communist \\"experiment\\"? A peasant uprising where people had been basically slaves to an elite aristocracy - not much of a middle class.The world certainly needs to heed Rand's advice about the leeches who demand, while keeping in mind that extreme imbalances between the haves and the have-nots must be addressed. It's the world's challenge - to find that balance.Ayn Rand's envisioned world is stark, and there's no Utopia to escape to where people promise to take care of themselves. She certainly would adhere to the \\"you reep what you sow\\" belief, but still, isn't there ever to be redemption?What about a very creative & successful person who leavse his/her money to their progeny who never did a thing to earn the money and may be the very kind of people she warns us about in her novel? Aren't THEY leeches?It's a conundrum, and I'm grateful to Rand for her point of view, but she doesn't address HOW to really live in the world. To adhere completely to her philosophy leaves a hole for those who fit in the gray area of special circumstances (victims of leeches or sociopaths and truly do need help even though you shouldn't have fallen in their traps). I'd never be truly happy believing that there are starkly two kinds of people - those who EARN their own way, and those who don't. Sometimes people give, and sometimes they take. Ultimately we're all dependent upon each other to some extent in our pursuit of liberty and happiness. YES, one needs to carry his/her own weight. The Conservative movement doesn't often address personal freedoms. Like why can't someone in pain be able to have marijuana if it helps relieve? or Why can't homosexual couples, who usually are great contributors, be able commit to marriage? (and other personal freedoms that don't impinge on others' rights & safety).Rand's observations are important as we all figure out how to find balance between compassion, dependency and personal freedom. Yet she abandons in the search for truly complete answers. I pay my taxes, some of it is wasted and some of it makes things better. I don't EXPECT anything from anyone, but I know if I were drowning and no one helped me even if they could, I'd feel betrayed believing they should help me as I'd do the same if they needed the help.\\"It's all an enigma wrapped up in a mystery.\\" Thanks to Ms. Rand for opening the discussion, but her ideas are a springboard, not an end all, be all. Do your best to make your own way, but rely on others when you REALLY REALLY need it to get back on your feet."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As many a reviewer has observed, Atlas Shrugged has an extremely black-and-white quality; either you are an embodiment of highest virtues or you are unredeemably evil. There is no middle ground. All the characters in this book are as if they had come from some sort of a Baroque opera. No doubt, Atlas Shrugged would have benefited, if it had had a better editor.Like Albert Einstein the physicist (and the philosopher), Ayn Rand has an absolute belief in the law of causality. I cannot help but wonder what her views on quantum mechanics and Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle were.Notwithstanding these flaws, the book makes many a good point:- Reason is the main epistemological tool of acquiring knowledge about reality. Thinking and rational mind are what separate us most clearly from other animals.- Do not apologize for your virtues.- Altruisms, when forced upon by the State, is a grave sin.- Mankind makes quantum leaps forward by brilliant and free individual minds.- In its core, capitalism is a system of individualism, thus inherently capable of making quantum leaps forward (in science, innovation, etc).- Communism, or any collectivism for that matter, cannot work, not even in theory. Enforced socialism is to be opposed. (Ayn Rand's views on socialism and capitalism were probably influenced by Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A. Hayek).I find it rather fitting that exactly 50 years after Atlas Shrugged was published (1957), the Nobel Prize in economics (2007) was awarded to Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Myerson for their work on mechanism design, which deals with the problem of arranging \\"our economics interactions so that, when everyone behaves in a self-interested matter, the results is something we all like.\\" Since the 18th century, we know (thanks to Adam Smith and Adam Ferguson) that the pursuit of self-interest is not a zero-sum game.The book is worth the reading effort. It will induce you to think about the nature of humanity, the perils of far-left egalitarianism, and what the struggle for happiness is all about (needless to say, Ayn Rand was no closet Aristotelian)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's seminal work laid the logical and philosopical foundation for the virtues of unfettered free market capitalism. In her book, the Atlas(s) of the world are capitalist who create and produce. A group of such individuals decide that they have had their fill of intrusive government regulation and decide to \\"go on strike\\", hence, Atlas Shrugged. (Atlas as you may recall from myth, held the Universe on his shoulders). By doing so, they plan to bring the world economy to a standstill. Her enthusiastic championship of individual liberty and economic freedom and her lampooning of big government and intellectual sophistry gave rise to the Libertarian movement in America. She was shunned by the American conservative movement because of her insistance that all virtue and values must be rational individual choices, rather than dictated by religion or tradition. The irrefutable logic of her argument alarmed conservatives because it marginalized their religious and social conservative constitutents. One of the longest books in the English language and worth it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I listened to the audio book version of this book. I tried to read it right after reading the \\"Fountainhead,\\" and it was too much. Some years past, and I got a version of it at work and gave it another go.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was not as good as the \\"Fountainhead,\\" that's why I gave this book four stars. I felt this book bounced around more than the \\"Fountainhead,\\" and was not as concise.What I did like about this book, over the \\"Fountainhead,\\" is that it deals with the entire country, not just New York. It also makes the move from the artist (Howard Roark) to the businessman (Dagny Taggart, Hank Rearden, and John Galt?).This book deals with larger social and political issues that seem to have come to pass. Or maybe it just seems that way after you read (or listen) to this book, and in reality things are the same as they have always been.To me that is the importance of this book. It gives you the ability to see those things in the world that you could not define before. It also puts you on a different plane of have read \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" instead of, have not read \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" This becomes important when in discussion with other people about politics in general."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'll start with the negative. Yes, this book is a bit lengthy. Yes, Ayn Rand's smug tone can be grating at times. And yes, the characters are all drawn in unrealistic shades of black and white. BUT, this does not make it a bad or irrelevant book. There is much truth and insight here, and I think the best way to view it is as an allegory in which Rand sets up her characters and their actions as symbolic of different traits of humanity as a whole. She uses this contrived world to study the motivations behind different modes of human behavior, and I think she arrives at some very insightful conclusions. This book will make you think hard and question much conventional wisdom about work, love, religion, and morality. Even if you don't agree with any of it, it will stimulate your mind and help you clarify your values.On a literary level, despite the flaws mentioned above, I think this is Ayn Rand's greatest work. It's a surprising brisk read for its 1200 pages. The plot moves pretty fast and Rand's dynamic writing style keeps it from ever getting dull. The characters are memorable and I found myself growing quite attached to them over the course of the novel. Dagny is a great heroine, a vast improvement over the obnoxious Dominique from The Fountainhead. Hank Rearden is probably the character who is easiest to identify with, the man whose sense of justice blinds him to the advantage others are taking of him. Fransisco is a bit annoying but he becomes more human and likeable towards the end.I won't say much more, don't want to give away too much. But I highly recommend this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book can be best described as thought provoking with more stress on the provoking. It will question beliefs you have held unquestionably throghout your life. Somehow, you face up to the fact that you possess at least some of the qualities of the less flattering characters. And it can really change your way of thinking.Having said all that however, the book is monotonous and repetitive in places not to say HUGE! The portions where she attempts to describe love making had me in splits- she seemed to have a thing for BDSM but it was awkward at best. And the world she describes is truly utopian and for that reason best left unattainable- it is just her vision of perfectness just as each person will have his or her own. Anyway, give it a shot- for rainy Sunday afternoons ( just hope that you live in a rainy area though !)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I can honestly say that this is the best book that I've ever read, and I have read quite a few.

I'm unsure as to whether they feel threatened by the ideas it presents, or just can't comprehend them, or what.The fact is that this is an excellent story. It was captivating, and despite its length very easy to read. The ideas in it also inspired thought like no other book I've ever read. I wish that this had been one of the books that was given to me by a teacher in school at one time or another.If I were going to be stranded on a desert island and could only bring one book with me - this would be the one.

Rand), I tend to take her writings more on a personal level.Unlike others, I found no difficulty in reading through the 1,000 pages. And unlike the others, I actually enjoyed the 60-page John Galt speech in the end. I didn't find it repetitive.On the flip side, I did find a few scenes to be \\"wooden\\" and unbelievable (i.e. a couple of the love scenes, and a portion of John Galt's personality). I chalked this up to being a book written in the 50's (re: language used).

As a high school student, this novel opened my mind and my eyes, and it is still fresh today. Entertaining and a classic."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is without a doubt one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. However, what I find in many of the reviews of this work is a sense of its impractibility, it's preaching of a world in which men must be completely alone, being hated and hating everyone around them. One has to keep in mind that objectivism is one philosophy, not necessarily the singular way of life. Are there people in the world like Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggart? Yes, of course, but does that mean that everyone who wishes to be successful must emmulate their actions as well?One thing that Ayn Rand does so well to demonstrate her philosophy is to place it in a context with which we are familiar, one to which we can relate and in which we can picture ourselves. Her characters serve only to demonstrate a point. Despite the fact that they are perfect examples of men in an Ayn Rand society, they may not be precice examples for us to follow. Rand uses abstract characters, people that are the extremes of a single viewpoint in the world, and their ideas are not necessarily the ideal - or even attainable - ideas for us to follow in our lives.The people who say that objectivism has ruined their lives may lay claim to the fact that they viewed life exactly as a Howard Roark or a John Galt might view it, but did they ask themselves why? Are there really such people as Ellsworth Toohey, or Wesley Mouch for them to oppose? Objectivism is just a philosophy. Its ideas are those which Rand would like us to consider, and her books are the stages through which she presents her ideas. She does not necessarily wish everyone on earth to become her characters, but to merely keep in mind some of her feelings toward life. After all, it's only her view, so take it or leave it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've just finished reading Atlas Shrugged and would like to make a few observations for those thinking about reading it. First, you must make a commitment within yourself in order to finish this book. It is very intellectually stimulating and not for those who have a short attention span. This book requires you to think as you read. In fact, I suggest you reread certain sections in order to comprehend even a partial amount of the ideas Rand is trying to espouse (especially Galt's speech). Second, don't expect to read this book over a weekend or a few days. Most people will need weeks to read and understand it. And third, all politically conscious people who consider themselves liberal should read this book. If you're still liberal after reading this, you really haven't understood the essence of the novel. Atlas Shrugged should be required reading for all journalists. Either that or a &quot;liberal&quot; exposure to Rush Limbaugh might make the national media a little more palatable. finally, if someone recommends that you read this book, do so, but have the guts to finish what you start. I also recommend Rand's &quot;We the Living&quot;, for a good insight into her motivations."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"All right, so I get the philosophy.

I mean, I got the message fairly early on; it didn't need to be repeated over and over and over and over and over.... and over and over again. I'm fine with the cartoonish generalizations -- the fat, sleezy and lazy; the beautiful, smart and hardworking -- I mean, it was overdone but whatever.With regard to the length of the book: it was wholly unnecessary. More specifically, it wasn't the number of pages in the book, but the number of pages versus the number of new or expanding plot lines, ideas or original thoughts.

I bought \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" to take on a cruise, and our lives changed!This is the best book I have ever read, it was moving and really made you root for the characters, really made you feel for those who strive for the best, and really hate those hangers on!

After reading it however, it all fell into place. The book is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Even though I feel there are some slight flaws within objectivism, the book is still definitely worth reading.The idea of having a philisophical utopia if everyone just acts in an individualistic, egoist way is quite absurd however. For one, you can never achieve this, and secondly people are not created equal. Some people are geniuses, while other are illiterate. Having an entire individualistic society would require that everyone can live as an individual, which is not so. If objectivism is to be viewed as black and white as Rand wishes us to, then we should not help the elderly or starving unless we have something personal to gain from it.Even though the book is long, I find the characters extremity intruiging as well as the story. Even though the philosophy reaches the extremes and sometimes goes over, it is definitely worth the read. Keep an open mind and read it as a story instead of trying to agree or disagree with everything on the way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is about living your life to the best of your ability and respecting that effort in others. A college professor once told my class that \\"everything you do has your name on it; reflects your values, your self respect - if you do a shoddy job that's how you value yourself and how others will value you. Do everything as best you can.\\"That's what this book is about: values, respect, worth, work, effort, doing your best and therefore making a contribution. And what is against is having no values, no respect for yourself or others, making no effort - i.e., becoming a parasite living off the efforts and work of others.This is the philosophy behind the story that includes mystery, suspense - everything for a good novel.It is not written for the MTV/CNN generation that needs everything in 30 second sound-bytes; but certainly should be read by them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, it is a long book. Yes, its characters are one-dimensional. And yes \\"Christian moral values (or pick any religion, except maybe Scientology), are in complete opposition to the ideals of Objectivism\\".That's the point. Atlas was written to be a definitive defense of the individual. Its length is necessary because it must address and refute all the arguments that have, for millennia, need used to convince individuals that acting in their own best interest is immoral, sinful and evil.As to the one-dimensional characters, the fact is that there are two kinds or people: those who are capable and willing of living for themselves (and neither need or want to be served) and those who are not (and for whom service is a life and death proposition).To make this point, Ms. Rand's \\"good people\\" seek to create something of value and then, in a fair trade, exchange it for something of value produced by someone else. Her \\"bad people\\" are either not willing or not able to produce anything anyone else would want, and so must rely on other charity (in the best case) or forced servitude (in the worst). Her point is thus that in charity or servitude there is always a winner and a looser: one who gives and one who takes. In fair trade, winners and losers cannot exist because each side receives something he or she values at least as highly (probably more) that what he or she has given up (which is, BTW, the basis for a free-market economy).Or, this is what it would be like if every person fully reasoned through his or her own actions and motivations. Most people, however, do not. The fact is that most people living on this planet are confused. They seek hold two mutually exclusive views (such as: I must be charitable and give the beggar my last crust of bread, but if I do I'm going to starve) at the same time. In other words, the average person is not simple, the way Ayn Rand paints people, he or she is \\"complex\\".Complex people always see an inherent conflict in everything they and they go through life feeling guilty about wanting to eat the bread themselves. But, that's the point. Guilt is a powerful tool for convincing an individual to act against his or her own best interest and those that benefit from these actions are past masters at getting people to feel guilty. Obviously, this leads to the last point.Objectivism is inconsistent with Christian moral values and the moral values of any organized religion. The simply fact is that you cannot believe in God and be an objectivist at the same time. This presents no problem to the atheists of the world. It's the rest that have trouble understanding Ayn Rand.The point of this review is that, if you are committed to some \\"selfless\\" philosophy (be it Platonic, Christian, communist or whatever), you are not ready for Atlas Shrugged. At best, the book will disappoint you and, at worst, leave you without a value system. It will not, however, change you mind. Irrational beliefs, by their nature, cannot be overcome with rational arguments.If, on the other hand, you find that the meaning of life as taught in Sunday school, sociology class and most economic text books doesn't seem to make sense, you may be ready for Atlas Shrugged. If, on the other hand, you a looking for a philosophy that will justify your desire to place your own self-interest on a higher plane than the self-interest of every other human being, you are also looking in the wrong place. If there is any central premise to Atlas Shrugged it is that while each individual has the right to promote his or her self-interest, he or she cannot do so at the expense of any other individual.From a practical perspective, one should never start with Atlas Shrugged anyway. Atlas Shrugged is a continuation of Fountainhead and simply asks \\"what would happen to organized society if altruism won\\"? As such, it is very much a (negative) utopia much like George Orwell's 1984. It presents a horrific worst case scenario of what would happen if individuals surrendered that which make them individuals: their individuality.If you do decide to take the plunge, be prepared to disagree with most people, even those who claim to be objectivists. For example, not long ago, I talked with a person who claimed to be a member of an \\"Ayn Rand society\\", who acknowledged that the government does have some legitimate role in society (to provide a common defense, police force and justice system) but who thought that the cost (paid in taxes) should only be borne by wealthy businessmen (who benefit from the system) and not the average person (for whom taxes should be voluntary). Some people's desire to live on someone else's dime is so strong, that they will go to any length to justify it.And finally some good news, it you do read Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and understand what you have read (which you probably will not), you will cease to care what any reviewer, including myself, thinks about these novels, or Ayn Rand, or her philosophy. You will have grown up. You will have learned to own head. Congratulations."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand's satire on the modern regulatory state must rank as one of the best philosophy-as-fiction works ever written. Not beach reading, but deep insight on Adam Smith's invisible hand in a post-industrial context. Almost like the conflict between the Obama administration and the Tea Party."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Who Is John Galt?\\" - the answer lies inside this very thick book, but what a magnificent one - it was very hard for me to stop reading! Ayn Rand thrilling novel covers brilliantly so many aspects which are crucial to mankind: economy, philosophy, sociology, socialism and free-markets. It's a landmark book that could almost serve as a prequel to George Orwell's \\"1984\\" or to Friedrich Hayek's \\"Road To Serfdom\\". Given the trend worldwide for more and more socialism (a concept which, as described in the book, is deeply flawed), I believe that this book is now more actual and needed than ever. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What this book is is almost incommunicable. Obviously not all agree but to some, a certain type of person, this book will mean so much and add so much to their lives. It is hard to define the type of person that this book is for. I only know that I personally have a hard time imagining reading this book with the indifference or sneering hatred seemingly experienced by some. For me it was such a positive emotional experience. If you strive for what you think is right. If you want great moments in your life. If you have ever strived to be good at something you do. If you have ever spent days, weeks, months practicing to achieve some goal or dream. If any of these apply to you or ever did, please, read this book - it could possibly be one of the greatest experiences of your life and best decisions you have made."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is an outstanding work and should be required reading in all high schools and colleges in economics or government courses. The stark delineation between the values of the main camps of characters made it easy to relate to people one would encounter in daily life. It absolutely affirms that exceptionalism is a virtue, not something for which to apologize. Reading through this novel, it was unnerving to see the similarities between the events in the book and the events that are taking place today in the U.S. and the world at large. Several times I put the book down and thought that this could be written about the economy and the socialist path on which the Obama administration has this country. It seems at times that Ayn Rand was writing a prophecy that is unfortunately coming all too true."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A few comments on the book, mostly in response to the negative reviews that have been posted.1) Ayn Rand is clearly not the best writer in the world. Character development and plot within the novel are somewhat lacking.2) Fact (1) above does not take away from the fact that the message is clear and most will find quite enlightening.3) Most negative reviews posted herein appear to be from people who missed the point. COMMMUNIST IDEALS ARE NOT ENVIABLE!!!4) The book is a carefully constructed series of events that could potentially transpire, should society forget (3) above.I found the book to be somewhat long and a bit dry at times as well, but it surely rates five stars for being one of the few pieces of literature that I've come across that makes a clear and well-reasoned anti-socialist argument, and does so without having to resort to a wildly fictional backdrop.For those not familiar with Ayn Rand, I recommend reading Fountainhead first.Cheers,"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged (Signet, 1957)I knew a great deal about Ayn Rand's philosophy long before I first experienced Atlas Shrugged. I read a good deal of her nonfiction in college, and a shorter novel, as well as endless articles about Rand and objectivism. I'm an objectivist myself, in the main, so it seems to me that if there's anyone Atlas Shrugged should appeal to, I'm it. Target audience, full steam ahead. Add to this that after a lot of reflection (and when you're in the middle of Atlas Shrugged, one of the ten longest professionally-published novels native to the English language, believe me, you have a great deal of time for reflection) I understood why Rand chose to keep her characters two-dimensional; paradoxically, it helped me remember who was who. But just because I appreciate something doesn't mean I have to like it.I think anyone who's experienced Atlas Shrugged, even its most ardent defenders, is likely to have remarked at some point that a good editor would've don the book wonders. It could have easily been trimmed to five hundred pages (from its current 1,187) with very little trouble. But length alone is not enough to condemn a book; Stephen King's logorrhea garners sales in the millions, and the books are a great deal of fun to read.Lack of subtlety in one's message is a reason to condemn a book, even when one agrees with the message in question. And yes, I do understand that John Galt's infamous sixty-page speech is a powerful piece of writing. What it is not, however, is something that has any place in a novel. It's as much fun to read, in its context, as the interminable, useless two hundred pages during which the action stops in Moby Dick so Melville can treat us to a treatise on how to kill, skin, and eat a whale. \\"But,\\" the defenders cry, \\"it's all about theme!\\" Yes. That's my point. It's a novel. If you stop the action and address the reader with two hundred (or, in this case, sixty) pages of theme, you're no longer writing a novel, you're dolling up the editorial page and attaching your characters to it. And Galt's speech is, of course, only the culmination of many times-- dozens, at least-- Rand stopped the action, ignored the plot, and allowed her characters free rein to have endless discussions about the finer points of objectivism. All well and good, if you're writing a treatise on objectivism. But this is supposed to be a novel-- with well-drawn characters, a gripping plot, that sort of thing. Atlas Shrugged is not. It's the similarly execrable La Bas for a more enlightened crowd. It doesn't matter how much I agree with Rand's philosophy, or how much I enjoy her novels when they clock in at under half a million words. This is a book that almost demands you to read an abridged version. **"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It amazes me that it took me so long to discover Ayn Rand and her phenomenal works. No one ever mentioned her in school to me, not even in my graduate work for my Ph.D. She seems to be ignored by the academic establishment, yet she is probably the most powerful American writer of the twentieth century, and if any novel deserves the title of The Great American Novel, it is Atlas Shrugged. Gone With the Wind, Huckleberry Finn, or any other contenders for that title are admirable books that depict an era in American history, but they are completely lacking in depicting the magnificent ideology that this novel promotes, one that is at the foundation of what America stands for and are in many ways more clearly defined in the pages of Atlas Shrugged than in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Atlas Shrugged should be read by all our politicians and government officials and university leaders. Ayn Rand's novel is a great monument to capitalism, to freedom, to man's right to pursue happiness and knowledge and live without fear. And rather than simply show what is right with capitalism, she depicts what would happen if the capitalist way did not flourish in society.Ayn Rand has been misunderstood by people who have not bothered to know anything about her. I have heard some people think she was a communist because she came from Russia, when in actually she lived through the Russian Revolution and saw the devastating effects it had upon her people, making her all the more embrace democracy and capitalism and come to the United States. It is also said she was an atheist, yet in Atlas Shrugged she makes no comments about the existence of God but simply refutes arguments that man is born in original sin and must give his life to serve others at the expense of his own happiness.In her own words, Ayn Rand states: \\"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\" After reading Atlas Shrugged, I am convinced by this argument. I wonder what kind of a travesty it is that she is not read in the high schools and universities of America; despite this, her books sell hundreds of thousands of copies each year, a quarter century after her death. If you want a book you can't put down (it's over one thousand pages yet I read it in five days over a vacation), read this novel. If you want to understand what America is and can be, read this novel. If you want to know that your life is of value, and you have the right to pursue your own happiness, read this novel. Atlas Shrugged is one of those very rare books that change lives because Rand poured her life and thought into writing it, and after half a century it is as monumental and relevant as ever.- Tyler R. Tichelaar, author of Iron Pioneers and The Queen City, available on Amazon"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having listened to the audio version of Atlas Shrugged, I had the pleasure of hearing the reader's remarkable voice affectations and inflections that helped to paint the characters even more strongly in my mind.For me, the story took some time to develop, mostly because there is so much mystery involved. Also, with such a long book, there are numerous characters. Some are presented in such inauspicious ways that belie their prominence. There would often be something that made me wonder if I should pay more attention to a character for the role that they would continue to play. I didn't always know the answer, but the intrigue was always enormous.Due to the extreme nature of which Ayn Rand presents the opposing characters, which she calls looters, it is hard not to espouse at least portions of her philosophy of objectivism.In my opinion, the story climaxed when Dagne crashed into the valley. The world wind of activities that preceded it, and everything from that point on was spellbinding. This is a great book, and seems like it would have made a good movie too."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am not a fan of Ayn Rand anymore, but this is the first book I read of hers; and I have to say that this is one of the few 1,000+ page books that really got me hooked. She's not a great fiction writer. All her heroes are mouthpieces for her philosophy, e. g., they're all atheists who love cigarettes and violent sex; and none of them have any children. Despite the fact that she was a self-proclaimed \\"right-wing extremist,\\" Rand didn't think much of the traditional family. And all the bad guys are collectivist straw men--something like Al Franken or Michael Moore without a sense of humor. And the story's quite hokey, right up to the sci-fi ending.Where she shines is in her ability to tell an interesting story while pushing a dubious, though seductive, philosophy. Rand--as she expresses herself through her four principal characters--comes across as magnificently arrogant. It is clear from this book and all Rand's subsequent non-fiction (she wrote no more fiction after Atlas Shrugged) that she was absolutely certain that she possessed the absolute truth about everything she wrote about."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.\\"Thus, the hero of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged chooses sides in an epic struggle for man's soul - not in heaven, but on earth. The central plot of Atlas Shrugged is a mystery story: as Dagny Taggard, a successful railroad executive, watches the entrepreneurs and inventors of her society disappear one by one, she seeks to discover the source of the scourge that is destroying her world. She witnesses the consequences of the ethics of altruism and collectivism as her society descends into socialism, productive men are turned into slaves, and mooching beggars into her masters.Throughout the novel, Ayn Rand presents clear examples of her philosophy in action through strong heroes and treacherous villains who demonstrate the importance of philosophy and the consequences of moral and immoral lives. Her characters ask and answer numerous important questions such as \\"Is reality independent of our minds or is it shaped by them? What is the result of basing our actions on emotions and what happens when we base them on reason? Why are so many successful individuals hated for their success? Should love be free or must it be earned? What is the proper role of government?\\" However, the most influential question Atlas Shrugged answered for me was \\"what kind of life must a man lead to achieve a state of guiltless happiness?\\"The influence of Atlas Shrugged on my life has been so profound that I am still learning new applications of the philosophy Ayn Rand presented every day. This book is for everyone who has ever questioned the ethics of altruism and asked \\"what is the purpose of my life?\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In comparison to the Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged is a considerably better written book. The dialogue is very smooth; the more colourful prose (for most of the time) blends in with the overall prose style, instead of sticking out like a sore thumb; and the background information is integrated with the characters as the book progresses in an almost Point-of-View delivery.At thirty percent longer than the Fountainhead this is long read - about 40 hours to keep up with the necessary detail - but is consistent with the quality of the structural elements of the story, and not overblown as others have suggested. Doubtless it could have been edited down to significantly less, but it didn't really seem necessary, since it all read smoothly, without any distracting slow sections. Some achievement, when most others can't mange this in books at a third of the length.The book's general tone allied to somewhat supercharged and improbably articulate main characters detracts from the book's literary merits. But with Atlas Shrugged as a title, instead of The Strike - as Ayn Rand had originally intended - it's pretty well in keeping. (Ayn Rand didn't figure on titles being too important provided they were consistent with the theme, but The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are more interesting than Mainspring or The Strike). I would have liked to have seen some attention to the naming of products, devices and legislation. Rearden Metal?... The Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog Bill?.... The Ferris Persuader?.... etc.At 55 pages the John Galt speech was long, but not as daunting to get through as I'd expected it to be, which, like the rest of the book, would have needed drastic surgery to make any significant inroads without having to leave anything out. Even so, I'm pretty sure that it could have been reduced - with care - to about two thirds of its length.Because the speech is so long and intense it's like a conclusion to the book, but not, leaving the remaining 100 pages rather anticlimactic for a goodly proportion. This quality was amplified by some very weak writing with respect to the characters of Mr Thomson, and his cohorts, who came across too feebly; the attempt by Dr Stadler to take over Project X; and the rescuing of John Galt from the Institute of Science was so poorly and schematically executed, it was laughable, made more so by Dagny shooting a guard dead because his refusal to back down was the behaviour of less than an unthinking animal ( spot of elitism there, I thought). The post-speech section also, just about, cleared up a logical niggle about John Galt and Dagny Taggart:After discovering the motor at the Starnes' Twentieth Century Motor Company, Dagny engages experts to find out how it might have worked. But getting nowhere fast, she approaches Dr Stadler to seek his help. Stadler refuses and cites his reasons and mentions his disappointment over three brilliant students he once taught. Dagny doesn't ask who these three were, and so doesn't discover that they were John Galt, Francisco d' Anconia, and Ragnar Danneskjold. She finds this out, much later, from Hugh Akston. So the point is... she could have made more rapid progress with the motor, and someone outside the chosen few knew who John Galt was. A problem such as this occurred in The Fountainhead where Dominique didn't wonder why and question Howard Roark about why he knew so much about marble, when he was working on her damaged fireplace, and saved herself a lot of wonderment.It's as if Ayn Rand is selective about the logic she cares to attend to. This is also an issue regarding the philosophy of her books, which I agree with, but her philosophy is backed up by a tightly controlled paradigm. Any xyz-ism can be defended by the specifics chosen and how they are articulated. But that's another can of worms.Anyway... I grasped the book in my hands. I opened it. I read it - and I liked it!(And, by the way, there were no rape scenes in The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I normally read things from science fiction, or things from the current era we live in. Just recently I saw &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; being voted as one of the best books of the 20th century and decided to read it. I could not put it down. It did take me forever to read (being that I do have a job and a life), but I was really able to get into it over the summer when I went on vacation for two weeks. It just kept getting more and more interesting. This story has it all: Adultery, sex, family quarrels, competition, and, of course, the steel industry. And once someone has read this book, they'll forever know who John Galt really is. This is the only Ayn Rand book I have read so far, but I intend to read the rest of her works later on. She may have written few novels, but she knew what she was writing. She had a gift for writing. If there's a book you're really looking for to read out there, this is the one I recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand weaves a tale in which good and evil is based solely around the work ethic. In Rand's world, all of the great and powerful capitalists are self made men and women constantly being undermined by government regulations implemented only by those lethargic individuals that want an unfair advantage in the marketplace. There is no doubt Rand is a philosophic genius, and it is important to remember that she mentored (in some cases personally) some of the greatest financial minds of our day.However, Rand never looks at the other side of the equation. To read Rand, on would believe that great wealth automatically imbues one with a great morality - her capitalists never seek to pollute the environment for financial gain, they never deceive the consumer about product content, or possible injury form a products use, they never purposefully create monopolies, using financial muscle to drive up prices or bury competitors.If only that it were true that wealth induces such morality and self control, what a wonderful world it would be. But we live in a world that not so long ago produced robber barons bent on burying the very type of people Rand champions, and thus great capitalists require great scrutiny, and Rand's folktale remains but a pretty dream."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book should be a mandatory reading requirement for all.

It is not for the weak or timid. If this is you, please refrain from reading this book. Proceed at your own risk.I had previously read Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" so I had an idea of what to expect from her works. I went in with high expectations and she completely over exceeded them. Her game is on a whole another level. Although \\"The Fountainhead\\" is an awesome book, a game changer in it's own right, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is far superior and deeper. This book is over 1,000 pages and took me four months to finish; and I was cheating by listening to the audiobook.The main thing to take away from \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a philosophical understanding of morality and reason. That is the whole essence of the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A daunting challenge for any reader but Atlas Shrugged is a must read for businessmen, capitalists, and those who think for themselves. Atlas has shaped my views on business, politics, and society. In a nutshell, the novel is about those who \\"do\\" and those who live off the coat tails of the achiever. What if the achievers, the business owners, those who move society forward, went on strike??? What if they walked away? What if those who make the motor run decided to stop? What would society do? Simply, it would implode.The achiever, the entrepreneur, have made America what it is - the land of opportunity. The one place or idea envied by the world. We were made great by great men and their vision. What if these men ceased to give society their effort? What if government, thru regulation, taxation and restrictions, forced them to give up? Atlas defines the struggle of capitalism vs socialism. For ideas vs regulations. For free markets vs restricted markets. But in the form of a fictional story.Because I can, and do, think for myself, I do not buy into all of Ayn Rand's philosphy. Her beliefs regarding religion are interesting but at some level disturbing. However, her philosophy that each person must think for themself and achieve success on their own is a lesson for all ages.Atlas is a 1,200 page lesson. Read it over a few months. At the end you should appreciate success, the American spirit, and feel a great sense of accomplishment."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What happens when Atlas, the guy that is holding up the earth (the innovators, the risk takers), just says, \\"To hell with this.\\" and shrugs?This book is as important today as when it was written.I have bought copies for all of our kids and all their friends."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In the dank cell of mindless philosophy. This is Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. A luminously rational philosophy in the guise of fiction. A philosophy which *can* be applied in real life. A philosophy which does not deny the existance of reason (wow thats a first) Something that does not speculate on implausible points that have nothing to do with real life. Something that can hold your attention for more than five pages (beat that Aquinas)In short, some get it and some dont. Some read the book for the philosophy. Some read it for the story, and get no more out of it than a yarn about a bunch of reclusive business executives (and may their God help them) Some dont see the point, say the philosophy cant be applied, and go back to the Bible. But for those who can comprehend, Ayn Rand is a shining beacon lighting the grim night of philosophy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When someone has an idea (say, a plow), they might make a fortune off that idea, but EVERYONE gets the benefit of that idea from then on because it's out there. A &quot;creation&quot; of wealth and a win/win occurs. This is why capitalism, for all it's troubles, works, and efforts to suppress capitalism (ie, the ideas that drive it) such as collectivism, socialism, &quot;all you need is love&quot;, call it what you will, result in disaster as sure as OJ can do more with a buck knife than whittle. If you call the plow guy an &quot;exploiter&quot; and take his money and plow, who will create after that??For bringing both sides of this out very clearly and resoundingly alone, I give Ms. Rand high marks.I also give her high marks for exposing another essential flaw in socialism etc. Separate the wheat from the chaff, and it's chief attraction is getting free work and stuff from people doing better than you. But read the fime print: people worse off than you can also get your work and posessions; and there's always someone worse off.And she should know. She got to watch the folly of plan B up close and personal before she and her family fled Russia. And although simplified somewhat, some of the things her &quot;we just need to regulate the greedy and share the wealth a little more&quot; crowd in her book say and do that bring disaster are eerily like things that often heard today (think California power crisis)I also vouch for her pointing out the eerie similarity between socialism and religion. Both believe we are inherently bad and must be forced to do the right thing (by who? Wouldn't be by the people peddling them, now would it?) I've lived in Ga. and Washington DC. and talked to both Christian right-wingers and uber-liberals. You would be stunned at the similarity between them. It really is high-time to check both their premises.On the downside, anyone who thinks this is a well-written book is sadly mistaken. The book is VERY repetitive so that by page 700 you're going &quot;alright, already, I get your point. Sheesh&quot; A lot of different characters making essentially the same speech. And a lot of &quot;known looks&quot; and &quot;feelings without being named&quot; Less would have been more.The characters are pretty 2-dimensional. The charge that she has an anti-family bias looks pretty true, and she conveniently ducks the issue of familite. In Ms. Rand's world, there is no clear reason for having a child or sacrificing for the child, so what...would the human race die out if it were left up to her??Another question she ducks is what would she have us do? In her book, the only &quot;answer&quot; to mysticism/collectivism turns out to be the fairytale answer her characters take. Nice for Ms. Rand since she gets to end her book finally, but not much in the way of workable ideas for us Eddie Willers of the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Several of the following reviews compare Atlas Shrugged to other novels. Okay, I'll randomly pick a novel too. Lets see, dinosaurs are cool, so how about Jurassic Park?Just imagine, Dr. Ferris, applying non-reasoning scientific methodology, manages to clone several species of dinosaurs. James Taggart, in order get away from his wife, forms a charitable trust, the Central Park Cloning Committee who's laudable goal is to bring dinosaurs to society. Then we have Hank Rearden see, who stymied by those darned socialists, is unable to produce the metal necessary to properly build the tyrannosaur cage. Enter James Taggart who calls his buddy Orren Boyle to make the metal bars instead.Ah, if only this second-rate cage had a first-class electric fence. But no, because the committee doesn't have an atmospheric generator, the fence they manage to build is unreliable.Well you can guess what happens. While John Galt creates a Jurassic petting zoo in his hidden valley, Dagney Taggart must contend with tyrannosaurs interrupting her train schedule.Exploding oil fields and copper mines, phooey! I'm talking marauding dinosaurs baby!If my review seems trivial, take heed. There are others who wish this novel were different in some way too. Others may wish for more rounded characters, less philosophy, or shorter length, but wishing is still wishing. So what if their wishes are more esoteric than dinosaurs?My criticism for the blatant lack of dinosaurs in Atlas Shrugged makes just as much sense as many other ... ... The only difference between those reviews and mine is that not only am I the first who wishes that Ayn Rand included dinosaurs in this work, but I know what I'm asking for."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I know most of you will think I am to young to be reading Atlas Shrugged, but I did.

This book is a diatribe (published in the 1950s) against the Stalinist Soviet Union, despite all the pseudo-political rubbish that people say about it nowadays. That the USA's current government is now doing things that the Soviet Union did a century ago goes to show how ill-educated our population (and politicians in general -- witness George Bush in particular) has become: those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. I read this book without any preconceived notions (I originally avoided it because of all the claptrap said about it these days) -- but, having read it, it is one of the most insightful works of literature I have ever read. Then again, I am wealthy, powerful, and extremely well-educated (though not in the slightest Republican), not one of those average joes that seem to be everywhere in society today, barely able to read or write.

In fact, I think she tells a pretty good story. The thing with Rand is, that she had no subtlety whatsoever. To her, there were no negotiables, everything, and to her that meant EVERYTHING, was black and white. While I certainly believe that there is absolute truth, we humans can't know everything at all times, so in some areas at least, one must realize that different points of view can be as valid as ones own. Rand did not believe this so her writing gets very preachy and heavy handed. However, I think that many of her ideas are like a breath of fresh air in our increasingly socialistic culture. We are fast giving away our individual freedoms and I for one believe that is a tragedy in the making."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A philisophically challenging, life-changing work, Atlas Shrugged seems to elicit polarized responses. I hope the two reviewers below do not deter anyone from reading this book. When you read an idea, and everything within you screams &quot;this is true!&quot; do not let a modern anti-intellectual convince you that it is not. This book is based on individualism, hardly what nazism or communism are based upon (see previous review). It also takes the view that your identity and self-worth are not derived from others but from your own integrity and accomplishment. Sure, work at a soup kitchen if you wish, but don't let that be the definition of your life. This is indeed a book written in the Romantic tradition. It's heroes are idealized versions of what men should be, and it's villains are more blatantly evil than what you encounter every day.

It is at least as important today as it was when it was published in 1957. Altas Shrugged lays out, in the form of a sprawling novel, Rand's philosophy, Objectivism. It has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by Americans as the second most influencial to them, trailing only the Bible.Atlas Shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground, but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society; people who invent, design, build, manufacture, improve and manage. She lays out the a story of a society that resents these people and their wealth despite the fact that they earned it and that they improved everyone's standard of living while they improved their own. Mysteriously, society's producers start vanishing, one at a time until almost none are left. The outcome and the explanation are fun reading while they make an important point.Our society has been wealthy enough for long enough that it is way too easy to take that wealth for granted and forget where it comes from. The decisions we make when we fail to keep in mind the source of the wealth do really have the power to make our standard of living go away. Rand reminds us of this critical, but easily forgotten lesson in an eloquent way.Read it and then tell ten friends to read it too. More of us need to see this side of the story.

The pushing seems to be by conservatives who think it tells a story they would like to believe is really the way people act and think. It's hogwash. This novel has an amateurish plot, little character development. Bulk is not quality."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ATLAS SHRUGGED is undoubtedly an interesting and thought-provoking novel. But unfortunately for Rand and her seemingly deathless (and hydra-headed) Admiration Society, there is more to doing sound philosophy (including political and economic theory) than writing a big long novel and then peppering a series of sloppily-reasoned short essays with quotations from it.The basic problem, of course, is that a novel is _fiction_. The fact that Rand can write a story in which something or other happens is evidence only of the vividness of her imagination, no matter how plausible she makes it sound in the artificial world of her novel. And in this case, the fiction in question is not without deep problems of its own.Other reviewers, including me, have called attention to the fact that Rand basically puts most of the world to death in this grandiose fantasy of hers, ultimately on the \\"argument\\" that some human beings aren't _really_ human after all. And other reviewers, including me, have called attention to the fact that outside of \\"Galt's Gulch,\\" capitalism is _not_ dependent solely on the mighty creative efforts of a handful of geniuses but primarily on a vast network of cooperating human beings, pretty much any two or three of whom working together could out-survive a lone John Galt who is wholly dependent on his own resources.The free market _does_ (sometimes) reward (some types of) genius, of course, but primarily it rewards the willingness to engage in peaceful commerce even with relative strangers and the ability to provide those strangers with stuff they want in exchange for stuff they're willing to part with. A supergenius who was, like Howard Roark, \\"born without the ability to consider other people\\" would find himself either undergoing a serious attitude adjustment or else starving to death while he tried to find \\"other people\\" willing to let him exercise his sublime and incomparable genius on _their_ construction projects. (And we might well wonder how someone described in such clearly narcissistic terms could design buildings suitable for human habitation at all, let alone as wonderfully adapted to their occupants' needs as Rand says Roark's buildings are.)And just for fun, I'll add that a real-life Dagny Taggart would be damned lucky if she didn't get pregnant several times during the course of her bedroom escapades with metallurgist/adulterer Hank Rearden while she lived out Rand's ideal of \\"romantic love.\\" (I hope Rand herself was so lucky. But in light of her ill-reasoned views on abortion, one has to wonder.) She'd be even luckier if a man who was willing to cheat on his wife was also willing to support any children he happened to father in the process. (But on Rand Planet, it's Dagny who tosses Hank over for John Galt. And guess what: Hank doesn't mind. Don't try this at home.)At any rate, Rand's tendentious fiction is hardly within tomato-tossing distance of the real free market or its genuinely philosophical defenses. Rand's bizarre and ultimately subjectivist ethic doesn't even permit us to say that, ceteris paribus, it would be _good_ if everyone had sufficient food, housing, medical care, and so forth; that, on her terms, would be \\"intrinsicism.\\"The fact that capitalism accomplishes these aims in as economically efficient a manner as will ever be possible on earth, and that it does so without violating the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness of the people who do the accomplishing, is not a fact one will learn from Rand. Oh, she mentions it once in a while, but she can't present any sound arguments for it -- and, really, she doesn't even think it's all that important.She acknowledges that there are ultimately no actual _conflicts_ of interest among \\"rational\\" people, but that our interests are, or can be, positively _coherent_ seems to have escaped her altogether. This latter is one of those facts that falls by the wayside owing to her impoverished view of \\"reason\\" -- which, on her kindergarten-level understanding, is satisfied by merely \\"noncontradictory identification.\\" (Strictly construed, this view should have committed her to some form of logical atomism. Be that is it may, no intelligence worthy of the name is satisfied by the sheer absence of contradiction.)For the arguments that Rand couldn't be bothered to offer, one has to go to a _real_ economist like Ludwig von Mises -- who, despite his high volume of scholarly output, didn't write even one single novel during his entire career. And what a tremendous loss that is -- not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I get it - you had to wrap your philosphy in a novel so the unwashed masses would pay attention to itI get it - you had to repeat your theme of individualism over and over, ad nauseum because we non-prime movers are kinda slowI get it - in order to create a world of black and white, there was no place for characters who possessed both logic and compassionI get it - either you are brilliant and numero uno in your field, otherwise your opinion and aspirations are irrelevantI get it - allowing anyone to edit one iota of your musings would have detracted from the absolute genius of the end productI get it - use of comprehensible sentence structure is optional when a character is perched on a particularly lofty soapboxI get it - you write suspenseful passages whose outcomes are usually telegraphed a mile away over Taggert Transcontinental wiresI get it - you create worlds where people are incapable of conversing in a free and easy manner, rather they can only whine or letureI get it - your philosophy is ceratinly noteworthy, your prose is notI get it - and could have got it in about 500 less pages"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not an easy book to read, but well worth the effort.

We were about 25 to 30 people who read the book over that period of time and we met for a two hour discussion each week. We all found the book to be a little different from what we expected, and I think we mostly left feeling it was not appropriate for our current national situation. I added my own review to one of my blogs which is here for anyone who might be interested in that. [...]It begins . . .At least that was my opinion after reading \\"his\\" defining speech. Or perhaps that speech was written for him by an angry woman who had a lot of scores to settle. It had to be someone who hated religion, labor unions, the arts, universities, scientists, college professors, people with problems, politicians and governments in general. Also, the writer of that speech had to be someone who was ineffective in control of his or her own world and life.She has a way of expressing feeling by combining a few words that collide like cymbals and create volumes of meaning and expression that shimmer and shine and stay with you as you read on. These marvelous gems are scattered throughout her book and often they jump up and try to grab you when you are being carried along by a free-fall of some of her other descriptive adventures. She also had several passages in which she writes very powerfully of great events taking place that seem too big to actually happen, then they happen, and then they get worse and then - then it gets really bad. There are at least six of these episodes that stand out.There are no management principles depicted anywhere in the book. If you can find even one, let me know. Everything that is done is just \\"done\\", often by Herculean effort by one of the gods. There is great work going in in several places but then it later turns out that there was really nothing there - and nobody knew it! There is apparently no education system in place anywhere. College is constantly dismissed as an evil and useless thing: \\". . . those modern college-infected parasites . . .\\" (Universal Reference .56584). People are not learning anything unless they teach it to themselves, or perhaps already know it. There are universities, but the education of masses is not addressed. The American public seems huddled in groups like lobotomized sheep, moaning \\" I don't know\\", \\"It's not my job\\", \\"I can't help it\\", and so onIn the early 1950s, university and government researchers were finding that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer. Obviously the characters in this book just Shrugged that information off their backs. Ayn Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 and died of heart failure in 1982, even though \\"Dr Hendricks had developed a method to end brain strokes and high blood pressure\\" (Pg. 703 UR.63288) . She actually smoked her last cigarette in 1974, but her book \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" still continues today to send the message to generation after generation of young people that smoking cigarettes is OK, maybe even good for you, and certainly a sign that you are sophisticated and \\"understand\\". When Ayn Rand died she was receiving Social Security and Medicare under the name \\"Ann O\\"Conner\\".\\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and \\"Love me Tender\\" were already best sellers before this book was published in 1957. This was twelve years after the first atomic bombs were detonated, and B-52 bombers were already on alert ready to launch a retaliatory strike against Russia. Soldiers were coming back from Korea. Sputnik was orbiting the earth. Instead of looking into the future, this book was already adrift when it was first published.John Galt worked as a track laborer for twelve years? From 1945 to 1957? Come ON! I did that job for three summers myself when I was a teen-ager in 1946, 47 and 48, and according to the book, that was when Galt began. It is a consuming job, a dirty, dangerous, mind-numbing job. We called it the \\"Bridges and Buildings Gang\\". A lot of the work keeps you away from home for a week at a time and it pays at about the poverty level. He \\"kept an eye\\" on Dagny while doing this job? Sure! I got a bridge I can sell you - built by that old gang.Art is mentioned occasionally, but it is \\"logical\\" art, like great music that is written by one great logical man, Richard Halley who is quoted: \\"I do not care to be admired by anyone's heart - only by someone's head.\\" (UnivRef .671244). He continues, talking about an \\"artist\\" who \\"feels\\": \\". . . all he has to do is feel - he feels, the flabby, loose-mouthed, shifty-eyed, drooling, shivering, uncongealed bastard!\\" No Picasso or John Cage there, not even Hank Williams or Elvis.Spiritual dimensions are all encapsulated in Religions - there is no awareness anywhere in the book of spirit that is free from the monster of Religion. Galt says \\". . . the mind is one's only judge of values and one's only guide of action . . . the alleged short-cut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short-circuit destroying the mind . . . (and it) annihilates one's consciousness.\\" (UnivRef.87451). The great prophets of the ages are called \\"mystic parasites\\". (UnivRef.87777) And even though Dagny's heart beats wildly over several different men, that is all right because she, her heart and those men are all very, very logical.The book is all devoted to Good-Evil, Black-White, Right-Wrong. There is some \\"middle\\" intruding from time to time, but it doesn't have any chance at all. Galt sums it up \\"There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong, but the middle is always evil.\\" (UnivRef.90472)My final opinion about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"? Those who profess to like it either have not read it, or they have read ONLY it, and nothing else. They would have to be people who like Ayn Rand have no use for science, art, spirituality, government, education, management, logic, economics, literature, medical arts or history.If you think you might have been exposed to \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", do not panic. Sit down for a moment. Remember that it was actually published more than fifty years ago and it has not really affected the world very much. You are probably going to be all right. Your prognosis generally depends on your age when you were exposed. If you are over 25 you have a good chance to enter remission next week . If you are 50 or over then you are probably safe, I would recommend a couple of good craft beers or a glass of wine with tapas. If you are 18 or younger then you may have problems over then next six or seven years. So go ahead and stomp and shout and rant and rave, and it would be good to wear a shirt proclaiming \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" or perhaps mention something about \\"Ayn Rand\\" so people will know what happened to you and understand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For the idealistic narcissist.

Especially in this election year."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Inevitably, when reviewing a title which is both as iconic and as extensive as Atlas Shrugged, one runs up against the difficulty that everyone has an opinion, and those opinions are more likely to be dischordant than harmonious. Worse yet, in the case of Atlas Shrugged, those opinions frequently try to exclude the possibility of all others, which repulses many people who ought to read the book and consider its arguments. So, to the reader who is frightened of the sometimes fanatical devotion which Rand enjoys, don't be. You're cheating yourself of a fine, if repetitive, reading experience.Atlas Shrugged serves as a dual-edged sword in the battle for capitalism(and make no mistake, it is a sword - Rand clearly intends to wound her opponents). On one edge, one finds a thriller/mystery novel about the capitalist upper class and the enemy who seems to understand them and want to destroy them at the same time. On the other, one finds a massive philosophical tract for the times, which attempts to smash, once and for all, every argument for collectivism, religion and emotion-based reasoning with a hammer of ruthless, brutal and airtight rationality. To both sides of this novel, I give three stars.The literary side is, literally, 3/5s brilliant. Up until about page 650, one can't stop turning the pages as Rand keeps the heart-thumping, blood-pumping plot chugging along like the Taggart Comet. Every mysterious disappearance and collectivist edict seems to subtract a few seconds from the countdown to economic armageddon, and the reader, like the heroine, feels both powerless and determined to stop it. But then we meet John Galt, and the suspense dissipates as we realize that the \\"Destroyer\\" Rand has created is nothing more than a personality-deprived Deus Ex Machina, who spends the next 400 pages of the novel repeatedly stepping in at just the right moment to speak to the nation/sleep with the heroine/confront the looters. The small suspense near the end when Galt is captured abruptly dissipates as Rand simply shifts the role of \\"deus\\" to her other heroes, who rescue Galt almost without so much as breaking a nail. It is as though the giant, gleaming train of Rand's plot rushed into the philosophical tunnel and ran out of fuel before it could exit.And what of the philosophy? Well, in the undiluted form it assumes in the 50+ page speech at the end, it is quite original and even graceful at times. But to get to that calm, articulate statement, the reader has to be a veritable literary Francisco D'Anconia and dutifully shovel through miles of polemic and thinly-veiled ad hominem attacks first. From a tactical perspective, this was a smart move on Rand's part, since anyone who reads even ten pages of Jim Taggart's dialogue will be instantly repulsed by the groveling ignoramus. After 800+ pages of such shrill moral indignance the reader will likely blindly accept whatever Galt says just so he won't have to feel like such a worthless, parasitic monster for disagreeing. However, saying \\"if you disagree, you are a nihilistic, pathetic sponge like Taggart\\" is not a valid philosophical argument. Moreover, when one does get the argument (the Galt speech), it spreads itself far too thin. For instance, Rand's indictment of religion (that it disparages rationality in favor of negative definitions and feelings) is only a definition which the evangelical protestant movement of the 1850s believed, and certainly doesn't apply to more rigorous religious reasoners like Cardinal John Newman, Pope Benedict XVI or Count Joseph de Maistre. As such, though Rand names Prometheus as her hero's inspiration, the Galt speech really resembles more the wings of Icarus, insofar as while it is brilliant enough to allow Rand to fly higher than many thinkers, it is not the titanic end of intellectual history which Rand imagines it to be. Therefore, because the book is a brilliant mystery with a cop-out ending and a philosophical tour-de-force bogged down by too much polemic and pretensions to revelation, it deserves only three stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In first deciding to read this book ,I was very aware that it had philisophical and political implications(and or applications).however like so many great novels I found my self imersed in the plot and the story.\\"Are they going to find the Motor?\\"\\"will the Railroad Stay in business\\"\\"Why Cant Reardon Sell as much of his alloy to anyone he pleases\\"and of course \\"WHO IS JOHN GALT?\\"all politics asidea well written story line that keeps you wonderingand interested for the most part.when finished you are left with many questions about how things are done in our societyand often how insane govenments can be .it's one of the BIG BOOKs of all time for good reason!!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whether you like the message or not, Atlas Shrugged is an important piece of literature and should be read.

She goes to the extreme to prove the point that the government should not be allowed to intervene in big business and that reason should be the basis for all decisions. Personally, I found the extreme morality of the heroes and heroine and the complete immorality of the political \\"looters\\" to be genius.As a work of fiction I found Atlas Shrugged to be captivating, entertaining, and enjoyable. What I found even more fascinating was the philosophy behind the novel. I think that though the extreme morality versus immorality demonstrated in the characters Rand clearly shows the value of reason and logic and the dangers of apathy and cunning. She portrays the importance of independence, and the dangers of complete dependence on another person. Although this novel is politically charged, it is easy to read and extremely engaging."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have been generally oblivious to Ayn Rand's politics and philosophies and I don't have a desire to become a convert to objectivism - but this is a great book!

Kasey Cotulla"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book in 1985, and found that it had an enormous influence on my thinking for a long time. As a result, I snapped up all her works that came to the Indian book shops. Ms. Ayn Rand was a staunch believer in individual freedom, and an enlightened capitalism. She opposed, in principle, that one man be expected to serve another, either through private charity or through enforced socialism. However, as I grew up, I found that this philosophy had a limited relevance to one's life.The novel, nevertheless, is extremely well-written and has a very unique plot. It traces the lives of individual entrepreneurs in the land of freedom, who are being held back by laws and people who want them to serve others instead. Ayn Rand uses the characters to make long, powerful, speeches about her philosophy. She also weaves this in very deftly with the lives of the heroes, and shows what can happen when we put creative, dynamic people in bondage. There is a pleasant, surprising ending, which affects you like a fresh dawnAs fiction, the book suffers from these long speeches. As a book on Ayn Rand's philosophy, the story helps us understand her philosophy better. Her skill is such that each is meaningless without the other. Therefore, if you just read the story, skipping the speeches, you will miss most of the flavour. And if you read some of her other works, without having read this novel, you will find it very difficult to visualise the implications of her complex arguments.While I am sort of glad today that I found a more, multi-faceted, multi-hued approach to life (than what Ms. Rand offered), I do envy you, if you haven't read this book so far. If you buy this book, you are sure to be in for a treat.And later, even if you move on, some of her philosophy will perhaps always remain with you.

Without spoiling the book, I can tell you it is about what happens when people who believe in being rewarded for hard work leave the utopian Communist world where laziness is rewarded. While some readers take the most superficial reading of the booka dn decide that Rand is eschewing decent treatment of fellow man, I believe that amore sophisticated reading will demonstrate that Rand is writing about her belief that it is indecent of you to allow your neighbor to get along on less than what he is able to accomplish. As in her novel The Fountainhead, Ayn Rand manages to highlight every aspect of the human condition, from the hero to the evil antagonist adn the rest of teh regular joes torn between the extremes.

When you find your answer, make sure it's the answer that Dagny, Hank, Ellis and the others find, not the answer that the man who has forfeited his mind has found: futility."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's &quot;Objectivist&quot; philosophy is set out in this massive 1,000+ page work. I struggled through it and finally finished it nearly 11 months after I first picked it up. Having read it I decided to post a bit contrarian review of the work here for those who are considering reading it. Remember one thing before you read this book: to buy it or borrow it you must proceed to the FICTION section of your library or bookstore. Rand creates characters in this book that are so mind-bogglingly unrealistic and out of touch with what actually occurs in the real world that it made me sick. With these characters she weaves a plot filled with lengthy philosophical asides all in her great attempt to set forth for the reader the virtues of her philosophy, &quot;objectivism.&quot; The b.s. ran so deep that at times I had to simply put the book down and walk away from it for a few weeks until the desire to simply finish it and get it off my nightstand was rekindled within me. I would not recommend this book to anyone--not even philosophy majors, it is simply way too far fetched."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I counted two of them. Even a John Grisham novel has at least four ideas.I greatly enjoyed Ayn whacking me on the head with the same two notions every page for over a thousand pages. Whack! Whack! Do you got it yet? You sure? Whack! I want to make sure you got it. Whack!Thanks, Ayn.Prerequisites for reading this book are either a helmet or a naturally thick skull.If you have any respect for the art of writing or any background in philosophy, don't waste your time. If you've read the reviews here, you've read the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I strongly suspect all the reviews captioned \\"The Greatest book of all time!\\" and similar should be held with a great degree of skepticism (guffaw). Ms. Rand inspired a following nearly as fanatical as that of L. Ron Hubbard, and I think many of the unqualified rave reviews here are not something any person of intelligence should respect, except as a symptom of how fanatical her ideas and writing are.I could go on and on about this book, and actually have. But to spare you all, I'll tell you what occurred to me as I was mowing the lawn, and delete the rest in hopes you *find this review helpful!*This book is a relic from a more naive, simple time. It's a good example of some of the flaws and presumptions of the 20th Century, and was a piece of bald-faced propaganda posing as serious philosophy. The television series \\"Mash,\\" I think serves as a good foil to this book. There is the same smug self-righteousness, the certainty that one is always in the right no matter what you do; there is the portrayal of the enemy as weak, corrupt, and/or full of vice. There is the sappy eulogizing. Frankly, I stil respect \\"Mash\\" more, although I hate to watch it. Just hearing the theme song makes me cringe.Ms. Rand was an intelligent woman, and she hated what the Soviet revolution had done to her country. She spent most of her life after she fled Russsia trying to foment hatred against the political order that did her so much harm, and she attempted to unify an anti-communist philosophy in the nation that she found refuge and success in.Her \\"objectivism\\" is an odd pastiche of feudalism and yankee capitalism, more than a coherent philosophy. It purports to be a philosophy of achievement and greatness, by and for those captains of industry who serve only the ideal of excellence.In reality it serves as a defense for inherited wealth, for those who care little about excellence except to the extent it makes them wealthier. And inasmuch as America is now slouching toward feudalism and hereditary power, she has inadvertently succeeded in influencing America, bringing it closer to her old Czarist Russsia. That was not her intent, but her intents and the reality were not really compatible.Who is John Galt, indeed. He moved to Hong Kong years ago, out of contempt for American speculators who produce nothing themselves, yet make royal paychecks off of sweatshops in Asia and Mexico."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I came across Atlas Shrugged here on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I read some of the reviews. Many people loved this book, and some people absolutely hated it. There was a real conflict going on. The one star reviews sighted an overly lengthy tomb that was preachy and highly opinionated with poorly drawn and poorly developed characters, unrealistic dialogue and confusing descriptions. The 5 star reviews touted amazing characters, poetic descriptions and ground breaking philosophy. But, it was the comments to the 5 star and 1 star reviews that got me interested. I read a comment on a one star review that the commenter thought the one star review was unwarranted and the reviewer needed to read some in-depth analytical books addressing this book and its author's philosophies - then re-read and try the review again (and that the second time around couldn't possibly be a low rating). Well, any book that needs other books to explain it and make it understandable and worthwhile does not sound like a good book at all in my opinion. Other commenter on the 1 star reviews basically said that the reviewers (and anyone who would rate this book low) were a bunch of closed minded sheep that COULD not or WOULD not understand the monumental, brand new philosophy in this book. Well, when anyone says that the reason a book is not liked is because of stupidity, ignorance or willful disregard, it makes me wonder - about both the book and the commenter. On the other side, the comments on some of the 5 star reviews accused those reviewers of being brainwashed cult followers. Overall, I was interested enough to read the sample on my Kindle. I wanted to know what all the controversy was about. I was pretty underwhelmed, and I have to say, I agree more with the 1 star reviewers than the 5 star. It was not well written, it was unrealistic in many ways, not believable at all, and was way too long. I was not fired up in either way. I do not vehemently hate it, nor did I absolutely despise it. I was pretty unimpressed, both with the writing itself and the concepts therein.As I said, the book is not well written. Many of the reviewers did comment on this, and the response from those who loved the book were often that English was author's second language so cut her some slack. I do not agree that that is an acceptable reason nor is it even a good excuse. A good editor or even a proof reader, even a few willing friends, could have cleaned it up. There is no reason why a book should be published like this. A few examples follow. Verb tense. Often the verb tense was inappropriate, especially when switching between past memory to current time. At one point, a character was thinking about an oak tree from his child hood (in past tense) and then this sentence \\"He stood there for a while, making no sound, then he walked back to the house.\\" Now, of course, after a moment of thought and a quick re-read, I figured out that he was still remembering a memory and not actually looking for a moment and walking back to the house NOW, but when there are multiple instances of verb tense mix ups throughout, it makes for a very confusing, jarring read. There are also many places were the wrong form of a verb or adjective is used, such as singular versus plural. An example: \\"It was as if normal existence were (should be was rather than were) a photograph.\\" And \\"-not more than every fourth one of the stores was (should be were) out of business; its (should be their) windows dark.\\" A proof reader or editor would have easily corrected this. Also, there were sudden point of view changes without indication or warning, one moment we are in one character's head, with their thoughts and feelings, and then we are suddenly in the head of another, then back again. Then, there is Rearden's name. He's referred to both as Hank and as Henry. Again, I figured it out, but there were a few pages where people were talking to \\"Henry\\" and I was thinking, did someone else walk in? I read back and forth, trying to find where it was explained that Hank was Henry, and couldn't find it. Earlier in the book, people would suddenly speak up that hadn't been initially described as being in the scene, so it wasn't unprecedented to have new characters show up without introduction.In addition, the sentence structure was rather cumbersome and confusing at times. Sentences are very long, repetitive and strung together with commas and semicolons. Example: \\"The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were rising itself, they were the essence and form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive.\\" Or \\"But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked straight at Eddie . . .\\" So, were the yellow glints at the end of the street and did the glints catch his attention? Because, if they did, how can he look at Eddie at the same time he's looking at the glints? Were they supposed to be caught IN his eyes? I think so. Or \\". . . not an active fire, but a dying one which it is too late to stop.\\" This sentence indicates that it's too late to stop the fire, which doesn't make sense because the fire is dying. But I think what it is actually trying to say is that it is the dying of the fire that is too late to stop. There were instances of this thoughout the book, and it made reading it difficult because I found myself re-reading and re-reading, before I got it. You can't just read through this book non-stop with images and experiences running through your head, because the words keep getting in the way.I don't know about all readers, but I would guess many of them would be thrown off balance and just plain confused by the writing of this book. I was. I had a writing teacher once who gave some of the best advice I've ever gotten, \\"You want readers to read your story not the words of your story. You want them to read without seeing the words. If they are seeing the words or worse, being confused and tripped up by them, then you have failed.\\" That was certainly true for me reading this book. It was only a string of words without imagery that envoked no feeling.Onto the characters. I too found them to be unrealistic, contradictory, and poorly drawn. There were only a few types of people in this book, those portrayed as stupid, selfish (wanting things only for their own gratification) and charitable beyond any rational reason and those portrayed as cold, emotionless and selfish (wanting things only to feed their vision). I would agree with the other reviewers who said the dialogue was preachy, contrived and unrealistic. Example: \\"Of what importance is an individual in the titanic collective achievement of our industrial age?\\" or \\"little slum children\\", \\"it's purely non-commercial\\", and \\"selfish greed for profit is a thing of the past.\\", or this great big long, incongruous statement, \\"I'm not going to requisition a new typewriter. The new ones are made of tin. When the old ones go, that will be the end of typewriting. There was an accident in the subway this morning, their brakes wouldn't work. You ought to go home, Eddie, turn on the radio and listen to a good dance band. Forget it, boy. Trouble with you is you never had a hobby. Somebody stole the electric light bulbs from off the staircase, down where I live. I've got a pain in my chest. Couldn't get any cough drops this morning, the drugstore on our corner went bankrupt last week. The Texas-Western Railroad went bankrupt last month. They closed the Queensborough Bridge yesterday for temporary repairs. Oh well, what's the use? Who is John Galt?\\" Who says things like this? Nobody! People don't talk like that. They give speeches with that kind of language, maybe, but not talk to each other like that in everyday conversations.I found no new concepts in this book. The individual versus the whole, society versus industry, ect . . . Rand did not discover something new and reveal it in this book. Nor was her restated concepts portrayed in any realistic setting. The man who runs the train company is whining in response to urging to use a big, established, good quality supplier because the small company (low quality and long lead times that cost them months of time and money) should be given a chance. Or defending a failing venture in an undeveloped country because - shouldn't those countries have help and have modern facilities too? And he's telling his more efficient, hardworking and profit minded hardnosed co-owner sister that she doesn't understand or care about the human element . . . well, as far as business is concerned, of course she doesn't! And to portray any leader of a business as this man is silly. I work in a manufacturing field, and I can tell you, a vendor that provides high cost, low quality parts and is constantly blowing delivery dates is dropped. Same with business ventures, if something isn't making a profit, it goes. And what's this whole resistance to using the new type of metal? \\"but - but no ones used this new type of metal before . . .\\" Once again, businesses are always looking for the newest tech, the newest discoveries and inventions to make themselves bigger and better and give them an edge and make them money. This whole business set up in this book just seriously annoyed me. No business runs like that, it couldn't, and rendering one as such, even to make a point, just rang false for me. In the book, sentiment, affection, charity were portrayed as weak, negative emotions that none of the obviously strong, truly successful, hero characters had, even towards their families. The strong heros were condescending, arrogant and bitter.I did read the forward, which had some comments on Rand, as well as some explanations of her characters and the parts they played. Again, if I have to have things spelled out before hand and be TOLD (because it's apparently not clear enough in the book itself) what something ACTUALLY means (because my own ability to drawn my own conclusions must be faulty or my willful ignorance might make me ignore logic and reason) then I suspect there is something lacking in the book itself, either in the nuts and bolts of the writing or in the characters or plot. I found all that to be true in this instance. The actual structure of the writing was confusing and repetitive as well as contradictory, and both the characters and the plot were unrealistic, unrelatable, inhuman and also contradictory. Clarity, concise and realistic dialogue, sympathetic characters, believable plot/people/motivations/actions were all lacking. As a story, it is not something I want to read. As a philosophy, it was nothing new or groundbreaking, that I need to read, and certainly don't want to if its not well written.Quote from Rand: \\"I seem to be both a theoretical philosopher and a fiction writer. But it is the last that interests me most; the first is only a means to the last . . .\\" Well, this book is not evidence that supports this statement. It is the exact opposite, in my opinion. This fiction book was not a vehicle for her philosophy. Her philosophy was a vehicle for this book. That was evident to me in the preachy speeches of the characters and the unrealistic mold every scene was shoved into. She did not use her fiction to tell about a philosophy but rather used her philosophy to tell a story. Everything was drawn and built to fit that philosophy.Quote from Rand: \\". . . creating a new, original abstraction and translating it through new, original means. This, as far as I know, is only ME - my kind of fiction writing . . . May God forgive me if this is mistaken as conceit. As near as I can now see it, it isn't . . .\\" Well, I saw nothing new or original in the philosophy and certainly nothing new in this book, and to think it is, to judge one's own work as such, sounds conceited to me. And, in reading Rand's other statements in the forward, she certainly left me with an impression she is an elitist, arrogant, condescending and bitter woman, just like the heroes she created. I will definitely not be paying the high Kindle price to read the rest of this book.This all makes me sad, in a way. There were moments and certain descriptions that were like breathtaking snatches of sunlight and left me thinking - wow, this woman could have been a great novelist. With a little editing, a little less soap box preaching, a grounding in realistic, believable settings and characters, she could have written a tremendous book. There is talent here, but its warped and lost in the extrusion through her narrow and bent mold."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read over 200 pages (of 1000+) waiting to get interested and never did. I got to what I suppose is a minor climax in the narrative, the launching of the John Galt Line, and realized that I could not care less about any of the characters. So rather than waste more time reading this bore, I took it back to the library. I left my page mark in, just like one of the people who had it before me. (She left hers somewhere in the 100s.)If you like a world where all the heroes look like (and are just as deep as) the stoic figures in 1930s German propaganda posters, then Atlas Shrugged is your book. Otherwise don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"That being said I agree with Rand's philosophy, to a point. There are not 3 kinds of people in this world: sinister looters/moochers, screaming ingorites(yes I made this word up), and creative Jesuses. There are not only 2 motives in life: domination and creativity. There is no purity in anything. That is the only absolute. Everything has flaws, imperfections, and inconsistencies. The only thing perfect is chaos which by definition is imperfect. Then why would Rand write this voluminous tome that contains nothing but absolutes?There is no solution to the evils of the world. They will continue because of the imperfect nature of our universe. Protection from them is impossible because we are all by nature evil in our own way. We struggle daily with right or wrong be it helping someone who doesn't ask for it, or ignoring someone who does. Which of these things are wrong? There is no answer to that question. All of our decisions are based on what will make us respect ourselves tomorrow. Our responsibility to our actions go only as far as the ability for us to see the consequences of those actions. Furthermore, those consequences are valued by everyone differently. We're all different and inconsistent so obviously we have to restrict everyone's abilities to judge right or wrong by determining a basic standard of values. But those restrictions can, and do at times, go too far. So we need to restrict the restrictions. Balance of power, checks and balances: nothing is perfect or constant.Welfare is evil if its purpose is to solidify an aristocracy. Accumulation is good if it is earned. I don't think these last 2 sentences should take over 1000 words, much less pages, to explain. What she tried to do was make everyone believe those words by repeating them incessantly. I don't mind point blank bluntness but I do mind being hit in the face repeatedly by a 2x4 and that's what reading this book feels like.I can't wait for the film to be made. Hopefully it translates well to a screenplay given that they could cut out 90% of the book as repetitiveness. The plot was obviously just a tool that she used to infest the reader's mind with her opinions but for the most part it was a solid story. Ideally they'd make it surprising and suspenseful rather than predictable and repetitive. Did I say this book was repetitive?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In the America of ATLAS SHRUGGED, Ayn Rand portrays a society that is as starkly one-dimensional as any that has been penned. To her, people, institutions, economic systems, and carefully worked out values are purposefully depicted as showing a society designed to highlight a personal ethos that places a premium on rugged individualism, laissez-faire capitalism, guided selfishness, personal happiness, and an unwavering contempt for anyone who opposes her core beliefs. If Rand's heroes personify her often repeated beliefs that American prosperity rests on the mythical shoulders of Atlas, then it is money that functions as the steroids of her philosophical body building. What complicates the extent to which the acquisition and possession of money separates her heroes from her villains is the troublesome issue as to the classification of the novel. Is ATLAS SHRUGGED a novel wrapped around a philosophy or is it the reverse? This is no small matter, since the reader's perception of and reaction to it is the means by which that reader can assess exactly how money shapes the reader's sense of Rand's entire mode of thought.Not all readers are willing to slog through the more than a thousand pages of prose that describe both hero and villain in terms not found outside comic books. Unless readers make a determined effort to separate their innate sense of their own realism from the novel's heavy-handed use of allegorical and metaphorical stick-figures, then the relevant question of the function of money is made moot. As I was reading ATLAS SHRUGGED, I had to continually remind myself not to straddle this metaphysical fence. I assumed that Rand did not intend her readers to see her titular hero John Galt as a real life fully-fleshed man, but she far more likely intended Galt as an absolute symbol of individualism that ordinary humans could grope for, but never quite grasp. Yet, I saw that for Rand, it was crucial that her readers try for betterment even if they failed in the attempt.The heroes and villains of ATLAS SHRUGGED both value money, but it is not the physical properties of the money that distinguish the hero from the villain, but rather in how and for what purpose that money was acquired. Generally, to qualify as a Randian hero, that character has to understand that there is no mystical world beyond this one and that pure reason is the means to apprehend it. Individuals have to be free from the taint of government handout or stifling restriction. Further, the pursuit of personal happiness is mutually exclusive with both sacrifice and altruism for others. The heroes--John Galt, Ragnar Danneskjold, Hank Rearden, and Dagny Taggart--all typify to one extent or another this credo. The villains--Robert Stadler, Floyd Ferris, Wesley Mouch, and James Taggart--are the heroes' antithesis.The heroes of ATLAS SHRUGGED tend to view wealth as that which was earned solely by the ability and effort of the earner. If that wealth were stolen, leached, or mooched, then these heroes would refuse to accept it as legitimately earned. Ragnar Danneskjold is one such hero who meets Hank Rearden to tell him that he wishes to return some gold that he had pirated earlier and now seeks to return it to its original owner. In effect, Danneskjold wishes to be a 'reverse Robin Hood.' The surprising part is that Rand makes clear her antipathy toward altruism and self-sacrifice toward others whom Rand sees as parasites sucking the vitality out of her genuine heroes. When Danneskjold says that he wishes to kill a man long dead (Robin Hood), he emphasizes that the world is better off with more of the powerful and vital mighty and fewer of the parasitic masses that occupy the rest of the planet.The mysterious John Galt is the central figure of the book. It is his name which is bandied about in the often asked: 'Who is John Galt?' It is his elusive philosophy which permeates throughout. And it falls to him to speak Rand's sixty page closing screed about the need for society to have a rugged individual running things. This long and pontificating speech is the rhetorical symbol for the novel itself: rambling, excessive, pedantic, and more than a bit boring. The proper function of money for the Right Thinking Man is the same as for anything else of that man. Honest clear thinking, whether it results in financial profit, (a certainty for Rand) is to be favored over taking or leaching the hard-won results of the efforts of that Right Thinking Man. At the end of his long speech, Galt is offered the chance to be the absolute dictator of the world--provided that his decisions meet the approval of the very parasites who stole his wealth and power in the first place. When Rand closes the novel with, 'He raised his hand and over the desolate earth he traced in space the sign of the dollar,' she notes that for Galt and through her, both value the free and unfettered symbol of the dollar over the actual and misused power of it. Clearly, then, the form and function of money in ATLAS SHRUGGED is itself a function of whether one sees the work as a novelized philosophy or a philosophized novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What a waste of time this book was. 1100 pages to convey a message that is &quot;do what's best for yourself, and to hell with everyone else.&quot; Rand's foolish excuse for philosophy is exceeded only by the clumsiness of her prose, which features such winning phrases as &quot;When asked what he would want to do he answered at once, 'Whatever is right.'&quot;This book is a product of 50s McCarthyism and anti-Communist fervor, and uses a remarkably dull method of repeatedly constructing straw men to have them torn down by Rand's superman.This is indulgent candy for the mind, and utterly lacking in both literary and intellectual merit."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book pits successful achievers against a progressive, dependent, entitlement society.This book is an attack on modern progressivism and the socialist montra.

Each heroic character is complex and it is easy to develop an attachment to them, both male and female, and those with heroic qualities travel through a journey of full life experiences and remain true to themselves throughout the novel. Their lives are never slow or boring to this reader. They are the kinds of people I would enjoy speaking with and being a friend of.Those whose nature is full of contempt are the embodiment of evil and the pages drip with description. They are the slugs and worms of the modern world and would be people I would not want to be seen with, much less know.Any Rand's Philosophy of Objectivism appears through the words and actions of her characters and is never stiff or stilted and is thought provoking and interesting and complete. I wanted to learn more about Ayn Rand and her beliefs after the first read and what I read I have enjoyed.I do not believe this to be a predictable novel and I had no idea where the author would take me until near the end of the book. I never felt bored nor did I want to skim or speed read forward (that is an extreme compliment!).

So far as the literary quality of the plot is concerned I would give the book 5 stars. The philosophy that Ayn Rand is trying to express however falls short of being convincing. In the book it sounds great, but keep in mind that throughout the book she creates a setting that provides ideal conditions for the application of her philosophy. Also keep in mind that Ayn Rand actually did not develope this philosophy at all. Indeed Adam Smith, who receives no aknowledgement anywhere throughout the book, actually detailed in full Ayn Rands philosophy of selfishness hundreds of years ago in The Wealth of Nations. For those who feel that they have been priviledged with the discovery of a new and exciting way to live, I feel it's my duty to inform you that you already enjoy the lifestyle that the characters are fighting so hard for in Atlas Shrugged. It's called capitalism, and as I'm sure you know, it is far from perfect."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I only got half way through before life got in the way. It was an interesting read and I'm hoping I can get back to it soon."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Well, after reading this book, I don't have much to say. I like it, but not that much. I consider The Fountainhead a much better work. Here is my review. I agree with must of the theory behind the story. Government must not intervene with the economy. We don't need a degree to see that every time the leaders try to fix the economy, it just get worse. I agree that none have the right to impose their believe into others. I agree that incompetence must not be rewarded, that a job belongs to the better person, that is almost a crime to give a position to someone for any reason besides his qualifications, and I agree laws need to be more objective to avoid stuff we decry later on, and I can keep writing a few of the things that I agree. Like the quote \\"the only proper purpose of a government is to protect man's right which means: to protect him from physical violence\\" Or \\"there's no such things as a lousy job, only lousy men who don't care to do it\\", and one of my favorites \\"the foulest man on earth, more contemptible than a criminal, is the employer who rejects men for being too good\\".But, the book turns a little bit boring. The main characters are a little bit unbelievable at times. Yes, we need to be ourselves, but every time one of the main characters is thinking or talking, you can't stop to think of someone anti-social. Let me explain. Yes, you have to be strong in defending your principles. And yes, we need to raise our voices when people are talking plain crap. Yes, we need to be more active and try to stop evil. If you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem. The problem is that the message that come across must of the time is \\"you don't need anybody, you can be successful by yourself, the world is just there to supply you with the materials you need, etc\\" The problem is, that is not so. If you go with that attitude that you are superior to the rest of the world, you will never do anything, since everybody needs something from somebody. Want to build a house? Unless you have tons of money, you need a bank. Unless you have a lot of tress, you need to buy wood. Unless you own mines to find the metals, you need a store to buy the pipes, and everything else. Unless you own a piece of land, you'll need to buy one, and even if you own everything I wrote, you need permits to build. So, to tell people that they are individuals in the sense that come across in the book is a lie. Act like you don't need the bank and you won't get the loan. But, if what Mrs. Rand meant was to be yourself, and never letting anyone to alter your goal, then yes, I agree.The book is not for dummies. Now, you don't need a degree either. You need to be a free thinker to understand it. But the John Galt speech...really? In real life, after 5 minutes half the people would turn off the radio. By the first hour of it, no one would be listening.All in all, is a good read, but not a great one. Like I said, The Fountainhead is a far better book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm a big reader--my job requires a lot of reading and my ideal night is to fall asleep with a book and my cat curled up in my lap (she, being too smart to risk getting kicked off the bed when I twitch, prefers to sleep on my chair).But this book is monumental, not just for its size, but for the ideas that are expressed in it and how well they come across. The characters are well-developed and the writing is tense, although if you're into imagery that tends to be a bit lacking. Conflict is evident throughout.The exception is John Galt's monologue. That could be called a book synopsis. It's skippable."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Was difficult to rate this book. I could have easily given it three stars or less for it's drawn out philosophy, but the story she tells tends to make up for that.This book is her philosophy on life which enters the world of corporate America. Ayn has an incredibly unique writing style with an amazingly observant mind. She brings forth a beautiful and intricately detailed description of the characters, but are they good examples of who we really are? Her characters become so real as though one feels to have known them, although she does seam to take pride in her pridefull characters. Incredible insights and knowledge of the railroad industry, and the businesses that are associated with it; though she fails to explain the complexities of the extraordinary scientific feats that are developed. There is no way of fully describing this book without reading it. If nothing else, it is undoubtedly a wonderful book to improve your writing skills.At a third of the way through, I find the book uninteresting. It is definitely not a page turner. The climactic moments are few and far between. It is the search for the ultimate motor or the stopping of (the motor of the world) and the man who built it. Are the Industrialist just greedy and immoral, maybe, maybe not. I believe people will tend reading into the meaning differently.Well, it took a few hundred pages before getting interesting. In comes class envy and governmental legalized theft. The demise of the industrialist and recession brings in socialism. Blackmail the corporation for the good of the people.The book probably contains the longest paragraph (or thought) that I have ever come across.It took me almost half the book to realize she is philosophizing on the robin hood mentality; the legalized theft by the government. The industrialist would then leave the world of the looters to create their own world within and compete against each other to make their world better. They would not submit to the world they left.I smile now as a reach two thirds into the book. A realize now why this book is called a masterpiece, although it is too long. What happens when the industrialists (the minds) walk out, goes on strike? who needs who? These are what we call the five percenters, the risk takers.I find myself somewhere in the middle of her philosophy. Her grand finale is the monstrous absurdity that she believes is mans original sin in the garden. Does she speak for herself or the character she writes about? Her philosophy on reason and capitalism is correct; on objective reality and self interest it is not. Her beliefs in capitalism and limited government are right on, but her reasons are off course.What is her philosophy?:\\"The essentials of objectivism: My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute. -------Ayn Rand"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One of my top 2 or 3 books of all time. It is a long read and you must get past the first 200 pages. Then it really takes off."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ignore the clunky writing(there must be at least ONE synonym for astonish),enjoy the overly melodramatic plot, but most importantly, take the opportunity to notice how presciently this book predicts what is going on in this country at the present time.

The reasons will be obvious once you read the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is my third reading of this book starting in the early 1960's. It is, by far, the most influential book I have ever read. Although a little dated as far as the technology is concerned, the basic philosophical ideas are more relevant today than they were 50 years ago and the goals further away, unfortunately. This book should be required reading in high school but the ultra left-wing bent of most of todays' educators would totally preclude that possibility. Hopefully there are still a few people out there that have the intellectual integrity to read it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn's book is more timely now than when it was published in 1957. I'm sure a lot of us feel like we're living Atlas Shrugged these days with all the 'geniuses' in government trying to run our economy. I don't think we'd be in the dire straits we're in if more in our government and our society had read and took to heart The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged and the U.S. Constitution."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This story is a fairly good read just as an adventure, but it's greatness comes from the absolute dissection of socialism (what the socialists of our generation call \\"liberal\\" or \\"progressive\\"). Socialism is a disease and Ms. Rand explains that to you in such excruciating detail that you have no shred of cover to hide behind and continue fooling yourself that 'liberal' is something respectable.Unfortunately it's more preaching to the choir; those who already want to fight liberals are the only ones who will actually read it. This country is doomed, the 2008 election was lost months ago, there is nothing BUT socialism on the ballot."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The Bible is the most influential book I've read. Atlas Shrugged is second. You'll note I give it five stars. But just as I cannot close my eyes to biblical contradictions and errors, so too I cannot close my eyes to the problems with Ms Rand's book.First, what is the purpose of living if actions are entirely self-referential? If atheism and selfishness are exclusively the way to go, does it really matter whether you're a moocher or a producer, as long as you get your hands on wealth?Second, why the antipathy towards children? By outright degradation but also by omission, Rand posits that having children is an unnecessary, distracting, unproductive, pointless waste of time. Is that really where humanity should go? To extinction?Third, why are all skinny people good, and fat people bad? Ms Rand, it is well known, had her own, uh, \\"issues\\" with weight. You'd think she'd be a little less hypocritical and a little more understanding.Fourth, who wants to work all one's life and never relax? You produce your whole life -- for what? To produce some more?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book in 1985, and found that it had an enormous influence on my thinking for a long time. As a result, I snapped up all her works that came to the Indian book shops. Ms. Ayn Rand was a staunch believer in individual freedom, and an enlightened capitalism. She opposed, in principle, that one man be expected to serve another, either through private charity or through enforced socialism. However, as I grew up, I found that this philosophy had a limited relevance to one's life.The novel, nevertheless, is extremely well-written and has a very unique plot. It traces the lives of individual entrepreneurs in the land of freedom, who are being held back by laws and people who want them to serve others instead. Ayn Rand uses the characters to make long, powerful, speeches about her philosophy. She also weaves this in very deftly with the lives of the heroes, and shows what can happen when we put creative, dynamic people in bondage. There is a pleasant, surprising ending, which affects you like a fresh dawnAs fiction, the book suffers from these long speeches. As a book on Ayn Rand's philosophy, the story helps us understand her philosophy better. Her skill is such that each is meaningless without the other. Therefore, if you just read the story, skipping the speeches, you will miss most of the flavour. And if you read some of her other works, without having read this novel, you will find it very difficult to visualise the implications of her complex arguments.While I am sort of glad today that I found a more, multi-faceted, multi-hued approach to life (than what Ms. Rand offered), I do envy you, if you haven't read this book so far. If you buy this book, you are sure to be in for a treat.And later, even if you move on, some of her philosophy will perhaps always remain with you. And you will find yourself to be richer for it.You may also find some of her other works interesting. I particularly recommend (The Fountainhead, Anthem, and The Virtue of Selfishness."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I love this book. There are questions about whether God is necessary for ethics, and this book is pretty straightforward about why religion and God aren't. I've actually been quite impressed with the motivation this book has given me to think right and do the right thing. It's about taking responsibility for your actions. Before you get too wrapped up into the size of this book, it is actually 3 books in one. You can take breaks between books if you get exhausted. Rand's Utopia suffers from what every Utopia suffers from...it's her utopia and no one elses. This makes it somewhat boring as it is a place where everyone and everything seems flawless. The ratio of women to men in Rand's utopia is much to small to be mine. This book probably didn't need to be as long as it was, but it has inspired me to take action and use my head in each decision I make."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was first exposed to Ayn Rand's works as a junior in high school when I was assigned to read Anthem. I finished that book in one sitting because many of the ideas put forth in it were so contrary to what I was being taught in almost every other class, i.e. the good of all rests my shoulders, we have a responsibility to our fellow man up to keeping him, fed, clothed and equipped with big-screen TV's and on food stamps, welfare etc etc, because those poor people just haven't ever had the chance (hey, I had no chance either, I was raised dirt poor, but somehow, I managed. Imagine that, a self made person in today's hand-out, victimized society). Now, I am 12 years older and finally picked up Atlas Shrugged. It has taken me 2 months (and I am a very fast reader) to get to page 950. This book is perhaps the easiest philosophy work I have ever read and it rings true. Generation X, which I am a part of, was taught that nothing is our problem or liability. We are poor victims of a world gone mad. After I began reading this book, I remembered many of the things I felt as a child growing up; that I am capable of great things and need not rely upon some state or broken social system to sustain me. I am writing this at a point in my life where I am merely an administrative assistant at my company and do not possess any sort of college degree, however, when I look around my home I know and can state truthfully that each and every thing in it, right down to the dishtowels, have all been earned by my hard work and not charity. There is another level in Rand's philosophy for me, however. I had a relative who was very poor and very sick, didn't plan and didn't save and so ended up on Medicaid. The state took everything (looters in the book, if you will) The house, the car, all of their income and that still was not enough, though the funds recovered did cover medical bills (the rest went to \\"administration costs\\" gee, wonder what that is? Thieves). This is but a brief example of the \\"good and welfare of all of the people\\" run amuck. It is not my job, nor is it yours to take care of those who cannot or do not take care of themselves. There is so much more I could write about this wonderful novel, but I have already typed a fairly long review. Please read it and decide for yourself if you possess the courage to take responsibility for yourself and not accept charity or become one of those horrid, corrupt individuals who robs from those who work hard and actually *earn* their daily wages to hands out checks, housing, etc to those who do not work. The greatest theme of this book to me is, work for what you want, take not what you haven't earned. No one owes you anything.*Addendum I just cleaned up my review to correct typos and will be re-reading this book for the 4th time. That being said, my economic situation has become greatly reduced since I wrote my initial review and my perspective on this work is somewhat altered. While I have much love for this work, what dismays me is those who continually attack Ayn Rand without having either read and/or finished any of her books, particularly Atlas Shrugged. For all of those who post negative reviews, my first question would be, have you read it-the entire book? And secondly, what vexes you so about what she put forth in this novel? It is fine if you wish to criticize that the prose is long winded, etc, I felt that way myself during part of the book. But to simply demonize and say she was stating that \\"greed is good\\" (which is not the point of the novel, btw, it is \\"personal responsibility is a virtue\\", instead) I am not what I would consider a randroid, as I cannot personally embrace fully the model of the virtous men in her novel. However, the dedication to personal responsibility has served me and my household rather well during these past several years. We have watched others benefit from the welfare system merely by having a child, when we have the same income and no children, watched people get handouts (SNAP, WIC, LEAP, etc) when we were denied, and heaven help me, things got bad enough that we had to. And yet, we are still here. I better understand the value of certain programs now, but just as it was in Rand's novel, the same assistance is not applied to everyone. We are and have been gainfully employed without using unemployment insurance. Our lives suck, and yet, without some of the tenants of this novel, we would have given up long ago. Keep hating on this book if you so desire; for our household, it still continues to give us hope, even though many of the situations described in it are not quite the same as what our nation is experiencing at this time, but there still is a similarity and looters and moochers still abound and are a cancer on this economy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Good value and well narrated by Herrman, who gives great peformances as the main characters and narrator alike - his interpretation of Robert Stadler is amusing. I would suggest that buyers ALSO read the book, and use this to keep the ideas fresh in mind if lacking the time to sit and read 1000 plus pages often. This is NOt an alternative...but a companion. I say there are ramifications as although this is a 10 CD fare and captures the bulk of ideas...descriptions and dialogue are hacked out, sometimes altering the \\"landscape\\".

It's a powerful dramatic illustration of how we are coerced to march in lockstep with the dominant culture, and thus forfeit our individuality and ultimately our freedom and humanity. It's interesting how Ayn Rand has become for many people a political symbol of all they love or hate. I would caution the reader to avoid this trap. This book is not a blueprint for utopia. It's a work of fiction, and, like all fiction, it mirrors certain aspects of our reality without being completely realistic. I value this book because it illuminated some of the social snares and pitfalls we face, forces that I had been dimly aware of but could not previously bring into focus. Because it meant so much to me, and because it has things to say that no one else had the courage and passion and skill to articulate, I'll call this one of the Great Books. It is not without flaws, but it is important and it is unique."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is simply the best book I have ever read.

Galt's character not as challenging as Howard Roark's character (Ayn Rand's Fountainhead) but certainly hits the bulls eye. Dagny Taggart, the woman, the heroine is the motion of this story, fighting for movement. In a world inhibited by people lacking courage and negated of originality, unappreciative of the sect who dares to invent, initiate... assiduous, the solution is for the creator to go on a Strike to bring the second-hander to realization... of their value...

Rand's writing focused on Objectivism and was very influential on the way I thought for many years. I credit her methodology with teaching me how to think critically, starting from a premise and constructing a thorough analysis. All of her books were very meaningful to me, both her fiction and her non-fiction. I read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" when I first went to Alaska in 1983 and shared it with a friend I met there. He in turn gave it to his father who went out and bought five copies. And one of those copies he gave to Al Gore back in the mid eighties! \\"Anthem\\" is another astounding book and when I found that one of my favorite pieces of music of many years originated from this book, \\"2112\\" by Rush, I was even more astounded. As I have learned more over the years and broadened my knowledge base, I must admit that I have fallen away from Ayn's views, but I still carry a large respect for what she was able to accomplish and still highly recommend her books."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've owned this book for over 10 years, but had never read it. It is now my favorite book. I understand the concepts, but some of the actions confused me. For instance, when our heroes rescue John in the hotel, Dagny point blank shoots a guard and kills him. I felt this was out of character, even though Dagny had her &quot;reckoning&quot; as it were. Also, I feel that John is more of an ideal (which may or may not be attainable) and that Hank is the real hero. He is who he is (except for Dagny - he should have acknowledged her from the beginning) and he lives in the world as he is. I feel that the world they escape to is sort of a cop out (even though at the end they intend to return to the outside).

Most of the opinions expressed are my own, which could be why I enjoyed the book as much as I did. I can see how someone who disagrees with her viewpoints would stop reading before the first part ends. For me, it's 36 hours until my physics final, and I couldn't put the book down!This isn't a quick read, though, and some of the details seem to be unnecessary. I quickly grasped the points she was driving at, but her opinions are restated many different ways and can become... well, redundant. Atlas Shrugged explains most of the finer points to an unperceptive audience (even the title, which is easy enough for someone with a general knowledge of mythology to understand), although some readers might like the relative straightforwardness.The book's length is often mentioned, and while I don't see the relevance (read The Little Prince if you like short political commentaries), I'll comment. Some details are drawn out, but I don't think a reader should be intimidated by its heft! If you are, then you probably aren't one who would enjoy what Atlas Shrugged offers, so don't bother. This book is for the people who read for their own pleasure."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am a Objectovist, that is some one who ascribes to the tenants of the philosophy of Ayn Rand.

I will keep my review short and establish what I consider to be a valid point not seen in any of the previous reviews I have read.Rand is a genius when it comes to writing. I too get overwhelmed and frustrated with her 50-page diatribes, but the woman does make an argument for her views and philosophies.As for the Title of my review, \\"She Wrote the Best Book She Could Have\\", this is a testament to Rand being a woman. No, this is not some chauvenistic boast. Quite the contrary. Rand writes of a man who figurtively carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. She delves into the growth and development of a man physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The problem is that she is not a man and can't provide an accurate portrayal. Out of all the arguments I have heard and taken part in regarding Rand's books, Atlas Shrugged by far is enjoyed more by women than men. Women see it as a wonderful insight into a man's psyche when the description could not be further from the truth.Think about it ladies, would you trust a man to write a story of the struggles in a woman's life? Especially when intertwined with the philosophies surrounding it? If you are a woman reading this book, take much for granted. If you are a man and want to experience the genius of Rand's writing without the handicap of disagreeing with her view of a man's struggles, pick up the Fountainhead."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Haven't read it yet but the book is like new and arrived ahead of schedule.

I leave it to you to criticize it appropriately."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a parable. It would be pretty good if it were fifteen pages long, but instead it's about 1,200 pages long. The characters are two-dimensional, the plot is incredible, the whole thing is...ridiculous. Fine for a parable. But this thing is 1,200 pages long. Save your strength. Read Hayek instead."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is not only morally reprehensible, worse, it is bad fiction. Rand was a maniac and has almost no understanding of philosophy. In fact, she gets it almost uniformly backwards. If you are ignorant of the history of philosophy, maybe you might enjoy this...but if you have any aesthetic sense, I don't see how you can."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Strictly as a novel, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a disaster. Most of it consists of sermons. Every character makes long speeches and, whether hero or villain, they're all reduced to their philosophical position. That is not how novels are supposed to work.And then there's Ayn's notorious \\"philosophy.\\" Predictably, any time a Rand character invokes family responsibilities or the general welfare, he or she is invariably portrayed as manipulative or vicious or just plain dumb. (Significantly, there aren't any children to be found in Rand's work--logically, since parenting is an altruistic task.) By contrast, her tall, square-jawed, handsome heroes are always right about everything! Neither life nor good literature operates that way.Add to all this the matter of Rand's personal dishonesty. In her afterword to \\"Atlas\\", she trumpets the following: \\"No one helped me, nor did I think at any time that it was anyone's duty to help me.\\" This is a patent falsehood. Throughout her life Rand received help from her parents, her relatives in Chicago, her husband, her courageous editor at Bobbs-Merrill, friends who loaned her money, and privately subsidized housing in L.A. Her books are as deceptive as she herself was.For a thorough unmasking of La Rand, I recommend Jeff Walker's \\"The Ayn Rand Cult.\\"For a satire of Ayn, I recommend my own book, \\"The Pianist Who Liked Ayn Rand: A Novella & 13 Stories.\\" When I was preparing for the title novella, I plowed through all of awful Ayn's oeuvre, raided it for quotes, and then placed them on the lips of my characters. It was my way of depicting and dramatizing the seductive lure that Ayn's \\"thought\\" has on susceptible American adolescents."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Much of Ayn Rand's philosophy--Objectivism--resulted from her growing up in the Soviet Union under Communism. Rand emigrated to America as a young woman, where she believed that in a free society, under Capitalism, she could write and get her works published. Rand could not accomplish these goals under the Soviet system.It is clear from Rand's works that she hated Communism. Objectivism, in its pure form, allowed individuals to strive to be themselves and earn what they can without relying on others for economic assistance or other similar types of aid. This, of course, included help from government agencies.In _Atlas Shrugged_ Rand presents her philosophy (or should I say, continually bangs the reader over the head) by developing a plot about a woman, Dagny Taggert, who is competent and self-reliant, and runs a railroad under the aegis of her ignorant, and unimaginative older brother, James. The U.S. economy is severely running aground, as does her rail line, because of extraordinarily strict governmental regulations related to production and work force rules. These regulations are meant to be fair to everyone, but they result in economic chaos and financial ruin for everyone. Rand believes that even the \\"looters,\\" i.e. those who lazily take advantage of so-called government largess, do not benefit under the American economic system.While Rand's theories are well argued and systematically thought out, she ignores those in our society who do not benefit from pure capitalism. What about those millions who are chronically unemployed or under-employed, and cannot afford to pay for health insurance, or are homeless. Are all those women with children (and no husbands) on public assistance merely \\"looters,\\" and not victims of a selfish, greedy, profit motivated, capitalist, \\"dog eat dog\\" economic system? To strengthen her points, Ms. Rand puts her readers through a 100 page radio address by a man viewed as the only possible savior of the eventual economic collapse of the \\"People's Republic of the United States?\\" I sincerely hope not."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've been intrigued with the idea of reading this book for some time. The story is a vehicle for Ms Rands political views, of course, one of the principle characters expounding for 60 (count 'em 60) pages. The plot is somewhat dated and weak, some of the 'villains' almost comic. To be honest, I had to take a break about two thirds the way through with another book, going back to finish afterwards."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This was my third reading and it is even more relevant now than 12 years ago. A must read for anyone who wants to see the blueprint that is being used to lead us away from our founding principles."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I got the book to reread because it is so popular with Paul Ryan and I wanted to understand what his point of view was. The premise is do not GIVE things to people because that diminishes their person-hood. I had read this in college and it fit with my student mentality just fine."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Ayn Rand. If you are more conservative politically you will like it, if you're more liberal you probably won't. It is dark and philosophical so it isn't a quick read - I find myself going back and rereading passages to make sure I comprehend all the nuances she has in the novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the most structurally aligned books I have read in the past 20 years. The book is long, but it is apparent that Ayn deliberately selected her words. You do not have to agree with her philosophy, but her writing is profoundly sound. The quality of this piece is what makes it popular among book lovers. Wow!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ATLAS SHRUGGED is an incredible book, and it seems that it accurately predicted the future. At times, it is a bit hard to follow, and it is a HUGE book - but reading the book, and seeing the two movies (so far) have made understanding much more complete. Read it and learn!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged for the first time when I was 19. Since then I have read it at least once every two years or so (I am now over 50), and have worn out many copies. My current copy is full of place-markers so I can reread my favorite sections. The writing style is rich with detail, but one of the hardest things I dealt with in the books was the lengthy dialog. Ayn (rhymes with 'nine') Rand's story development is exceptional."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ms Rynd was way ahead of her time. One has only to do a cursory look at todays policys to see that we're headed down the same track. ( no pun intended.) Great read -- fascinating."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This should be required reading for every American. Old and young. Fits our time perfectly. The world should take note that man is free."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you are a person who is often times frustrated by the direction our society is going you will find this book very gratifying. It is reassuring to here someone express feelings that you share and do so in such a powerful and convincing way. Amazingly contemporary for a work which is over 40 years old. Apply it to the current tax cut debate. By the way it is also a very engrossing story from the perspective of pure fiction, regardless of philosophy.It would be interesting if the ratings that this book received were broken down to reveal whether or not the reader considered themself to be &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot;. I suspect their would be a dramatic difference."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a trap, designed to capture your attention and expose your deepest convictions to the open air for a while before letting you go. Whether you walk away with your head held high or stumbling and reeling is entirely up to you.Despite the final enormity of the novel's message it begins subtly enough, introducing Rand's Objectivist philosophy almost beneath levels of detection, starting with a premise you can understand: existence exists. If you believe that, as the plot continues so does the lesson: then you must accept this, which leads to this, and to this. The beauty of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is how well its message is woven into a fascinating plot that uses characters and their conflicts as its examples. Its power lies not in heavy-handed preaching you can ignore at will, but in the gradual production of a ladder with every rung identified and labeled, challenging you to find the flaw on in its construction on your way up.Some readers think they find it. Many don't, but remain stubbornly convinced it is there. Others' lives, mine included, have changed forever when the conclusions reached at the top of that ladder prove inescapable. Face this challenge with pride and reach your own."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book over 10 times, and it is simply the best, most important book ever published! Whether you agree with her philosophy or not does not change the fact that she is mostly right!The story is engaging, and the philosophy she presents wants every reader striving for the best they can be! The moral chaos we live in today needs to be seriously examined, and Ayn Rand knows how to tell it as it is, and conceptualize complex issues into understandable alternatives.Highly recommended, if not for the philosophy, then for the storyline and the highest quality of writing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is indeed quite a book. People love it or hate it. It makes some people crazy. For a young, fresh mind it is engaging and hypnotizing. Many older readers are less inclined to enjoy it. But hey, let's accept it for what it is worth."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's one of my favorite rituals to settle down with this mammoth lollipop at least twice a year and lose myself into this world of philosophical literature. However, Rand left a few intriguing holes in her plot. Why, for instance, would Hank Reardon, fierce, an extreme individualist and achiever, marry such a female king cobra as Lillian Reardon? Rand portrays her as a repulsive, sinister serpent with dead eyes and a frozen smile, the very antithesis of what Reardon was all about. Also, how could such an man-made-of-steel come from such lowlifes as his mother, who is described as a drooling lap dog? And the brother, another miscreant. I would have the same question about the parents of the cool, collected and courageous Dagney Taggart whose brother is such a gutless marshmallow. Rand portrays these same unlikely familial groupings in We the Living, where Kira Argounova's mother is a twittering little canary, and her sister, Lydia, is a simple-minded religious fanatic. In The Fountainhead, Dominique Francon has as father whose such a mental retardate it's difficult to imagine he sired this blazing beauty of Objectivism (her mother in this book, and the parents of Howard Roark, are nowhere to be found). Would be interesting for someone to do a study on Rand's family background."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Yes, the characters are one dimensional. It was written that way to show in the abstract the various values, good and bad, that Ayn Rand wanted to illustrate. Yes, there are other minor flaws, yet in scope and ideas, the book is breathtaking. When the history of the 20th century is written, Rand's book will be an important turning point. It will change the world, one individual at a time. It points out the lies of collectivisim, socialism, totalatarism, all the ism's that demand that the individual give up his rights for the &quot;greater good.&quot; This book should be &quot;required&quot; reading for everyone, which of course begs the question of required by whom?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Since 5 previous copies of Atlas Shrugged have disappeared from my personal library (some on loan), I've just ordered another hardcopy to re-read, after 15 years since the last reading. Contemporary society seems to have fallen into &quot;self-destruction&quot;-- the kind that Ayn Rand describes in this book. Atlas Shrugged should not be read with formal literary critique in mind, rather as one from which to learn how to return to being decent human beings. Self-interest is a good thing, as long as it is not abused or overly abusive to others. As a young woman just entering the working world that was full of impenitrible &quot;glass ceilings&quot;, Rand's book gave me courage to rise above and succeed in all my life endeavors-- without becoming a miserable, unprincipled or uncaring witch. Now, 32 years later, I continue to be enlightened by her work, but with a more mature eye that has experienced much of the world and recognizes the importance of her philosophy in today's society. Through much of her pessimism, I gather optimism toward changes we humans can make to provide better lives for all. An enlightening book for all ages."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm halfway through this book and I am spellbound. I frequently become caught up in philosophy. The fact that I wrote my college thesis on Transcendentalism, when I was neither a literature or philosophy major, should indicate something. At any rate, the book is dynamic. Don't let anyone tell you that anyone who enjoys this book must be stupid or a fool. After all, the greatest fool is one who does not recognize that other opinions exist in the world and have their own validity. If the critics of this book were truly confident in their own capabilities, they would lambast the OPINIONS of the book's supporters, not the supporters themselves. Resorting to name-calling is often the sign of a banal intellect.I say, even if you think that you're not likely to enjoy the book, read it anyway. In my opinion, it had more than enough sub-issues to keep anyone's mind busy puzzling them out for hours. I, for example, found myself most caught up in Rand's call to know yourself and to not let anyone co-opt you into their particular moral code. Rearden finally realizes that by allowing men to turn his life in a direction that he didn't want it to go, he was implicitly aiding them in their mission. In general terms, the book is about ACTION. Motive power, as Rand calls it. What motivates you for living? Whatever that is, look inside yourself and make certain that it is noble enough for you to stake your life on its precepts. No excuses, no doubts. Stand for something or you will fall for anything -- Rand has no love for those like Orren Boyle, whose loyalty swings in the wind, ready and willing to be bought or sold.Rand's theory, admittedly, works better in theory than practice. It's much easier to be Objectivist, I would imagine, if you're as wealthy and powerful as Rearden and Dagny. Nonetheless, that doesn't make it any less valid. Think really hard... what values does society reward when your taxes increase as a result of a hard-earned raise (i.e. your productive SUCCESS) or your marriage? Why should two people who pledge their mutual happiness to each other be fiscally punitive when other people get more AFDC money year after year for producing welfare babies? (And don't tell me it doesn't happen, that it's a Conservative myth. I've seen it.)More than anything else, think THINK THINK about the world you live in and what role you want to play in it. Why is it that when we aid someone's alcoholism we're considered an enabler but when we aid someone's utter dependence on the government, we're 'generous'?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is an incredible read!I rarely read books more than once, but I've read this one three times. This goes far toward demonstrating it's continued appeal.If you've read this book, read it again. If you haven't read it it's well worth the time.For new readers, don't read the introduction until after you read the book. If you want a taste of these ideals without reading such a large volume, read Anthem also by Ayn Rand.The rest of the reviews speak volumes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged had been on my parents shelf throughout my childhood in England but I had always been intimidated by the length and the small type. Since then, I have moved to Japan and I am now living and working in the middle of one of the worst economic periods Japan has experienced since the war. All around me I see unhappy faces, the kind that in Atlas Shrugged might suddenly ask &quot;Who is John Galt,&quot; and in many ways the situation has parallels with the one that Ayn Rand paints in her novel. The book was being promoted heavily in the English language section of one of Tokyo's largest book stores and it caught my attention. One month later, I have had one of the most profound reading experiences I have ever had. I think that the story, its characters and its philosophy were the right message for me at this point in my life. I always thought that John Galt was not to be found in society or government but in ones own capacity to think and act and in the highly conformist culture of Japan this is a message that any individual needs to hear from time to time. However, to be your own John Galt, you must think for yourself, and this means that you will take from Atlas Shrugged that which makes sence in the context of your own life and should not swollow every idea in the book. The situations, people and events in the book are designed to create the best backdrop to explain Ayn Rands philosophy but the situations, people and events in our lives are many and varied. There is a time to be logical, there is a time to be sensitive, there is a time to be selfish and there is a time to be selfless. To be happy and to really live our life in accordance with our highest ideas of ourselves is the end that Ayn Rand teaches, but the means must be up to every individual to work out for themselves taking into account the lives of all those we love.ADL"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is my first acquaintance with the writing of Ayn Rand, and I walk away impressed, but not taken aback. Atlas Shrugged hammers home Rand's personal philosophy Objectivism in very eloquent language and a complex story with great detail. Does Rand accomplish her goal of creating an allegorical novel explaining the dangers of dependent, socialistic society? yes. Does this make for an excellent novel? Most of the time. Her characters are one dimensional, either completely embodying the Rand model for ideal person, or embodying the opposite. Is there no one in her world with a Objective mind, but the human quality of weakness? Rand would have us believe not. The style of the novel is something that you adapt to: eloquent and excessive. The 70 page soliloquy by the character John Galt is one example where Rand could have stated her point in less words. Getting through Atlas Shrugged was a struggle for me, and I'd imagine it was for others too. Overall, recommended for fans of philosophy who can stomach some wordiness. 4.5/5 stars (I rounded down because it was closer to 4)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you are a conservative, a libertarian, or at least a thinking person this is a must read.

I absolutely loved its plot and characters, as well as the message, which I suggest you read for yourself rather than getting anyone else's watered down version.I found only one part to be too long and drawn out...John Galt's 60 page speech was too much for me and I had to skim it.Otherwise, I think this might be the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn's characters are taken to archetypal extremes to illustrate her point. If you can get past that, this book explores some interesting concepts that I continually find myself thinking back to and relating to modern events.Simply as a work of fiction, it can be a little slow in parts, but overall it succeeds as entertainment."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has made me able to see only 2 kinds of people, the ones who achieive and get things done and the others who feed off of them. Complaining and badmouthing the ones who create the jobs and truly help out society.

But all very smoothly and intentionally laid out, like rails of Rearden Metal...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am only half way through listening to the story and am addicted to the pure enjoyment of every word. Every man women and adolescent should read/hear this story more than once in there lives if not only for the exalting entertainment, certainly for the underlying principles the adventure denotes. The one dissapointment I have is the quality of the discs.............a bit of a let down."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The only fictional book I recommend to my clients for good reason. Ayn Rand builds the formidable, beautiful, relentlessly driven protagonist of Dagny Taggart as the ultimate heroine. Dagny is an inspirational example of a woman who continually makes choices that honor her Authentic Self, including one of the hardest of her life. I keep a copy of Atlas on my desk and at my bedside table, just in case. Be warned: Dagny is not perfect and that lack of perfection is one of the reasons that I love her character and this book so much.

This lays out clearly what happens to a society who encourages the mindset of entitlement. It is so detailed how an action by one affects the other. It defines how the parasites take down the producers and in turn destroy themselves. I can put current names of people I know personally or in the news in place of the characters in this amazing book. It is a \\"page turner\\" I can't recommend Atlas Shrugged strongly enough, it has absolutely kept me rivoted to the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Though I love politics and business, I was never an avid reader as a young person. However, after hearing multiple professors, mentors, and ambitious professionals strongly recommend this book, I decided to tackle the 1100-page, 800 pound gorilla of political and philosophical satire. Atlas Shrugged is the best novel ever written on pure capitalism and the dangers of government intervention. As one successful businessman told me, \\"Read Atlas Shrugged; you will be a capitalist for life.\\" If you are remotely confused about why moratoriums and other legislation that slows American productivity are harmful and even detrimental to capitalism and free enterprise, read this book. It is not too deep to follow. You will learn more about politics and economics than you would initially think.Since then, I have read multiple other famous books on this same topic - books by Hayek, Friedman, and even Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations.\\" But none of them came close to having the effect on me that this book did. You will never again think the same way about capitalism, free enterprise, and the dangers of socialism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Sitting down to pen and paper--or rather lap and laptop--to write a review of this book which has long had a profound place in my life, I look at the headlines around me: a bridge in San Fransisco reported to be on the verge of collapse after years of bureaucratic neglect and irresponsibility; a half-million pounds of contaminated beef are to be recalled, a report predicts that half of US children will be on foodstamps within twenty years, a tax-payer housing project for illegal immigrants is being planned by the US government.....and in the 1 November New York Times, the publication of an essay by one Adam Kirsch of The New Republic, a distorted hack-piece of an attack on Rand under the guise of a review of a new Rand biography. The silliness, the complete misinterpretation of Rand's work is so vast as to seem deliberate (it was written around Halloween--I thought maybe Kirsch wrote it dressed up as James Taggart--?). It would not be worth commenting on, were it not for the fact that his views represent, in general, what is so exasperatingly misunderstood about Rand's message (particularly in AS). I ask your pardon, in advance, for the length of the following.Let me begin by saying that I am not an 'Objectivist', as I don't 'need' to be. I read and loved both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged; they have been enough in terms of reinforcing or shaping anew certain convictions of mine. I read Barbara Brandon's biography of Rand, which I found beautifully written, both respectful (but not worshiping) and objective (but not artificially detached), particularly in light of the dramatic events of their friendship. Mr. Kirsch (we'll get to him in a moment) makes a smarmy aside about the book's appeal to a \\"mass market\\". There is nothing 'mass-market' in my background, education, tastes and life in general, outside of trips to grocery stores. I am a very highly-educated American, distinguished in my field and female. Some of my other favorite authors, for example, are Vladimir Nabokov and Graham Greene. There is no 'pulp' in any of my cultural or intellectual interests. I used to be a conservative Republican until it was taken over by the Bush, Neocon, Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh crowd; I used to see the potential of Democrats until that party was taken over by the Obamamania, Pelosi, Clinton-worshiping crowd. I am a political loner.Atlas Shrugged is a beautiful story about the possibilities of the human spirit. It is about adhering to an exalted vision of man's potential, and the deepest sense of a love of life that comes with such vision. The basis of this outlook is the rigorous application of Reason as man's greatest gift, his only tool of survival and success in all areas of life. It is the proper exercise of Reason that is at the foundation of how he defines and applies his intellectual ability, his moral code, his sense of justice, his personal comportment and how he utimately find the one person--the ultimate object of desire--he will and can only love. She, Rand, defined this philosophy as \\"rational self-interest\\". Please note the word \\"rational\\" before \\"self-interest\\". She does not mean the 'self-interest' of those who have no Self--i.e. the foam-at-the-mouth wimps--both rich and poor--in her books.It is a heroic view of life, one with a great sense of the dignity of man. The Kirsches of the world sneer at this kind of thing for one reason and one reason only: they don't believe it possible in themselves so they don't believe it possible for anyone. Given the state of jadedness and cynicism pervading most of our \\"cultural\\" standards today, this is to be expected.The writing in the novel and its structure are exquisite. She repeats, but has to, given the scope of the work. She masterfully pulls together suspenseful, well-paced events and introspective flashbacks with complex, interlocking themes, interlocking storylines, profound, but never boring technological data (she did her homework), peak, dramatic scenes of high crises, and then orchestrates these elements into the novel's brisk, smart closing scenes, all the while keeping the whole vessel together with an overriding, consistent philosophy. The psychological portraits of her characters is masterly. There are several scenes of sheer beauty and emotional poignancy: the childhood of Dagny and Francisco, the first journey of the John Galt Line (the scene that made a Random House editor rave over the manuscript), the coal-engine tunnel disaster, the college-student assistant who dies in Hank Rearden's arms, John Galt confessing to Dagny that he wanted to be a world success like Rearden....these, and many more.It has been said, like Kirsch writes, that her characters are \\"abstractions\\". No one can be so \\"emotionally repressed\\", no one can be so infallible, so self-possessed, or to coast off into eloquent speeches at the drop of a dime. These characters--\\"cartoon characters\\" in the words of the Garfield fan, Mr. Kirsch--would be more 'real' (hey, man), of course, if their language were strewn with obscenities, if they broke down and whimpered in times of crises, if they had sex indiscriminately with any breathing body at the bar that night; if they joined hands around Wyatt's Fire to sing ' Kumbaya' and ask that Jesus and Buddha both help in lobbying efforts to move the supply base of Taggart Transcontinental to a slave labor camp in China.Rand depicts what excellent human composure consists of: emotional control as a means of keeping one's focus and mental balance in life (Not 'repression'--there are many many scenes of \\"emotion\\" in her main characters); being well-spoken in order to use words properly and to convey thoughts in a clear, precise manner (she fought her editors to keep the language \\"elevated\\". She maintained that debased language was for graffiti on subway walls, not books, and I would agree). The aristocratic manner of some of her characters (Dagny and Francisco) is meant to demonstrate the type of steely discipline and personal calm that best works in face of the onslaughts of stupidity and sloppiness around one.We have all known James Taggarts or Lillian Readens or Robert Stadlers. The Eddie Willers type is familiar to us as well. But so is Hank Rearden. And we have somewhere met the Dagny type and the Francisco type. The latter is difficult to imagine for one reason only: that he was, apparently, exclusively loyal all those years to a Dagny he rarely saw. Given that he is depicted as one of the best looking men on earth, one of the wealthiest and, last but not least, Argentine (i.e. the Latin lover image), it is \\"impossible\\" to imagine him so chaste. Fine. But his type--his elegance and self-certainty and \\"mocking pride\\", many of us have seen in certain kinds of men. The \\"severity\\" of Galt, meanwhile, is partially for the effect of literary drama. But given what he represents, his characterization could not have been otherwise. Do we know Galts? I think that the \\"millionaire next door\\" type is the real-life version of him: the serious, determined, \\"hidden\\", American-dream worker who is carrying the burden of the nation's wealth....One should also note that her heroic characters are inventors, engineers, a conservative investor, a philosopher, and an artist (a composer). Her \\"Capitalism\\"--the application of a man's Reason to preserve his material well-being, security and enjoyment in life--is that of rigid intellectual application. It is not Bernie Madoff, Wall Street meltdow hey-day anything-goes \\"capitalism\\". It is why many of her villans are businessmen. This essential difference is one that has remained strangely elusive to many if not most critics.About the sex in this book. In Mr. Kirsch's \\"review\\", he boyishly, gleefully notes right away that part of the \\"mass appeal\\" of this work consists of Rand's vivid sex scenes. Now, c'mon folks. In a book that is some 1100 pages long, I counted about four, and these about a paragraph or two long. There are no crude mechanics described, no florid description of them pwivate pawts, no shrill aches and pains detailed ad nauseum. The \\"sexual struggle\\" aspect in which Rand pits Dagny and her devoted male suitors (three of them in her 37 years, no slut is she) is meant to highlight their conquest of a heroine. I found the sex scenes to be very well done, and at times, beautiful. These were men who represented Dagny's sense of life, and the sexual dimension a celebration of that.On this note, one of the most beautiful \\"theories\\" on the meaning of love between a man and a woman is to be found in Francisco's speech to Hank Rearden on that subject, after Rearden, the one hero who struggles with self doubt, asserts that sex and a man's value or spirit are two separate categories. Read Fransicso's respose, I think it is one of the most lovely, poignant comments on the meaning of sex, ever.Then of course there is John Galt's speech. Read it at its own sitting, it is wonderful. Kirsch, pounding away at the favorite mantra of his and his ilk, writes that the speech \\"makes Gordon Gekko's look like the Sermon on the Mount\\". Really, where? Where does it sound like that? In its defense of using your brains? In asserting that enduring money and success cannot exist without integrity and honesty? In telling men of 18 hour days and entrepreneurial risk to stick to their convictions and not give into the pallaver of \\"public policy\\" that breaks their backs in order to prop up incompetence? ( Mysteriously Mr. Kirsch gives no example of these GG-like comparisons--this being the Times and all where any journalist must scrupuously defend his or her points and...whatever...).Finally, no attack on Rand would be complete without a) mentioning Nathaniel (!), b) book sale comparisons to the Bible c) Bennet Cerf and d) Her \\"amphetamines\\".The lady was married fifty years, sometimes wonderful sometimes hellish. Fifty years, friends. Her husband Frank was not the intellectual giant she was but he played a very good complementary role, and even supplied the title of the book, and was her sounding board for its writing and Fountainhead, Anthem, etc. Branden came into her life at the height of the professional upswing in her life, and they had an affair that ended badly. End of story. Her critics just do not relent, it seems, in sniping away at her \\"infallibility\\", her mistake.Kirsch gloats that AS, in having the highest sales in American publishing after the Bible (so it is said), can mean only that a bunch of thick-headed commoners find as much mystical, rah-rah appeal in AS to pump up their wobbly self-regard as they do in ingesting hearty, wholesome fare from the Gospels. Yawn. Note the snide, second-hand elitism of a Leftish journalist who can't for a minute imagine that an intelligent reading public may be attracted--very attracted--to the convictions she espouses. Convictions one cannot otherwise voice without the Kirsches of the media or a university classroom or God knows where hurling insults at them. The Bible, of course, is an entirely separate matter. We are talking about the religion of one billion people who own and will continue to buy the Bible. This is something else. The appeal of Rand, I would argue, is on its own merits. And what Kirsch doesn't want to confront is that people might be far smarter than he thinks.Bennet Cerf and Ayn Rand became lifelong friends. The editors were ecstatic about the book and, as I wrote above, the John Galt Line scene was the selling point of the manuscript. He made the comment that he found her political philosophy \\"abhorrent\\"--at first. But he came to agree with many of her views. See Barbara Branden's biography on this. The sections on Random House and the book's publication is a wonderful read.And as for the \\"amphetamines\\".....Rand did not knowingly take any kind of narcotic. She took an appetite suppresant, so she believed, that was prescribed to her by her doctor in order to maintain the energy to write. She was constantly tired. Years later, it was discovered that what she was taking was newly categorized as an amphetamine. She stopped taking it at once. Again, this is from Barbara Branden's biography, in footnote form. But the sly Kirsch wants you to think that the moralizing grande dame was some kind of druggie.But...enough said. In grand Randian fashion, go, find out for yourself, think independently, see what the book tells you personally. It's been a great event in my life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Scott Brick does his usual superb job reading the classic.

It makes you stop and think about *your* values and what they really are."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"That book has daunted me since I was fifteen at least. It sat there,in its hugeness, in drug store paperback racks and in book stores and it just looked at me and said HA! all these years, so at the library Saturday, I found it for sale, and paid a whole dime for it, nice small print--just going to let it sit here in the house staring at me and it going HA!Thought I would try a couple of pages, and rapidly fell inside another world. Gargantuan and detailed and massively bright and evocative enough for me to see totally beyond what I had seen before. The writing is so skilled and sure handed and somehow wide eyed all at once. It is the heart of philosophy written as a gripping novel.The scope is impossibly huge. The characters are not who they seem to be, many of them, but far more, gaspingly so. I could see them. I could almost hear them breathing. A book of huge muscles. Rugged and human as fictional humans can be.The writing is a wonderful mystery science fiction character driven juggernaut that is a pleasure to read, a pleasure that comes from deep inside. It says listen to me, it says let me tell you the story of existence and does.Its philosophy would never work in \\"reality\\" but the book's world is fascinating and honestly so otherworldly, while being at the heart of this one, I felt like a meteor had crashed through and the sky rained blood--it has such sureness, such courage and ocean depth, this book, like John Gault's fantastic engine, like Atlantis is indeed real and in this novel on the map.I felt she was searching so deeply,so surely, so logically, for her own way and I was there beside her in my small brain looking at a world peopled with giants. Like socialism, objectivism would not succeed, for persons just don't work that way, and Gault would wind up being what he strove mightily against.But in this novel. God, in this novel, Atlas did shrug. And the world did tremble. And so did I. Has there ever been a dime spent so wisely? Not for me. Not ever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In case this is your first encounter with this book, It is a fresh story but a continuation to Ayn Rand's philosophy that started out with books like \\"We the living\\" where she new something was wrong but could not put her finger on it. She progressed to books as \\"The Fountainhead\\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \\"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence, your head can work without your hands yet your hands cannot work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \\"Who is John Galt?\\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \\"Atlas shrugged\\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \\"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\\" and at the same time, the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Relato con estilo muy descriptivo.

Move this one to the top of your list!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There seem to be some pretty skewed views of this book, which is to be expected I guess. I started with Anthem, then read Fountainhead, and just finished Atlas Shrugged. Fountainhead may be one of the best books I have ever read. While I loved Atlas Shrugged, half of me finished it just to finish it. I love reading Rand, however, as any Rand fan will (or at least should) admit, she can go off on rants and become extremely long winded. Galt's 60-70 page speech is a prime example. I found myself saying out loud, \\"I get it, A is A.\\"Don't get me wrong, I actually loved reading this book for the most part which is why I gave it 4 stars, however, if you are wanting to give Rand a try, I would suggest cutting your teeth on the Fountainhead instead. Its a better story line and I found myself getting involved with the characters more during the read. Not to mention its about 500 pages shorter."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I titled my review in this way to try and provide a view point that someone interested in business would be attracted to. There's a lot of rattle on about Ayn Rand's philosophy and it's all relevant but, if you simply understand that she has a philosophy she expresses through her characters and the plot of this story, but the story takes front and center stage, not the philosophy, which is easy to make an issue of.The book is beautifully written in a way that books are seldom done anymore. It develops characters and lets them develop further as the story continues, their thinking, feelings and actions so beautifully expressed. The \\"hero\\" of this book is a woman, Dagny Taggart, and the focus remains on her for most of the story. Her passion and drive are envious, her intellect even more so. She is all too human as the story shows, yet the pride of singularity and powerful self esteem are inspiring. The men that surround her; Hank Reardon and Francisco d'Anconia are male versions of her blue print in ambition, drive, intelligence and vision but coming from a different place with different baggage. The love affairs she has with these men, both physical and emotional are so magnificently described they seem almost unreal. The characters are perfect, the stage is set, the world is revolving and all is well until one day... it's not.That's when the story really begins, when people, trust and love are tested. In each case, the choice of Rand's words, the description of a thought (which might take pages to describe) are so beautifully crafted you wonder how a single person created this masterpiece work. I urge you to read it, for the love of words, for the depth of story for the escapism and for the philosophy, it's blended together in a way I have never experienced before in a single volume.You will identify with someone in this book, Me? I think I was more Hank than Francisco or Eddie. The clarity of purpose is inspiring and even possible for a while but where the \\"flaws\\" start to become evident is that it's only a story and it's called Science Fiction by most. In reality it's a love story and a capitalist dream. It's a political manifesto and a revolutionary's cook book. It's a way to think about your work life and your life in your country as a citizen. I inspired me and solidified many of my assumptions about my role in society and it made me feel damn good about my own life's accomplishments.As you read, immerse yourself and go along for the ride without judging until the end. Who is John Galt? It's every one of us who has a dream and will go to any extreme to make it real.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Bathed in cynicism and despair, the people in tough economic times such as these might rhetorically ask, \\"Who is John Galt?\\" Well, little do these people know how little they know. For they know not who John Galt is, but I do. John Galt is The Mythical Mr. Boo, who is also known as Atlas. And The Mythical Mr. Boo never shrugs, because The Mythical Mr. Boo was born without shoulders.So while he won't shoulder all the hardships, he can surely stomach the cramps of society (he is half cow on his mother's side and possesses two stomachs). So, If our current economic situation is enough to make you want to throw up, just be glad that you don't eat your own vomit, like The Mythical Mr. Boo does.Anyway, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was intellectually delicious, and I'd recommend consuming it before I'd advise you to eat a whole pasture of grass. But I will say that if you can't afford to eat beef, you might seriously consider eating grass. It's like my grandpa always used to say, \\"If you can't eat the cow, you might as well eat what the cow eats.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is difficult to find a book of fiction that has caused so much controversy as this one, and its critics have a degree of zeal that is matched by its defenders. It is a gigantic philosophical tome, with characters that many have scoffed at as being larger than life, as representing a sterile view of the human psyche, and as being nave and sophomoric in its world view. Hated in general by both conservatives and liberals, those who love the book envy those who are approaching it for the first time. It is a book for optimists; a book for those who love and celebrate life. But above all it is a book for normal people, because in the final analysis, even though its author may have viewed its characters as representing statistical outliers, as rare and distinctive visionaries who epitomize high intelligence and creativity, it represents what it means for a human to be normal.It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to want to organize themselves in a socialist state with no personal rights and no freedom to make their own way. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to wage war and destruction against themselves and others. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to avoid responsibility for their actions and blame others for their failures. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to hypothesize an imaginary deity and prostrate themselves in contemplation of it. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to serve others without question and with no mutual respect. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to sit still, to lose their kinetic energy, both physical and mental, and not overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.Humans are in a state of normalcy when they create, build, think, and prosper, and unashamed when they are doing so. This novel, now appearing in print for fifty years, asks the reader to contemplate what would happen if the most creative and industrious of humans were to withdraw from society and leave it to those who took on the grotesqueness of inaction, envy, and sterile diatribes of socialist thought. It asks the reader to contemplate what it takes to have a productive, healthy, comfortable, technological society. Whose intelligence and entrepreneurial alertness are in full operation in such a society and what are the consequences if these are extinguished by the voluntary withdrawal of those who possess them?The philosophical dialog one can find in this book has drawn the ire of many an academic philosopher and politician. The reviews of the book when it was first published fifty years were probably the most vituperative of all in print. But vehemence towards the book has not extinguished its relevance or its power to instigate critical reflection. It is an alternative view of ethics, one that dignifies human individuality and self-interest. It is an ethic that abhors the initiation of force and worships human ingenuity. The philosophical dialog inked on its pages is a testament to the center of human optimism, and it is a perfect reflection and celebration of human normalcy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As many people have written this book changed my life.

The reason Atlas no longer needs to shrug is because of this book by Ayn Rand.There are signs everywhere that Ayn Rand and her philosophy, Objectivism, is slowly but surely changing the culture of the United States and the world. There are people speaking out in virtually every major newspaper, there are radio shows on the air every day bringing the voice of reason to their listeners, there have been leading Objectivist intellectuals on popular TV shows, there are even several major universities now starting philosophy programs to study Objectivism, and the internet has hundreds if not thousands of websites dedicated to Ayn Rand and her ideas. The media department at the Ayn Rand Institute. is being consulted more and more often by news outlets that wouldn't even have given Rand a second thought 10 years ago.No, Atlas does not need to shrug... the burden of bad ideas is growing smaller and smaller every day thanks to the ground-breaking philosophy in Ayn Rands novel \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Let's ignore the philosophy - Objectivism as a system isn't very well thought-out, and (which is worse) simply won't stand up to many empirical tests. But that's not the point here.Viewed strictly as literature - as a reading experience that offers the kind of rational, difficult pleasures that we term &quot;aesthetic&quot; - _Atlas Shrugged_ gets three stars. I resist the temptation to become a partisian for or against the novel. The novel displays Ayn Rand's characteristic strengths - a skill in plot construction and in handling immense casts of characters through lively incidents. It also displays a number of characteristic weaknesses: heavy-handedness, _loaded_ didacticism (I'm not against didacticism if it's cool and controlled, but clearly Rand can't take opposing arguments that way) and hardly any sense of humor.One of the things that might grate about the novel is its schematization, which is laid out almost mathematically - many of the &quot;good&quot; characters have opposing &quot;evil&quot; characters, doppelgangers matched by profession: Hugh Askton/Pritchett, Rearden/Boyle, Richard Halley/Mort Liddy - there are numerous others. But that needs to be understood as part of the novel's method: the &quot;evil&quot; characters are in fact evil doubles in a Manichean mythology: complete with its prophet, John Galt (who somebody says might as well have emerged full-grown from Zeus's head - Rand's unhappy views on families are influential here) its New Jersusalem, Galt's Gulch, and its Apocalypse, which quite thoroughly and exactly separates the sheep from the goats. So enjoy it on that archetypeal level, and don't wish for the same kind of full-blooded reading of the human condition that one might find in Henry James or Jane Austen. These aren't real people - the way in which Rearden and Francisco both happily give up Dagny to Galt is the act of humans giving way to a god's perogative, not the actions of biologically normal males.Incidentally, the text also displays the great extent that Hollywood played in shaping Rand's imagination - the apparatus of tuxes and evening gowns and of material luxury prominently. (There's a certain fetishistic dimension to it - check out the mink scene with Rearden and Dagny.)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The logic of Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged is flawless. The Statement A is A is profound yet so basic. The disappointing thing about the book is that all those individuals who should read it never will. For a confirmed liberal mind to absorb this material they would have to suspend any logic whatsoever to be able to deny its truths. They would have to say A is not A.It is no wonder that in all my years of schooling I never had this book presented to me. It tears at the status quo with a vengence and yet leaves the reader with an undeniable understanding of truth based on logic.The only reason that I only gave it four stars is that Ayn Rand took over 1000 pages to weave this tale. Which in itself is not bad, but she easily could have sliced it by a third without compromising any of the story or message. Regardless I highly recommend this book if you desire to know what makes things work in a society and what things will always destroy it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I just reread this book after I read that TNT was getting ready to make a miniseries and wanted casting suggestions. It was even better than I remembered.How about Antonio Banderas for Frisco? Harrison Ford for Reardon? Anthony Hopkins for Jim Taggert? Val Kilmer for the pirate? Susan Sarandon for Lillian Taggert? Nicole Kidman for Dagny? Dylan McDermott for Galt? (if only Redford and Newman were younger).Please offer some ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Literary masterpiece, it ain't. Her writing style is dreadful, melodrama oozing from each exchange of the one-dimensional characters. Although the story itself is intriguing, she really knows how to make a short story very long. Skip a few hundred pages in the middle; you'll feel better if you do, and you won't miss anything in the process.Novel philosophy, it is. It's usually more difficult for me to take the 'greed is good' credo seriously, but Ms. Rand makes a compelling case for it. Problem is, this reader was still left with the queasy suspicion that something about the argument was terribly wrong. In speaking of volition and free will, she leaves no room for faith and reason to coexist. And she puts forth the theory that the 'most evil' is done by moderate men; compromises are intolerable. But in a world where people have different minds, compromise is a tool of necessity. It's tempting to imagine living in our own personal Galt's Gulch, surrounded by people who think and feel exactly as we do, but what fun would there be in that kind of life?This book challenges conventional thinking, but ends up pushing readers into answers they should have puzzled through for themselves."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you don't have a conceptual mind, you will find this book boring, like most of the negative reviewers you will only focus on the events that happen throughout the book, (and it is a long book) instead of processing the ideas presented. And that's what this book is all about. I didn't find the story too good but keeping in mind that it serves as a vehicle for a great achievement (if not the highest) in the field of ideas makes it my favorite. A big mistake some people make when reading this book is that they compare it with the state of the world today, and will say it's too fictional, or if it's fiction how can it apply to our real lives?, it applies because the ideas in it are rational, logical (without contradicitions) and If you find a contradiction the problem is the premisses you have accepted, but not the book. this book tells you not how things are but the way they oughta be.

My great relief was to finally turn the last page. Free at last, free at last.......! I readmostly to learn and I hoped to glean from this behemoth a smattering of wisdom from Any Rand, but the messages were of limited value and delivered as pontification with a distinct lack of clarity. Such people could not exist; such philosophies could not coexist within any reasonable society except at a personal level; such governing structure could not exist---ours has evolved into a much more sophisticated and intricately viscous and manipulating form (choose any present government). One gets the impression that not only does Rand disassociate herself from society, but dislikes or even loathes it, seeing herself as superior to itand capable of repairing all its shortcomings, yet her \\"heroic\\" characters, all of a generic aryan bent, lift nary a finger to either stop perceived injustices, or maliciouspreditors---instead, divorcing themselves from such social ills and surreptitiously working behind the scenes to undermine society as a whole and effect its totalcollapse, of course with ambitions of rebuilding society in their own image---the godlike perfection, as defined by Rand herself and therefore intrinsically andmorally consumate and Utopian. Curiously she ends to book after dragging out the story for 1168 pages, without giving us a clue as to how to rebuild the new\\"shining\\" society. She does not recognize that man is a social creature which by definition entails social shortcoming as well as achievement. While, as she suggests,not our brother's keeper, we are our brother's brother and sometimes our brother's custodian by default, although I strongly am against overdoing it with unsolicitedor exaggerated assistance, but who does not espouse a well-needed, occasional helping handing? Reading a 10-20 page synopsis will encapsulate Rand's message,which in part, I do agree with, but skip the opus and seek wisdom elsewhere."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The typeface on this book is extremely small.

They believe that without them, the rest of us would perish; that we NEED them. they are clearly very sick individuals; egomaniacs to say the least!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After committing myself to this large and mythological classic, I was fully prepared for the leap into the intellectual \`objectivism' philosophy that this work is famous for and the subsequent work that it would require along with the requisite deep contemplative thinking on my part to thoughtfully compose a sort of treatise full of sublime exposition and comparisons of Rand's profound thinking of mid 1950's anti-Communistic culture to today's society that then would garner some meaning or warning of her prescient \`50's offering of industrial collapse and political/governmental control to today's oligarchy. Instead, I'm completely under impressed with this professed philosophy but somewhat surprisingly over impressed with her literary ability in Atlas Shrugged. Ayn Rand, encompassing the stereotypical Russian novelist's capacity to pen an intriguing story, is seriously overrated here in her philosophical deportment but, instead, provides a monolithic literary allegory to the industrial tribulations of early 1950's America if it had proceeded McCarthy-esque towards the then believed socialistic dominated society that pervaded in those heady days.As one internalizes this work, its important to realize that this was, in fact, written at a time when most U.S. government officials were being persecuted for dubious behavior and that a feeling of socialistic overthrow was being warmongered by the nefarious Joe McCarthy. A natural outcome, then, for a novelist of that time with a political and purported philosophical bent would be to fictionalize what an America would look like if it slowly slid into a socialistic dominated economic downturn. Interject some good guys (viz. extremely idealistic and hard working Americans) who are determined to do away with this vile predominance and the inferior intellect implanted in those making these decisions and you have Atlas Shrugged in a nutshell. The politics, philosophy, indeed the intellectual worthiness of this dated work is rather silly when read in a contemporaneous context and those who attempt to garner meaning or, worse, attempt comparisons of this work to today's society are somewhat short sighted and possibly under exposed to the issues of today.The worth of this book, then, is the literary content. True the characters have been historically criticized as shallow and one-dimensional and I'll not argue those examinations, but I will say that Mrs. Rand had an amazing ability for detail and to nuance settings such that the 1200 pages made for somewhat pleasant reading. Her mosaic scene settings of inner city New York, with all its grime and haze are brilliantly balanced with an open western wilderness. Building of railroad track through mountainous climes gives Rand a large literary swath to work with and parts of these scenes are indeed breathtaking.But these rigid characters are terrifyingly empty...so bad that one is mystified why this work continues to carry meaning today. The main protagonists, Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden (the avowed good guys) are overly idealistic, but are presented in such a depressing tableau as to appear heroic. Others, like Dagny's brother James, Rearden's wife Lillian and a host of superficial industrial leaders, are depicted in an arcane, predictable and seemingly overly socialist manner as to leave no doubt as to Rand's intentions. And the amazingly contrived Francisco d'Anconia, he of the preponderously long, shallow and abstract speeches that go on for pages and say essentially nothing appears to be Rand's philosophical outlet. This \`objectivism', as stated in the dystopian backdrop of the story, is the mindset whereby one's ability, intelligence, drive and motivation are the driving force for the capitalistic society that America should strive to be. These intellectually light, socialist leaning buffoons who somehow gain an edge into leadership, succeed in driving the capable leaders out and they then \`stop the engine of the world' by organizing their collective brainpower to overcome the \`communists' who've taken a foothold on our economy. Rand's surmise is that capitalism is good and right and communism is bad and she goes to great literary lengths to persuade us of this axiom.The problem is that this is revelatory for late 1950's readers, not now. Those who extract meaning or try to imply that this is a referendum on our society today, really haven't read this book. Trying to compare overt government spending and liberal vs. conservative battles on the national deficit to this flawed and dated slide into communism is naive. My suggestion is to read this for the literary gain, but go elsewhere for the philosophy and certainly the polictics."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read this book when I was in college.

Ayn Rand was idealistic but that's okay, it's a great book and everyone should read it at least once."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A huge fan of anything by Ayn Rand, and Atlas Shrugged in particular. She is one of the very few authors that leaves no one indifferent. Some bow before her intellect and courage, others hate her for them. Interestingly though, those who hate her, generally have not read her, and usually flat out refuse to read her (not all, of course). Her ideas are like a beam of light, once you shine them on your own mind there's no escaping of the skeletons that have been buried there.Having said that, I'd caution anyone from falling into the semi-religious \\"Randite\\" cult. The woman was brilliant, but she certainly had some, shall we say, odd ideas. For example, if you like music in the minor key or enjoy pretty much any kind of folk music, according to her theory (The Romantic Manifesto), you're an imbecile. She considered homosexuality immoral. (For an atheist who claimed to be guided solely by reason, that's quite a statement.)Atlas Shrugged though, makes my top ten books ever written list."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The problem with writing a review of this book is knowing where to start. The story is enticing; the hundreds of pages will turn themselves. The philosophy is thought out to extreme detail, it will change the way you think no matter what your opinion of it is. The writing style is masterful; there is not a single wasted sentence. The novel has the single greatest female protagonist of all time. The strength of the heroes in this book will make you want to be great. The only qualm I have heard about the book (philosophical differences aside) is that the heroes are to ideal. That is the very point of this novel. Meritocracy only exists because people have accepted it as a fact of life.

I took this book on as a summer-read from a right wing fundamentalist, fully expecting to disagree with the philosophical side, but to my surprise, it shapes the way I feel about a majority of modern day issues. By the end, I had fallen so deeply in to this book; it felt like I was parting with an old friend when I finally put it down. Although I have a terrific image of all the characters in my minds eye, there will be an Atlas Shrugged movie coming out in 2008 staring Angelina Jolie that I will definitely not miss. So if you're just reading this as a prelude to the movie, or you are interested in objectivism, I HIGHLY recommend this to any and all; it was terrific."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Looking through the reviews below, it is not suprising that they run the gamut. This book can and should be read on many levels.Atlas Shrugged was offered to the world as Miss Rand's grand exposition of her philosophy of Objectivism. Unlike most philosophical novels, it is offered as something of a mystery story, revolving around Dagney Taggart's struggle to save Taggart Transcontinental railways. As if the task wasn't big enough, she's puzzled by the out-of-the-blue disappearance of brilliant businessmen. Their businesses fold and they vanish, just like that. Why? This is the book on it's first level. That of a completely enthralling mystery.The second level is as a philisophical discussion. Relativism v. objectivism (small 'o'), faith v. reason, self-reliance v. government paternalism and the nature of man- to name a few- are given treatment. All I should say here is that while the discussion (usually through first-rate dialogue) can seem throrough to the uninitiated, Rand certainly tends to misrepresent views she disagrees with- not just in Atlas Shrugged, but in the complete body of her work.This brings us to the third level of the novel. Not just a discussion of philosophy, but of Objectivism. Especially towards the end when we enter 'Galt's gulch', we see Miss. Rands vision of the future. It is exciting, to say the very least.So there are the three levels. The novel tends to be known as an exposition of Objectivism but I would urge the reader to read Atlas Shrugged first as a gripping story. When I came to the novel, I'd already read Rand's non-fiction, Peikoff's &quot;Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand&quot; and Chris Sciabbara's &quot;Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical.&quot; If the reader wants simply an exposition of Objectivism only, she would do best to pick up Peikoff and Sciabbara first. As a novel however, there is seldom a 1,000+ page book more gripping and provocative. I think it took me about a week and I'm a medium paced reader.As a footnote, I am a former objectivist. The reason I feel it important to mention is that as other reviewers note, to the uninitiated, this novel can become something of an obsession. If this is the first philosophy a reader experiences, she might hesitate to read more philosophy, partly because of Miss Rand's erroneous depiction of other philosophers- namely pragmatism and Kantian philosophy. This is the position I found myself in and as other reviewers attest, it is not uncommon. If a reader finds themselves in that position, two good books to read (it might hurt a bit, but trust me) would be Karl Popper's &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot; and Antony Flew's &quot;Introduction to Western Philosophy.&quot; While I'm still in a great degree of sympathy with most of Rand's philosophy, there is a wealth of great philosophy out there."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I though this was a great story and I loved the characters in it.

The author has first hand knowledege from her own experiences in the early Soviet Union. The first 90% of the book is absolutely top notch. Many of the characters in the book fit current real life figures so well that it is hard to believe that it was written almost 50 years ago.

I'm saying this, because in the interests of integrity, your politics are going to dictate your feelings on this book. Chances are, if you're on the right, you're going to love it, and if you're on the left, you're going to hate it and term it \\"hateful.\\" Such is the nature of our world. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't really hear about this book until I was 40, because I was taught, and raised by leftists. But I read it at a critical point in my life. The book and the philosophy of objectivism revolve around people who create, learn something new everyday, take risks, make bold decisions, hate bureaucracy, and the way they are treated. Nietzsche-like definitely. I wouldn't say hateful, I would say emotionless, and detached. Anyway, we sometimes call these guys the go-to guys, because if you need something done, you go to them. If they can't do it, they figure out a way. Sometimes they're industrialists, sometimes they're janitors. Most organizations have only one, or a very few of them. Some like Southwest Airlines, the Special Forces, and the Marines have them all over the place. They are NOT necessarily CEOs, they're the CEOs that built the company, or keep it going with innovation and common sense. And sometimes they are not happy about being used by some knucklehead CEO, or executive who got there by kissing butt, or some knucklehead in Washington who can't make a decision. Apparently, knuckleheads were not in short supply in the 50's, and there is a never-ending source of knucklehead supply in 2005. So, this book is really about the go-to guys getting fed up with the way they are treated by the knuckleheads, and withdrawing from society. And hey, guess what? Things fall apart, cause there's nobody else to go-to anymore. There's a lot more to it than that, of course. And there is a LONG-ASS speech towards the end. I recommend skimming that thing, if ya haven't got the gist of it by then, go-to somebody and have \`em do it for you. And if you are on the right, we have our share of knuckleheads too. Believing in a philosophy, and practicing it are very different things."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Since there are so many misconceptions and mischaracterizations regarding this book, I thought it warranted clarification. Count me as one well-educated (JD, MBA) adult (40 years old), who can write a review with no spelling errors and no sense of anger, despite the protestations of many of these reviews.Atlas Shrugged represents a positive, life-affirming philosophy. It stands for the proposition that each individual exists for his own sake and owes nothing to his fellow man. This does not mean that people can't or shouldn't work together, or that those of us who endorse Rand's philosophy don't want to work together. It simply means that we demand nothing from other people, just as others should demand nothing from us. Contrary to the common misconceptions regarding Rand's philosophy, practical application of this doctrine would result in a highly productive, inter-connected world of voluntary interaction, not one of self-inflicted isolation.The most difficult concept for people to grasp is that the alternative to the coercion which Rand opposes is NOT isolation. Rather, it is VOLUNTARY interaction. Capitalism is indeed an unknown ideal because it represents the ultimate freedom and liberty. It simply says that man is free to enter into any voluntary relationships he chooses, and that he will not be forced to enter into any which he does not choose.Here is the other common misconception: eliminating mandatory support systems (e.g. welfare, public education, wealth redistribution) will NOT mean that disadvantaged people will be left to fend for themselves. Every individual will always have the right to form private organizations to accomplish the same goals. Count me as one who endorses certain voluntary support mechanisms - just not the mandatory ones that we currently have.The bottom line is that Rand's philosophy is positive. If you don't come away from reading Atlas Shrugged with a wonderful sense of life, you have misunderstood the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Most of the hundreds of reader reviews are quite accurate about the individualistic, rationally egoistic, life-affirming philosophy that Rand conveys in this book -- and that goes for those who both love and hate her work. What few have discussed at any length are the merits of &quot;Atlas&quot; as fiction.If you are interested in encountering Rand as a provocative author and literary stylist -- and it's an eminently worthwhile desire -- this is not the book with which to begin. Her earlier novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1943) is notably superior to &quot;Atlas&quot; (1957) in character shaping, plot construction, setting, and dramatic tension.&quot;Atlas&quot; changed, while Rand was planning it, from a straightforward story -- about the creators of value withdrawing from society -- to a project that entailed the description of a &quot;moral revolution,&quot; as Nathaniel Branden termed it. Rand felt the need to make the essence of her philosophy more explicit and detailed, in order to properly depict her heroic characters and what they believed.Was that a genuine need? Within fiction, that is? Not in the wake of what she'd created earlier. The courtroom speech by Roark in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; ended up genuinely dramatizing the essence of her philosophy, in how it was connected to the events of her plot, and in how it alluded to those Roark had defended or opposed. It didn't sit apart from the events that created the main conflict. The similar climactic speech in &quot;Atlas,&quot; by contrast, is a piece existing on its own (though superbly self-integrated in its philosophic aims). It's set apart from the rest of her story, and unlike the shorter speeches of others earlier in the plot, it's not genuinely linked to the main events and characters.This isn't a minimal distinction. With a few minor exceptions (some polemical pamphlets), Rand wrote fiction exclusively until 1955, by which time she had worked on &quot;Atlas&quot; for nine years. When she turned at that point to the major speech (itself requiring two years to formulate and write), she shifted gears and aimed her writing skills at the exposition of philosophy, not at dramatizing plots. She couldn't sustain her work of writing in both ways at the same time.This makes &quot;Atlas&quot; into two books, not one. The book with a plot surrounds the book-length major speech in the heart of Part Three. One can see the rising and falling lines of Rand's talents, as she shifted interests. The most vivid and moving episode in the plot-book immediately precedes The Speech. (Rearden and the attack on his factory, and the young boy who attempts to prevent it.) The most conventional and least original plotting immediately follows The Speech and continues to the end of the novel, with almost visible efforts to tie up loose plot ends. (And in a use of overly transparent allegories, such as the main character being &quot;crucified,&quot; albeit on a torture machine.)To know this road map helps in negotiating what is a long and yet rewarding fictional path. Don't mistake me: Even when the plot was below her best efforts, Rand's dramatic sense exceeds all her contemporaries, and hearkens back to Hugo in its concentration of effects. Yet this book attempts to bridge the gap between fiction and philosophy, and ends up being a weaker effort in both areas. Rand wrote better fiction earlier, and (The Speech aside) better philosophy later.&quot;Atlas&quot; is Dagny Taggart's story, much as &quot;TF&quot; was Howard Roark's. Rand was more adept at finding the greatness in human beings by looking at men than at women. She made little attempt to hide this point in her later nonfiction writings and interviews. Introspection was not her strong suit. This didn't mean that she was bad at it -- for Dagny is an intricate, passionate, complex character, the most compelling by far of Rand's female protagonists. Yet this woman writer fit better by far within the &quot;skin&quot; of a man such as Roark.The secondary characters in &quot;Atlas,&quot; with the exception of Francisco d'Anconia and his sardonic wit, don't match up to the detail and quality of those in the earlier book. The men in &quot;Atlas&quot; who sell their souls, such as Boyle, Ferris, and Stadler, are far less compelling and chilling than the delicate balance shown in Peter Keating, in Rand's earlier novel. Too many of those appearing on either moral side in &quot;Atlas&quot; shade into caricature, whether in Rand's descriptions or in their immersion into plot twists. The main hero of &quot;Atlas,&quot; Hank Rearden, accepts far too many blows from those who are being parasites upon his values -- too many, that is, for a man possessing the strength of intellect that he is shown to use. By contrast, the earlier book's Gail Wynand, who is far less moral in what he has done, knows his weaknesses and is more realistically self-aware.&quot;Atlas&quot; is set in an undefined time in the future, and the science-fiction touches have fallen short in 40 years (watch for the 35-inch TV set). The backbone of the story, using passenger railroads, also threatens to be anachronistic. Yet if a bit of &quot;alternate universe&quot; sensibility is used, thinking of this as a world of might-have-been that's even more bleak than our own, it becomes less of an obstacle to the present-day reader.All of this aside, &quot;Atlas&quot; is a compelling, challenging, and dramatic work of fiction. If you want to genuinely understand Rand's strengths as a fiction artist, though, begin with her earlier novels.And when you do read &quot;Atlas,&quot; read it for the plot. Don't let the 70-page major speech slow you down ... skip it if you wish, absorb the essence of the plot, and then encounter it on your second reading. As with all of Rand's work, the perceptive reader will want to encounter it a second time, if only to appreciate the workings of her mind and the skills of a master dramatist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read ... intelligent, well-written, thought-provoking, suspenseful ... overall, it was refreshing to read such an original point of view. It really surprises me that I went through my entire education and was not exposed to the writings of Ayn Rand ... this should be required reading for all students."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"An intriguing book but one with which I could not connect with those who would raise it to the level of being one of the greatest novels ever. A thought provoking book, yes, but one whose philosophical message gets blurred by the weight of author Ayn Rand's own writing.Dagny Taggart and John Galt are intriguing characters. However, everyone else is either very good and brilliant or very evil and dim-witted. I can understand why Ms Rand did this but that polarization became so extreme that the characters became ridiculous and thus greatly diminished Ms Rand philosophical thrust.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is generally predicated on the concept that in a deteriorating society those who are most capable of saving it would choose to withdraw and allow the system to fail. Perhaps this is a direct result of Ms Rand's own personal Russian experiences. However, in this society the captains of industry rise, confront and prevail. I understand that this is a fictional work but not buying into the book's premise made the novel difficult to connect with.Lastly, I had a problem with Ms Rand's need to constantly drive home her message and philosophy by relentlessly repeating them. The sheer number of those redundancies became exceedingly tiresome and contributed greatly to the book's 1,168 pages.Overall, I liked the novel and am I glad that I read it. But despite all of the critical acclaim \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" has received I still could not connect with it being considered one of the greatest novel ever."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although it is a long read, I loved listening to it on audiobook.

She is a fantastic philosopher for any time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand's family owned a successful pharmacy in Russia, the story goes, and the egalitarian-entitlementarian communists thought it unfair that such crass capitalism should be going on in &#34;Anatevka.&#34; So, the people's party used the Russian version of Imminent Domain and took over so that the Rands would be free of their drudgery and better able to enjoy the socialist republic. American &eacute;migr&eacute; Ayn Rand's memories burned ever after and resulted in Atlas Shrugged and other cautionary tales about big governments slouching implacably toward totally egalitarian ash heaps of equally shared misery. Through her writing, Rand describes a philosophy that came to be called Objectivism, which promotes rational self-interest and laissez-faire capitalism. Somewhat dated, but still poignant, Atlas Shrugged is a futuristic peek at an American governmental dystopia in which the few remaining successful business people, those that carried the weight of the economies on their shoulders, one by one shrugged and just disappeared, and where John Galt announced that he would stop the motors of the world. Did he succeed? Better grab a copy and find out. Ayn Rand's works are more important today than ever before."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Everyone should read this book!

Of course Ayn Rand deals in extremes. Her pictures are black and white only without any shade. I can identify myself with her partially, but not totally. Too much government is bad for everybody, rich or poor because government does know about collectecting money (taxes), but in most cases is unable to spend it correctly. Same thing with people: the ones who do not know how to make it, not only do spend other peoples money (social security) wrongly but start depending on it and asking for more without making an own effort to improve their situation. I'm not against helping the poor and needy, but a strict control is absolutely necessary. I'm considering myself a democrat, but do share at least partially the worries of the republicans."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book in high school 20 years ago and thought it was time to read it again because of it's relevance to todays society.

Or, could it be that anyone who even slightly steers away from the norm is a heretic and should not be allowed to publish their thoughts? How closed minded could anyone be?ATLAS SHRUGGED is a story that is nothing short of brilliant. Is it a long read? Yes. Does Ms. Rand have her philosophy/ views and does she fervently believe in them? Of course. Is it wrong to write about them? No. Unless something has changed, we are all allowed the freedom of choices and beliefs as well as the benefit to talk about them. What ATLAS SHRUGGED discusses may not be for everybody but that must not take away from the amazing story that is introduced to the readers. Nor should it deride the genius of the plotting or the exhausting depth of imagination that went into creating the characters introduced here.Years after reading the novel, images, sentences, words and thoughts will flood back to you: The new type of motor; A couple who disobey the accepted rules and eat when they are hungry, sleep when they are tired; The concert pianist who vanishes after his apex concert; The story of the railroad line and its meanings to all involved with it. Captivating imagery told to us by a true professional who believed in every word she wrote. Furthermore, history has told us that Ayn Rand never deferred to the whims of others. She knew her mind and, long before liberation was mentioned, stood up for her beliefs as well as herself. This steel casing of determination is indoctrinated into her vivid characters as they face the daily challenges as they practice their beliefs.Of course no one can force a person to believe something and I do not think that Ayn Rand is trying to do that here as much as she is explaining her values. Ms. Rand's dedication to her way of life is presented to us in a well formatted way. The characters are intricately drawn and the situations, as they are introduced, never lower themselves to the soap opera level.From John Galt to the hidden valley, ATLAS SHRUGGED is a literate carpet that asks the readers to at least try to understand what the author accepts as logic. Rather than blunt preaching, Ayn Rand wove her personal viewpoint into a story that is captivating. This novel can be taken as a blueprint for altruism (even Reverend Normal Vincent Peale discussed the art of selfishness at some points in one's life) as well as a frank argument on what happens when a radical set of thoughts is unleashed onto the public. By putting it into a tale about Dagny Taggert and John Galt, Ms. Rand has taken us away from text book logic and given us her ideas of how her beliefs would work in modern society.All I can say is, don't get hung up on trying to accept the author's creed if it upsets you that much. Respect her and her rights to establish her own views. While you are at it, enjoy the practical, entertaining and down-right fascinating way she tells the story. BRAVO!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The reason why, is that for the great majority of people this book will remain in their mind for life. Some readers will really like it, some will really hate it, but almost all will toss it around in their heads from time to time. The fact that there are so many reviews, just about as many on amazon.com as there are pages in the book itself, testifies that it may be worth reading. Most authors should be so lucky!The task of reading \\"Atlas\\" is, well, quite a task. Long, and often more twisty that seems necessary, one could call this story one of those \\"acquired tastes.\\" But acquire the taste you almost certainly will. Stick with the first 40 pages, and the rest falls into place more easily. As in the title of this review, the style of \\"Atlas\\" is supposed to be what the author called \\"high romantic.\\" To most readers, this comes across as characters talking to each other UNlike real people do today. That does make the dialog odd, for the most part. There is the occasionally refreshing movie-talk like, \\"...dying for me ..., and now I want you to do something even harder: I want you to live for me.\\" Jimmy Stewart reigns! Then again, let us remind ourselves that this is fiction, and fictional characters and storylines almost always deviate from real stuff to make either a good tale, or a good point. The fact that Rand manages to do both by the end is what will make this book memorable long after finishing. Oh yes, and quite a bit of the science and technology in the story will cause the more engineering-minded readers to chuckle over some of the improbable things that Rand wants nature to do. So do most science fiction books, so just ignore it and move along.For those fans of Rand's other famous work, \\"Fountainhead,\\" it is worth crediting Roark's \\"fire\\" speech at his jury trial as better spoken than John Galt's enormous 50-pager near the end of \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" when he was commanding the world to writhe in their vile dumbness. Lots, lots shorter too. When you get this book to read, though, make yourself go through the Galt harangue also. Just thinking about how to shorten his speech effectively will be at least one thing that will stick with you for life!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"IN the introduction to this book, Leonard Peikoff, cited as the world's most prominent Rand scholar, points out that Rand viewed her novels as worlds within themselves-- a fact that would probably mean that Rand would discourage any such introduction-- she would prefer that the reader experience her world on their own.This book, in terms of message and sheer plot, stands out to me as the most magnificently fantastic book that I have ever read. In saying this, I think it's prudent to explicate the root of the word fantastic-- the book is, no doubt, a fantasy--however, a fantasy that inspires fear as well as hope.If you are new to Rand, and objectivism, it is important that you read this book expecting that you will not agree with everything that is presented. I, no doubt, cannot totally identify with a large amount of what Ms. Rand says. However, when you find yourself immersed in the world that she has created, you will also, in all probability, begin to see the world around you in a new light.The book's protagonists are unbelievably developed, and the plot is meticulously detailed. The book is surely long at 1200 pages, but, minus a few sixty page monologues, you hardly notice the length, just the awe that begins to develop when you contemplate that the work you are reading resulted from one person.I cannot express the admiration that I feel for Ayn Rand, for I feel that a piece of John Galt has been left within me for the rest of my life. It might be a task for a busy college student to re-tackle this 1200 page mammoth, but I think it's worth the effort.Who is John Galt? I think that he is a beacon of hope, and a warning of what is to come. But, rest assured, that if you want the practical answer to that question, you won't mind the 1200 page journey to get there."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I finally got around to reading this one almost 40 years after my precocious eighth-grade friend found his idol in Ayn Rand, with her meritocratic philosophy known as Objectivism. At once both futuristic and set in the past, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" makes compelling points about the dangers of depending too much on one another to provide for us in the world. During the Cold War, I'm almost sure that the book would have been the anti-Communists' Bible, though some of their tactics echo those of Ms. Rand's parasitic \\"looters\\", \\"leaders\\" who sought to suck the lifeblood from talented, dedicated, and successful people like railroad magnate Dagny Taggart, steelmaker Hank Rearden, and copper baron Francisco D'Anconia. The question \\"Who is John Galt?\\" resounds throughout the first 2/3 of the book--finally we meet the great mind and inventor, who has withdrawn his skills from society and is encouraging other productive leaders to do the same. I think that libertarianism is the current analog to Objectivism--as much as I admire some of its precepts, I haven't been able to detach myself that much from the needs of others."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"one star for Rand's writing ability, which is at times very good.one star for the plot, and that the book is so very one sided, but a little blindness and fanaticism a good thing for art IMO.

There is also truth here, beneath Rand's rhetoric, and another star goes to her revelations of unpopular glories- Rand's voice in history will be felt for some time. I can forgive her unorthodox pushy outlook and the many one dimentional characters because they are kind of interesting, but not the 50+ page(!) manifesto/diatribe/yawn fest three quarters of the way through, or the slow pace!

It sent chills up my spine because this kind of thing CAN happen. I enjoyed the rich imagery she used--it was like reading a very, very good movie script.If you ever detested welfare mommies and people who think they deserve your money JUST because you have more of it, then you'll find a sympathetic voice in Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas.&quot; I took off one star only because the book is very extreme and often unrealistic in it's views.

Having said that, this is the least subtle novel I've read since &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. Rand's approach is to hammer her philosophy into the thick skulls of her readers with the literary equivalent of a 36-ounce Louisville Slugger. The characters are caricatures. The points are made repetitively. And, given that the the novel was written around 1950, her foresight with respect to industrial development (the novel is set in some undefined post-socialist future) is absolutely comical - the heroes are coal, oil, copper, steel and railroad magnates. I know what you're thinking - &quot;What, no tractors?&quot;. No tractors, but a prominently-featured pirate plying the high seas. While her presentation leaves much to be desired, the novel is the most engrossing 1069 pages I've encountered in recent memory. The driving theme is the mystery embodied in the book's first four words: &quot;Who is John Galt&quot;? Despite Galt's sixty-page manifesto late in the book, the answer is not &quot;Bill Clinton&quot;. Not by a mile - this book infuriates college-town Sandalistas precisely because Rand's answer is &quot;the man who butters your bread, America&quot;. The heroes are self-interested greedheads who wouldn't throw a dime to a wino unless it was to get him to mow their lawns. The villains are public-spirited bureaucrats, tweed-jacketed intellectuals, and do-gooders of every stripe. The past fifty years have not been kind to steel or railroads, but Rand's philosophy has held up magnificently compared to its socialist competitors. Earth to academia: GREED IS GOOD!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand should be mentioned in the same breath as authors such as Swift, Dostoyevsky and Hugo. However, she stands apart from these authors for a very important reason. Most authors write their work based on past knowledge... Rand by exception created an entirely new field of philosophy (Objectivism) then captured it in her novels. This puts her apart from any other fiction writer in history, her fiction is not based on second hand knowledge but is her own in totality.Atlas Shrugged is the only book of fiction I have ever read that has radically changed my life... It has also changed the life of thousands of others. I have now read it at least ten times and the last is as fresh as the first... I will never get bored of this book.Whether you reject or accept her philosophy one thing is for sure, after reading Atlas Shrugged your thinking will never be quite the same.Atlas Shrugged is a first rate masterpeice and it is about time Ayn Rand's works got the worldwide recognition they deserve.If I was stuck on a desert island and could have one book, it would be Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am glad I read this book, because it helped me understand that Objectivism has many weaknesses.It's now just another theory that I can just cross off the list."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I always got the impression Ayn Rand was a very sexual but unsatisfied woman. She seemed obsessed with hyper-successful men and...skyscrapers. I won't call it a simple romanticizing, as her writing repeatedly reveals itself as a non-physical outlet for her unrequited fixations. In Atlas Shrugged she tried hard to balance this with a strong female character who takes what she wants, but it's still with these same types of men who interestingly take what they want when she's with them. Vicarious? As to the less sexual but even more arousing aspects, Rand explores the Prime Mover: singular entrepreneurs who change the world. She does not stop at that, though. She focuses on the \\"Atlas\\" figures who are monopolizers. She does this in a misplaced attempt to show not just how Eastern European socialism but ultimately ANY constraint on capitalism is bad. I will quickly agree pure socialism (e.g. communism) like pure capitalism (e.g. China or the pre-workers' riots/rights era in the West) has its problems. Yet the rest does not follow.The country she came from was not oppressive because it was socialist, rather because it was totalitarian and early on did not have a consistent rule-of-law or historically contiguous justice system...especially during the revolution. Most \\"prime movers\\" throughout history got to where they did not because of invention and innovation. In fact, the original genius inventors and innovators are often much less financially successful and not the ones who rise to the top. The heads of U.S. railroad, steel, and precious metal monopolies were able to centralize power primarily (pun!) through the use of worker exploitation, thievery, bribery, conspiracy, collusion, fraud, and a variety of other illegal acts...some even worse. Rather than being brought to justice, their companies were simply broken up under anti-trust law. If ignoramuses want to try and ignore facts in favor of the laissez-faire ramblings of some horney but homely Eastern European refugee, then be my guest. It's still ignoring history and as such must be repudiated with truth.And don't get me started on the resemblances to the \\"handsome architect\\" shtick from Fountainhead. Architects and engineers are essentially interchangeable. If we're talking about artistic style in a design as in the prior novel, that's one thing. I have to assume that was a redeeming product of the editing process. Here you get the pure form. But there are no two, three, or even three hundred Prime Mover architects if jailed, put out of work for good reason, or just voluntarily went off to some brooding man-cave all the skyscrapers and bridges would collapse. There are plenty to replace them and capitalism is not even necessary for them to flourish. Only funding is needed. I'm all for intellectual property rights, but Ayn Rand was clearly deficient in her understanding of science, engineering, & technological development, and this is most apparent in attributing some of her characters with almost wizard or guild-like secret knowledge that no one else possesses. It is a complete and utter fantasy. The concepts are universal, and knowledge & intelligence can be taught. Good character and a healthy B.S. meter perhaps cannot.If standardization is necessary, such as railroad gauge, there are industry consortiums (like the IEEE) and government mandates that routinely and effectively fill that role. The real-world success examples are numerous and the potential for future efficacy in everything from financial regulation to automobiles boggles the mind. Most of the current problems we face can in fact be quite easily solved through this. The entrepreneurs have their roles and their rights, but should not be deified. The regulation of and governing over capitalism produces a system that ensures diversity & market fairness so the evolutionary dynamics can play out. Just as The Founders used a solution in taking pieces of monarchy, aristocracy, and republic to form our mixed government, so too must an economy. There is wisdom in balance and moderation. Allowing a feudal-style super-mogul in a given industry is not only unnecessary, but more prone to putting a populace at the mercy of one person's whims. You would never allow that in a modern government, so why do it in the economic sector?Rand's most fundamental core flaw is this, in her unwavering exaltation of the unbounded individual. While rights boil down to the singular because the group does not think, feel, sentiently bare witness to its surroundings, nor vote because it is merely an abstraction of collected individuals; you cannot get most grand things done through a single person alone, even at the managerial level through fiat. Collaboration and teamwork is what built the pyramids, changed the courses of rivers, got us to the Moon, fights crime in every city, wins wars, and is most effective in the most extreme of circumstances: the state of emergency. When untamed nature wrecks havoc, the credo \\"every man for himself\\" will fail. Nature also has a human twin in the unethical man. And he is in fact more powerful per capita than the ethical man because he has fewer limits on what he will resort to. Evil trends towards success and centralized power. Thus you fight the utility of evil not by becoming it but through superior numbers and teamwork."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"So far, so good--it may take a month to get through it but I want to finish it before the movie."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Heros, villians, the true capitalist Rand despite her repetition is an intelligent writer who makes you think!

I can't go into it here but with time age and wisdom the suspicions i had when I was 23 I see clearly at 33.So if the philosophy is 'no good' than that knocks down the book a couple of stars, since that's the purpose of reading it.As a story, I didn't find this nearly as compelling or interesting as the fountainhead, but she does provide some interesting descriptions of a society breaking down under the weight of socialism.

I have always thought really deep about stuff, but until ayn rand, i totally didn't know how. Her skills as a writer are indoubtful and affective. I agree with the 12 year old reviewer below, her seemingly needless repitition is the result of a smart strategy, not what some college kids have told me is bad writing. My dad is an executive at a huge corporation, and he has always told me that the key to rising to the top and being successful and living right is knowing that the usual business practices are really virtuous and not evil. I think this is really evident now, with corporate corruption we are seeing what the effects of government intervention in the economy does. Look people, purple prose is for the weak who are just relying on others for examples, we need to do our own thing, and that is the good thing to do. There is a reason why so many business majors in college have rand on their bookshelf, it is because she knows what she is talking about, and when you learn about how business works, you can see how right she is. I have met a bunch of 'philosophy' majors at the local college i live by, and they don't like rand because of all this stuff like universals and because she said in her address to the navy academy that kant was a dope and wrong and ruined society, or so that is what it seemed to me like they were saying, which is just the point. when you are talking on that you are relying on others and using others for help and helping others, which is what rand is against, and which is wrong. people, let's not get together, but become totally our own, and never ever, ever ever, no matter what, cross our hearts and hope to die, that we won't ever do anything for another person unless we do it selfishly."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One of the reviews was wrong. This was taught to me in college. Not only did I have to learn about Objectivism, but I have more than one professor who is a devoted socialist. I hear arguments against this book every day.I am a philosophy major, so reading this was not nearly so dry as say, Hobbes or Aquinas. It was not the most boring thing I've ever read, to put it simply. I am growing immune to stale syntax, so the length and arguments were not a problem for me.The disregard for human life and the world (ecology, animals, etc...) were a problem. Rand is almost silly in her inability to realize not all socialists, communists, or Marxists are lazy, grubbing malcontents who covet the robber-barons' wealth. She describes exclusive human natures and tries to convince us all humanity falls into these two opposing categories. There's no possibility of the hard-working socialist or intelligent altruist. These people are argued to be as fictitious as Santy Claus.If this book were a play, I suppose I would be cast as a tree.The long and short of it--capitalism, in the end, promotes the valuing of material gain over human life.I cringed when Rand tried to romantically justify the killing of &quot;non-humans&quot; because of their Evil ways (the train in the tunnel, for example). A person who can try to rationalize these thoughts should not be taken very seriously, though it's good to know those people are out there, for your own good.Rand goes on about rationality forever, but the problem is, pretty much anything under the sun can be &quot;rationalized.&quot; It just depends on how much you want to believe it. I love reason as much as the next fellow philosopher, but I'm not delusional enough to believe we should all be fully rational Vulcans who would produce freaking SYNTAX errors at the first line of inconsistent programming.And give Dagny some credit. She invented the most successful form of birth-control known to man while the country was still typing on typewriters, AND she got the man who slapped the beJesus out of her to pine away for her till the end of his days. She smoked as much as she wanted, yet never developed a hacking cough.She was just too rational to be outsmarted by nasty ol' nicotine addiction, emphysema, and pregnancy. Railroad runnin', nothin'! She is a multi-talented gal!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whether you like her book or not, it is an influential book and it isn't going away. She is to conservatives what Marx is to liberals, i.e. the extreme version of what most conservatives believe. Her philosophy is flawed and most conservatives only really take parts of her philosophy, (most of the parts conservatives do not agree with deal with Rand's disdain for religion, which again is quite similar to Marx).Her book, Atlas Shrugged, deals with a hypothetical in an unreal world. What if those who went on strike were the \\"backbone\\" of society, rather than the poor lower class workers whose only apparent drive, according to Objectivists, is to tear down the powerful and intelligent. However, this hypothetical is not real. What Rand and Objectivists seem to forget is that the powerful and intelligent die, and are no more, yet someone still takes control. So if one or two, or even a bunch of them stop working, others will fill in and do the work.Rand and Objectivists cannot look at the real world, but have to use hypotheticals to explain their flawed philosophy. If you look at all the characters in her books, they are all one dimensional. Tell me, in real life, have you ever met a person who was perfect, who did everything exactly as he was supposed to do? I have never met anybody who did not have a flaw in their character. yet I am to believe, as Objectivists would like, that by following their philosophy, I have somehow attained perfection in my character. Even Greenspan has gone back on his words!Rand's black and white view of the world fits well into conservative thought because they like to look at the world through a two-dimensional prism, or at least they like to believe they look at the world through a two-dimensional prism, but yet even Bush beds with dictators, i.e. Uzbekhistan.The problem with Rand's book, which Objectivists can't stand being brought up about her book is that her heroes have no flaws and her villains have no redeeming qualities. But yet we are to believe Kadafi of Lybia changed overnight. How can that be? He's a villain, or at least he was. Can villains have redeeming qualities to Objectivists?Another problem, which is the title of my review....look at the name of the book. It is called \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" According to Rand, Atlas is a mythical being who holds the earth on his shoulders. Apparently, in her view, the earth begins to weigh heavier and heavier on his shoulders, strengthening the burden on poor Atlas. When one character is asked what does Atlas do with this extra burden, another character replies \\"he shrugs.\\"So think about it. Rand's \\"Atlas\\" characters, the mighty, the rulers of business and industry....do they \\"shrug\\"? Is going on strike shrugging? So what is really her point? it seems that the book ought to actually be called \\"Atlas Revolutions\\". It seems more appropriate. If Atlas only shrugs, would not her mighty heroic characters just shrug their shoulders and get back to work?Yet another example of how unrealistic her book really is.Finally, and this last point is to the many Christians who find her book and her philosophy appealing, I have one question:Was Christ selfish?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There is no way that I paying $19 for a Kindle book that was originally published in the 50's. What an outrage by the publisher. Ms. Rand's estate should really negotiate with a new publisher."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"** Spoiler Warning ***Oh, boy, where do I start? First, let me say this: that hero of hers may have stopped the motor of the world, he certainly could not slow down Ayn Rand's FURIOUS typewriter. This edition has 1,168 pages in tiny fonts. It should have been, and easily could have been, condensed to 300-400 pages. At most.As a literary work it is flawed. There is not much I want to add to what other reviewers have already commented: it is long, the characters are two-dimensional, the dialogs long and repetitive, etc.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it exposes the hypocrisy of those \\"benevolent social planners\\". Read in light of our current times of government bailouts and \\"wealth spreading\\", it is eerily familiar (for this I give it more than the minimum 1 star).But it is not a novel in the traditional sense, it is a vehicle for Ayn Rand to expound her philosophy. And expound she did, with a vengeance.Maybe one day I will write a full review of her philosophy, which I think is also flawed (though it has some good elements). Why is it called \\"objectivism\\" anyway? It sounds more like \\"subjectivism\\" or \\"absolutism\\" to me: she views everything as black-or-white, there is no middle ground, and those who do not agree with her are branded \\"irrational\\".Since this is a review of the book, let me focus on it now. It being a vehicle for her philosophy which presumably she wants the user to apply in real life, then the fictional world she constructs must be at least somewhat realistic. But it is not. It is populated with three types of people only: 1. the industrialists whose only goal is to maximize his or her profit; 2. hypocrites who pay lip service to the abstract concepts of \\"social justice\\", \\"equalization of opportunity\\", but whose real purpose is to restrict the freedom of the industrialists and 3. the gullible \\"public\\", waiting to be rescued by their heroes. Aside from the fact that there are more types of people in the real world, even the ones in the book are not believable. The villains are singlemindedly against the heroes, to the point of absurdity (and Ayn Rand thinks herself as the champion of reason). For example, why is Jim Taggart so against his sister's success when he is the president of the same company? He stands to profit from it! Yet he persistently tries to run his own company to the ground. All the villains are absurd caricatures in her book.Even the \\"good guys\\" are not believable, and their relationships are just bizarre. Consider the following conversation between Rearden and Dagny, after they had sex for the first time (Keep in mind these are two main characters and heroes of the book, they went on to have a long relationship, which is fraught with contempt, despisement and violence).Rearden: I want to you know this. What I feel for you is contempt. But it's nothing, compared to the contempt I feel for myself. I don't love you. I never loved anyone... I wanted you as one wants a whore .. You're as vile an animal as I am. .. I held it as my honor that I would never need anyone. I need you. ...Dagny: I want you, Hank. I'm much of an animal than you think. .. You'll have me any time you wish, anywhere, on any terms. .. If I'm asked to name my proudest achievement, I will say: I have slept with Hand Rearden. I had earned it.Yet this is supposed to be a model relationship between the good guys. Now ask yourself if you would speak like this and have a relationship on such grounds. And Dagny is supposed to be a driven, shrewd and rational businesswoman. Give me a break. With heroes like these, who needs villains?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The characters in the book are either completely good or completely evil. Basicaly it depends on your point of view if you agree withe Ayn Rand's heroes or not.But what always struck me as significant is that the bad guys in the novel hold completely acceptable convictions: in the context of the book you are encouraged to hate them, but you will encounter them in your daily live every single day, fifty years after the book was published. There must be a point here somewhere..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I finally read ATLAS SHRUGGED.When I was going to college at Ohio University over 20 years ago, someone had spraypainted \\"Who is John Galt?\\" on walls around Athens, and I was intrigued when I found out it was from a book called ATLAS SHRUGGED. I liked the mystery with a hint of secret knowledge its reputation held.As I asked around, a pretentious stoner friend told me to save a lot of time and just skip to the chapter where John Galt lays out his 50-page philosophy.Another buddy said he'd heard a professor at the Univeristy of Virginia say, \\"I read ATLAS SHRUGGED...then I shrugged.\\"Twenty years later, I reconnected with someone who'd based her worldview on that book, so I decided to give it a try. (That's right: I finally made it through the whole thing for a woman. I'm just glad she didn't ask me to build a pyramid or something....)The book was interesting, but I found problems with it both dramatically and philosophically in the last third.I was into the relationship between Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden...but then they drift apart. After establishing Dagny as a unique, strong, fiercely-independent woman who falls in love with an equally-tough Rearden, I was a little disappointed when her next lover is a man she has no real interaction with--and comes off as more as a groupie than anything else!I enjoyed the work ethic espoused in Rand's \\"Objectivism,\\" but beyond that it would lead to other evils just as great as the \\"looters\\" and \\"moochers\\" she curses here: where would an Adolph Hitler, a lunatic with the hard-working drive of a Hank Rearden, fit into this world?Ms. Rand's contempt for the \\"mystics\\" (or, in politically-correct terms, \\"people of faith\\") appears to be limited to the most freakish raving stereotypes that most spiritual people also abhor.Am I the only one who noticed that, after reading how the heroic thinkers gun down security guards just doing their jobs near the end of the book--and dismissing them as human for not being able to quickly make a decision (it's there, read it), ATLAS SHRUGGED might only be advocating one form of tyranny over another?Still, I'm glad I read it. I know who John Galt is.(Now I can laugh at the SOUTH PARK joke when Officer Barbrady learns to read and then rejects all books after reading his first book: ATLAS SHRUGGED)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am sure that anything I have to say negative about this book has already been said, so I will simply say that this is the biggest piece of tripe that I have ever read. I highly suggest anyone interested to pick this book up out of curiousity, because only then will they know the true idiocy that is Atlas Shrugged. I know, this sounds really mean, but I've read many books in my life, and this is one of the few that I couldn't finish (or even get halfway through). The writing is juvenile and poor; none of the characters are likable. The protagonists would see the entire world and all of nature destroyed to serve their selfish desires (by the way, how would you have any resources without nature?). The antagonists are so caricatured that they all sound the same, and all spout the same, boring, exclamation-point-laced, left-wing drivel as the next. I even adopted a \\"stupid bad guy\\" voice to use for all of the \\"bad\\" people in the novel, because they all sound the same.After about 250 pages, I finally had to throw in the towel. For the large part, I felt like I was being lectured by a very angry, self-righteous, dictatorial shrew with a huge superiority complex. If that sounds contradictory at all, it's because the whole book is a typed contradiction. I actually started feeling bad for the antagonists because of the way Rand wrote them: \\"Oh, you poor, poor character, made to sound so stupid and unbelievable\\".This was only going to be a few lines long, but I can't stop! The way the book deals with absolutes is completely moronic. An idealism such as what is harped on in the book would destroy a civilization because it denies one of the major components of human nature: emotion.I have to stop; I'm getting pissed off. In summation, I don't wish to turn anyone off to reading this book, as I believe reading is good and opinions should be formed by each and every one of us (not regurgitated from an Amazon review). Just don't buy into Rand's fear-mongering and authoritarian flight of fancy. Rand would take away your freedom for the opportunity to force you to believe in her philosophy, which goes against my personal ideal of liberty."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was an Objectivist for a few years when I was young. The fundamental flaw with Ayn Rand's philosophy is the basis of this book: The idea that CEO's are somehow supremely gifted superman, irreplaceable and far superior to weak, ordinary mortals.The Big Lie is that if all the CEO's vanished our world would be in shambles. Here's what would happen: Just like when a drug dealer is arrested, someone else sees an opportunity and takes his place. #2 rises to #1. #3 rises to #2.ALL human beings have drive and ambition. What we all do NOT have is opportunity: rich parents - a chance for a good education - health. Also, businessmen are generally not Creators. At best they manage creators, at worst they just control a big chunk of power and other people's money.If all the CEO's in the world shrugged, the world would shrug back.This book is far worse than inaccurate though - it has brought the USA to the brink of disaster, by removing any pretense of morality from business, and giving justification and arrogant righteousness for selfish, sociopathic greed, to the people smart enough to understand it, but not smart enough to think past it.When our civilization falls, we may just have Ayn Rand to thank for it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this when I was 15.

Her book Atlas Shrugged (1957) sketches a Marxist Russian type state emerging in America: incompetent government politicos who plunder the work of productive people using various lofty slogans for a pretext. Orwell's 1984 depicts a similar dictatorship, but unlike Rand, Orwell was lucid enough to warn the reader: this is not just a sketch of the Soviet Union, it can happen anywhere in the West too.And by golly, it sure did. Have you heard about the Patriot Acts 1 and 2? Read of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia and their Washington friends? Ayn Rand's oppressive nincompoop government politicos are here with a vengeance, plundering the productive people as badly as any fictitous Wesley Mouch could. The effective U.S. tax rate with all hidden charges visible is what, 50% of the average income?. To add insult to the injury, they are plundering us in the name of free market capitalism, the credo of Rand's book.In Atlas Shrugged, Marxist ideology is depicted as the pretext to loot productive citizens. Ideology is always just a smoke screen. Looting governments emerge because ripping off taxpayers from a sheltered government position is such a lucrative and easy racket (since Babylon), that it inevitably attracts the most unscrupulous and the laziest elements of any society like a shining lamp attracts flies. Call it Darwinian governmental anti-selection. Even in John Galt's utopian commune of super-thinkers, if they had a civil office post, who would apply for it, the brightest and the busiest of all, or the least bright and hence the most idle? In 1100 pages, Ayn Rand depicted us a government running out of control like a broken car. Next, she suggested that if we switch the little logo on the hood from a sickle and hammer to a dollar sign, the deep engine problems will cease. Well, I think the problem is elsewhere. And it didn't take 1100 pages to point it out where, either.I spent two days reading the book (enjoyed its dialogs, and a lot of the character situations) and a third day reading people's reflections about it on Amazon. Without reading the wisdom of the vox populi online, it would not have been a full experience. I hope my review and occassional thoughts will add to the enjoyment of others as much as their posts added to mine."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I to read this book because my mother-in-law proclaimed it the \\"best book I ever read.\\" My tastes run the spectrum from Twain & Dickens to adventure ..., but I just could not get into this story.My primary criticism is this: you could easily cut half the words out of this book and still tell the entire story. Ayn Rand is not content to merely belabor a point, she beats a dead horse until it begs mercy in three languages. By the time you reach the climactic \\"this is John Galt\\" speech, you've already heard it all no fewer than three times! This obviously doesn't bother some folks, but I was so bored I could barely pay attention to what I was reading. (So maybe I missed something?)My other major criticism is that there were no human beings in the story. The heroes are wooden and the villans are straw. And to strain our credibility further, the \\"this is John Galt\\" speech drones on page after page after page. When he finally stops talking we are supposed to believe that there are still people listening to his radio broadcast! I would have turned off the radio and gone to watch paint dry.To be fair, she did have some clever ideas. The idea of all the greatest movers and shakers in the world withdrawing their efforts from the global economy is fascinating. And the merit based society they build in their self-imposed exile is a less intriguing but still interesting idea. But (as Ayn Rand would say) \\"let's face facts\\", if Thomas Jefferson couldn't make meritocracy fly, John Galt didn't have a chance.Many of the harsher aspects of objectivism are what America moved away from in the 1960s & '70s. I suspect that what appealed to my mother-in-law was the freshness of the ideas in her time. If you're a baby boomer, you've heard the message before and probably rejected it. If you're a post-boomer the ideas may be fresh again. Come to think of it, Dickens attacked the \\"facts without emotion\\" idea in his novel \\"Hard Times\\" about a half century before this book was written. Even philosophy is cyclical, I suppose. Except, of course, Aristotle.If you love a fast moving story, this isn't for you. If you like great story, it could be. If you like ideas, you will love this book.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I shudder when I read reviews of Atlas Shrugged that call it &quot;drivel.&quot; My reaction is such because it is precisely this type of person Rand is warning aginst in her epic masterpiece.

It's a socialist province in Canada. In school, they kill your mind. They give lots of space for the handicaped and the mindless people but for the intelligent people there is nothing. Here in Quebec, you almost have no rights to think! People will tell you: &quot;Who are you to judge?&quot; - &quot;You don't have the right to judge!&quot;. The government take as much as 55% of your money to help the poor, &quot;give&quot; free hospital, help the angry women to do their useless marchs and give millions of dollars to help the gay people.

An adventure novel. A mystery. A philosophical treatise. When I read it, Atlas Shrugged set my soul on fire. In a world of injustice and irrationality, Atlas Shrugged shows a world of men as they can be and should be. A hymn to the nobility of man's spirit, Atlas Shrugged tells of a beautiful woman who runs a railroad and her quest for an ideal. It tells of an America in which looters and criminals in Washington try to smother the productive men of ability in this country. It tells of one man, who, in order to save the world, had to destroy those whom he loved most.Upholding individualism, reason, and rational selfishness, Atlas Shrugged is not only a philosophical triumph, but a literary one as well. Ayn Rand's 1000-page masterpiece shows such integration, such skill -- every word was written and rewritten until the sound, the meaning, and the meter were not only perfect for the sentence, but for the entire book as well. Written with unimaginable passion, Atlas Shrugged elicits so much feeling on the part of the reader -- as I read it, certain phrases or sentences made me just lean back, close my eyes, and savor the words on my tongue.Controversial, intellectually challenging, enthralling, exciting, and totally entertaining -- Atlas Shrugged shows Ayn Rand's genius as a writer and her ability as a storyteller. Each sentence conveys the content of her mind and the passion of her heart. Read this book and your life will never be the same."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was a lightning bolt across my consciousness. It was shocking to be so completely divested of all of the socialist trappings of my ignorant college mindset. It was extremely liberating to acknowledge the proper role of government is limited to just defense and the criminal justice system; to acknowledge that government is necessarily ineffective and parasitic in all other realms of society; and to acknowledge that a man has a right to pursue happiness without being a victim of force or fraud.Many have \\"reviewed\\" this book without mentioning its themes, or simply criticizing Objectivism itself. They claim lovers of this book and adherents of Objectivism as \\"full of hate\\"; the reason is never explained or justified. Because I think I'm entitled to my own paycheck and to no one else's money, I guess that makes me a hater. Because I believe that I am entitled to pursue my own happiness without the government regulating my life I'm a hater. I guess there are still people who enjoy claiming the status of victim while \\"feeling\\" and \\"empathizing\\" people's money and property right out of their pockets, with the government's use of a gun backing them up.The book deals with several themes, one of the most important of which is the non-producing government using its monopoly on force to rob from and extort the nation's most valuable assets - the producing businessmen, inventors, scientists. These are people who have to work for a living, and have enhanced this nations' standard of living by orders of magnitude.You may want to ask yourself how prophetic this book is as the United States continues to destroy the concept of the individual and individual's rights. The recent Supreme Court decision regarding Kelo, the campaign finance reform laws inhibiting free speech - there are many examples of the encroachemnt of the federal government on the life and welfare of the individual.Don't believe it?

I will admit that there were times when I really wanted to keep reading because I was waiting for something to happen. Eventually something did, then it got boring again. Ayn Rand has writing skills I could only wish to have, although it doesn't save the content. As I neared the end, determined to finish, I didn't think that John Galt's rant was ever going to end."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I should probably begin by indicating that this review may contain spoilers.Somewhere, buried deep within the bloated mess of Atlas Shrugged, there lies a compelling novel about the disastrous effects of totalitarian government. Unfortunately, to get to that novel you would have to cut away the seven or eight hundred pages of political axe-grinding and inept \\"philosophizing\\" with which Rand burdens the work. Yes, I'm aware Atlas Shrugged isn't supposed to be just another novel; it's a *philosophical* novel, which apparently means that I'm supposed to look past the book's ragged prose and utter unreality in favor of the of the ideas that Rand's one-dimensional protagonists earnestly spout off at openings conveniently provided by her non-entity antagonists. This justification for Rand's heavy hand ignores the fact that ALL serious works of literature are fundamentally philosophical, in that they deal with the author's conception of the world we live in, and how life is lived. Insisting that it's the philosophy of Atlas Shrugged that's important doesn't excuse her failures as a literary artist. But, since I'm on the topic of the philosophy of Atlas Shrugged... it's quite a mess, isn't it? In Ayn's imagining, there are \\"no conflicts of interest between rational men.\\" Apparently, this means that if I run a business, and one of my competitors puts me out of business, I should be grateful, because this superior indistrialist's continued success ensures improvements to my standard of living. I don't know about you, but if I ran my own foundry I might find it difficult to transition to sweeping up that same foundry after its taken over by a competitor; Rand's heroes, apparently, would accept this role gratefully. (At least, the secondary characters would; Dagny, Hank and John would never let such a thing happen, of course, A being A and all) I suppose, in a perfect world, where great inventors are also great businessmen and are always flawlessly ethical, Objectivism is feasible; however, that world doesn't exist even within the confines of the novel. In spite of the book's frequent reminders about the frightful consequences of making important decisions based on anything other than evidence and reason, Dagny Taggart chooses to build a railroad bridge using Rearden Metal, which is untested in that application, and she makes her decision based on Hank's assurances that it should work just fine. Seriously? This is a rational decision, to risk your entire enterprise on an untested prodct based on the word of the guy who developed it when the capacity for testing it exists? That's not good business, it's psychotic. An even greater irony is Dagny Taggart's murder of a guard at the end of the novel, which action she takes explicitly because this individual will not convert to her way of thinking. This is the way to defend individual freedom, by killing anyone who doesn't share your values?It might not be so bad if the characters had any depth, but Rand's Objectivist philosophy prevents her from portraying people in any but the starkest shades of black and white. As a result, her protagonists are one-dimensional bores who only serve to give voice to Objectivist talking points, while the book's antogonists are straw men who serve to set up the aforementioned talking points. While this technique gives the book a certain forcefulness, it's ultimately a contrivance that demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to deal with the world as it really is. According to Atlas Shrugged, if you're good at business you're automatically perfectly ethical and flawlessly logical; and if you take issue with the idea that business and business alone will solve all of the world's problems, you're morally corrupt and incapable of rational thought. Why any thoughtful person would embrace a book so intellectually dishonest is beyond me, yet somehow it happens.Finally, a note about this book's influence. In 1991, the Book Of the Month Club mailed a survey to 2000 of its members, asking which book had had the greatest influence on their lives. Of those 2000, approximately 1300 responded; and of those respondents, 166 named the Bible as the book that had influenced them the most. Atlas Shrugged received 17 votes, placing it in a distant second, but just slightly ahead of The Road Less Travelled and The Lord Of the Rings. Like everything else Ayn Rand-related, claims of the book's pervasive influence evaporate when scrutinized."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has been regarded as one of the \\"Greatest Books\\" of all time by people whose job is to review books. I will save you a lot of time and tell you that if you read the first 300 pages, which are the meat of the book, you will understand the philosophy of everything Ayn Rand. Basically, it is that the capitalist moves the world and social programs are bad. I believe in this theory myself but to have to keep reading over and over again the same speech by the main characters over the course of 1000 pages can get very stale and boring.Bottom line. More of an anthem for capitalists than a good novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I loved it and was influenced by it, but still... I can't get past the idea that Ayn Rand's heroines get brutally raped by the person who turns out to be their ideal man. In this and in the Fountainhead, a savage rape is Rand's idea of Galt/Dagney's and Roark/Dominique's expressing their mutual respect (serious!)and adoration for one another.I was also left with the idea in both books that if I met these people in real life, I would be way too flawed for them. I think they'd be just about unbearable to be around! I'd love to slap Dagney, but she'd probably like it. (No, wait -- only her ideal man can slap her around...)Rand also seems to have a total lack of regard for nature and the environment and any type of mysticism. I'm interested in those things so right off the bat I guess I'm a second-rater.Overall, it's entertaining with wonderful ideas, but way too preachy, and I still don't get why an Ideal Man needs to rape his Ideal Woman."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have submitted myself to the torture of reading the 1168 pages of this horrible book because of curiosity and in view of so many accolades I heard on talk radio. It did not seem believable that so many people would praise such a large book only because of their agreement with some philosophical principle. I expected an entertaining book in which I might disagree with some arguments, but appreciate the erudition of the writer. I could not be more wrong.The reviewers who were not blinded by the celebration of selfishness the author has espoused have already spelled out the many specific shortcomings of the book. The book is a mixture of genres, each of them presented without competence. It is a philosophical tract completely divorced from reality, full of contradictions and repulsive ideas. It is an almost idiotic science fiction, showing a total ignorance of science. It is a feeble, unromantic romance. And it is an action thriller, which is not thrilling, just stupid.Ayn Rand never uses a hundred words when she can use a thousand to say the same thing. The repetitions of the same arguments are endless. The characters are caricatures of the worst kind. Occasional fine descriptions cannot save a book, which soon becomes boring to the extreme."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was enthralled by this novel when I read it in high school some 38 years ago. Then I grew up.Objectivism is the basic \\"philosophy\\" of the book. Objectivism is a highly idolized, might-makesright \\"philosophy.\\" It certainly appeals to teenage boys, who fantasize over some supermen to come and set the world straight. The book has very little in common with the nuanced world in which we live. The author of this misguided tome was a particularly nasty woman. Her friend, lover and business partner, to whom \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was dedicated, said in 1984 the book \\"encourages emotional repression and self-disowning.\\" He later said her works were \\"disjointed and contradictory.\\"The Philosophical Lexicon, a website run by two philosophy professors, defines a \\"rand\\" as: \\"An angry tirade occasioned by mistaking philosophical disagreement for a personal attack and/or evidence of unspeakable moral corruption.\\"Ayn Rand and her works are the philosophical equivalent of Britney Spears. IF you love pop culture and like your philosophy without the burden of thought, this is the book for you.The best review of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is as follows: \\"There are two novels that can change a bookish 14-year-old's life: \`The Lord of the Rings' and \`Atlas Shrugged.'

The other, of course, involves orcs.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I had heard of but never read Ayn Rand's fiction so decided to read Atlas Shrugged to enlighten myself on her philosophy.What I found was a tiresome, plodding story with one dimensional characters and impossible dialog. Rand never says in three words what she can say in three hundred, and her illustration of Objectivism could have been done in a few hundred pages instead of the thousand or so that she used.While I personally agree with her philosophy, I just can't recommend this book to anyone. It's difficult to read, it's boring, it's condescending, and by the time you're several pages into a character's monologue in which the character says the same thing in a different way in each paragraph, you just want to escape this awful book.I'm well aware I'm going against the mainstream here, but I just dont' see what's so great about this awful book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas and everyone else should indeed shrug and yawn. This book is not well written. It is preachy, wordy and full of outdated philosophy and bad economics. Sentences go on for pages and some of the rants are are about silly things like the benefits of smoking.Dagny Taggert tries to save the railways and John Galt tries to save the Nation and international commerce. Captains of industry are the moral and ethical models for a struggling nation and world. Growth and prosperty are in their hands - and the greatest impediments to thriving commerce and fulfilled people - are intellectuals ,religions, and government.Does anyone really believe that high standing corporate ethics in conflict with shackling government regulation is what destroyed Enron, for example? IT WAS GREED AND LACK OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION.It may have been an important book of the last century (so were Mein Kampf and the Communist Manifesto) but in Atlas Shrugged the characters are shallow and one dimentional, the story is ponderous, and the political and economic philosophy has been long since descridited.Don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Save yourself some time and simply tune into the lunacies of a local rightwing radio talk show if you want to get to the bottom of what Rand was blathering about in probably the most overrated book of the last century.She utilizes a bastardized version of what she terms objectivity and rationality to more or less argue for the complete deregulation of the Fortune 500, Wall Street and the owning class in general. In her and her sheep's view environmental protections, progressive taxation, labor standards and consumer rights are anathema to the workings of the free flowing market. Someone would think the horror stories of the 19th Century would have awoken her and her clones' minds to the rapacious nature of unfettered corporate power. Certainly the recent behavior of ImClone, Enron, Andersen, WorldCom, etc., must have shook the nonsense out of a few disciples; although if the S&L; crisis, Boesky, Milken and BCCI shenanigans of the 1980s didn't do it probably nothing will.And of course the runaway of strong union jobs to the Sun Belt and Latin America is simply considered the wonderful machinations of capitalism. Sometimes a healthy dose of pragmatism is no match for committed disciples of balderdash. Clearly one can see that Rand's snake-oil ostensibly laid the foundation for the Republican Party's eventual platform.Pseudo intellectualism at its finest, to dare criticize the dime store wisdom in Atlas Shrugged will bring forth the wrath of her cultists of which Alan Greenspan is a member. The guy who tweaks interest rates in order to keep the bond traders happy and a solid chunk of Americans unemployed. One can thank Ayn Rand for bringing misery to myriad citizens and for perverting the definition of objectivity. I'm sure Nietzsche would approve."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm not going to post a super-lengthy review of why I gave this book one star because so many others have done such a great job of explaining why. I echo the sentiments of the other one-star reviewers. Simply put, this book is long-winded, dry, and takes itself far too seriously. I understand that Rand thinks government is evil and private industry will save us all because it is an altruistic, benevolent force (major sarcasm), but does she really need over 1,000 pages of tiny typeface to tell us that? The characters are so stereotypical that it's hard for me to take them seriously. All of the \\"good\\" characters (private businessmen who will save the world) are strong, attractive, intelligent, and hard-working. All of the \\"bad\\" characters are unattractive, whiny, weak, and lazy. Even the dialogue is frustrating at times with the bad characters whining and the good characters answering in short, clipped sentences. I first read this book in a college course and did not enjoy it then. I thought that perhaps ten years later, as an adult with a bit more life experience, I might think otherwise - particularly given the current economic situation. No such luck. I still find it one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune of reading. Strong words, perhaps, but one is entitled to her own opinion. Many love this book but I am truly baffled as to why, because I can find no redeeming qualities - try as I might!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"What would happen if one day, Atlas, with the colossal weight of the world on his shoulders, decided to just shrug it off? If this has got your interest, then you should read this book. It is certainly long but it reads relatively easy, excepting some rather long winded diatribes. This is largely due to the fact that this is a novel of ideas and not a novel per se. Being Rand's self proclaimed magnum opus of her philosophical theories of Objectivism, the normal elements of a novel are secondary to the need to elucidate Rand's ideas on politics, ethics, morality, and economics. It has provoking ideas that are fed to you wrapped in a story of epic proportions (and distortions too, of course, to make a point). The influence of this book is equally epic. Just bring it up casually at any social gathering and watch the reactions from people. It can be intense. For these reasons alone you should read this book.The story is an apocalyptic one with the world quickly descending into violent chaos because a handful of the 'producers', or industrial tycoons, business magnates, genius engineers, intellectuals, etc. decided they were tired of supporting the world of 'looters', the vast majority of humanity who are lazy, good-for-nothings that just mooch off the 'producers'. So, the real powers that be (which are not the government) go on strike. And all hell breaks loose. And who hasn't felt these same things in their own lives? This place would fall apart if it wasn't for me. My God, I'm surrounded by such stupidity. Look at the way that person's driving, what an idiot! If I ruled the world, it would be such a better place. And so on and so forth. This is what sucks you into the novel. These mundane feelings of indignation are cast in the grand historical narrative of social darwinism. And of course, you know how it must end as a result but you've just got to read it to find out! The novel will pull you along rather engagingly.This is based on a rather nihilistic viewpoint of Rand's, casting the world as a meaningless, raw material to be molded by the hands of a select few with the intelligence and drive to create meaning. It has strong messianic overtones (though she herself, a daughter of secular Jews, was an avowed atheist and had very little patience for religion) in the central character of John Galt who delivers the few good from the masses of bad to then bring the new world in to being. Galt is the self-made man (possibly an every man but of course, not really) cast in the image of Christ. This line of thought produces what I feel is the single most important effect of this book - self-empowerment. It is very difficult to walk away from this book and not feel a tremendous amount of self worth immediately following. Yes, the world is against me! I am a worthwhile, intelligent, creative person who can accomplish anything! To hell with the world and everyone else! I'm getting mine while I can!Some considerations should be kept in mind though:1. As a work of philosophy, it is important to keep in mind that the vast majority of professional philosophers have little time for Objectivism. There have been occasional essays written about it, but they are often highly critical of Rand's philosophy. I have a degree in philosophy and I can count on one finger when Rand was mentioned in my years of study. To a student's question about what my professor thought of Rand's philosophy, the reply was, \\"One can get ideas from Winnie the Pooh books as well.\\" A very quick overview of my understanding of the matter is that Rand's rigor as a philosopher is rather lacking. Her main inspirations are a curious amalgamation of Nietzsche (who's \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" is a well-spring for \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" with Nietzsche's understanding of nihilism based in Christianity and the ubermensch, personified in the novel by John Galt) and Aristotle. Her ethics are troubling at best as they are based on rather overly dramatic extremes and basic binary oppositions, Good/Evil, Active/Passive, Individual/Group and so on. Therefore, having little practical application to real world situations. In a story line plotted out by the author with an inevitable ending of her own creation of course it works. In short, beware the air of intellectualism as the logical fallacies alone in her arguments are enough to make any philosopher wince.2. Ayn Rand spends very little time considering such apparently trivial matters as racism or gender or classicism. Her characters are either born into a beneficial position or are able to work themselves up with little hindrance as they've been able to somehow get by on their merits even in a world which she characterizes as being not even remotely close to a meritocracy. The vast majority of her characters who propel the plot and exemplify her ideals are white, Eurocentric males who never confront obstacles based on their race or gender. Her central female character Dagny Taggart somehow avoids all gender bias. Rand herself was an outspoken critic of racism and supporter of equal rights between the sexes. It is curious then her choice of characters.3. For a novel that espouses notions of critical thinking for one's self and Rand's own constant iterations of the same, it is surprising the number of people who take her literally. And quote obnoxiously verbatim from her. Much like the Jehovah's Witnesses at your front door. In Rand's defence, she kept many long friendships with people that she disagreed with. It is sad to say that many people don't follow this example of her's. After you've read the book, trust me. You'll see this happen all the time. This applies equally on the other spectrum with those that dislike the book giving no inch in a discussion on the book. It inspires some of the most passionate and violent reactions from people.4. It is an unabashed exposition of why free market capitalism is the only economic system. If this isn't your cup of tea, be warned. An interesting thought to consider after reading - can Bernard Madoff be interpreted as a Randian individual par excellence?There are of course other problems, particularly the drive of innovation and production that has environmental ramifications that Rand was either unaware of or unwilling to consider. Her descriptions of the industrial landscape are rather horrifying but it is certainly not meant to be horrifying. It's supposed to be awe inspiring. And many more.But do read this book. I've centered on the negative in the spirit of a critical review, but it would be a lie to say I wasn't deeply moved by this book when I read it. My own position was initially to fall quickly in line with the way of thought. It is intoxicating on a certain level. As I said, it really makes you feel empowered. But this quickly faded after more thought for me and I now largely reject most of her claims.As an antidote, I recommend reading JD Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\". It also contains a nihilistic view of a world that should be overcome but in an angst ridden, adolescent view of the world. Which has some peculiar similarities to Rand's. It is interesting to consider the dream of Salinger's anti-hero, \\"I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.\\"John Galt would let them fall."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand books and philosophy have been around for 50 years or more.

Dagny Taggart as Mary of Magdalena who has the hots for the Messiah and some of his followers. Dr. Robert Stadler is Judas who betrays the Messiah for silver in order to build the State Science Institute. Henry Rearden is Peter who denies the Messiah and then goes on to be his greatest disciple. And Midas Mulligan as Mosses who leads his followers into the wilderness in search of the laissez-faire promise land.The plot is simple. Rather than have the fruits of their labor stolen by the government, the industrialists withdraw from society to await the fall of government. In order to hasten the fall of the government the industrialists began destroying the means of production and to disappear. The industrialists have no concern for the well being or loyalty of their workers.For example when workers fight to defend Rearden Mills against government goons, at the risk of their lives, Rearden simply vanishes and leaves his wounded and dying workers to their own devices. Or look at the fate of Edwin \\"Eddie\\" Willers, the faithful little puppy that followed Dagny around. For three generations his family had served the Taggart family. He was a childhood friend of Dagny and Francisco d'Anconia; for 12 years he sat and ate with John Galt, but in the end he wasn't worthy to run with the big dogs and was left to die alone still clinging to the belief that Dagny would somehow come to his rescue. Outside of their own little clique, no one meant anything to Ayn Rand's heroes. Her heroes were as heartless as the 19th century robber barons.Once millions and millions of Americans had died due to hunger, cold and fighting; the infrastructure and all means of production destroyed; and the country divided into fiefdoms by warring factions, then the hero's mount their white horses and ride to the rescue of the country.How? There is no means of communication or transportation left. There are no military or law enforcement agencies to restore order. Did Ayn Rand really think that the people would welcome back the industrialists who abandon them and destroyed the country? Before they left they couldn't find enough good men to run the trains or the mills, how were they going to find the men to rebuild everything that was destroyed? Before there was not enough material or fuel to run the country, yet now when they return there would be enough to rebuild it?The trouble I have with Ayn Rand's thinking is this; she wants to trade the rule of the country by a greedy incompetent government for the rule by heartless industrial elitists. She has no faith in the common man, no faith in the Constitution and no faith in democracy.What I find most interesting is Ayn Rand's understanding of future events. We have now entered a time where the government finds it necessary to loot the rich and give to the undeserving. Whether it is a house, health care, education or income, everyone today deserves something at the expensive of someone else."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Read some philosophy and political science. Try a real &quot;novel of ideas&quot; or two. Lean to think critically. Don't waste time reading or debating this turgid non-novel illustrating a non-philosophy.It's odd there's such enthusiasm and rancor in the reviews below. This work and its associated &quot;philosophy&quot; falls of its own weight. Its main appeal is to teenagers, either just before they enter college or in their freshman year. And that's great, because it can lead to some of them taking a real interest in philosophy and literature.Rand's philosophy has not had any meaningful effect on society, philosophy, or literature. Ranting about it is a waste of time. I wish those who enjoyed this book, for whom it &quot;changed their lives,&quot; the best of luck as they (as many of them will) use it as an impetus to discover a love of philosophy and literature."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first heard of Ayn Rand when I was in my teens and listened to the rock group Rush. At that time I bought \\"Fountainhead\\" and tried to read it but was bored silly--end of Ayn Rand. I recently read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as I kept hearing how it is \\"life changing\\" and \\"a classic\\". I liked the book as a story, but I don't think it is life changing or a modern classic. It was just a long-winded book pushing a jaded philosophical style.I do admire Rand's descriptive powers, particularly in describing surroundings and the outdoors. The basic plot of the book is that a business man and woman fight the establishment to build a superior steel mill and railroad. The estabishment has passed so many \\"do good\\" laws that this becomes more and more difficult. They learn of a innovative engineer who built a space-age type of motor and seek to find him. This engineer has \\"dropped' out of society in protest of the establishment and decided to \\"stop the world\\" and manages to do this through his wealth and wit. I admit I had to chuckle when I read the main characters' outrage over the United States subsidizing Mexico for philanthropic reasons at the expense of her own people. That had a curiously modern sound to it, as did the oil shortage, bankruptcies, incompetence of workers, evil robber barons of big business, and the all around liberal tax and spend attitude of the government in the book. This made the book seem much like a modern novel. Over all, the plot was good, if somewhat long winded, and convoluted.However, it was the main characters who embody Rand's philosophical style that really turned me off a 5 star rating for the book. Talk about mechanical, wooden, self-centered, stuck-up people!! I realize they are exaggered to make a philosphical point, but heaven help us if everbody was like them! Do you want to be changed to be like this?? They are so convinced of their superiority that they cheat on their spouse/commit adultry and manage justify it based on their superiority. When the two main characters get together for the first time, the man contemptuously tells the women that he has no respect for her and nothing but contempt for what they have done. She basically says the same thing back--but then they go on and continue their affair. For such a \\"strong\\" woman, this character is a real wimp when it comes to men!! She even sleeps with a man who just told her he is trying to destroy her company. Again, this has some modern political tones--stand by your man even when he is cruel and nasty to you. I guess this is what superior people do.....Come to think of it, I believe Rand cheated on her spouse for several years--and even managed to convince her wimpy husband and the other man's wimpy wife that this was OK and not selfish or immoral--and they went along with it--and to top it off wrote books praising her! How superior can you get??The conversations in the book are stilted and wooden--and 90% of them are business or philosophical in nature or disparaging of common people, revealing some very shallow people. Even the bums they bump into spout philosophy. The main characters cannot stand the \\"average\\" working person, whom they disparage at every turn and only want to be with people \\"like themselves\\". The male character had married a perfect, beautiful, but ordinary trophy wife who seemed mysterious to him, but then on the honeymoon becomes contemptuous of her after consumating the marriage. (Sex in this book is an act of contempt) He wanted a trophy wife but then is contemptuous of her \\"depending\\" on him and spending his money. He cannot carry on a normal conversation with her without talking about business. Thankfully, this couple does not have children--but nobody in this story does except for the stupid ordinary people who breed indiscriminately. I wonder how superior people intend to have like-minded heirs to their wealth if they don't have kids....(Maybe the abnormal wooden sex prevents this in their world)....Perhaps they clone one another instead??Rand's philosophy regards atruism as a sin. I agree that unchecked altruism is wrong-- such as supporting lazy people who could work but won't, tax and spend to accomplish this. However, the main characters in this book take their hatred of doing good to someone else to extremes (of course). They cannot give of themselves even to their families or spouses (they think this is petty weakness) and begrudge the financial support they provide. The recipients of this support are, of course, petty and unthankful. The altruists or \\"looters\\" in the book are as over-the-top as the main characters and pass incredibly dumb laws designed to \\"spread the wealth\\" and anger the superior people. The altruists in the book are all characterized as weak, plotting, conniving, lying types who don't have enough brains to see what they are doing. I hope the people who find this book life changing don't wind up changing into either type stereotyped in this book....Ayn Rand had a deep rooted hatred of people and this book shows it. Everybody hates everybody in this book. The biggest \\"haters\\" (another modern concept) in actuality are the superior people who take over the world in this book with their magnanimous disgust for the common man. The elitist believe they have been persecuted and hounded by the inferior looters and use their superior skills to bring the world to a halt. The result is a superior handful of people taking over control of the entire world to do their bidding--which they believe is \\"best\\" for everyone since they have the \\"superior\\" minds and financial means to do this. (another modern political parallel) Does this not sound a bit like the communism or collectivism that Rand reportedly fought against? Of course, the noble main characters could not possibly have any collective ideas and only want to provide freedom for the superior individual to make a profit and not have to associate with the masses. Of course, Rand does not mention the obvious future result of such a move, she only deals with an unrealistic, idealized present. She conveniently forgets every dictatorship known to man has been evil.I think the strangest thing of all about this book is that the ultimate result of the takeover plot would lead to the establishment of very thing collectivist ideas the book seems against on the surface---a dictatorial rule by the elite and subjugation of the ordinary people. Yet another modern political parallel??? Perhaps brainwashing is how lives are changed?The most disturbing, revolting thing of all about this book is not in the actual book itself but in the quote in the introduction to the book: \\"I trust that no one will tell me that men such as I write about don't exist. That this book has been written and published-is my proof that they do.\\" OOOH, the elite approved of Ayn Rand and her book. How superior of Ms. Rand....and scary. WE will \\"allow\\" this \\"individual\\" to write a book that expounds \\"our\\" ideas, while we advocate working towards repressing the ideas of inferior individuals with whom we do not agree.Want to read a truly life changing book about the True Elite? Read the Bible. There are no superior men in the end, only a Superior God."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Having read virtually all of Rand's works as a youth during the 1970's--and dismissed her fiction as wooden and philosophy as sociopathic--it is alarming that a substantial number of impressionable youngsters, not having the advantage of being exposed to the classics, have found in the dogmatic Atlas Shrugged a new Bible, and a prophet (albiet with feet of clay) in the philosophy of the novel, &quot;Objectivism.&quot; (A knowledgeable reader may want to gag at the title of this cult-philosophy, since Objectivism is anything but objective.) I will not go into the aridity of Rand's prose, the artificial characters, the veiled sadomasochism of her &quot;heroes&quot;, the insane nature of the philosophy that drives these characters. I advise only this: explore the great vault of literature through the ages just a bit, then read the many excerpts of Rand's fiction available on numerous websites. Decide then if this is really the kind of fiction you want to waste your precious time on. (This review is listed with one star only because there was no option for a &quot;0.&quot;)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"At the end of my copy of Atlas is a brief autobiography by the author; the arrogance and smugness apparent therein - no philosopher ever influenced her thinking other than Aristotle! (and he was mostly wrong anyway!) - wasn't too surprising after forcing myself to finish the book, which became increasingly difficult after page 150 or so. By that time, the constant repetition of the same dialogue, slightly modified, and the characters that turned back into cardboard just when you thought Rand might instill some life into them, became increasingly frustrating. It is amazing that anyone could describe this as a great work of literature.(Well, maybe if your other reading material consists of L. Ron Hubbard, novelizations of Star Trek, and Marvel comics...but I'm slandering Marvel.)But of course this is really a philosophical tract masquerading as a novel. I can't say I find Rand either an original or cogent thinker. Her principle failing is establishing two extreme polarities of \\"all good\\" and \\"totally evil\\". An interesting flaw in someone who cites Aristotle, considering the classic Greek philosophical maxims \\"aim for the middle\\" and \\"nothing in excess\\". But of course what Rand admires in Aristotle is the logical syllogism: a good intellectual tool, but often misused to prove dubious propositions through questionable chains of logical hocus-pocus. And human nature and human interactions may be too complex to make \\"either-or\\" thinking of much use or relevance.Rand fails to see her vision of an essentially government-less capitalism is as much a fairy tale as Marx's vision of a stateless Communist society, and its mirror image.Rand's lone-gunslinger, Captain America industrialist ideal is the naive creation of a mind stuck in childhood rather than, as she seemed to believe, the conception of a mature adult. In so emphasizing driven individual will, Rand fails to give sufficient credit to the social and governmental structures that allows entreponeurs to succeed.We now know that altruism has been built into human nature by natural selection. In other words, altruist behavior does make us happy; so does success in business, so does the caress of a loved one...Rand's attempt to simplify human nature in her philosophy indicates a small and rather shallow intellect, rather than the great one her followers would attribute to her. And there's even an Ayn Rand Institute! Amazing! I'm starting the Krusty the Klown Institute...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I shrugged when I read it. The English looked like it had been fed through Babelfish and had passed through Mongolian, Kurdish and Quechua before being reluctantly returned to English. Unbelievable that someone could deliberately write anything so turgid, or that there was an editor involved in the process. As for the concepts in the book, they reinforce the old Frankfurt School view that political and philosophical opinions arise from personality types. If one were to develop a shallow political philosophy whose sole purpose was to rationalize narcissism, it would be indistinguishable from Objectivism. This is consistent with Rand's biography, which is that of a self-centered ranter with a grievance against the world for not bowing down to her genius.The fact that this book has so many enthusiastic proponents is a symptom of the decay in mutually-supportive social interactions in our society. It has been used by the powerful to salve their guilt at looting and cheating the rest of us (e.g., Reagan, Greenspan) and can be found in the backpacks of many an overweight nebbish with crumbs in his beard who aspires to grow up to be JP Morgan or Bill Gates. All in service of a lifeless, mechanistic system that allows no more space for authentic human existence than Stalinism did."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is an interesting read. It's entertaining, though its didactic passages can get a bit tedious. I read it many years ago and recently re-read it, and both times, I found it disturbing, but couldn't articulate why.After some thought, here's my answer. Rand's objectivism is very little more than the elevation of the American cowboy mythos to philosophy. It's a very attractive mythos - who *doesn't* want to be a rugged, self-sufficient, ultra-competent alpha individual? - but it glosses over the inconvenient fact that human beings are social creatures, with the attendant compromises that arise from living in a pluralistic society. The \\"looters\\" she creates are caricatures and straw men, set up so she can knock them down using fairly simplistic arguments, in the same fashion as Ann Coulter sets up straw-man liberals for rhetorical purposes. Her arguments bring to mind current neocon ideology, in which the state can do nothing right and private enterprise can do nothing wrong....both assumptions are incorrect."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is not worth the time. Simple, sad, ignorant, boring. Most moral individuals could not relate. Not for Americans."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand makes up an impossible (idealistic) world and then lists the problems with the ideal she has carefully defined. She then expects (or prompts) the reader to make links from this fantasy world to current culture, and then suggests equally idealistic cures for her ill conceived fantasy world while leading the reader to surmise that the same cures can and should be applied to the real world. This is irrational and dishonest but since you are presented with the straw-man world she has created, what choice do you have except to put the book down and go on within your real world.For those who continue with the book (you'll never get this time back), you find that all the characters that are not selfish enough for her are killed off in a literal train wreck that mirrors the figurative train wreck that is this book.For those who agree that the world will go to hell if all the movers and shakers went on strike, I wonder if they have considered the Lord of the Flies world these beautiful people have moved to.In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is King; and without other Kings, we will get along fine without the richer Kings.We poor employed people just can't live without our employers.Hey, did you hear the one about . . .

This is a book that clearly illustrates the sickness that is destroying our country. Centralized control by corrupt, greedy non-producers......... or as the book calls then \\"looters\\".

If you have ever felt that you were pulling the load for a bunch of freeloaders and wondered what they would do if you just stopped producing, if you ever wanted to see their reactions as their free ride stopped so badly that you were willing to lose everything........ you will get a kick out of this book.

While reading this, and Fountainhead, I never read it as an academic exercise, but for what it spoke to me. Coming from a Christian worldview, and for other reasons as well, I ended up dismissing some of the depth of certain arguments. But, what I found most compelling was the \\"Whats my value?\\" content. The concept of interacting with the world from the perspective of \\"What do I offer\\" and \\"how does what I offer spring from who I am\\", was striking to me. In our society today, as in Rand's time and location, there is so much of the \\"give me because I need it\\" or \\"give me because I want it\\", and the kind of political organizational networking such as done by Peter Keating and James Taggart to get ahead. The pride of production that comes from drawing from within yourself, overcoming obstacles along the way, and then bettering yourself. These shine through. Now, this may seem like obvious notions, but in the day to day of living in our society, it very often gets lost. There are too many Keatings and Tooheys and Mooch's and Boyles around, and we need to keep our eyes and associations more fully fixed on the Reardens and Galts and Roarks."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a beautifully written, thrilling novel.I enjoyed the depth of the author's characters and her way of capturing the essence of different mentalities. The plot was engaging and intense, with an interesting mystery that unravels with every chapter. This book never stagnates - the story is always moving forward, and every aspect serves a purpose in developing the plot.Ayn Rand's prose was extremely enjoyable. Her abstract portrayal of beauty was unique and unforgettable.I was fascinated by the different plot devices that the author used throughout the book - from the strong tree (and terminal), rotted from the inside, to Dagny Taggart's railroad, that served as the blood feeding the country's spirit.Atlas Shrugged can be read as a story in and of itself, but if one chooses, he may notice the unique philosophy that served as the basis for its greatest characters and themes. Ayn Rand's purpose in writing was to portray the ideal man. Painting a portrait of man as he can and ought to be, Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged will challenge your every premise, and the premises of the history of mankind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In 30 yrs, I have never read a book that has had a greater impact on me and clarified my personal beliefs. I immediately purchased The Fountainhead and once I finish reading it, I will read Atlas Shrugged again!

If this were required reading in High Schools, then the children of today would be so much better prepared for their futures."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A great classic novel just for the joy of reading, but it is more importantly a clear warning of the misbegotten role of government in the industry of charity (to put a kinder word on it than socialist government deserves). While writing from the early 1950's perspective puts a few twists in the story that history has not followed, the author has hit the nail on the head so squarely regarding the key message that one has to think she had a crystal ball. The tyranny of big government has been told effectively by other writers, particularly George Orwell, but none of them anticipated so accurately and described so minutely the corrosive effect of legislation hiding behind a facade of government-mandated welfare programs seemingly rooted in sympathy for human misery. Anyone who reads this book and does not see the stark parallels with today's situation (government nationalization of private industry, attempts to mandate one thing after the other for the sake of our health, confiscatory taxes, corruption and unlawful behavior at the highest echelons of government, movement of capital and industry to more friendly states, etc.) has to be blind. Anyone who thinks that her story is an un-Christian one, arguing against individual charity for the deserving needy, hasn't read the book deeply. (Though I admit that it takes a real effort to get through some of the more lengthy monologues.)This is this year's Christmas present to my children. May they learn from it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is the greatest book I've ever read. Amazing that Ayn could have foreseen the events were going through today back in the 1950's.

My advice, have them read this before they go off to their first year of College. Bribe them if you must, some of the manifesto like sections will roll their eyes back into their heads.....but get them to read it and discuss it with you. The story of John Galt comes closer to reality each and every day. Just look at the mess Washington is making of capitalism in America. From SOX to Bail Out Nation to selecting which car dealerships should live or die, it is all about punishing achievement and molly coddling folks that the government think are too stupid to understand things for themselves. If you have already read it ...read it again....If you missed it, don't miss it now. If you can get your kids to read it is worth a whole year away from home!

Nostradamus has nothing on Ayn.Atlas Shrugged, to my mind's eye, provides us with a glimpse into our near future. The encroaching socialism we are experiencing today could lead to the nation described in this book. Innovation and success are first discouraged, then limited and finally banned. Government controls production and allots contracts not on merit, but equity. I want a roofer who \\"deserved\\" a job to replace mine, not the most competent. Right! When the roof leaks and needs additional repair, at least I was egalitarian. Our entire society will pay for such choices. Do the actions of today parallel the events described in AS? Judge for yourself.The characters are well developed. The protagonist of individualism and creativity display characteristics and expound views reflective of many public figures seen on the Sunday morning shows, guests and moderators. The achievers strive ardently to continue despite barriers imposed with ever increasing restraint. The \\"final solution\\" for our rebels is idyllic, but essential to their collective survival as independent thinkers and producers.While reading this novel, you may feel the impulse to ask; \\"Is AS an essay posing as a novel, or a novel posing as an essay? No problem, it's a literary treasure. If I were to select one book from my library to be stranded with, AS fits the bill."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book last summer before this great economic collapse and the scary thing is that I was clearly able to see all of the parallels to what was and is happening.

The entire economy tanks within a few short years and everyone but the thinkers and doers, who have all moved to a secret city, starve to death.The end.I made it a point to make it to the end, but certainly it was not entertaining reading. The book was about twice as long as it needed to be."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's epic, philosophical novel is as relevant today as when it was first published, over 50 years ago. I have deep personal reservations about some of the ideas she expresses in her book, but I have to say that that did not keep me from enjoying Atlas Shrugged in the least. Rand writes wonderfully, and her characters' thoughts are deep and layered. If I had to sit through an author's philosophical preaching, I would much rather have it in the form of a dramatic work of romance, mystery, and intrigue, than a dry intellectual treatise. Whether or not you agree with Rand's philosophy or not, her novel is a brilliant, beautiful work of thoughtful fiction, and well worth reading.\\"Who is John Galt?\\" That is the phrase that drops the first hint of mystery into the lives of the characters in this book, characters that will soon find the very machinery of the world system beginning to work against them. It is one of several mysteries in the book. Why are capable, hard-working people suddenly walking away from jobs that they love and vanishing? What happened to the mysterious inventor of a motor that could solve most of the planet's energy problems? Why did he abandon his greatest work? What is the mysterious Project X? There is enough intrigue to keep you turning the over 1000 pages of the novel, and the answers to your questions are generally satisfying.Rand's philosophical ideas are controversial. Basically, she argues that working for one's self interest is a good thing, and being forced to give up the fruit of one's own labor to support others is evil. Her novel is remarkably uncompromising. Her heroes really do live for nothing more than pleasing their own selves. They are selfish people, and she shows why that is not necessarily an evil thing. Actually, she goes way farther than that. She attempts to show that working for one's own self is the highest moral good that a person can do in the world. And those that work to support others, or give them what they have not earned, are actually working out a terrifying evil in their lives. If this sounds extreme to you, it does to me as well. My own personal beliefs go against some of what she is preaching here. (Rand was a fierce atheist, and her philosophy, Objectivism, leaves no room for what cannot be supported by objective reasoning.) I appreciated her novel regardless. She attempts to uncover what drives people to do good and evil, and how these basic principles work out in society. Her thoughts on morality are fascinating. And if, like myself, you find yourself agreeing with part of what she says, but unable to fully commit yourself to her ideas, she places you fully in the realm of the evildoers. There can be no compromise in her morality (something I can appreciate, though not from her camp). The book attempts to peel away the reasons for peoples' actions until you find the one ultimate motor of human life, the moral law that guides all life, which is the good of loving one's own life. For me, the discussions of good and evil, life and death, are the philosophical highlight of the book.The characters are an interesting bunch. Some of them are wonderfully complex. Some are ridiculous caricatures (and intentionally so). Some of them speak long, drawn out monologues of intelligent philosophy. Some spout out brainless lines that no one would probably say in real life. This is both the strength and weakness of the characters in this novel: they are not real people. They are not intended to be real people. They are ideas made flesh. They read like allegories and expressions of philosophical possibilities. Her heroes do not compromise, because Rand's philosophy does not compromise. Her villains break down mentally because they are really personifications of the arguments against her ideas breaking down in the face of her logic. It is effective, but means you have to love or hate her characters based on what they represent, rather than who they are.One element of the book that might be easily overlooked is its humor. This is actually a very funny book. It is practically all black humor and satire, but if you like that kind of humor (and I do) then you will have something else to appreciate in the book.A word about the science fiction elements of the story: I love the science fiction and fantasy genres, so I'm glad they are a part of this story. There is a mysterious broken-down motor that could practically mean free energy for the world, voice-activated technology, a ray screen with something like an EMP effect that brings down a plane, and a frightful tool of destruction that uses sound as a weapon. Science fiction adds to the mystery and intrigue, and just makes the story more interesting.The biggest mark against the novel, in my opinion, is the utopian aspect of the story. I just found Rand's concept of an ideal society where the very rich cheerfully do unskilled labor and have no need of any rule of law completely unbelievable. Even more unbelievable than the science fiction stuff. Of course, these are characters that do not feel jealous anger when they lose the woman they love to a rival (after all, he earned the right to be with her with his own value). This is the ultimate drawback to having characters that are really just walking ideals: there is no room for imperfection, and real people just aren't like that. (But they could be, Rand would argue. In fact, this is humanity's high moral ideal, a society where pure selfishness will not allow people to act against one another because everything they possess must be earned, and if it is earned, then they have a right to it.) As a rule, I have a problem reading about an author's idea of utopia, especially if I don't see any way that I could be a part of that system and still retain the things I value as my rights (such as the right to give something that is not earned, a thing Rand would decry as evil...and with compelling, if not fully convincing, reason). Most of us probably couldn't live in Rand's ideal world, and so we are doomed to a world that will one day fail, collapsing in on its own lack of moral strength. To be fair, her portrayal of the crash of the world's economic system is far more believable than her utopian ideal. She is at her best when she is criticizing what doesn't work, rather than trying to show us how her ideas could. The apocalyptic events described in the novel, and the corrupt system of power that brings them about, are frightening, poignant pictures of how it could all go wrong. Watch the news, listen to the words of those who sit in seats of power in our society, and you will see eerie shadows of the disaster Rand describes. Does that mean she's right about everything? I don't think so, but I do think her ideas are worth knowing about.Atlas Shrugged is a passionate romance. It is a philosophical work about good and evil, and human nature. It is a work of mystery and suspense (and even some action). It is a science fiction story. It is work of satire, and an attempt to describe an ideal. It is flawed, but worthwhile. It is beautiful and tragic. It is a socioeconomic commentary, and an intelligent sermon on reality and logic. Not everyone will enjoy it. Not everyone will make it through over a thousand pages of Rand's philosophy in action. This is especially true of those who passionately disagree with her. But I liked it. I think it's a book worth reading, with ideas worth knowing. I had fun reading it. It made me think. It made me want to have a long conversation with the woman who wrote it. I didn't really know what to expect when I picked up the book, but I'm very glad I read it. If you don't mind a lengthy book with an uncompromising ideal driving it, I would highly recommend this epic novel."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"While I would certainly recommend this novel on the basis of its captivating plot and magnetic characters, I cannot consider it great literature in any sense. Ayn Rand's philosophical views on 'Man vs. Society' are clearly presented in the early part of the novel. From there on she presents a thrilling storyline mixed in with episodes in which she essentially beats her views into your brain. Ayn Rand's greatest flaw is her complete lack of subtlty in her writing. Towards the end of the novel there is a radio broadcast which spans well over 50 pages, which is nothing short of a political essay. Since I had already gotten the point some 700 pages earlier I skipped over that entire passage, and would encourage any other reader with any sense to do the same.While the content of my review thus far has been critical, I would still recommend the novel and have given it four stars to reflect that fact. Indeed it could have been a five-star novel if the moralizing and preaching were toned down and/or substantially edited out. A better author would have shown more respect for the intellect of her audience and allowed the reader to connect the dots on their own rather than through brute force."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book twice over the years.

She has everything to keep you on the edge of your seat, action, romance and a wonderful cast of characters. She weaves an intricate saga of human nature and how it leads to the thinking that by helping the idle and taxing the inventors, companies and the doers, everyone will be equal. Rand shows that Social Justice will never work and why. A wonderful, insightful read. Hands down the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't think there's another fictional book that could have a larger impact on our political system than this one, if it were to be widely read by intelligent Americans (of which there are millions), this could inspire a renewal of the American Dream. Many reviews remark that reading Atlas Shrugged was a life-changing event. Reviews contain phrases such as: \\"Had a Lifelong Impact on Me\\", \\"The most thought-provoking book I've read\\", \\"A Refreshing Sense of Life\\", \\"A tremendously helpful book\\", \\"This book made an impact on me!\\", \\"Required Reading for all Americans\\".I read Atlas Shrugged 20 years ago for the first time. Recently I saw the 1943 movie \\"The Fountainhead\\" and was inspired to read that novel. As result of the messsage of that story, I became interested in Ayn Rand and her philosophy. While reading the wonderfully written very honest and surprisingly dramatic biography \\"Ayn Rand and the World She Made\\" which shows both the greatness and the pathology and errors of Ayn Rand, the section on the writing of Atlas Shrugged, which was the major work of Ayn Rand's life, made me want to reread \\"Atlas Shrugged\\".I have a hardback copy, but wanted the Kindle version which I carry on my frequent travels. I went online to purchase it, and at first I balked, seeing a price of $18. This seemed rather expensive compared to other books (I had expected $9.95). However, I did want to read it on my Kindle(s) and went ahead with the purchase; I'm very glad I did.The Kindle version has been very well done. I didn't see any of the mis-formating that I often see in other Kindle books, and I really enjoyed the reading experience on the Kindle. Several times I had it with me when I had an unexpected hour or two to wait (one hour was spend in a safety hallway at work, during a Tornado warning). So it took almost a week to read the 1,000+ page book.This book has a great message; an angry, seemingly selfish, but sincere and profound message that should resonate very deeply in today's world more than ever before. Sales of the book have risen and I've heard several conversations at work initiated by young adults reading it for the first time.No doubt, the book could be edited down to 500 pages and remain as effective. Many passages are too long or restated or over stated, the philosophical/economic points being made often seem to be written for teenagers, but the plot and characters are mature. This book expresses the passion of Ayn Rand and I love the detailed descriptions of my favorite characters, others (the bad guys) are over-simplified presented as \\"idiots\\" to be sure that it will covey her message to the masses. I reread the book, with patience for the verbosity, but didn't skip any of the text.The book is profound and very effective in communicating the message of the struggle of the individual against the collective; of creative accomplishment, even genius, against the mediocre of society, against socialism. It rants against the moochers of society --those who beg or demand handouts from those who own and produce goods or values; and against the looters -- those who uses force (legal, political or social) to expropriate values freely from the productive.The plot is creative and interesting and strong enough to pull me through the verbose sections, the heroic characters are draw in enough detail, with motives and lifes of great interest and personalities that resonate with me. By the time I reached the climatic speech (70 pages long), I was totally focused and interested... what it is that John Galt has to say that could justify such length? This is the essence of Ayn Rand's message and philiosophy, stated as directly as possible.... again I read every word.The final impact of the book was very profound; it could be better written, there's much to argue with concerning Rand's view of life, there's much that may be wrong, much that she missed; but there is also (and more importantly) so much that is so obviously right, inspiring and important to hear (especially for the young), that it could change America, revive the founding father's vision and reset our course and lead into a future of greatness; there are few books that could have such impact on us as this.Great literature, maybe not, but a great message and reading experience, most assuredly.The message from a quote (though stated in the negative sense) \\"Until men learn that of all human symbols, Robin Hood is the most immoral and the most contemptible, there will be no justice on earth and no way for mankind to survive\\"...Postively stated .. it is good for all that a person has freedom and liberty, to develop and pursue their purpose, skills, gifts and to be duely rewarded for that achievement,as it benefits others... government should never penalize the successful for greatness ...However, in life there is room for, and virtue in, compassion, love and respect for all sentient beings.. but socialism is not a benefit to humanity, does not encourage personal growth and responsiblity and inspire our evolution.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is being made into a movie (Part 1 of 3 is complete and will be released in 2011)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This was Rand's 4th and last novel, and also described as her \\"Magnum Opus.\\" Boy, she wasn't kiddin'! With over 1000 pages, Rand essentially paints a picture of a increasing oppressive government filled with, and controlled by the \\"moochers\\" and \\"looters\\" of our society, verses the innovative and most productive citizens of our society. This eventually leads to these great individuals going on strike in response to the slow drain of their freedom.They all basically close up shop, and take off. This is the nutshell version. Wait till' you see what the effects are. Rand was reporting on a trend in America that was happening for decades at that time, and increasing up until today...encroaching government oppressiveness, and control of it by the moochers! Ayn Rand hammers the point of the importance of individual freedom in this one. If you don't get it, you never will. And you'll probably be a looter or moocher for life.She does explain this in a more complex manner, with great detail, great characters,and emotion, but this is my two cents..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Great book that everyone should read at least once (in my opinion anyways, I wish I had found it earlier in life)after reading more of her books (especially liked capitalism and the virtue of selfishness) I furthered my reading scope and found Henry Hazlit, F.A.

Every high school student should read it - sophmore year! - so that he or she can more deeply appreciate the benefits of knowing something of the real world conveyed by higher education and how ideologues like Rand use ignorance to warp perceptions and sooth the guilt and greed of the Taggarts and Galts of the world while fluffing their own nests.

Atlas Shrugged had me expelling billions of neurons from oneside of my brain to the other trying to follow and understand the story and concepts.Simply put, it was not enjoyable to read, it was work.I have not comment on the particular philosophy presented, nor the political leanings on Ms Rand, butit's clear to me why the book wasn't very popular when it was released in the 50's. No one liked it.I think the only people who do like Atlas Shrugged are persons who are looking for whatever this bookhas to offer in the way of literary philosophy and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. I am surethat the large number of positive reviews for this book doesn't really reflects a cross section ofEnglish reader because people like me who picked it up and dropped it don't tend to bother writing a review.I happened upon this book at my workplace, we have a central area where people leave paperbacks theyhave read and pick up another, and earnestly tried to read it all but only got about 1/3 through beforeI gave up, my head hurt. I think a friend of mine who actually read it all said it best, he said: \\"Ithink the Atlas Shrugged book is 'dense'.

The main characters are all social morons, they have a real union shop attitude towards their work, and their attitudes wouldn't really motivate normal people. I think that Rand was probably hurt by her home land, and that comes through in her extreme views.The great hypocrasy of this book is the forward by, I think, Leonard Peokiff.

Rand is truly a visionary as many of her ideas about the evils of the world are rearing their ugly heads today. I have yet to meet a liberal who hasn't had their entire value system turned on its head after reading this, or a conservative (like myself)who hasn't had their own values reinforced and built upon by this book. One of the people who reviewed this book said that she didn't understand Rand's message and really didn't care, she just enjoyed the story. While the story is epic in proportions and all engrossing, the story is the message. She seemed to understand the evils and virtues Rand espouses, so without actually knowing it she does understand the underlying themes. Objectivism is a philosophy which encompasses all aspects of life from politics, to economics, to sex and relationships. Whether you care about politics or not you can apply the philosophy of Objectivism espoused in this book to almost any aspect of your life. Rand truly is one of the greatest thinkers and writers of our time. Make no mistake about it the looters exist, their names are Teddy Kennedy, Tom Daschle, and Hillary Clinton. If you can make the claim \\"I swear by my life-and my love for it-that I shall never live for the sake of another. Nor ask another to live for mine.\\" Then you are ready for Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, and you have already begun to grasp it. I would reccomend you begun with Anthem, move to The Fountainhead, and then read Atlas Shrugged if you are new to Rand. It will start you off slow and gradually prepare you for the magnitude of Atlas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I loved this book and The Illuminati Manifesto!Very powerful works!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The excruciatingly tedious sex is exceeded only by the excruciatingly tedious economic preaching that passes for foreplay among Rand's characters."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book for the first time at age 14, it thrilled me. Just finished listening to the Highbridge edition on cassette.I think 14 was about the right age to read the book. My capsule review now is as follows:An empty shell of a half-baked philosophy, borne along by a river of the worst sort of romance-novel prose and story structure.The story was well-read by the narrator and entertaining enough on a long car trip. There are certainly better-fleshed-out versions of the philosophy espoused here, and the love story aspect is mushy and starry-eyed enough to make any post-teenager cringe. Ick.Catherine Potter"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's just too long to drive home its point. The characters are one-dimensional, or not realistic. Granted it is a philosophical novel, it still is a novel, and the characters should have been made more believable. Too much repetition as well. I also don't understand what the big deal about objectivism is- haven't a lot of people before Ayn Rand been living their lives according to their own self-interest?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Before I read it, I thought there might be something to Rand!!!! Now that I've read it, I see that she was just a pathetic demagogue whose &quot;philosophical&quot; system consisted almost entirely of rationalizations!!!!Read this book and SET YOURSELF FREE -- of the mind-numbing Cult of Objectivism!!!!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is a story that is grounded very strongly in a particular philosophical viewpoint, namely Objectivism. I'm not going to criticize Objectivism too harshly, since the story could have been great even if Objectivism is not, but I must say that Rand spends far too much time force-feeding her philosophy through the characters. Grounding a story in philosophy is not a bad idea....but continuously having your characters give 6 page monologues on the greatness of an idea gets ridiculous after 300 pages or so.What Atlas Shrugged really needed was an editor. This story could have been told, without losing anything whatsoever, in 400 pages or less, instead of the absurd length of 1074 pages that my copy contains.Furthermore, there were serious problems with the plot and characters. Every single character in the book is a blatant stereotype that doesn't actually exist in real life. All of the \\"good guys\\" (Hank, John, Ragnar) think, act, speak, dress, and look exactly alike. The only exception is Dagny Taggart, who is different only by the fact that she's a woman. The \\"bad guys\\" are all exactly the same as well, expounding a ridiculous philosophy that Rand calls \\"collectivism\\" which doesn't actually exist in the real world. With her characters, Rand is making the well-known \\"either-or fallacy\\" (which she does quite often in her fiction and non-fiction work). Rand presents two sides and then declares that they are the only choices, without allowing for the possibility of a third option.Now, on to the plot. This book appears to be set in the future, but it was plainly outdated even when it was originally published (1947 I think). Rand's view of the future is ridiculously primitive and unimaginative. Trains are still the primary mode of transportation and steel is the main industry. There is absolutely no mention of the service or information sector, which was beginning to rise at the time of the writing of the book. Wow, what a lack of vision. Furthermore, the very premises and underpinnings of the plot are false. If the major corporate executives were to \\"go on strike\\" as the plot suggests, then business would just continue as usual. Rand seems to believe that all the business leaders are the main creative engine of the world, which is outright false. Most innovation and creativity comes from the rank and file....those who the capitalists exploit for profit. Take away business leaders and nothing is lost.A well read socialist or biologist would be able to debunk Rand's philosophical underpinnings easily, because they are based on a bed of misunderstandings about human nature. The story wasn't terrible, but it could have been much better, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. To summarize: Poor philosophy + long-winded and boring storytelling + bad plot = A waste of my time. Definitely not recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Her philosophy is indeed &quot;whack.&quot; Let's see why.&quot;The basic premise of Objectivism is that you are your highest value, you care about yourself foremost. You care for and love other people when they add to your life, (i.e. you buy your kids presents for Christmas because it makes YOU happy to see them happy, you are doing it for yourself).&quot;Yep, that's pretty whack. To understand what's wrong with it, consider a simple example.I want to eat a piece of cake. Eating a piece of cake will make me happy. Does that mean what I really want is happiness?Hardly. &quot;Happiness&quot; isn't some hard little nugget of something-or-other that can be pursued in various ways -- as though I get out of bed in the morning, notice that I have a taste for &quot;happiness,&quot; and fetch around for something that will give it to me. The &quot;happiness&quot; in question here is specifically the happiness _of_ eating a piece of cake; what I &quot;want&quot; is not &quot;happiness&quot; but just to eat the cake.A straightforward enough confusion, and one pointed out long ago by T.H. Green against the &quot;utilitarians&quot; of his time. But consider the same criticism applied to the present case.We care about other people because they make us happy, we are told. So when I pursue your well-being, what I'm really pursuing is my own happiness.Getting whacker by the minute. In pursuing your well-being, what I &quot;want&quot; is not &quot;happiness,&quot; but _your well-being_. Do I care about your well-being because it makes me happy -- or does your well-being make me happy because I care about it for some other reason?You decide. But this whackness is a perfect example of Rand's attempt to reduce other-regard to a matter of sheer prudence. Her &quot;philosophy&quot; leaves us no way to care _directly_ about the well-being of someone else -- surely an odd feature in a &quot;philosophy&quot; that was supposed to provide the true foundation of both rights and benevolence. (And David Kelley's _Unrugged Individualism_ doesn't solve the problem either, though this review isn't the place to say why.)&quot;To say 'I love you,' one must first learn to say the 'I',&quot; wrote Rand. Fine as far as it goes. But one must also learn to go on and say the &quot;you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand certainly had a dream- one of complete self-reliance, both of individuals and of societies, and of lives lived through nothing but reason. For that, we can place her books on the same shelf as that of Marx and other idealists who envisioned an utopia on earth and whom have gathered reverent disciples to genuflect at the feet of the master. The remarks on Atlas Shrugged and her other writings reflect both the devotion (from her fellow travelers) and extreme dislike (from opponents).One can easily find simple arguments for and against her simplistic ideology- the utter failure to understand natural human attachments like that of children for parents and vice versa, the appealing refusal of individual responsibility for others (in Rand's world, no one is ill or suffers from mental disease) and the rejection of irrational belief and emotional tie, whether it be religion, nation, ethnicity and so on. (She fails to carry this through to the economic growth cult or its ally, that of technological determinism. So she is a believer.)I wish I could write that this book has virtues beyond her ideological pretensions. Its enthusiasts believe so. But alas. Atlas Shrugged is but a mouthpiece for her peculiar set of beliefs; it is artless, incredibly repetitive and ponderous. Her arrogant refusal to accept editorial guidance is painfully obvious; no competent editor would have allowed such a bloated book. By the famous John Galt speech toward the end, I was limping badly. The characters are simple people with poor memories, little capacity for emotion (beyond resentment toward others for getting in their way) and great ambition. I was reminded of certain politicians. But they do work hard and resent any interference in their enterprises. Fortunately for them, they don't have a spouse or children at home, elderly parents or other obligations. If they did, they'd be more interesting people, but Rand's ideology would collapse upon itself.Nevertheless, it is worth one's time to read one of Rand's novels in order to gain an understanding of why her fans love her so. And she has had influential admirers, including Alan Greenspan.

There are so many wonderful books to be read, if you are interested in her philosophy, read her shorter book, save your time and move on to something good."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn RandI came across Atlas Shrugged by following the book tree that started with Berkshire Hathaway's letters to shareholders by Warren Buffett which led to, The Smartest Guys in the Room then to The Fountainheads and finally to When Atlas Shrugged. (The full tree is available at my blog) At the time my company owned property in Western Massachusetts and the ideals and concepts that caused such frustration to the innovative business people in the book was similar to the thought patterns of many of the locals in Western Mass. While reading Atlas Shrugged you may think it unimaginable that in the most pronounced capitalist society of the modern world people can have such disregard or even genuine animosity to the point of sabotage towards the risk taking, forward looking and progress oriented capitalist, but I can assure you, even in today's day and age, which is much different that when Ayn Rand wrote this book, they are out there in force.Ayn Rand came from communist Russia and was full of frustration about what was happening in her former country. She, very tastefully and eloquently tried to embed in the American people the dangers and disruptive forces that can destroy capitalism. Partly because of my then current situation, dealing with people that could have been straight out of one of the ghost town abandoned factory cities mentioned in the book (and they may just end up that way) my attachment and addiction to continue reading was one of the strongest I can remember feeling in a long time.This book really helps you understand the different forces in play in a capitalist society in an extremely entertaining way. The message is loud and clear. I think to many people try to take it to another level or turn the message into an abstract concept that needs to be worked on and acquired over time.

Look, I can understand why she would jump in the ditch on the right, having grown up under Soviet Communism. But her Objectivism is as about as feasible and effective as the Communism she ran screaming from. Uber rigid hard-liners, be they on the right or the left end up self-centered, boorish, and alone. Want to find out the real scoop on hypocrisy of her Objectivism? Read \\"Judgement Day, My Years with Ayn Rand\\" by Nathaniel Branden. (This is the couple that co-wrote \\"The Virtue of Selfishness.\\") Rand and Branden, married not to each other, nevertheless decide to have an affair with each other. Some time later, Branden decides to have an affair with someone else not his wife or Rand. When Rand found out, my my my, she had a corker of a conniption fit. And that dear readers is the ultimate failure of Objectivism: It's okay if *you* are the one behaving selfishly to the detriment of those around you. But when someone else behaves in like manner and it negatively affects you?

Total focus on individual rights and rational selfishness becomes your 'gospel,' and you fall in love with the nobility of honest businessman earning his profit by trading with other capitalists of high integrity.But after the initial rush tapers away, and you start analyzing more &quot;Objectively&quot; you realize it is a house of cards. John Galt (her perfect human being) has a worldview that fails from a philosophical point of view, from a logical point of view, and most importantly from plain common sense.If you're interested in Libertarian philosophy, (similar to Rand's Objectivism) there are many better sources of a philosophical foundation for it than this work."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This was the most interesting and truthful book I have ever read.This book literally changes the way some us think and view the current state of the United States and the world. There are so many parodies within the book and the current political conditions in the United States today, that I could hardly beleive it was written so long ago. Rand's book points out the immorality of people living off the efforts of others. When you read the book and start to look around, a person can definitly see that America is becoming a socialistic state. Think about Social Security, welfare, hud, medicare, and a whole slew of other governmental redistributive programs. Also take a serious look at how the current tax code punishes you for trying to get ahead in life.The type of people who support these types of programs also beleive that it is the responsibility of the productive and brightest people of this country to support them. They also beleive the that it is fair that 1% of this country pay 35% of the taxes. Meanwhile, they beleive it is moral for them to accept payments for being unproductive (welfare, etc.) This book is a must read for people that are tired of hearing people whine for their fair share when they do nothing to deserve it. I was never subjected ot Rand's works in all my business courses while in college."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"By far the best book I have ever read. Totally inspirational. To answer Spencer's complaint below about Objectivism being &quot;whack&quot;, because it promotes people from being uncaring, I have to say that is false. The basic premise of Objectivism is that you are your highest value, you care about yourself foremost. You care for and love other people when they add to your life, (i.e. you buy your kids presents for Christmas because it makes YOU happy to see them happy, you are doing it for yourself). That may or may not clear up that issue, I am far from a good writer. After reading this book I reccommend reading other Objectivist works such as The Selfish Manifesto, or one of Peikoff's many books explaining basic facets of the philosophy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is generally acknowledged that Atlas Shrugged is more of an application of her Objectivism in a story format than a traditonal novel. This is a good thing, since as a novel, this book falls short. The characters are very two-dimensional and the plot was badly structured. I'm not opposed to a lengthy book, but Atlas Shrugged is too long, longer than it needed to be. The dialogue, the plot twists and the ideas are all repeated over and over again, beating the reader over the head with a message that, in essence, is quite simple. Even the characters are repetive, it quickly becomes difficult to discern differences between any of the &quot;good guys&quot;. Midas Mulligan, Ellis Wyatt, Ken Danagger, Francisco D'Anacondia, Hank Rearden and even John Galt all seem so similar, one wonders why Rand even bothered coming up with different names for what is essentially the same character. The &quot;bad guys&quot; are even less inspired: Kip Chalmers, Wesley Mouch, Tinky Holloway, Jim Taggart, Dr. Ferris... after the first ten chapters, one is inclined not even to bother learning any of their names.But the redeeming quality of this book is the excellent job it does of making the reader think. I've not yet read a book that brought me to a level of introspection as deep as this one did. And while I don't agree with some of Rand's views, most of the ideas presented seemed very true, or atleast, upon examination, lead to a realization of truths. And even though Ayn Rand's philosophical rants become repetetious, every diatribe, whether delivered by Galt, D'Anacondia or Haley, leaves the reader with some new insight and forces him or her to examine all the ramifications of Objectivism. This book is definitely Anti-socialist, and with communism failing in Russia since its publication, it seems almost prophetic in that regard. However, I would not call it anti-religious as it seems Rand is not opposed to religion in general but rather the mysticism some of its followers resort to. We've all seen the yahoos Rand describes on the street corners, testifying that the state of the world is God's own retribution for our insolence, and they have very little to do with the actual teachings of Christ.All in all, Atlas Shrugged is a very interesting book, that makes the reader think and think deeply, and which is sometimes dull only in its execution."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is a book with impact. A vision created that can keep one going for the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shruggedis known as Ayn Rand's magnum opus, and the reasons for thishonor are easily found within the pages of the book. The novel challenges thousandsof years of altruism and collectivism in human civilization. Atlas Shrugged is AynRand's tribute to the men of the mind: scientists, philosophers, businessmen, artists,teachers. It is a mystery novel, not about the murder of a man, but the murder ofmankind's spirit and the struggle to bring it back. The novel unites metaphysics,ethics, economics and romantic love. The integration of theme, plot, characterizationand style are unparalleled by any other philosophical work of the century. Theseelements, combined with the novel's scope and depth, lead the reader into AynRand's world, where he discovers and enters the lost Atlantis, a world of moral giants."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If there ever was a novel written with a single minded purpose of proving the author's philosophy as a panacea for all human problems, not by the merits of the philosophy and convincing arguments but by relentless propaganda, this must be the one.Even if one were convinced by Ayn Rand's philosophy applied in a narrow sphere in her other two novels &quot;Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;We the Living&quot;, after reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" one would realize how absurd her philosophy is when it is extended beyond the narrow sphere. Choosing the novel as a medium to explain her philosophy through a bunch of unreal characters and a comic book story line, far from proving her philosophy as a means of attaining utopia, actually puts into question the philosophy itself. Though the novel as a medium for teaching her philosophy might not have worked for Ayn Rand, it proves the inadequacy of her philosophy for the real world.The theme of the novel is bordering on absurdity and the plot and events are exaggerated out of proportion. A bunch of God like super heroes (geniuses) stop the motor of the world by refusing to use their creative minds for the progress of mankind, thus depriving the mediocre society of all their inventions and contributions. They do this because their philosophy is diametrically opposite to that of the society which is infested with the greatest ills of the world according to their (i.e. Ayn Rand's) objectivistic philosophy - collectivism, altruism, charity, and selflessness.What made me feel annoyed and amused as well was the fact that she projects her philosophy as a panacea for all the problems of the world and tries to prove that an utopia can be created just by following her philosophy. Her philosophy is purely materialistic and far removed from reality. It applies only for that fraction of mankind which consists of geniuses, intellectuals, inventors and scientists and conspicuously ignores all the other &quot;mediocre&quot; people.Ayn Rand's objectivistic ideas are not so worthless as to be rejected in whole. I myself am an admirer of her ideas of absolute individualism and her theory of man's ego as the fountainhead of progress. I like her absolutely egoistic characters, not for the perverted principles they hold and their presumptuous philosophy, but for their unbending ego, absolute integrity, extreme individualism and undaunted courage in standing against the society to which they don't come to terms.Ayn Rand's ideas make sense only when they are limited to the individual. They lose their credibility and become absurd when they are projected as the means to create an utopia. Though her eulogy for the genius of Man, which has made him achieve such a tremendous progress in all fields, is to be appreciated, it seems absurd to read her explain away all the problems of the world by glorifying steel, foundry, oil and railroads. The way she glorifies the industrial achievements of man one would think man is born only to build bridges and railroads.Coming to the novel itself, I felt really bored by the way she sings her philosophy page after page, making the whole novel a massive work of propaganda in which she beats Goebbels. In her attempt to make her philosophy as the only way for utopia, she confuses and contradicts herself in many places. For example, one of her characters Richard Haley retires from public life the day after his first grand success as a musician, saying in essence that people appreciated his music rather than his genius mind which produced that music. Here Ayn Rand contradicts her own philosophy that man is an end in himself and consequently should not depend on others for anything including appreciation. This is not the absolute ego which her philosophy tends to glorify.The characters in the novel and the world she has created for them to live in seem just out of a fairy tale. It looks as if she has invented an imaginary world different from our own to suit her philosophy rather than using the real world which is too complicated for her philosophy. Her characters are incredibly identical, like the preconditioned inhabitants of \\"Brave New World\\". While there are at least six types of human beings in Huxley's dystopia, there are only two types in Ayn Rand's world - those who follow her philosophy and those who oppose it. Throughout the novel each type behaves in the same way, like a keyed toy. Those who follow her philosophy (heroes), right from the highest intellectual genius to the lowest \\"intellectual\\" foreman, recite her philosophy unvaryingly like a nursery rhyme and in a sickening frequency as if to din it into the reader's mind. Those who don't follow her philosophy (villains) oppose it in the same way, glorifying all the &quot;evils&quot; of objectivistic philosophy - altruism, charity, social responsibility, and so on. It looks as if people exist in her world only to follow or oppose the objectivistic philosophy.Those who don't support her philosophy fight against those who do for no reason other than to destroy that philosophy and its followers. An incredible theme on which the whole novel hangs. Here there is another contradiction of her philosophy. Both the kinds of people have the same &quot;virtue&quot; of selfishness which her philosophy preaches, though the motives and means may be opposed when viewed from conventional moral point of view. As Ayn Rand does not consider morality from the conventional point of view and the war waged by the opponents are ideological, the qualities of both the characters are essentially same implying that both follow her philosophy, a corollary which is contrary to Ayn Rand's intention.While she makes her heroes larger than life, showing them in their best and giving them God like powers over humanity, she portrays her anti-heroes as a vulgar, slipshod imbeciles, their actions always bordering on absurdity. May be she tries to convey the point that all the intellectuals follow her philosophy and all the imbeciles are opposed to it.Her utopian valley \\"Galt's Gultch\\" with all the intellectual egoists in pompous and ridiculous roles is as comical and fantastic as Alice's wonderland. The stilted dialogues of her characters who always seem to understand more than the words and attribute philosophical meanings even for ordinary conversations are other sources of irritation.Notwithstanding the grand theme and philosophical pretensions, Atlas Shrugged degenerates into a pot-boiler with a turgid philosophy and frivolous story line."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Great read. Very scary realism to Ayn Rands credit.

It is superbly written and you don't have to be a political intellectual of any faith to enjoy it. Even if you don't agree, it is still a fantastic story. At least see the movie out in April.

These are hard-working who ask nothing except that they receive rewards for their efforts. Several things bother me about the book. The redundancy is a problem. Ayn Rand says the same thing over and over and over again. She is so didactic--preaching, not telling a story much of the time. The ideology is troublesome: the worship of God has been replaced by the worship of money. Capitalism, unchecked, is the desired goal. The heroes, we are led to believe, are self reliant people who reached success through nothing but their own efforts. All this is unrealistic. Money does not make people happy. Capitalism without regulation does not work and people only reach success with the help of \\"a village\\" (their genes, their parents, their teachers, coaches, schools, luck, etc.). It is hard to believe that this book inspired so many people like vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Few books are polarizing; even fewer where a substantial number of the critics haven't read the book. SATANIC VERSES comes to mind; its author is still hiding from folks that would have him killed--a majority of whom probably did not read the book--at the order of their religious leader who declared it blasphemous. ATLAS SHRUGGED, a novel from the fifties, is a case in point.Great works of art--and great works in general--transcend authorship. Wagner was Hitler's inspiration, yet we listen attentively to his music. Henry Ford, who was inspired by Hitler, brought us automobiles with interchangeable parts, allowing an entire industry to profit. How many people drive Fords today?You may have been told that Ayn Rand was this or that kind of person. I am not going to prosecute or defend her or her philosophy, however, Ayn Rand's Book ATLAS SHRUGGED stands on its own. It is an epic and great love story with great--though perhaps not all that real--characters that develop and have great things to say. The book also has a message beyond simply \\"objectivism.\\" It's about accomplishment in a hostile world. It's about the power of love. It's about irony. It is about parasites. It's about innovation. And it's frikkin' fiction.The main male character, Hank Reardon, develops a lighter, stronger, cheaper steel and is persecuted for it by lesser men. The main female character, Dagny, is a more competent manager than her brother of a major railroad. She sees in Hank the solution to her railroad. Hank sees in her the solution to his steel company. In theory, it is a match made in heaven. Mutually beneficial. All around them, however, are freeloaders, people who want to get value for producing none on their own. On the one hand that is simplistic--it was written in the late forties and early fifties when equal opportunity was assumed, but definitely didn't exist--in the real world, there are seven billion individual characters with complexities that cannot be portrayed. But from a storytelling perspective, it is about the difficulties inherent with being innovative, of being an effective and efficient leader, of doing more with less. Of accomplishment. And when one gets persecuted for it, well, the innovators will stop innovating; in fact, they go on strike. That is kind of silly on face value because innovators typically keep innovating in real life. But as fiction, as a love story between folks that each have and fill a need while being surrounded by folks that just take; well, it makes for great fiction.Ayn Rand was surely a strange gal. But she was an independent woman. A leader. A thinker. A change-agent. At least in ATLAS SHRUGGED it's the freeloaders that do the bombing and the hating and the parasitizing. Rand's personal life may have been a mess compared to others in the 50s, but ATLAS SHRUGGED is far more meaningful than, say, FIFTY SHADES OF GRAY, or other popular trash that one can buy today. And ATLAS SHRUGGED represents accomplishment in its own right. It took her three years to write the seventy-page John Galt soliloquy alone that begins, \\"I am the man who loves his life and I will not do penance for my own virtues.\\" I think she spent seven or eight years in total writing this 1,000+ page work of fiction.ATLAS SHRUGGED, which I've read off and on a few times over the past couple decades is my ninety-eighth review here on Amazon.com. I am not selling ideology. I am simply recommending it because it is a great book. I am happy to discuss it at length. But if you don't read the book, or use it as a pawn in a larger game of politics--again, without reading it--then there's really no discussion to be had. That is not personal. It has everything to do with being literate, being able to think for yourself, and joining in on life's journey.ATLAS SHRUGGED is highly recommended... - lc"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have always enjoyed this book ...

(Her double-dealing on this point is how she manages to bar 'benevolence' from any important place in her 'philosophy'.) But once you've swallowed that false dichotomy, the rest is easy: the whole world comprises a few 'rational' folks (like YOU, of course!) and a whole lot of 'second-handers' and 'parasites' who are out to use you as a Sacrificial Animal.

Amid an intensely structured writing style with detailed characterizations that would make Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton blush (\\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"), there are economic, social and political descriptions that seem to mirror our times.These comparisons include a world where popular leaders are less concerned about the correctness of the ideas they advocate, but more concerned about the number of followers they can attract. A world where some highly publicized and popular ideas, if taken to their logical conclusion, would result in the eradication of mankind from this planet. And finally, a world where rhetoric counts for more than logic.Ayn Rand attempted to identify the root causes of these behaviors and propose a solution in an epic end-of-the-world story. To summarize, in some future or parallel world, everything is grinding to a halt. The primary producers are dropping out and disappearing. They are being replaced by people who are both humanistic and opportunistic, but not very knowledgeable. As a result, industry continues to collapse. Eventually the government steps in and in a series of directives are issued: each more severe and more socialistic. But each directive worsens the situation, until a dictator-like status is reached.Amid this crisis, the book primarily traces the activities of two individuals: Dagny Taggart, in charge of the operations of the last Transcontinental Railroad, and Hank Rearden, the last of the steel barons. Both characters are very intelligent, responsible, and highly productive. Other important characters move in and out of the narrative: the good, the bad, and the indifferent, but Taggart and Rearden are used to discover the root causes of the world-wide collapse.Near the novel's end, when the causes (according to Rand) are rooted out by both Taggart and Rearden, there is a long speech (Part 3, Chapter 7: \\"This is John Galt Speaking\\") that sums up Ayn Rand's philosophy. It is the notorious 50 page speech, which most people either skip or browse rapidly. Unless one is reading Atlas Shrugged simply for entertainment, I recommend that you take the time to carefully read the \\"speech.\\" There are a number of issues (especially her very anti-religious stance) that are spelled out and justified in that speech, but hardly touched in the book.I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the significant root causes of this double-minded world, but her solution (taken to the extreme that she advocates) is seriously flawed. For Rand, the problem can be distilled down to the fight between the romantic/emotional side and the rational/logic side. The descent into political, social, and economic madness has occurred because logic has been discredited by the elite, and decisions are made solely on how they appeal to our emotions.For Ayn Rand, the mind and the rational process take precedence. Her sense of morality is linked to the ability to produce. Religion, as is, is to be discarded, because it ultimately depends on a non-rational activity (the religious experience). So she believes that any morality based on a non-rational activity cannot be the basis of a moral code. However, Rand's use of religious terminology and illusions are scattered throughout this work. One cannot help but make comparisons to the \\"End of the World\\" and the \\"Second Coming\\" (of Christ or the Capitalist?) along with the \\"Sign of the Dollar\\" as opposed to the \\"Sign of the Cross.\\"As far as I am aware, no one has successfully described how to balance the emotional with the rational, and Rand does not even try. Rand's solution is that the emotional must be completely subjugated to the rational. Rand would redefine all emotional things, including Love, Hate, Respect, etc, in strictly rational terms.At this time in our history, when rhetoric is replacing rational thinking, especially in the political realm, it is obvious that we too need to rebalance the rational (a terrible shock to most Political Romantics), otherwise we too will face a collapsing world. But rejecting the emotional or trying to redefine the emotional in strictly logical terms is absurd. It denies our humanity and our history.I question Rand's attempt to define a purely rational moral code based solely on the ability to produce for several reasons. The first objection, I admit (ironically), is solely (and ironically) a matter of one's taste: the image of Dagny Taggart as a willing sex-slave to the highest producer (not based on love, because that is irrational). That's right, abolish love or redefine it so that it fits a rational definition. Rand's attempt to do exactly that is probably the most warped thing she proposes in this book.My second objection is purely practical: an atheist morality has one significant flaw, even Bertrand Russell acknowledged that weakness: Pride. The ability to compete, no holds bared, without having to acknowledge any higher power would lead to a dog-eat-dog environment that would be Hell on earth for the majority of mankind.I realize that Rand believed that (socially-evolutionary-speaking) that the dog-eat-dog world would eventually destroy itself and finally result (and then a miracle occurs) in a harmonious capitalistic society. Unfortunately, US History does not support her. We have a long dog-eat-dog history of capitalism in 19th Century United States and it was not pretty nor was it getting better until governmental regulation stepped in and laws protecting the laborer were passed.My third objection is historic: for every Ford (who paid his staff above Union wage and implemented work safety processes) there were several dozen Andrew Carnegies, John D. Rockefellers, and J.P. Morgans (who abused their workers, stole others' ideas, and manipulated stock prices to increase their own income). Rand would protect all the above, although I suspect that Ford was closer to her model of Rearden then the other Capitalists.Despite my objections, I believe that Ayn Rand correctly identified the imbalance between the rational and emotional as the underlying cause for the inability to produce or to solve significant political, social or economical problems. While she argues that the logical conclusion of the pure romantic (one who rejects all rationality) is nullity, I believe that the logical conclusion of the pure rationalist (one who rejects all emotion) is tyranny because co-operation among any competitors will break down once the means to bypass or control another is found.While Rand would like to believe that competing capitalists can cooperate, history has shown us a very different picture. After all, Capitalists, whether she wants to admit it or not, are only human and that means they do not suppress their emotions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Read this one when you are bored with fluff.

It's a book that you must have in your library and of course a book to read at least once in your life. My favorite is the FOUNTAINHEAD[[ASIN:0452286751 The Fountainhead (Centennial Edition Hardcover)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This CD book is read in a clear easy to listen to voice. Thoroughly enjoyable. Perfect for one who experience Dyslexia. What a great way to hear a very large book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm still reading this book but I love it so far. There are so many consistencies and symbolic references to today's government. It really makes you look at it from a new angle. I highly recommend this. It will take a while to read, but it is worth it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First, let's all agree that this is a great book. A bit long, but the prose is magnificent, the story is riveting, the theme is grandiose, and few can claim to have read it or even a portion of it without leaving profoundly affected.Second, let's all agree that it is fiction. It is a set of allegories and metaphors. Rand supporters like to tell everyone that Atlas Shrugged was rated as the second most influential book in a poll of Americans (One must assume well-read Americans), second only to the Bible. The two books share many things: they share a similar structure of radical followers who take each word as fact, as well as detractors who point to the inconsistencies in their philosophies. They share a physical scale ranging from the singular thoughts to the fates of nations, and moral scale ranging from the godly to the satanic. Their interpretations rely on a certain adherence to principles contain within themselves, to be accepted as matters of faith. And yet, they appear to come to virtually opposite conclusions: selfishness and altruism as the ultimate cause of right and wrong (and vice-versa, of course).Whether Rand herself believed that any of the heroic characters was possible in real life is immaterial, the fact is that there never has been a John Galt, and asking a rational human being to conform to such a standard is like asking a christian to conform to the standard of Jesus Christ. A rational person can strive through his actions to become more like Galt, but perfect rationality is unreachable by physically limited brains in a complexly intertwined world.The book is about the struggle between life and death on the scale of civilizations. Rand shows that the basic and only real dichotomy available to any life form is that of existence or non-existence. The human mind is seen in this book as a mere tool of survival -- albeit a uniquely powerful one. The modern luxury of laziness has led to some mass denial of this fact: our increasing life spans and standards of living in the western world are more and more attributed to faith and society, and we lose sight of the fact that individuals had to use their heads to make it all possible. The lesson is that we can choose to believe what we want, but eventually the consequences must be felt.The book is about social responsibility as a metaphor for personal responsibility -- and it says that if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Most who cite a flaw in it are interpreting allegorical characters as realistic. The pure good of Dagny Taggart, Francisco d'Anconia, and Hank Rearden vs. the pure evil of James Taggart, Wesley Mouch, and Orren Boyle is a metaphor: the attitudes that value life vs. the attitudes that cause death. The story of the Men of the Mind's revenge, and the difference between Akston and Stadler, is a call to the good people of the world to stop kowtowing to the evil around them when possible, and stand up for what they believe in loud and clear; it is not a manifesto for world destruction. In reality, there is a some good and evil in every human or human system, a fact that is realistically impossible to work around without becoming some sort of rationalist hermit.Rand took a very general philosophy, instilled its values in larger-than-life characters, and told a story of a scope virtually untouched since the Bible. The book's profundity is not an effect acheived because it is great writing (it is), or because Rand is dead-on in her philosophy on life (in the nature of philosopy, we'll never know), but because there is a piece of every character in every one of us. We all have some of the genius of Galt, the loyalty of Eddie Willers, the cunning of Wesley Mouch, the guilt of Henry Rearden, the romanticism of Dagny Taggart, the depression of James Taggart, and the disillusionment of Cheryl Taggart. Rand takes all these little local impulses, and carries them through their conclusions on a global scale, showing us what they do to those around us and those we can't see. The best marker of truth I have found is consistency; and a theme that scales from the conflicts in one's self to the survival of millions is hard to ignore.The message is often interpreted as being that only those who produce, and those who covet wealth, are of human value. But Orren Boyle coveted wealth, and it left him \\"in the city when the lights went out.\\" So many see the phrase \\"the virtue of selfishness,\\" and forget that it is a qualified selfishness -- it is a selfishness that only covets what it has produced itself. It is a selfishness based on honesty, that recognizes that for every unconditional giver there must be an unconditional taker (a thief). The message in Atlas Shrugged, behind all the jumbled justification of selfishness, the vicious attacks on some unenlightened interpretation of faith, and the tangled contradictions of quack philosophy, is much the same as that in the Bible. It is a call to live by the golden rule, to never take by force. The Bible uses the wrath and mercy of God to extend consequences to those who chose to follow or not to follow this rule. Atlas Shrugged attempts to do it through logic.I'm ignoring some major things that cause others to revile or worship this book. This is intentional, because any theme with this much truth is easy to vilify or deify by examining the plot that surrounds it. It affected me personally so deeply, that I had to take one of three paths in inperpreting it. I could fear the overwhelming sense of truth and spend some time trying to gather every shred I could to debunk it, I could accept the feeling on faith and assume that it was gospel, or I could cut through the inconsistencies and see that the conflict of Atlas Shrugged is in me. It is one that I struggle with every moment, and it is one that everyone lives every day, inside of our minds and hearts and souls. While Rand may have claimed to have all the answers, most of us cannot ... it is the battle in this book that makes the lonely conflict within all of us between greatness and depravity seem so much more important. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone as something that will change your life."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the most timely reads given today's economic and political issues.I first read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged in 10th grade. I then read again in college. From there, I have re-read this classic about every decade.In recent times I have been on an annual read cycle of Atlas Shrugged. Need I say more?My first reading as a high school sophomore was pretty much matter-of-fact. Of course you earn an \\"A\\" you keep an \\"A.\\" What is so hard about that? Of course that is how things work (naive sophomore). Your work that yields excellent results is not redistributed to classmates who are either lazy or less talented. You keep your grade. They keep theirs. Nothing unfair about that. Next.If you chose to share something with another, whether earned or inherited, that was a personal choice, out of the kindness of your heart, not mandated, legislated generosity. By and large many people I knew were generous - by individual choice.On the football field, the track, the baseball diamond, and in competitive debates, we all kept score. There are winners and there are losers. It wasn't mean and unfair. It was competition. Who is the best at the contest at hand? The fastest wins the race. Not everyone gets a Happy Meal.What is somewhat puzzling to me is how I go back to this fictional piece from time-to-time to re-connect with pragmatism, individualism, and just doing the right thing in the face of criticism and being singled out by those in power who are working hard to get you to go along with their socialistic agendas and feel guilty about wanting to achieve personal success. Perhaps it is because our political and economic reality today is so twisted and wrong that I have to turn to fiction to see a pragmatic solution and hope for the future. Scary.Now, perhaps more than ever in my lifetime, I feel is time for as many of us to read, whether for the first time or the tenth time Ayn Rand's classic before our country is completely stolen away from us.Atlas Shrugged ought to be required reading in high school.In essence let's reclaim what is ours and expose the looters' mentality and regime we are experiencing today.Atlas Shrugged is a pretty cool novel -- but make no mistake -- it is not a comedy -- it is as serious as the troubling times of 2009."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Before reading Atlas Shrugged in college, I often wondered why people cult to Ayn Rand, just as I have wondered why people have blind-faith in their various ingrained religions. Often they themselves cannot explain to me specifically why their heroes are righteous - at least they cannot explain it to me rationally. But then who can explain such magnificent things? My personal take on Rand is that she alone hits a base cord in the readers who understand the reverence that must be given to those minds who have build unbelievably supreme and unfathomably complex manmade systems in our modern world. Although Rand's time spoke to continental trains, and skyscrapers, you can't help but superimpose more modern and wondrous inventions. There are more and more things of amazement that are being created that simply can't be comprehended by most, yet paramount to the human condition is that the unknown must be reconciled! To understand Rand's thought is a must, but to read her longwinded, overly melodramatic, and dare I say... second-rate... writing is optional. But I have yet to find other writers who &quot;get it&quot; like she does. I suspect they don't exist, and that's why so many people are still parked in Rand's camp. The most succinct thing I have read about Ayn Rand's writing was that she is &quot;a man-lover&quot;. Religions do not approve of putting mere man at the helm. They would rather attribute all things to supernatural origins. Ayn's thoughts are, and have been, at the forefront of this clash between mysticism and realism. As we continue to move from a &quot;natural&quot; to a more human influenced world, her thought will only get more and more important as the struggle toward a rational society continues."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;For twelve years you have been asking: Who is John Galt. This is John Galt speaking. I am the man who loves his life. I am the man who does not sacrifice his love or his values. I am the man who has deprived you of victims and has thus destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are perishing-you who dread knowledge-I am the man who will now tell you.&quot; Not very awe-inspiring, right? I mean, who wants somebody pushing all of their beliefs about God, about a good life, about what is virtuous and sacred in front of an oncoming train and pulverizing them into an indistinguishable evil that towers over the world and makes what is good wrong? What is wrong with the people who love this book? It's like it is their Bible. A revelation. An achievement limitless in magnitude, if only everybody understood. It is a book for dreamers, the &quot;new intellectual.&quot; And I salute those dreamers. The books of Ayn Rand are very incompatible with the views of society as a whole. Even the term itself. But for the free mind, the mind untarnished by the binding views of religion, by society, and by a limited ambition, this book can be a roadmap to success in life. Her two most-famous books, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are the two of the best books I have read so far in my life. And I have read most of the classics, and most of the great philosophers. Her views are uncompromising. Her stories are brilliant. And above all she is a compassionate person, by a much truer form of the definition. I fear, though, it is much too late. A noble effort, Miss Rand. Thank you for letting me realize what was blurred."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I did not know what to expect when I started reading this book. I knew it was political, but not to what extent or direction. What I found inside was a compelling story, a good mystery and a stunningly well thought out defense of America and Capitalism.Some may object to its politics, but that is mere reactionary thought. For those of us who have the luck to live in America, it is kind of sad that we are inundated with a lot of negativity towards our way of life. It is good for us to hear something positive being said about it. After all, if things are really so rotten in America, then why do we have it better than everyone else?Ayn identifies the fallacy of some ideologies that would take from those who achieve and waste that effort. This is not mere charity bashing, but more a rejection of an organized taking from others. I think that the point is is how can a society succeed if the bargain between the successful and the non-successful works out to the negative of the former? It may feel good to take from people to give to less fortunate, but what is in it for them to stick around? If the methods of redistributing wealth are too harsh, you stifle achievement and development.Read the book and you will be pleased. While I was reading the book, I was upset that I spent my formative years reading useless navel-gazing like \\"The Republic\\" when this was just as important and more relevant. It was as if I was found what I was searching for for most of my life, someone who gave thought and rationality to the ideas that I could grasp, but had not fully explored because for the most part I was exposed to anti-American and anti-capitalist mush."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This great classic by Ayn Rand is controversial only because it tells people what they need to know, not necessarly what they want to read.There is a growing opinion out there that the rich get richer only because of special help from the government. Well let me clue you in, that is only a half truth. The government does give great tax breaks, but what these bastions of misinformation fail to say, that anyone can take advanatage of tax breaks. Anyone from a minimum wage employee to the ultra wealthy.Ayn Rand makes a strong case for the problems associated with high taxes. While this is not a personal finance book, it does drive home the folly of overtaxing the rich. What too many people fail to realize is that even if you are broke right now, you can start a small home based business and reduce your taxes from 50%-100%---in short, everybody has the same advantages, if only they will take advantage of them.That said, I have to admit that when I first read this book, I didn't agree with it either. I was from the old pay your taxes is your duty and taking advantage of tax breaks was illegal or immoral.Ayn Rand is uniquely qualified to sahre her thoughts in Atlas Shrugged. Readers may be surprised to know that Miss Rand also wrote four non-fiction books on subjects like objectivism and capitalism. I found the ideas in Atlas Shrugged as well as Rand's other book's both stimulating and timeless.If you are new to Ayn Rand, I suggest that you read Atlas Shrugged first then move on to her other books. Create a new philosophy. Keep an open mind and these books may very well change you life!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I recently listened to the audio book version of Atlas Shrugged, and was completely shocked and amazed at how events portrayed in the book reflect reality in this country today. The principles of socialism, and the resultant effects on society as portrayed in the book, accurately fore-shadow many aspects of the social and political environment in the United States today.On the surface, this book is a wonderful and exciting story, but is almost scary when you start to realize how accurately Ayn Rand fore-saw the future in many aspects."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand displays a remarkable gift for translating moral messages into human characters and following those characters over time to reveal long term consequences of our moral choices. Rand brings morality into vogue without requiring a belief in the supernatural. I disagree with Nathaniel Branden that Atlas Shrugged is \\"the most original and challenging novel of our age.\\" Still, and although I consider myself a Christian, this book challenged me to define my own existence.I am both attracted to and repulsed by her philosophy. She characterizes the negative aspects of collectivism with a depth I applaud and admire. Yet, when she discusses the mystic and destructive qualities of religion, I lose confidence in her own objectivity. God can exist whether she recognizes that existence or not. Rand gives no room for the possibility she is incorrect in some of her observations or beliefs.Despite my disagreements, my life changed for the better when I committed to defining my existence as she insists is the moral responsibility of every human being. For those who have not read ANY Ayn Rand, I recommend reading 'Fountainhead' before tackling this advanced course in Objectivism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The fact that a book written half a century ago can still stir up heated debate is enough of a reason to give this book a spin. Unlike other controversial reads (i.e. the communist manifesto, mein kampf) this book is still relevent to todays society. The latest example of this being France, a country that has created little to no technological/indutrial advances in the last 30 years, suffers double the unemployement rate of other 1st world countries and is now facing the facts that their government is in real danger of collapsing under the weight of their entitlement system. This alone proves the story of Atlas Shrugged right. Ayn Rand does speak in extremes to illustrate/expedite her point which can be a tough pill to swallow for dissenters. My advice is to read the Communist Maifesto and Atlas Shrugged and decide for yourself how societies that have built their foundations toward one philosophy or the other have fared."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book generated a deep change in my life and in the mayority of the people I've given the book to read as well.From my personal observation it is also the best-known book among high-level executives in the business world (I travel a lot and get to meet many Fortune 1000 Chief Executive Officers). According to the Library of Congress this is the second most influential book in the United States after the bible. It is very inspirational (note that it is not a religious book) and will make you want to get up every morning and do the best with your life.Some people misinterpret this book, and others become fanatical about it. Before listening to them, read it yourself and make up your own mind. Based on book sales alone (it's been in the best-selling list for over 35 years straight now) there's a good chance that even if you don't agree with the ideas in it, that you will enjoy it.By the way, I recommend you read first her short book &quot;Anthem&quot;, then read the amazing &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and finally move to the epic &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is completely overpriced.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved it but the digital (kindle) version should not cost this much.Good job publishers, way to ruin the ebook market before it really takes off."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This supposed masterwork is way too long, with good editing could be about 1/2 its size and not lose the impact."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand was far ahead of her time!I love and agree how she sees the world - in other words her paradigm.

I finally got around to read the book after I saw Part 1 of the movie. The characters are phenomenal. Even if you do not agree with everything in Ayn Rand's philosophy, you can still appreciate a great book. It is one of the most popular books of the 20th century for a reason. I do agree with many things Ayn Rand says about regulation and redistribution of income--most Americans do. Many people agree that some regulation is necessary, but it is the responsibility of Americans to stop the government when they want too much regulation and very little freedom.There is a need for regulation. Anyone with an understanding of basic economics knows that we would be in a depression right now if the government did not step in during the financial crisis of 2008. The extreme viewpoint of the government doing nothing and letting the whole financial system crash is asinine. The other extreme viewpoint of the government regulating the financial companies to the point where they have no freedom to operate and make profits is equally foolish.This is a rare novel that makes you think. It is one of the few books where I have heard people say it literally changed their whole way of thinking."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Great audio book, great book period.

That he had even contributed to some of Ayn's works? Probably not. It is difficult to know those kinds of things when one is using the Argument from Intimidation (to use Rand's term)'But it's not difficult at all when one is using one's mind, which - believe it or not - some non-Objectivists do. _Very_ few readers of Rand are unaware that Greenspan contributed to _Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal_ - though it is difficult to know those kinds of things when one is using the Argument from Intimidation. And the sorry fact is that Greenspan is an adherent of Objectivism the way oil is an adherent of water.Be that as it may, Greenspan's record at the Fed is not exemplary of free-market economics as developed by Mises and Rothbard - no matter what Rand (or Randies) might think about him.And what any of this has to do with ATLAS SHRUGGED is more than I can fathom. Maybe Rand's defenders could stick to the book itself instead of attacking her detractors based on a presumption of ignorance that is not borne out by the facts."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Readers who've been giving 4 or 5 stars to this book or others by Rand amaze me. No doubt a fair percentage of them watch the daytime soaps that run for 20+ years... Quantity doesn't mean quality. Another review stated that Rand kept going until she &quot;ran out of ideas.&quot; NOT TRUE. A book should be as long as it needs to be without meandering. Lord of the Ring was three books (4 if you count The Hobbit) but every page meant something, served a purpose, moved the story forward. AS treads water. Was Rand paid by the page? Or by the word? Where ten words could suffice, Rand uses two hundred and fifty. I have just enough interest in these characters to keep me reading the book, but I don't need page-long descriptions of everyone's hair, breeches, chin, face, skirt, expression, cleavage, skin color, sweat, shoes, etc. NO ONE CARES. Perhaps Rand alone isn't to blame. We keep buying her books. And who the heck is the editor?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" after 9/11. I was 19, scared to death that I might be drafted to go fight and die in a war somewhere in the middle east, and very vulnerable. I saw this book at the store and found the jacket intriguing.I must have read it a thousand times after that. My favorite bit was when we see John Galt refusing to take part in the welfare program adopted by his employers. I was enthralled by the philosophical passages and attempted to live my life according to the ideas Ayn Rand introduced me to. The next several years were spent studying her novels, essays, and a book written by Leonard Peikoff entitled, appropriately enough, \\"Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand\\".You could say that I came under the spell of Rand's thought- I had \\"Atlas\\" or \\"The Fountainhead\\" everywhere I went. I would constantly recommend them to friends and acquaintances, and viciously argue with anyone who dared to contradict the things I learned from them. I am 27 at the time of this writing; this garbage was my life from 19 to 23, when I started to notice cracks in Rand's thought.Because she was not a trained philosopher her arguments are all too often speculative, her proofs sophomoric. Memo to 'objectivists': You can use a syllogism to \\"prove\\" anything. 'Objectivism' is little more than a patchwork of ideas gleaned from the likes of Aristotle, Milton Freidman, Adam Smith, Nietzsche, Thomas Aquinas and others. It is an artificially contstructed system, not based in reality or on human nature; largely, it is a rationalization of the tendency of the strong to dominate the weak, and Rand encourages them to do so while scolding the weak for not enjoying the bondage they find themselves in.There is no originality to be found in all of Rand's 'philosophy'. She frequently resorts to 'ad hominem' attacks, especially where Immanuel Kant and other philosophers are concerned. Her grasp of Kant's system is limited, to say the least. Personally, I don't believe she ever actually read what he wrote.Rand constantly psychologized her (perceived) intellectual opponents (accusing them of secretly hating life, humankind and \\"the good\\",etc.), which is a danger one learns to avoid if one wants to be taken seriously by serious people. Maybe Rand never worried about that, as insulated as she became from the rest of the world. I think that between the collective of Peikoff, Alan Greenspan, Nathaniel and Barbara Branden and others that gathered around her in the 1950's and the affair she had with Branden, she truly began to believe in herself as an expression of the new hero myth she worked so hard to build.The most original aspect of Randian thought is the idea of \\"measurement-omission\\" in concept formation; the most current research in this area, however, completely contradicts Rand's theory. (The last time I mentioned this theory to a person with a degree in psychology, they laughed.) Research it. I dare you.The downfall of Rand's philosophy is her novels. The downfall of her novels is her philosophy.Both are built around a romanticized version of humankind, lacking in depth, warmth, weakness, flaws, vice and, above all, feeling. The heroes are all blameless, perfect, and perfectly boring; they all speak in a voice that is eerily similar to the one Rand uses to serve up her own ideas in her 'nonfiction' essays. The villains are also rather uninspired, always whining, pleading, begging, crying, screaming- but never speaking. They all have a secret, subconscious desire to destroy the world, and the 'heroes' that built it- and no realistic motivation is ever given.The whole mess of bad characterization and plot holes resolves itself in a sustained prose-vomit as Rand treats us to John Galt and his 40 or 50 page long rant. When I look over it again this moment, it's truly painful to read. No one ever talked like this! The sentences are awkward and unrealistic as Galt explains his \\"philosophy\\" and why he and his fellow industrialists decided to doom millions of people to death by starvation, civil war, diease and famine.Eventually, I could not inhabit the 'objectivist' mindset anymore. I read Kant, Hume, and many of the other philosophers she abhors, and found that most of what she wrote about them is a complete fabrication. Read theCritique of Pure Reasonand show me where Kant unveils the darkness in his soul. Oh, wait. You can't, because it isn't there.Rand offers us a vision of a world that is wholly unlike our own, filled with people wholly unlike us. They do not grow old and die, they do not have children, they do not get laid off or marry (unless it's a youthful mistake or a way torture the person they really love) or do anything at all, except work (and have affairs, which is kind of weird). When they do fall in love, it's almost a rivalry. As the title of the review says, this is all very juvenile and unrealistic.In the end, I decided that what she advocates- the capitalist, unfettered and unopposed, is at best, misguided and at worst, fascist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Over a thousand pages of Randian sputum, all of it aimed at anyone 'value-destructive' enough to believe that anyone has any sort of unchosen obligation to anyone else. 'There are no unchosen obligations', chants Rand, blanking out on the fact that a *chosen* obligation, on her own view of 'free will', is a straightforward contradiction.Anyone living in, and profiting from life in, human society has an obligation to help preserve the conditions that make society possible in the first place. Rand may not like it, but the basic obligation is *benevolence* - without which there is simply no reason for anyone to care about defining, let alone respecting, anyone else's 'rights'.But Rand assuredly does *not* like it. In effect she swallows Hobbes whole and goes him one better: she *prefers* the 'state of nature' and actually *wants* the lives of the less-than-supremely-competent to be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. How dare those 'second-handers' suggest that anyone's ultimate concern include anything but oneSELF SELF SELF SELF SELF . . . . ?This novel is pure revenge fantasy. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Thank you for confirming my initial reaction, Ayn Rand. Atlas Shrugged is a total waste of good intentions, paper and ink. When I first read it I was overcome with terror for not being able to get past the first three pages. Have I gone dumb for watching too much TV and skipping the classics in my uncle's bookshelves? What seems to be the problem here? Rand's prose is unbelievably dull and reeking with propaganda, that is why. I get more excitement reading the timetable at a nearby train station. Or more imagination from a full page obit page. But you should not waste your time reading my comments. The first one-star review you come across this page will most likely just become a repeat of what I will have to say. Ayn Rand is all energy but no fire. All blabber but no meaning. All tedium with no release. Like a word processor on auto-mode spewing lines of prose at random. Like a public address system describing how to operate an internal combustion engine. I am overcome with a tragic dread and sadness for all those who pretend they liked her books. But to save myself from the tedium that is Ayn Rand, I am afraid I will be forced to just shrug it all away. And, by the way, what is wrong with you people? This is the Information Age. The competition for talented writers and excellent books are too overwhelming to waste your time with the likes of Ayn Rand. Choosing at random what is wrong with Kurt Vonnegut? With J.M. Coetzee? With Primo Levi? And if you insist on the classics, even Henry James is a delight. Why is it that the Russians when they write in their own language dazzles everyone with their genius? I was wondering now if Ayn Rand, if she wrote in her native Russian would have been a different, if not a better writer."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'll start off with positive aspects about this book:Very creative.OK, now for the negatives:Ms. Rand's heros are these nabobs who know what's best for the rest of us.All these rich, successful, intelligent \\"gods\\" of Rand's Atlantis are all beautiful people with trim bodies, golden hair, and are devoted to the greatness of mankind.I don't know what world Ms. Rand is living in, but the last time I looked at all the \\"movers\\" in society, they all looked like a bunch of mutants.Bill Gates and Ross Perot hardly strike me as being \\"gods\\" to be admired.All this business about objectivism is VERY entertaining. Human nature in itself is SUBJECTIVE, not objective!If it were objective, we would have solved all these social problems thousands of years ago.Finally at the end of the novel, these \\"gods\\" transform themselves from rich industrialists to a highly trained para-military SWAT team!

Ms. Rand really needs to spend some time researching close quarters combat and the use of firearms.No, I'm not a liberal. I'm very conservative and quite frankly, very anti-union.But I think Ms. Rand's philosophy has been embraced by too many uneducated people looking for a cheap hero and, in the process, has given the conservative a bad name.And as far as virtue goes, I suggest reading Victor Hugo's Les Miserables for any of those who are in search of this unattainable characteristic.May God have mercy on Ms. Rand's soul."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I truly hope that this book is widely read by the general public. I say this in the sense that I wish Mein Kampf would have been more widely read. If people would have been more familiar with the author's ideas it would have averted horrible tragedy, and outright evil, in the world. As Ayn Rand is the author most quoted by \\"libertarians\\", \\"free-traders\\", and advocates of \\"hands off\\" capitalism this also applies.Her philosophy of Objectivism is the philosophy of sociopathy, of the ego freed from the restraints of social conscience. All that is important is gratification of the ego. There is no room for community, no room for humanity, no room for God- the individual ego is God. To the objectivist, \\"altruism\\", lending a hand or doing good for it's own sake, is a dirty word. I have heard a leading spokesman for Rand's philosophy denounce Hitler primariy because he was too \\"altruistic.\\" Make of that what you will. In our own time, the proponets of unrestrained corporate power, and of the dismantling of elected government, love Rand. They tell you that only governments can \\"initiate force.\\" This is the Big Lie- there is no moral difference between shooting a man and starving him to death through economic control of resources- or controlling people through the threat of it. Rand and her objectivists are usually very adept at formal argument and logic. However, their basic premises are so absolutely inhumane that their arguments are mere castles in the air. Castles empty of humanity and God, but filled with evil.I sometimes wonder what sort of childhood abuse in her native Russia could have warped Rand so seriously. It is obvious that her philosophy is an extreme over reaction to communist collectivism- in the same way that Satanism is an extreme overreaction to Christian fundamentalism"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Let me start by saying this review is regarding the Kindle pricing - the book itself is fantastic and a 5 star for sure.I recently bought a Kindle in large part due to the advertisement that hundreds of thousands of books can be had for $9.99 or less; clearly I should have researched a little further before taking the plunge because $18.99 for a digital version of a 50+ year old book is insane. At the moment Amazon seems to carry 3 physical versions of the book - the most expensive costing $14.18 (and anybody who had read this book knows that is a lot of paper and ink).I was looking forward to re-reading some of my favorites on the Kindle but I guess that won't include this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This novel is hard to rate. If the rating was based purely on influence, it would be 5. If it was based on boldness, a 4. But the risk of trying to mix philosophy with fiction is that you do both poorly, and there is why I end up at a 2.Purely judged as a novel, it is mediocre for this reader. At time too slow, at others, too obvious. Half-way thru, I found I could predict what characters would say and the outcome of plot complications. John Galt's radio speech in the last third sheds the demands of fiction and becomes pure Rand polemic. On the flip-side, while Rand has a unique philosophy which is very worthy of considering, the novel does not present it in a way that is nuanced or multi-dimensional.The dilemma of this book is that its reputation & influence demand that it be read, but the experience for this reader was disappointing."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Imagine my surprise when I opened my package and saw that Amazon had mistakenly sent me a copy of Atlas Shrugged that was intended for a member of the flea circus.

That Rivendell was actually Morder, an ideal society recognizing the supremacy of the $, and that the way to get Middle Earth back on track was to do away with the income tax, return to the gold standard, and axe all regulations governing the captains of industry. You'd have something similar to Atlas Shrugged.Here's the great thing about the book: Ayn Rand was a master of vigorous prose. She was a great writer. Here's the bad thing about the book: The characters are all made of cardboard and, my God, how they blather on. Two people are irresistably drawn to each other. Dripping with sexual desire, they meet for a tryst, and what do they do? They engage in many page soliloquies about their philosophies and motivations.There's only one complex interesting character in this book and it's not Dagney or Hank Rearden or Francisco D'anconia or Ragnar Danneskj&ouml;ld. It's certainly not the insufferable know-it-all John Galt (the ultimate Lord of the Bling). Rather, it is James Taggart - an ambitious, flawed man who can sense his faults and would hope to overcome them, but who winds up drowning in the mire of his insecurities.I had hoped (briefly) that Eddie Willers - in desperate unrequited love with Dagney - might rise to the level of a Judas-type betrayal of the books \\"hero\\"s, but no. He's a loyal servant of T.T. until the end, where he is abandoned aboard an ill-fated Comet in an un-named Western desert. He wasn't strong enough or bright enough to be recruited by the strikers and he wasn't passionate enough to betray his true love. I was disappointed in him.The plotting is decently done, but because of every character's propensity to deliver a Bill Clinton style State of The Union speech at the drop of a hat, it seems to last forever. Set aside at least a good two months if you want to wade through this one. Good Luck with it. I hope you find within yourself the Motive Power."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas shrugged has the same issues the Moby Dick does. Under a thousand page novel, a wonderful 200-300 page novel is struggling to get out. The book is a page turner, hard to put down, but is weighed down by the illogical worship of money and power. The assumption that the best minds will always float to the top and that those who are rich are more virtuous destroys a wonderful pulpy thriller. If she had stuck with fiction and ignored philosophy, this would be a 5-star review.I read this book in one night, skipping the speech at the end going to the next part. That speech, in its own right is a horrible piece of drek that should have been edited out by any right-thinking publisher.Pros: Gripping, hard to put down, somehow motivates you to find out what happens nextCons: 2-dimensional (or less) characters, simplistic plot, unnecessary length, stupid pseudo-philosophy.Conclusion: Not bad for a flight across the US if you can stand the embarrassment of carrying it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Book was in exact condition buyer said it would be and was shipped fast and a great price - thanks!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's a good thought provoking book, but in my opinon shouldn't be taken literally and as a lifestyle. everything needs a balance, and this may help you find yours.if you're a big pushover (like i was) it'll help you realize how badly you need to learn the word 'no' and think about yourself rather than doing someone else's job with no compensation. I'm still a pushover about a few things, but i've realized that i deserve my free time also and that it doesn't always need to be spent working or doing things for someone else. It showed me some things people do (ex: guilt trips) and made me aware of how often it happens in reality. I'm also probably not going to use the term 'good intentions' again for quite some time becuase of the disgusting way she turned it into a negative.anyway, the worst part i've come to so far is the one 50 page speech around the end that repeats itself. everything is stated differently (perhaps because different concepts are grasped by different people) but all in all it repeats... badly. She does it throughout the book in smaller doses, but this is the one almost making me put the book away - hence the 3 stars instead of higher.I agree with another reviewer that this is not a book for the easily impressionable but to be looked at objectively and find your own way through the concepts she portrays."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As noted above, Atlas Shrugged is the &quot;second most influential book for Americans today&quot; after the Bible, according to a joint survey conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, gives you a good starting reference on how enduring the story is, decades after publishing.This is one of the few books I have ever read multiple times. The first couple times as just a great novel, then as societal commentary. So I guess both need to be addressed in a review.As a novel: The story follows Dagny Taggart, executive of a railroad as she struggles, along with other achievers, to succeed while the bulk of the human race stands idle. Eventually, the achievers start disappearing and the resultant society of &quot;looters&quot; begins to fail on a grand scale, without a system of work ethics or morals to guide them.Good character development in the leads, supporting characters are numerous and provide ideas and contrasts more than anything. Provides examination of complex issues, and raised a lot of thought provoking questions. The only downside to the book is the overly long speech by a lead character at the end, otherwise moves along quickly for its' size.As a commentary on society: The storyline parallels today's America to a point, as we become more and more of a welfare state and a society of self-described victims who don't take personal responsibility for our choices to chain-smoke, overeat, etc, etc.I recommend it as a novel, regardless of your take on the philosophical portion because it has a great epic storyline. An even more satisfying read if you are a self-starter or small-businessperson type who has dealt with government bureaucrats and assorted hangers-on."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'll keep it brief, which I heartily wish Ayn Rand had done in 'Atlas Shrugged'. This book is a perfect of example of every literary mistake conceivable. Although there are numerous characters in the book, there are truly only two: GOOD GUY and BAD GUY. Rand just shuffles the names around and gives them all the same party lines. The characters (both of them) are cardboard cliches with nothing compelling to recommend them. The philosophy is simple-minded and naive beyond belief. The 'real' men are hijacked directly out of a romance novel, and the requisite woman character is hopelessly dependent upon them in spite of her supposed independence and intelligence. If you like to read books by authors who present a story and let you form your own judgements of her characters, look elsewhere. Atlas Shrugged is an excellent door stop. I gave it one star because the system won't allow me to give it zero stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged. Never before in my life have I seen a book more in need of an editors pen. The book is over 1,000 pages long and could have easily been told in 400. If you dropped Rand's psuedo-political/religious rantings and took all those 60-70 paged character monolouges (and I'm not even joking about those lengths) you might have a two-star story.Any Rand seems to not want to actually write a decent novel. Instead, she wants to slam her beliefes in our faces. If you've never read her books or heard about her beliefes I can sum them up in a nutshell: She glorifies shelfishness and has a basic motto of &quot;F**k everyone else, I'm more important that you.&quot; Nice, huh?Not only does she want we, the reader, to follow in her footsteps, but all of her characters follow her as well. It's bad enough that the characters are uninteresting, but they are all alike. I'm still comvinced that there is only one character in the book.And about those 60-70 paged monolouges. You only need to read one paragraph, after that they'll start to repeat themselves constantly for the rest of the 70 pages.If this seems like just one big rant, it is. Reading this book put me in rant mode. I wish I could give this book no stars at all, because it doesn't even deserve the one."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The longest excuse you have ever read. People who claim that this novel changed their lives are just using it as a convenient, critically lauded excuse to use the &quot;virtues of capitalism&quot; to thier advantage. People who place financial and emotional well-being before all other aspects of life are completely missing the point of living. The most rewarding actions that we as people embark on in our lives involve compromising our safe, comfortable environments to experience new things, whether this means experiencing a new social situation for the first time (helping out at a soup kitchen, going to a club, feeling so real, etc.) or taking on a new resoponsibility (having a family, giving time to a charity, among other things). It is not the inherent acts of selfishness that give our lives meaning, but it is the acts of giving, that we do conciously or otherwise, that give us a reason to live. This book promotes gaining satifaction through taking rather than giving. If everyone followed that gospel, then we would be in real trouble. Donate the time you would have spent reading this book to a charity or cause that means a lot to you. Then you will realize that the giving of ones self is tbe best way to grow as a person."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am not reviewing the novel \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as published in 1957. If I were, I would give this novel 5 stars. In fact, 5 stars doesn't do it justice. It is a page turner from start to finish and significantly relevant today. What I am reviewing is this particular \\"35th Anniversary Edition\\" paperback published by Plume.The new \\"introductory text\\" is offered to the reader right after the table of contents. It consists mostly of Ayn Rand's personal notes she kept while researching this book. It is the most shameful introduction I have ever read before starting a novel. The author of this \\"introduction\\" even begins by claiming that Ayn Rand would hate to see an introduction to her novel written by someone else, so he forgives this trespass by claiming that he is going to let her write the introduction from her notes. The text that follows (before chapter 1 of the book has even started, keep in mind) introduces all major characters, their motivation, a plot summary, and musings on why the novel ends the way it does. Offering all these spoilers before the novel even starts is disgusting. You can almost see the intro author smirking as he concludes with \\"now here is the novel in it's entirety, so judge for yourself.\\"Read this book as published in 1957. If this is the only version you can find, tear out of the introduction and tear off the back flap. Both contain significant spoilers that will distract from the experience. Better yet, try to find a hardback version that doesn't spill these spoilers out all over place like a staggering foul-breathed drunken lout sloshing ale from his unsteady mug. This novel deserves much better."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Please note: I am writing this purely from a literary standpoint, this is not a commentary on objectivism.I found \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" to be one of the most boring, poorly written books I have ever read. Ms. Rand attempts to make up in volume what she lacks in talent, and that makes for a series of very tedious evenings for the casual reader.The characters are flat and hackneyed, the plot is tedious, and the long pages of political diatribe, while sure to please the acolytes of the author, do nothing to move the story along.I was disappointed, for I truly enjoyed \\"The Fountainhead\\" - a story that, if you skip over the speeches, is a rather enjoyable romance novel about architects.

John Galt's 75+ page speech about 2/3rds of the way through the book is in a word - phenomenal! This is a book on capitalism at its best. The antagonist view throughout this book is about altruism, but reeks of socialism (lets take from those who have and who have worked hard to get what they have and give to the have nots - those who haven't been either as fortunate, smart, or who are just plain lazy and want to live off others.) There is a huge difference in charity and altruism, or for that fact, Christianity and altruism (I only say that because Ayn Rand's philosophy is known as Objectivism. Objectivism holds that reality exists independent of consciousness; that individual persons are in contact with this reality through sensory perception; that human beings can gain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive and deductive logic; that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or rational self-interest; that the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights, embodied in pure laissez faire capitalism; and that the role of art in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form a work of art that he can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally.Again, a MUST read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you love Ayn Rand's novels, you will love Beitler'sRational Individualism: A Moral Argument for Limited Government & Capitalism.

Definetly a must have for serious readers."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Before you read more reviews use your head.There's no one answer to anything be it personal philosophy, different forms of government etc, at list not anytime soon. Unfortunately, reality is complicated. What there could really exist, however, is a BALANCE. You cannot live in the world, and be happy without having a philosophy of life. The only two remaining logical forms of political governments today are those of Sochalists and Capitalists.Ayn Rand (following modern capitalistic philosophers such as Adam Smith), realized that there's a gap in the philosophy of the most fundamental layer of existence of every person: the individual. To convey this thought she had to describe the utopia of the individualist, otherwise her message would be vague.For those of you wanting to have a complete philosophy of life, this book (or the Fountainhead w/ 400 less pages) is definitely a must read, the two most important messages of it are:1. To reach happiness, everyone needs to learn &quot;critical thinking&quot; as an individual. Hence, if you're shocked by some of the material in this book (which you will be) then agree that there's a lot to be learnt by everyone. Hence, the bad news: you can't expect to stop learning after reading this one book or any other book2. Unless if there's an individual there's no existence. Hence, each individual needs to first have a philosophy of their own, i.e. he needs to ask himself, what is his purpose in life?The only flaws I see in Rand's Philosophy, are first of underestimating communincation, and second and more important as I mentioned earlier, that of absolute Capitalism:On the former that it's true that having a solid ego will keep you happy most of the times, but it could very well make you narrow minded: look at Internet for example and how it is revolutionizing the world, the choice is yours to embrace/disregard the means of communication, including other people (for the same ends that Rand partially if not completely explains).Also, when it comes to Rand's political views remember that capitalism is only an economic system and although you can push it as a morality, but there's a limit to that since the same great minds of Ms. Rand have to be educated in societies in the first place, so that means you need schools, subsidizations etc. Rembember to keep US politicians out of the book, she wouldn't have approved them! Historically, our US form of capitalism, has often translated to the power of guns and death of many great individuals in US/overseas.This book is very complete when it comes to your individual philosophy but when it comes to politics Rand is a utopian in the capitalistic sens. To get a good view of the sochalistic side of life, and why we all need to learn about each other, I recommend reading Maxim Gorky's (a communist) masterpiece: Mother. And then think of the balance: is money the only language people understand or could we be wrong, in that case should we wait till all we individuals are destroyed or what!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book was awful. I picked it up because my brother suggested it, and he usually reads some interesting books. After the first 250 pages, I wasn't exactly excited about what I had read, but I figured, given the size of the book, that I was only through the introduction. I read the next 250 pages and still the book sucked, but along the same rationale I finished it, my brother had to have seen something. The main problem is that the book continously repeats itself, conversations are the same, plot twists are the same, and it is all flawed capitalist extremism. At the end, the protagonists take off their everday clothes to reveal the tight spandex, capes, and a letter C in the middle chest to save the day.

Those that agree with Rand should take some time to reflect on what the world would be like with out compassion for those less fortunate. This belief that those unfortunate are only unfortunate because of their own shortcomings is a conclusion derived from false premesis and as primitive as believing in curses.

I also enjoyed &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; immensely.I was quickly upset by the quality of work presented in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. The book is boring from the onset, never truly 'picks up', and offers no semblance of a substantially redeeming quality in Rand's literary style.I know the Objectivist Fever finds many people reading and LOVING most anything Rand ever wrote, and to them, I think the book would be far more fun. I find Ayn Rand's philosophy, while accurate at points, to be extremely esoteric and even contradictory at others.Throughout the book are located speeches by the main characters, characters who, I must mention, are not remotely realistic. The good guys are all in actuallity Objectivists, the bad guys are all simply philanthropists or uncompelled Socialists- she never gives the ideals she opposes a fair shot. There ARE two sides to every argument. This fact is ignored throughout the book. The good guys know why they're good, the bad guys know why they're bad. Things are not cut and dry like that.The speeches to which I refer happen many times. Each one is a 5, 10, or 20 page ode to Objectivism, essentially the exact same words revamped and stated by a different character. By the end I was so exasperated by the assinine redundancy of these casual dissertations that I skimmed over most sections.I have found this book, not because of its philosophy but because of its lack of literary integrity, extremely dissapointing, and must strongly urge potential readers not to waste your time. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, as I said, was a slightly more succinct and far more pertinent novel, which I would highly suggest in place."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have only read about 50% of the book.

It does make you rethink those beliefs and notions that you hold dear, even if the result is only to solidify them. It is a big book, in the sense of ideas and philosophy, and it can't be ignored.Personally, I find myself agreeing with much of what Rand has written and I find most of her arguments cogent (if overlong and melodramatically posited). However, I also find her plot devices and writing style dull and long-winded at best, and infuriating at worst. Also, the simplicity of her philosophical arena -- the fight between her version of good and evil -- is annoying and rather childish. It seems strange that such an important philosophical exercise should be implemented in what is really, at the heart of it, an amateurish, simplistic tale.So, a fable, and a poorly written one at that. But, an important fable whose central ideas constitute much, much more than the sum of the parts. Utterly worthwhile, IF the reader is prepared to think about her words and measure them against reality instead of just incorporating them into his ideology as a useful weapon in arguments of self-interest/selfishness."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand may not have had basic courses in business or economics.

One thing that the two books have in common is that you can open the book to a random page and read a few paragraphs and gain 'inspiration' (for lack of a better word).The biggest problem with this book as a novel is the characters. You can't really tell the personalities 'looters' apart (Wesley Mooch, Orrin Boyle, Balph Eubank, Kip Chalmers, et al). You also can't even tell the personalities of the heroes apart either (John Galt, Ellis Wyatt, Owen Kellogg, Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia, et al).

I thought, &quot;Objectivism? what in the world is that?&quot; I flipped through it an was utterly amazed at the congruence between Rand's thoughts and my own. Ever since I have read every one of her original works (fiction and non-fiction alike) and have a hearty respect for her and her philosophy.This is not to say that I accept every one of her views on life and work and love. For the most part I agree but when it comes to matters of morality there is a slight deviation; I believe that you can be charitable as long as it benefits you in the long run. I don't think anyone out there would disagree that helping a charity or something along similar lines does not give one a nice warm fuzzy feeling. This, to be sure, is a profoundly selfish benefit which, I think, ms. Rand ought to have touched upon.Anyhow, do yourself a favour and pick up her book. 116 reviews......and counting. This is obviously an important and life-changing work whether you agree or disagree with Rand, whether you love or hate her. But please, for the sake of intellectual honesty and respect for REAL criticism, read her work before you open your mouth and spew forth something like: it's just a cult, or a religion or something of the sort."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"'Atlas Shrugged' is the best book you'll ever read. It was superbly written and easy to read, a gripping tale of mystery and romance. One thing this book guarantees is a mysterious plot including a philosophy of the 'motor of the world' that Ayn Rand intertwines into the story. This philosophy looks at a hypocritical group of men given the power to create directives that ruin the balance of material in America. She explains that when a party of people are allowed to make decisions without proper restriction, there is no stopping them. As for characters, Ayn Rand's descriptions are a vivid imagery of regular people. Their personalities are decribed to such perfection the readers are able to create the person in their mind. Each character has a destinct personality unlike any other. Overall, I think this is one of the best books I've ever read. Ayn Rand has a style of writing no other writer could match. Her extreme look at life graspes your previous views and shatters them into complete chaos."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Remember the Michael Douglas movie where GREED IS GOOD? Atlas Shrugged is a brilliant demonstration of how greed works for the good of society and how social welfare institutions can ruin a country's ability to sustain itself.The America that Rand depicts is startlingly similar to what happened to Soviet Russia under communism. When people don't get to reap the rewards of hard work or hard thinking -- then why bother to work or think hard?This is a great book. I loved it and can't stop thinking about it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A must read for anyone who wonders what they're working for"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Is it:(1) A vehicle for the promotion of one's (perhaps the author's) ideas, or(2) a depiction of what it feels like to live in a world where these ideas prevail?I don't think there is a right or wrong choice to the above quiz. However, if you chose (1), keep in mind that there is a better term than 'Literature' to describe the notion: Propaganda.The art of using logic and &quot;reason&quot; to advance one's cause is not new. It has been practised for millenia; the Ancient Greeks called it Sophistry; and in the Middle Ages it was known as Casuistry, a science by which black bread could be proved to be white, the moon square rather than round, virtue to be vice, and so on.The author has mastered the &quot;mechanics&quot; but hardly the &quot;art&quot; of the novel. She seems to have spent an enormous amount of time and energy in understanding and depicting what one can perceive with the five senses but hardly any in trying to fathom the inner human world. That may be why her writing reads awfully brilliant but leaves an aftertaste of lacking wisdom. Her work lies at an extreme diametrically opposite to that of Dostoevsky, whose understanding of the human soul borders on the absolute.But Dostoyevsky's work defies time and space; it has so far been impossible to peg it to any moment, place or situation in history; it is eternal, like the human soul itself. And that, in the end, could be the deciding difference that separates it from the work of Rand."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In case you may think I am a fan of Ayn Rand, I have to say I did not read any of her other work before reading this wonderful book... and I was hooked ! The intricate storyline, the vivid characters, the engrossing setting, everything is perfect. It tends to get long-winded but hey, it's a philosophical novel. Not necessarily a great introduction to Objectivism, but a great novel. Deserves the title of second most influential book of the century, in fact it deserves first place, that's for sure !"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand believed in some thing , so do most of us .The only difference is she took it to extreme hights .We must remenberThat any kind of extremism breeds intollerence and intollerencein turn breeds all type of social problems.Ayn Rand was pro capitalism , So are most of us ,but she took it too far.So far thatas per her philosophy selfishness is ok.If we have to question her philosophy then the first question that comes to mind is what about humanity?The book is well written but ....?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Five stars because if any book explains the spirit of Man, this is it.

School in the nation right now. Yeah. Stand up for you, it's nice to be selfish in every sense of the word. Forget being forced into groupwork where you carry the load of seven others who slack off, and then end up with a &quot;D-&quot; for their lack of effort. Be your own group. Your grade is yours, do not cut your &quot;A+&quot; into eight chunks and end up with a &quot;D-&quot;...Your grade, why give it to those who don't even try?

I didn't earn a &quot;D-&quot;...I should've gotten an &quot;A&quot;...there's no way that anyone else in that class pulled more than I did, but because the rest of my group was composed of slackers, a D- was the result. On all of my individual projects, I had A's. It was that I let them take away from me, that's what it was. I was just too stupid to realize it. So wake up, if you're doing what I did.

Conceit is not, there's a difference a fine line..keep that part straight, and this will do you nothing but good!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I find the adulation of Rand's supporters almost as amusing as the hysteria of her detractors. Read the reviews here and notice all of the petty shots taken. Yes folks there are many intelligent and educated people who, agree with Rand, but people who do not are not budding fascists (the true Philosophy Rand is opposing in this book.)Rand's essential points, that reason is a better guide to public policy than emotion, that it's wrong to take from others by force or the threat of force, that religion has no place in public policy, are all fine. It is Rand's contention of non-contradiction, that creates the problem in this novel, I would expound on that further, but it is not My intention to debate Philosophy here.As for Rand's literary style, keep in mind that Russian writers tend to focus more on ideas than character.So over all I would recommend this book, not as a manual for life, but far better than it's hysterical critics would have you believe."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Pure genious.

It's a novel about ridiculous extremes. The socialism and communism Rand uses in this novel were even rarer in her world of the 1940's and 1950's when this book was being written. However, she clearly saw the path America was traveling down and took it to that ridiculous, but not completely implausible extreme.The country is in trouble. There are poor. The majority of people feel that need, not ability, should be the great decider of who gets what. Things are done for the \\"greater good\\". Most people don't try to do good work, they just try to avoid blame. Most, but not all. People like Dagny Taggert, the female Vice President of Operations for the Taggert Transcontinental railroad. People like Hank Reardon of Reardon Steel. Even people like Eddie Willers, Dagny's faithful assistant and fellow \\"mind\\".No, this is not a novel about reality as Rand, or either we, know it. But instead, it's a warning about how our world could be if we continue down a path that will ultimately lead to a socialist society.One doesn't need to agree with Ayn Rand to need to read this book. However, it's an insight into the minds of capitalists. This novel has changed my views of those who work for profit and make bones about it. I'm sure it will for many of you as well."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A wonderful epic told by a master story teller.

The second most influencial book in my life (the Bible being the first) I have read this book over and over. I can see why she would have a cult following. I would highly recommend reading this book for everyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is difficult to find a book of fiction that has caused so much controversy as this one, and its critics have a degree of zeal that is matched by its defenders. It is a gigantic philosophical tome, with characters that many have scoffed at as being larger than life, as representing a sterile view of the human psyche, and as being nave and sophomoric in its world view. Hated in general by both conservatives and liberals, those who love the book envy those who are approaching it for the first time. It is a book for optimists; a book for those who love and celebrate life. But above all it is a book for normal people, because in the final analysis, even though its author may have viewed its characters as representing statistical outliers, as rare and distinctive visionaries who epitomize high intelligence and creativity, it represents what it means for a human to be normal.It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to want to organize themselves in a socialist state with no personal rights and no freedom to make their own way. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to wage war and destruction against themselves and others. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to avoid responsibility for their actions and blame others for their failures. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to hypothesize an imaginary deity and prostrate themselves in contemplation of it. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to serve others without question and with no mutual respect. It is abnormal and an aberration for humans to sit still, to lose their kinetic energy, both physical and mental, and not overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.Humans are in a state of normalcy when they create, build, think, and prosper, and unashamed when they are doing so. This novel, now appearing in print for fifty years, asks the reader to contemplate what would happen if the most creative and industrious of humans were to withdraw from society and leave it to those who took on the grotesqueness of inaction, envy, and sterile diatribes of socialist thought. It asks the reader to contemplate what it takes to have a productive, healthy, comfortable, technological society. Whose intelligence and entrepreneurial alertness are in full operation in such a society and what are the consequences if these are extinguished by the voluntary withdrawal of those who possess them?The philosophical dialog one can find in this book has drawn the ire of many an academic philosopher and politician. The reviews of the book when it was first published fifty years were probably the most vituperative of all in print. But vehemence towards the book has not extinguished its relevance or its power to instigate critical reflection. It is an alternative view of ethics, one that dignifies human individuality and self-interest. It is an ethic that abhors the initiation of force and worships human ingenuity. The philosophical dialog inked on its pages is a testament to the center of human optimism, and it is a perfect reflection and celebration of human normalcy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book in 1985, and found that it had an enormous influence on my thinking for a long time. As a result, I snapped up all her works that came to the Indian book shops. Ms. Ayn Rand was a staunch believer in individual freedom, and an enlightened capitalism. She opposed, in principle, that one man be expected to serve another, either through private charity or through enforced socialism. However, as I grew up, I found that this philosophy had a limited relevance to one's life.The novel, nevertheless, is extremely well-written and has a very unique plot. It traces the lives of individual entrepreneurs in the land of freedom, who are being held back by laws and people who want them to serve others instead. Ayn Rand uses the characters to make long, powerful, speeches about her philosophy. She also weaves this in very deftly with the lives of the heroes, and shows what can happen when we put creative, dynamic people in bondage. There is a pleasant, surprising ending, which affects you like a fresh dawnAs fiction, the book suffers from these long speeches. As a book on Ayn Rand's philosophy, the story helps us understand her philosophy better. Her skill is such that each is meaningless without the other. Therefore, if you just read the story, skipping the speeches, you will miss most of the flavour. And if you read some of her other works, without having read this novel, you will find it very difficult to visualise the implications of her complex arguments.While I am sort of glad today that I found a more, multi-faceted, multi-hued approach to life (than what Ms. Rand offered), I do envy you, if you haven't read this book so far. If you buy this book, you are sure to be in for a treat.And later, even if you move on, some of her philosophy will perhaps always remain with you. And you will find yourself to be richer for it.You may also find some of her other works interesting.

In the 21 years since my first reading, I've read it cover to cover 3 times more and keep referring to it for quotes.Few books have been able to define so clearly what's right and what's wrong (of course, from the authors perspective)and it constantly challenges the reader to agree - or not.

The storyline is intriguing, but just a vehicle for the ideas of the author, namely, the philosophy of objectivism. John Galt is a metaphor for an ideal.

In many ways, this maleable, soft, moderate, milquetoast cross between Johnny Galt and Jimmy Taggart contributed to the business failings with which I am now dealing. I was tempted by both sides of the philosophical arguments presented in the book. Atlas Shrugged was a useful tool to help me focus my mind to explain the past and, in turn, look towards an enlightened future.

It tends toward caricature, but is none-the-less a timely revelation of the general, destructive direction in which our government is now moving.Railing against the \\"selfishness of the profit-motive,\\" government officials hamstring the private economy with massive regulations and executive orders. Industries, railroads, social fabrics begin to disintegrate. Bureaucrats refuse to rescind their crippling legislation and release their stranglehold on the economy. Nebraska's seed corn is confiscated to feed Illinois. Prosperous businesses are cannibalized to save failures from the bankruptcy they earned. The best creative, productive minds of business [the geese that lay the golden eggs] withdraw on strike, and devastation is complete. If Robin [robbing] Hood doesn't get out of the way of liberty, he must be eliminated.A few negative comments: This five-star novel [forgiving the excess repetition] suffers from a lack of sophistication in ethics and theology. Atheist Rand identifies all religion with Gnosticism [an early heresy which taught that the body and material world were evil; or with simplistic, literalist versions of extreme Calvinism which know nothing of the God of people like Niebuhr, Tillich, Hartshorne, or Kung.Rand's either/or mentality leads her to simplistic, misleading ethical maxims. She preaches that work is THE purpose of life, and that we should practice \\"radiant selfishness,\\" and that giving to a friend is not sacrifice [which she says is always evil]. For her, there is never a place for gratitude [thus, atheism]. She fails to see the distinction between selfishness and self-love [remember \\"Love neighbor as you love yourself\\"]. She failed to see that it's not always either/or, but often both/and."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First, to be clear, I would like to state that I am no disciple of Ayn Rand, and I took on this book's 1200+ pages little foreknowledge of the story's contents or purpose.My criticisms of the book are many, and largely around Rand's writing style. The passages that outline sexual encounters were particularly awkward, which I interpreted as an echo of Rand's reconciliation of female submission during the act. In addition, the 50 page rant near the end of the book that constitutes Rand's philosophy of Objectivism would have been better published elsewhere, possibly replaced with a condensed version that didn't interrupt the already irregular pace of the story.The protagonists in this book are not found in real life - they are driven beyond what a human could realistically withstand. Sadly, the antagonists in the book are more likely to be found in the real world, people whose social conscience leads them to pave the road to Hell with their good intentions.I read this book 50 years after it was first published, and its applicability cannot be denied. Regardless of your political persuasion, if you wish to make an argument for your position with a knowledge of the theory of markets that are truly free, you owe it to yourself to read this book. Your goal can be to know your enemy, or to learn the philosophy of a renowned 20th century Libertarian.I believe that Rand's view was less popular than it would have otherwise been during her life due to her atheism. In this day and age, where even religious people can accept the morality of secular people without judgment, her story outlining the virtue of free markets and its direct correlation to the freedom of people is bound to be more widely accepted.Mostly, however, we're seeing a period in America where the popular opinion is that more regulation is required, and the president of the United States is firing the management of private companies - to me, this is evidence that Ayn Rand's magnum opus is both prophetic and instructional... we must find boundaries for our leaders, or they will set boundaries for us."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand hits the nail on the head with this clear, thoughtful, hard hitting novel.

This is an amazing and thought provoking book. It puts into words many of my own ideals and thought processes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As many people know, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is not going to be to everyone's taste. While being a wonderful work of fiction, its core is a philosophy that tends to be somewhat polarizing. Personally, I loved the book and agree with much of Rand's philosophy though not all (something I suppose she wouldn't have approved of). Among its tenets is the idea that one has to work to earn everything in life - money, respect, even love must be earned through an exchange of values. One should not expect to just be given something because one \\"wants\\" it or believes they are entitled to it.This concept of values separates the people in her novel into two main groups - the looters and the producers. The producers live by these values and strive to do their very best in everything. The looters steal - directly or indirectly - from the producers and depend on them in order to survive, all the while claiming it is for the public good and that it isn't fair for the producers to have more than anyone else. But what if the producers stopped producing? And what is the real goal of the looters?Although rich with philosophy, the novel is still a work of fiction with some intriguing characters and an engrossing story. The main character is Dagny Taggart, a strong-willed independent woman who is in charge of running Taggart Transcontinental, a large railroad company in the United States headquartered in New York City. Her brother Jim is president of the company but it's clear from the start that he could never run the railroad without his sister. Jim is a cowardly type of person who fears personal responsibility but enjoys playing at politics for personal gain and claims to be working for the public good. Dagny meets Hank Rearden, a married industrialist who owns a steel company and has invented a new type of metal alloy. They share the same values and a mutual attraction which eventually leads to a love affair.The looters in the government pass a number of laws aimed at making things more \\"equal\\" for all competitors in one industry after another. Steel companies were restricted by how much they could produce, railroads were restricted by how many cars they could run and where. The story focuses on the efforts of Dagny and other industrialists such as Rearden to try to continue production and innovation under these constraints. Before long the greatest industrialists started to disappear one by one. The factories they leave behind are taken over by lesser people and quickly run into the ground. More and more the world is run by influence peddling in place of any real ability. Things fall apart and the supply of many goods becomes scarce.The general feeling of the public could be embodied by \\"Who is John Galt?\\", a phrase used to express a kind of hopelessness and lack of motivation. Dagny eventually finds the answer to the question, which leads her to reevaluate how she sees the world. It is in this process that Rand's ideas are more and more explicitly stated, culminating in a lengthy speech broadcast over the radio to the world. Love or hate her ideas, this book clearly illustrates them through a very interesting story and well fleshed-out characters. I found the book so influential that I couldn't help but look around at things happening today such as the government bailouts and seeing them in a different light. It was refreshing to read such a well-written novel with so many thought-provoking ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm still reading this book. About half way through. The story and the way it is presented is very interesting. Ms. Rand does an excellent job describing emotions, people, and places. My only negative is that this book's font is a little too small for my 60 year old eyes."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the story of a different world, where Europe has fallen to communism, and the United States is set to follow. In this world, those who achieve, think, and strive for money are considered selfish and evil. In this world, the questions that cannot be answered are countered with, \`Who is John Galt?'. As the United States slowly crumbles, an achieving and hard working railroad heir, Dagny Taggert, struggles to save her railroad and find where the great minds are going, as they all disappear. In this she meets the man who wishes to stop the motor of the world, the Atlas who shrugged. This novel is an allegory for Rand's hatred for communism, and love for capitalism, industry, individual thought, and personal achievement. Rand shows a country where achievement and thought are vilified, money is evil, and free spirit is disappearing with the intellectuals. Atlas Shrugged is a very well written and to the point book, and although the long soliloquies can drag on, the messages in them are worth the wait. I would recommend it to all who have an interest in Russian literature from the Soviet era, as its very pointed message against the Soviet Union is well displayed and explained, and is made even more interesting by Rand's personal experiences."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read a lot from Ayn Rand and am quite the fan. This is by far the best piece of her work. Her writing style stands the test of time while her subject matter is slowly coming to pass. I had never heard of Objectivism until I came across her work. I found that the more I read, the more I could associate my own thoughts and opinions with hers. She really knows what she is talking about and how to suck you into her world.For such a long story, it is hard to put it down and I never became bored with what I was reading. I was able to immerse myself into her world. Her characters are believable and full of such depth that is hard to find in many novels written today. As a writer myself, I find I am inspired to improve on my characters and writing style each time I go back and read this novel.I strongly recommend the audio book for those that do not have the time to read the book. It is approximately 52 hours of audio and worth every second. Atlas Shrugged is truly one of the greatest books ever written.Courtney ConantAuthor ofThe Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra) (Volume 1)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas, freaking, Shrugged.I wound up reading this book in via some strange circumstances. A popular video game calledBioShockhad hit the market and a number of people were relating story elements from it to the book Atlas Shrugged. This was important to me because I enjoy being the person in the room who catches obscure references in storytelling.Remember the seriesGilmore Girls: The Complete First Season? (If not, watch it. You'll thank me.) Part of the charm of the quirky television show is that the writers LOVED to throw in obscure literary and pop culture references. Part of the fun, for me, was knowing that I was getting a good percentage of them.Back to Atlas Shrugged: I began to look into trying to read the book after hearing it was a content inspiration for a pretty snazzy video game. Then my good friend Joey Snackpants [...] let me know that it was one of the most influential books in his life.THIS IS NOT A SHORT BOOK (in case you haven't figured this out on your own) but it is rich in characters and ambiance. This book is part science fiction, part period drama, part philosophy, and is \\"steam punk\\" before steam punk was cool.[SPOILER ALERT] The book mentions holograms before the word hologram exists. Seriously cool. [/END SPOILER]I could go on and on for hours about the entire school of thought Ayn Rand created when she wrote this opus, but there are millions of websites to do this already. You don't need to read them, but it makes for fun AFTER reading the book.This work effected my life by helping me to see that the characters in this book and their need for \\"the greater good\\" do exist, and I wasn't odd for thinking that, very often, these intentions are misguided. Succeeding for one's self breeds success for the greater good.I have The Fountainhead set to read sometime in the near future, but I already know that Atlas Shrugged is easily in my top five favorite books of all time. Something tells me that I should read it again in ten years... just in case."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One of my favorite novels. It is not a book to be picked up for pure entertainment or for a quick read. That said, even after several reads, I find this novel thought provoking and intelligent."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is incredible. The beginning is a little slow - the first 50 pages or so - and it is intimidating to start since it looks huge, but it is well worth the effort! Once you get into it, you won't be able to put it down.The biggest idea from the book is a question about John Galt. I won't spoil it for you, but just imagine if the main people in the world, those who are coming up with the ideas that shake the world, suddenly started disappearing. What causes them to leave is the basis of the book.If you read no other book for the rest of your life, read this one. It will transform (or confirm) the way you think about what is happening RIGHT NOW in our government and in this country. But just know, this is not a hard-core political book. Rather, it is a page-turner with a backdrop of ideas. Ayn Rand is a fantastic story-teller!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged should be required reading in every high school in America. Although written in the form of a novel, it is a complete overall economics lesson. It's lessons regarding governmental and human behavior are invaluable. A must read for everyone. Written in 1957 but far ahead of its time and spot on regarding what is going on in today's world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Highly recommend this audiobook to lovers of Ayn Rand and Scott Brick. Scott does his usual masterful job of giving characters their own voice through his numerous talents. While I read this book first some 40 years ago and had a memorable reaction to the text then, it has since been replaced by my recent listening to this compelling audiobook. I would highly recommend this to a new reader of Ayn Rand, particularly younger readers who can appreciate the value of a good story told by a great storyteller. Thank you Scott for so many pleasurable hours of listening. John Galt"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Everyone should read this book. Although written in the 1950's, it seems to have returned from the future with a cautionary tale."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Had I written this review a year ago when I actually finished the book, I would have given it five stars. However, even as I finished the book I had an uneasy feeling about what I had read. Even as I recommended it to my friends I had that little voice that said, &quot;spare them&quot;. For months I couldn't really put my finger on why. But now I understand. I was totally in love with Rand's economic theory and her view of the great things man's mind can achieve. At the same time, her view of humanity is totally scewed. Rand's economic view of the world is, in my opinion, quite correct. Yet she fails utterly to put a human face on it. The love story is terrible. Is that love? In fact, I don't think there is an ounce of love for humanity in the whole book. The characters don't even seem to love themselves. . .just their minds and what they can produce. Overall, the book is a testament to the great things man can achieve through hard work and perseverance, but it ignores that which makes us who we are . . . our humanity. This book had no soul."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The ideas presented in the book are interesting, but overall the story is severely lacking. The characters are ridiculously one-dimensional: they are either perfect in every way, or they are sniveling cowards. Plot is a low priority in this book, and what little is there is very predictible. Rand needed to calm down before writing this book; she constantly interjects her opinions into the story via the LONG speeches of some of the &quot;good guys&quot;, the most notable time being the 60 page sermon near the end of the book.This is the first book I voluntarily quit reading before the end. If you like reading philisophical discourses and agree with the principles of objectivism, you may find the book thought provoking and enjoyable. Otherwise, you'll feel browbeaten and very, very bored."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the few truly great pieces of literature in the genre of Science Fiction. It's a great book. The story is fascinating, the world is believable (Rand's portrayal might even be called prophetic), and the characters are interesting and well-developed. The only down side to the book is that it runs a bit long. If the book were published today, it would probably be broken into a trilogy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand was eloquent and precise in her philosphy, as she was visionary and romantic in her works of fiction. If not read before, the reader will see the world through the eyes of Dagny Taggart, who's confusion but persistence leads her to discover the root of her own guilt: the sanction of the victim.If read before, Atlas Shrugged will slowly reveal the manner by which John Galt learns to drain the world. Step by step, the reader will become increasingly aware of the subtle happenings in the plot, will grow anxious to enlighten Dagny and Rearden of the answers they seek, and will learn to identify with the frustrations of Francisco D'Anconia and John Galt in their love for Dagny.In either case, the reader will trace the rising tension in the plot throughout the book, released when John Galt delivers his famous speech and voices his demands. Atlas Shrugged is a worthy novel, and a must read for all who consider their mind their greatest asset."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the only novel representative of a complete and clear philosophy of life. To summarize the novel in two words: brilliant and inspiring. Brilliant in that it demonstrates Rand's complete grasp of the proper role of politics, economics, psychology, sexuality, and morality. Inspiring because it's protagonists embody the saying, &quot;Our accomplishments are not the result of priveledge or of the favor of a higher being, but because of our adherence to objective principles, our determination to improve by hard work and our love of man.&quot; This book champions the ability of the mind, and the morality of Capitalism. In doing this, and doing it expertly, Rand demonstrates that we are responsible in bringing out the best within us."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's John Galt, Dagny Taggart and Francisco D'Anconia are the nation's brain - and what follows from their story and Galt's speech is a constant verbal assault,every sentence, every idea has the effect of a whip on the mind, shaking us for giving in to the looters.And there is no respite. The thinkers are inevitably those who are ahead, who are sexually charged, and who belong on earth. The looters, are identified as those with no minds, only emotions, sexual impotency, no moral standards and absolutely no brains whatsoever. Halfway through the book, when you expectthe end, the never-ending &quot;who is John Galt?&quot; adds a new twist to the story and changes Dagny's world. Written from a powerful perspective, and given the pssionate writing that Rand is famous for, here's another book that's aerobic excercise for the brain!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This stuff is not total BS, but I would be hard pressed to give any novel so aestetically displeasing as this anything more than a 7, even with some great passages. The characters are one dimensional, the philosophy is half baked, and the plot is does not exist. A slow plot would be OK, if the characters were capable of some Joycean epiphany, but epiphany is made impossible by the philosophy"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"One of the most prescient books I have ever read. Rand has an amazing understanding of markets, business, finance, and capitalism. For a fiction author I was incredibly surprised. In some parts, she gets a little long winded but the famous speeches more than make up for her verbose writing style. Obviously, some people will not \\"get it\\" or think that she \\"doesn't know what she's talking about\\". For people who believe communism makes sense, they will never understand this book because the logical progression of the book is counter-intuitive to a communist's faith based mindset."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I started out wanting to read this book as a novel, not as a political treatise. I told myself: just because I don't like libertarianism doesn't mean Ayn Rand sucks. I told myself I'd be open-minded.Well, the verdict is that the story is a nice enough story for about two thirds of the book, what with the collapse of the economy and the failing train system and the melodramatic hair-pulling of Dagny Taggart. There are two things that divide 'Atlas Shrugged' from good literature: the first is that the story is basically a wind-up for Galt's long monologue near the end. It (the story) contains no deeper meaning such as we look for in a text, besides Rand's repetitive Objectivist blithering. The characters, as many other reviewers note, are merely the figureheads of the two mighty ships of ideology whose clash constitutes the plot of the book, and despite the pretty paint that's on 'em they're about as interesting characters as a wooden figurehead is. Plus, it's painfully obvious where she's going with the plot. I had guessed the Big Secret of who John Galt is by page 300.The second problem is that Rand's writing, though oozing with melodrama, is not great at all. In this age of spell-checkers and text messaging, when most impressionable youngsters will be wowed merely by Rand's ability to string grammatical sentences together with a minimum of outright infelicities, the number of positive reviews here raving about Rand's writing can hardly be surprising (though it is a bit saddening). We old-fashioned people with a healthier respect for excellent prose of depth, however, will have to look elsewhere for literary enjoyment."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This used to be my favourite book of all time.Until I sat back and really THOUGHT about it. Then I started to smell something fishy. I began to notice that whenever people read this book for the first time and loved it, myself included, they spend the next few months acting like self important [...].A strong sense of self is important but we actually do have to share this planet with millions of people of all sorts - if we all walked around with Ayn Rand size bloated egos there wouldn't be enough room for us all.Imagine if we all applied the \\"every genius for himself\\" (as another reviewer here put i) philosophy to life... Well, surely I'm not to only one here to notice that even the biggest morons to set foot on the planet tend to believe themselves to be absolute genius.Enough almost incoherent babbling. By all means, read this book and love a lot of what is being said but take it all with a giant grain of salt. Seriously, a grain of salt as big as your head. A grain of salt as big as Ayn Rand's ego."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book violates every canon of literary excellence. It's simplistic. It's overly long. It's preachy. The characters give long speeches explaining the book's action and theme. Not one character has any great complexity (although some are more complex than others). And its philosophy is very extreme, as extreme and as unrealizable as Marxism (to use an example from the opposite end of the ideological spectrum).Yet you can't stop reading this book. You can't forget it. And at important moments in your life, you keep flashing back to it, and remembering its message of hope, triumph, and self-reliance.Every human being should read this book. May it endure into the next century!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Summer, 1969. I'm 14. My older sister throws a worn, marked up paperback edition of AS at me, and says 'Read this.' I do, along with most of her others, and since then, as a selfish pleasure, reread from time and again.4 years later, I'm at a socialist-chic Ivy League playground, innoculated against the firehose of crap aimed at us, and manage to take my education, instead of getting my indoctrination, unlike the legions of apologist lapdogs who sat up and panted for the trainers; good doggies, all. However, being poor white trash steel mill spawn, I had no pressing desire to apologize for anything, so I passed on the opportunity. Because of this book.But, it was always amusing, spending my summers actually working in mills to pay for college, upon returning to the playground every fall, to hear the plaintive cries of the Last True Friends of The Working Man whine on about injustice, and thank-you Daddy for sending me to this playground so I could see what a rat bastard you were. I would ask these clueless fops if they ever heard the phrase, &quot;F***ing the dog,&quot; or if they did, knew exactly what the meaning was in the context of the 'labor' struggle in America in the 70's. Clueless, through and through. (To help, I'll use it in a sentence for you. &quot;Where's Jack? He's supposed to be here.&quot; &quot;He's f***ing the dog.&quot; &quot;Oh.&quot; This was the MOST used exchange at the mill I worked in.)It's black and white clear why, for those like these of a certain bent, this book needs to be burned at all costs. This Soviet emigre who escaped the consequences of the very ideals these puddingheads hold dear nailed these fools to the ground. A couple of decades after her death, and the uncomfortable book-burners are still trying to squirm away from her. So, when I read the few negative reviews in this 600 or so, for some reason I was struck with the thought, &quot;Schadenfreude; it's not just for dessert, anymore.&quot;So, thanks, Sis, for saving my life. Wading through life as neither an employee nor employer, I and tons like me have managed to build our own mini-Atlantis-of-the-mind, and have shrugged so far under the radar as to be undetectable. Unless, of course, you count the avalanche of crappy jobs in our economies, and the uncomfortable sense that so many have of &quot;working harder and getting&quot; less. Yet, that is a lament that I often hear, and wonder why? I've listened hard, even in college. Business is abuse; to employ someone is to abuse them, is to take advantage of them, is to squeeze their life from them, and take it as your own. Well, OK. I learned may lesson. That's why I never did; I never wanted to abuse anyone, and take their life from them. Given the choice as to how to expend my finite heat and noise, I chose a way that abused no victims with employment, neither as an employee, nor as an employee. Surely, since I refused to do that, that left more of The Pie for folks to scoop up. So...scoop away, folks. Be my guest.My Sis, the one who first saved me in 1969, did so as a senior in college. The next year, she started teaching in the public schools, and is about to retire. Imagine; 30 years in the public schools, quietly saving a few kids here and there. How did THIS slip past the NEA? Meanwhile, my oldest is 13, going on 14. Guess what he's getting from Amazon.com?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Here's the idea: There is only one correct way for people to relate to the world around them, and that's through reason. There's only one correct way for people to relate to other people, and that's through reason. Those who understand this are superior to everyone else in every human endeavor, including making hamburgers. The rest are just annoying obstacles, also-rans. The joke is that Rand explains all of this in the context of an incredibly bad science fiction novel, thus placing herself squarely in the camp of the also-rans by her own definition. Whatever the merits of the philosophy, having the main character explain them in a 60-page speech is just a wretched plot device. And the philosophy ultimately reduces to a tautology, although it takes an awful long time to do so."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You can either read the book to get Rand's philosophy or you can read this to get her philosophy: thinking is an act of choice, choose to think and all will be well, choose not to think, and all will not be well. Since the book was ultimately written as a conduit to express her philosophy, you can now skip reading it.Rand divides the world into the heroes that think and act for themselves (the good guys) and all the rest, who are parasites and thugs (the bad guys). The good guys have cool names (John Galt, Dagny Taggart, etc.), while the bad have names like Mooch. Rand implies (not too subtly) that the bad guys don't even deserve to live. Rand wants to negate the role of emotion in human existence and portrays an ideal human as having a Spock-like commitment to the logical.Rand's real life bore no resemblance to the characters that she idealized in her big novels (Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead). She was neurotic, vindictive and deeply dependent upon the opinion and acceptance of others. This is well chronicled in various biographies about her life. Her philosophy of Objectivism developed an almost cult-like following and she seemed to revel in the role of cult leader (quite contradictory to her philosophy of valuing autonomy and free will).I agree with a previous reviewer's statement that this book could have been much shorter w/o losing much. She is very redundant with her philosophy. It's an admirable philosophy and many people have been inspired by it (especially at the high school and college levels, myself included), but it is more of a vision than something that can ever become a reality for anyone not stranded on a desert island. The simple truth is that people are dependent on one another, that every one has his/her neuroses, blind spots, etc.Read the book, maybe it'll motivate you to become more self-sufficient. Don't be disappointed, though, when you discover that reality (defined as your interpersonal dealings) will never come anywhere close to matching the ideal that Rand presents."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Those who read this book need to follow up with \\"The Ayn Rand Cult\\" by Jeff Walker. Ayn Rand is a typical reactionary who radically overreacted to Russian Communist oppression. Young Russians who have been influenced by Rand and other \\"Objectivists\\" are like Super Capitalists on Steroids. What they fail to learn is the fact that ultra-capitalism (capitalist purism) eventually leads to a Plutocracy where the richest of the rich have the most power. Those who believe in God and come from a Judaeo Christian faith need to seriously consider where Rand is coming from and the cult following that is now being recycled in the 21st century (a modern cult of selfishness) and having a deleterious affect on Democracy and balance in the United States of America. The greatest teacher is one that Rand completely ignores. Nature and nature teaches that balance is the key to sustainability and success over the long run."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"My hands were tied ...I began to re-read in paperback (1200+ pages); absolutely hooked again.

I've read two of her works (this and the short story Anthem) and found them both distasteful.Yes, individualism and free will are important, and people know it. But at the moment, I don't believe that the kind of world she depicts is going to come about (or the sort that Orwell espouses in 1984, which is very similar). But doesn't she believe that an individual has ANY responsibility towards society? What is society for? We might as well live in our individual caves and stay there, and human progress would be dust. Our greatest endeavours require teamwork, and cooperation, and sacrifice. If she expects us to worship the Ego, I would demur. When I think of civic virtue I don't think of mindless masses 'working for their brothers' without the spark of initiative. I think of decent and good citizens, who are willing to make a few sacrifices to better their society and thus themselves, who are a part of that society.

Is this why you attack AS, because it is so opposed to your shining ideal? What is this ideal, so that I may know it and stand corrected?&quot;Happy to oblige. My positive standard is reason; my (relevant) ideals are liberty and capitalism. Rand's are not.Here are some points I've posted in earlier reviews that have scrolled off their respective review pages, just by way of pointing out a few of Rand's many philosophical errors.1. In epistemology, Rand regarded herself as having solved the &quot;problem of universals&quot; when, in fact, she never raised it. Universals, if they exist, are &quot;repeatable&quot; features of reality -- qualities or relations that may be literally identical (not just &quot;exactly similar&quot;) between disparate contexts. _Whether_ they exist is an irreducibly ontological question, not (as Rand thinks) an epistemological one. Rand fancied herself to have found a Third Way between nominalism and realism (&quot;Objectivism&quot;) solely because she identified &quot;universals&quot; with concepts (and abstractions) in the opening paragraphs of ITOE. In metaphysics and epistemology, then, &quot;Objectivism&quot; is nothing more than a not-very-self-critical form of nominalism/conceptualism.2. In ethics, Rand built &quot;Objectivism&quot; on a foundation of pure _subjectivism_. Since her ethic _presumes_ that one has made a positive &quot;choice to live,&quot; Objectivism can give no guidance about whether to live or not, and all its ethical injunctions rest on an arbitrary decision about which, strictly speaking, Objectivism can't provide any instruction. In ethics, then, &quot;Objectivism&quot; is nothing more than a not-very-self-critical form of subjectivism.Moreover, having dispensed with any ultimate, objective ethical standard, Rand tried to introduce one anyway by insisting that anyone who did _not_ put the Objectivist ethic into practice was quite literally subhuman, even subanimal. She arrived at this insane view by (very much against her own epistemological standards) identifying &quot;human&quot; with just _one_ attribute of human beings: namely, rationality (understood in her own highly inadequate way). To see how this view works out in practice, read pp. 1054-55 of ATLAS SHRUGGED, where Dagny Taggart quite unnecessarily shoots a guard who has &quot;proven&quot; himself to be less than an animal.3. In politics, Rand sapped all distinctive meaning from the moral concept of &quot;rights&quot; by making respect for rights depend solely on self-interest (rather than making justice foundational and deriving an ethic/politics of _self-responsibility_ from that foundation). That means that, in strict consistency, the only moral guidance Objectivism can offer to anyone contemplating Hitler-like atrocities is that it's a mistake to louse up one's _own_ life so badly. In political theory, then, &quot;Objectivism&quot; is nothing more than a not-very-self-critical form of might-makes-right: treating other people as Hitler did is &quot;wrong&quot; only because, in the long run, an &quot;egoist&quot; can't _get away_ with it. (Of course Rand wrote her essay &quot;The Pull Peddlers&quot; precisely because she thought people _could_ get away with taking unjust advantage of each other through the use of government power. That this undermined her case for &quot;egoism&quot; seems never to have crossed her mind.)Moreover, her claim that a government requires a legal monopoly on the use of retaliatory force is a very foolish recipe for totalitarianism. The entire federalist system (including the Second Amendment) is supposed to _prevent_ just such a monopoly.These are not her only errors by any means; Rand redefined quite a few terms and never let on -- perhaps because she didn't know any better, and more likely because one of her major purposes was to subvert traditional philosophy altogether. The result is that she not only misrepresents the thought of everyone else, but also makes it almost impossible for her _readers_ to understand anyone else.Everybody knows the obvious examples: she left the words &quot;exclusive or excessive&quot; out of her definition of &quot;selfishness,&quot; she redefined &quot;sacrifice&quot; as the giving up of a _greater_ value for a _lesser_ one, and what she meant by &quot;altruism&quot; has never been defended by anyone important at all. Even on her own premises, what she should have defended was an ethic of _eudaimonism_ in which the distinction between &quot;egoism&quot; and &quot;altruism&quot; is of no fundamental importance since our real interests are not ultimately in conflict.Less well known: she thought &quot;a priori,&quot; &quot;analytic,&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot; were synonyms, and likewise &quot;a posteriori,&quot; &quot;synthetic,&quot; and &quot;contingent&quot; (no two terms in either triplet are synonymous); and she understood both &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;relative&quot; to mean &quot;arbitrary&quot; (which they don't, nor are they synonymous with each other). Even the central term &quot;objective&quot; suffers at her hands; what most people mean by &quot;objective,&quot; she calls &quot;intrinsic.&quot;Not only did she anathematize by misdefinition, she sometimes intentionally misrepresented the ideas of other people. Any philosophically informed reader can see this happening on nearly every page she wrote, but here's my own favorite example: in &quot;Philosophical Detection&quot; (in _Philosophy: Who Needs It_), she incorrectly attributed the saying, &quot;Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,&quot; to &quot;a very little mind, Emerson&quot; -- knowing full well that the _correct_ version of the quote is, &quot;A _foolish_ consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.&quot;(How do I know she knew better? I have an acquaintance who worked with Rand when the piece was originally published. The error was pointed out to her; she refused to correct it. And see Emerson's essay &quot;Self-reliance&quot; for the context of this quotation. He's not knocking logical consistency; he's arguing that it's silly to refuse to change your mind just because it might confuse other people.)The bottom line: Rand was a propagandist, not a philosopher. Those of us who really _do_ stand for reason, liberty, capitalism and all that nice stuff object to her because her &quot;defenses&quot; of them were so often incompetent and dishonest."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Over the course of the novel, there is potential for a nice piece of literature. But, as Rand is who rand is, the novel turns quickly and inevitably into a diatribe on objectivism and the \\"monopoly of the minds\\". Rand, possibly the least compassionate person to hold such an important place to so many people, does not hold back from turning what could have been a captivating story of industry into what slowly evolves into a large piece of overwrought propaganda (including a seventy page long speech on the tenets of objectivism and the faults of EVERY OTHER PHILOSOPHY EVER).I will admit, I am a liberal. I do not live by Randian codes. But when you examine her past work, such novels as We The Living, Anthem, or The Fountainhead only to get this as her magnum opus. Well, it is simply disappointing. While here other novels still act as works of advocacy for her philosophy, they do it under the guise of a novel. There is such a veil that one can ignore the preachy subtext and simply enjoy the novel for itself. With Atlas Shrugged Rand throws off the veil to produce a work used only as a soapbox (and with the size of the text and the failure as a piece of fiction, perhaps it would be better to step on anyways."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Kindle edition way too expensive, 3 times price of paperback, more than hardcover.

I also like the premise that one's help must not be \\"demanded\\" from another and people must be willing to help themselves. I have a brother who is older than me and who behaves just like Rearden's brother and who acts as if the world owes him something. He owes me $9000 which I know I will never reclaim. But after reading this book he will never get an ounce of assistance from me. The concepts of love in this book are irrational and laughable. Falling in love with someone you never met? All in all it was a good read. Readers of this book need to remember that there is one absolute in life, that of balance.I believe that it is important for individuals to seek their self interest and not be ashamed of doing so as espoused in this book, but we must never seek our self interest to the detriment of others, just as we do not want their self interest to be to the detriment of us."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Product arrived promptly.

Perhaps the evidence had always been there -- I think it was -- only now I was freer to see it because of my own growth and emancipation.Essentially what Nathaniel is saying here is young 'impressionable' minds, can be negatively affected by reading Ayn Rand, unless they keep it in the realm of FICTIONPsychopaths are born of too strong of a anti-societal belief...(Paul Ryan who said her books were required reading in his office is a perfect example)Mad Angel on FB"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A country where the government is on the rise for power and control.

Ayn Rand predicted this over 60 years ago and lays out what our government is currently involved with in changing our country from a capitalist society into one where \\"everyone gets a fair slice of the pie.\\"If you read this book, you will never look at the government in the same way again.

It is incredible that Ayn Rand had the foresight to predict some of the social/political malaise. Agenda 21 is from the United Nations is a good example."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is often favorably compared with \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" by those who claim a broader social significance for the book. But the comparison is more apt in describing what both books are: fictionalized tracts, political polemics masquerading as literature. Both see the world in black and white (no pun intended); the good guys are wear very white hats, and the bad guys are very dark indeed. Of course, melodrama and moral dichotomies are nothing new in literature, and I don't disparage Rand on that account. Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" presents a similar bifurcated plot, a battle between the ultimate Good and Evil. The difference between them is in intent and quality. Milton's intent was ultimately artistic, and as a poet few in English are any better. Rand's intent is largely political, a representation of her materialistic philosophy, and her literary skill, like that of Harriet Beecher Stowe, is quite limited, her plot sophomoric, and her characters wooden. In a word, Rand is an excruciatingly poor novelist.Therefore, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" must stand on its ideology, or it is nothing. And like most dystopian novels - \\"A Handmaiden's Tale,\\" an equally shrill feminist tract, comes most recently to mind, but there are many others - the defenders tend to agree fanatically with the message (as conservatives do with this book), or to oppose it with equal fanaticism (as Rand's liberal-socialist detractors do). In political movements, it seems more important to hate what we hate than to love what we love. This book continues to be read today solely for this reason. Its appeal is to a fanatic minority who seek certainty in an increasingly ambiguous world.But even as ideology, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" fails. In fact, Ayn Rand distilled a rather muddled philosophy from many classic sources, including Aristotle (which she admits), Plato (whose elitist ideas she copies without acknowledgment), and Nietzsche (whom she claims to deplore, but to whom she owes a great deal of her philosophy, especially to his \\"Man and Superman\\"). For those unwilling or unable to read the originals, Rand's pretentious attempt to recast the thoughts of her philosophic masters in modern clothing must come as something of a revelation. But warmed over Aristotle, Plato, or Nietzsche bears poor resemblance to the original. Rand's undisguised longing for an intellectual elite that will save the stupid masses from themselves and the social welfare state leads logically to a self-anointed intellectual elite, the same totalitarian end to which Nietzsche's philosophy led Hitler. Her vision is the flip side of extreme liberalism.Rand was only too aware of that logical extension of her ideas and wisely chose not to push her philosophy beyond its fictional denouement, for the triumph of her vision resembles the Big Brother of that other, far better written, dystopian novel, George Orwell's \\"1984.\\" Whether the controlling Big Brother is a socialist-Communist fanatic or a conservative-Capitalist fanatic seems scarcely worth debating. Any elitist regime that purports to think for the incompetent masses and plan happiness and death for others is suspect.If it matters to anyone, I am a political moderate and a successful capitalist myself. I too deplore the socialist state. But I cannot recommend \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" as literature or philosophy. It is no more a \`novel' than \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" or \\"A Handmaiden's Tale\\". As philosophy, it is morally bankrupt. But for an insecure minority and for adolescents who have not yet learned to think for themselves, it offers a warm blanket of pre-packaged philosophy as an anodyne for the pain of thought. The book has no other merits."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand was a novelist who convinced herself that she was an important philosopher. Rand was wrong; she was just a novelist, but was decent at what she did. She stopped writing novels after this one, and I can safely say that her nonfiction lacks all of the good qualities of her fiction while taking on all the bad ones.Atlas Shrugged is a sort of period piece, where the brilliant ethically selfish industrialists of the world go on strike and bring it into chaos in the hands of the \\"altruists.\\" I say period piece, because it was written in the time when the United States was involved in its Cold War with the Soviet Union, and embodies the anti-Communist spirit of the era, which also conflated Communism with Socialism. If taken as a large anti-Communist tract, Atlas Shrugged isn't all that dismal in terms of philosophy...just the misguided ideas of the times. However, it has no bearing on the world itself.The fundamental assumption of Atlas Shrugged is that capitalism really does work exactly as idealistic conservatives say it does, with shining, heroic geniuses rising to the top. It deals with the laissez-faire capitalism of Industrial society as opposed to Communism (as I said, it's a period piece; we are in the post-Industrial era, which has quite different rules). However, industrialists weren't really the moral, mental, and creative giants Rand depicted them as, and the rest were not grossly incompetent. An industrialists' strike would've led to the rest capably taking charge. As we see today, effective presidents of corporations are not at all super-executives like Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggart; the top ranks of a corporation are a strong network, rarely so effectively autocratic and never so constantly right.Atlas Shrugged suffers from Rand's psychological disorder of Narcissism, which separates everyone into all-good and all-bad, scapegoating the all-bad. It even has a very distinct way of expressing that: all the all-goods in AS have the same thoughts, with any differentiations (Rearden's guilt, Dagny's relentless optimism) as simply errors that need to be ironed out. Only in one case does a character ever break the boundary and become interestingly unique: Dr. Robert Stadler, who is quickly given the brush-off by the all-goods of the novel. Stadler, who once held to certain ideals but has seen them broken by the world, is victimized by Rand to become simply another all-bad. A pity.The dialogue ranges from stilted to unthinkably bad; nobody ever made the mistake of thinking that Rand knew how people really talk. Occasional speeches interrupt the flow of the story, and John Galt rants on for 50-some odd pages just to get the point through. A shame, because the story itself is a fairly interesting dystopia mixed with lackluster philosophy. You see, the heroes of Atlas Shrugged really aren't all that heroic, but the villains remain quite plausible. Their real villainy isn't in their philosophy, which is just as simply a justification as the Nietzscheanisms of the Nazis or the Marxism of the Soviets. They are rather hypocrites and liars, men exploiting the people for their own desires while spouting meaningless platitudes. Against these people, even Objectivists seem sympathetic. Rand's view that philosophy fundamentally shapes history is wrong, and Atlas Shrugged actually proves this...it is not because the villains are altruists that the world goes to heck, but rather because they are liars and hypocrites. A better message than \\"collectivism will ruin you all!\\" is \\"power corrupts,\\" and AS actually goes a long way to show it.During all those speeches, Rand tries to impress her ethics upon you: a man's highest value is his own life, and the right thing to do is that which benefits yourself. This is a corrupt, morally dead principle derived not from reason, but from Rand's psychological disorders. Rand's all-or-nothing mentality meant that all good was to the self, or to others, in her regard. Hence, she could easily dismiss an altruism no rational person would ever accept, for an egoism that was equally unsound. I am reminded of the myth of Narcissus and Echo: Narcissus wasted away because he was concerned with nothing but himself while Echo faded out because she was concerned with nothing but Narcissus. (Funny, a Christian explaining morality in Greek myh terms...) In other words, we cannot rely solely on ourselves or on others for our values, but must strike a balance in the middle. We live in symbiosis, and must care for our own needs and the needs of others. Rand's black and white view did not properly account for the complexities of reality.So, what do you get? A decent dystopia with philosophically unlikeable heroes and a lot of philosophical dead weight. Rand's thought can be dismissed after taking an unbiased introductory course in philosophy. It's 1069 pages, but 50 some is the eminently avoidable Speech; it goes by pretty quickly, and when it has its moments, it has some style. Worth reading after you've had a decent philosophy course, and can further bolster your own ideas by countering Rand's. And at 1069 pages, it's an accomplishment to read...."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This fantasy book (now a poorly done and insufferable movie) continues to espouse Rand's 'selfishness as a virtue' idiotology. Over the years she's gained quite an unremarkable gaggle of dimwitted followers, many of whom like to fantasize and imagine themselves as being powerful 'movers and shakers', unconcerned with the poor riff-raff on the streets who hold their hands out for scraps of food or alms.Through her own self-serving psychosis, Rand envisioned a corporate-state and a permanent underclass along the lines of Stalinism (totalitarianism, not \`socialism'). In essence, she became a confused sociopath with a little girl's mind, who never forgave Stalin for taking her pony away and forcing her family to flee to Europe. Ironically, what she hated she became. She believed in Nietzsche's supermen, as did Hitler; and corporate-government, a la Mussolini. Rand herself was a despicable hypocrite who ended the last years of her pathetic life sucking government taxpayer money and living off of welfare, Medicare and Social Security - without which, she would have died destitute in the street from lung cancer. Two of her main cohorts ended up taking handouts from friends or living with relatives as they, themselves, aged and became useless parasites on society.I really liked the part in the book, though, when all the movers and shakers went 'on strike' and moved to their own little fantasy island yelling 'GO GALT' and 'GREED IS GOOD'; and that's where the story turned into a cross between Animal Farm and Lord of the Flies. The book ended with acts of cannibalism, which I enjoyed.William F. Buckley declared: \\"Ayn Rand is dead.

I can't say that I agreed with everything she wrote, as I am a devout Catholic, and believe in things that she says I can have no proof of. But I wouldn't believe without reason, and reason, I have. Ms. Rand did an excellent job with the development of the characters. I will never forget any of them, they had strong personalities, and were all believable. I also respect her belief in capitalism, because in today's government, we seem to be straying away from it, in order to allow everyone to have a &quot;fair shot&quot;.

After reading one page, I put the book aside wondering how I would ever finish the one thousand-plus remaining pages. A couple of years later, I did the same thing. When I finally did get to read it to the end, I wanted to kick myself for not having read it through the first time. I did not realize at the time I read it that Ayn Rand worked as a writer for movies in Hollywood when she first came to America. I think this shows through in the very visual style she gave to the action and settings in Atlas Shrugged. At first, I thought it would make a great movie, but to capture the scope and essence of the complete novel would probably take a thirty-day TV mini-series. If someone told me that a novel known for its underlying political and social theme could also be so much fun, I wouldn't have thought it possible until I read Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ATLAS SHRUGGED : I would like to communicate with ALL WOMEN having calibre &amp; Character like DAGNY - (Atlas Shrugged) on my Email.THE FOUNTAINHEAD : I read it.

It doesn't tell you how to live your life. It gives some advice, but this is just to help explain the major point. Don't criticize the advice; that is pointless and stupid.

Many others are also afraid of the primary question of the book, what produces wealth and prosperity, and who is entitled to it? Rand's answer, so chillingly and lengthily refined, is the Atlases of the world--the producers and the thinkers deserve the rewards of their work, not the moochers(bureaucrats must a priori dislike this book). Justice, not irrational mysticism, is the theme and overriding concern. No wonder Atlas stirs up such passions!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As a novel, Atlas Shrugged has too much preaching; as an exposition, it lacks power because practically all of the characters are far too extreme for the readers to relate to the real world. It is a great work nonetheless. Ayn Rand used her tremendous writing skills to forcefully express her (somewhat extreme) social views in the form of a novel - perhaps the most effective way to touch the minds of a lot of people.Atlas Shrugged has a great plot, the characters are vivid and engaging. However, the last fifth of the book was not as well formed as the earlier part.Whether you agree with her views or not, you will find the book thought provoking and very entertaining. It is one of a kind. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You need not agree with everything in this book or Ayn Rand's philosophy on Objectivism to enjoy this book (though it does help). I don't entirely agree with what she has written and found many flaws, but who wouldn't have flaws with the scope that this book covers. It took her many years to write it, and you begin to understand while you read this epic-in-proportion book.What I did like most was the stark contrast of the Looters (those who feed off of the intellectual initiatives of others... basically freeloaders and those in government) and the heroes of this story (the few who are willing to think and bring home their own bacon). The characters are interesting no matter which point of view they are being shown in.The worst thing of this book is its length. Some of the dialog can be a little long-winded. One speech given over the radio was 60 pages long!!! I felt like half of this book could have been edited out and nobody would have missed a thing. So if you are going to read this book then be prepared for a lot of unnecessary conversations.I have been hearing for years that this is a book that must be picked up and I finally found the time to do it. Don't get me wrong, I could put it down (and did for a few long breaks in time) but I have no regrets in reading this through finally.

The examples are kind of extreme at times, but it does help to get the point across. I enjoyed this very much. I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is Ayn Rand's masterpiece that lays out her philosophy of objectivism in an epic tale. It is also one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read.This book will appeal to the young with high expectations of the future and to the successful with pride of their accomplishments, espousing individualism, self-confidence, self-respect, production, and pride, while demonizing pity, helplessness, laziness, uncertainty, liberalism, and weakness. The heroes of the book are great industrialist that act in rational and confident manners to accomplish their goals. The villains are abstract philosophers and progressives that preach the helplessness of man and behave as cowards and sneaksters. The producers and movers attempt to fight off the relentless moochers and looters, who stab and grad from and depend on the producers they are trying to ruin. The story chronicles what happens when the movers of the last free-market country on Earth (America) finally have enough and refuse to feed the beast any longer.This novel relays important lessons that readers should take to the heart. Besides the obvious dangers of socialism and communism, Atlas Shrugged also highlights the dangers of pure democracy. As elected officials (and the populace in general) become convinced of the unfairness of corporate tycoons making too much money (Ahem.. Exxon) while the \\"underprivileged\\" are left behind (Ahem.. Walmart), danger arises in the passage of laws that take the \\"free\\" out of free-market capitalism. It is important to realize that just because we live in a free democracy, we must always be on the lookout for social-progressive thinking gaining a foothold in the American mindset.Rand gives tribute to the ideals of America.. In the words of Fransisco D'Aconia, \\"the first and only time in history, a country of money... no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America,.. a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement.\\"There is a lot you could learn from this book, with characters such as Dagny Taggart, Hank Rearden, Fransisco D'Aconia, Wesely Mouch, and Jim Taggart each having a well-fleshed-out history and emotional clarity. There is a lot more I could say about this 1100+ page novel, but I promised to keep it short, so I'll just say this: READ IT and then REREAD IT when you begin to forget why you loved it so much the first time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a philisophical thriller. It is the story of what happens when the productive become slaves of the non-productive and when society degenerates into one that views altruism, rather than individualism, as the most noble ideal.While I am normally intimidated by large books like this, I found Rand's writing style to be very clear and concise which kept my interest throughout the book.Rand wrote Atlas Shrugged not only as a fiction novel but also as an introduction to her philosophy of Objectivism, respectfully. Not only can people see what Objectivism encompasses with this book but also take examples of people of high moral standards and actions like Dagny Taggart, Hank Rearden and John Galt.In Atlas Shrugged, Rand dramatizes the moral basis of capitalism and capitalism's enemies. It is a philosophical and fictional tour-de-force presented as a mystery.This is one of the best fiction and philosophy books I have ever read and I now consider this my favorite book. You will not be disappointed by this novel either. Someone once told Rand that her work was not in the mainstream of American literature, she is alleged to have replied that 'the mainstream of American literature is a stagnant swamp.'She had a point than and this statement is true in many ways now."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Critically acclaimed as 'one of the most powerful and influential books ever written'. I whole-heartedly agree with that, this book is my bible. I believe that if you understand this book, you understand the meaning of life. Anyone with any sort of natural inquisitiveness, with any desire for knowledge, must read this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"OK, so I've read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", simply because there's been such a popular culture buzz about Miss Rand and the supposedly-neglected almighty principles that she alone has enunciated. It's a whopper of a book, and full of stuff that I had to learn to skim read if I ever wanted to get through it. I don't think I could stand a cult-settlement like Galt's Gulch--it's oversimplified, and people would eventually raise a ruckus that even the best of minds couldn't contain. The emphasis upon railroads, steel, and other such mechanical enterprise are enough to show that this book comes from a different time than the one we're in now; it would be interesting to see how it would adapt to this so-called \\"information age\\". The notion of gold- and silver-standard coinage was a neat one; I'd like to see that come back, but this hoopla about the almighty dollar is a little on the kooky side. I noticed that a whole lot of story seemed to go on in the last quarter to fifth of this book, as opposed to the interminable drag-on of Miss Taggart and her Lovers that seems to consume the first part. When I was a kid, I'd pick up huge novels just for the satisfaction of conquering their bulk, and I suppose that was the case about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". It's an old fashioned, big-box of a novel, the kind people used to have time to read more of. But her prescriptions are just hammered at you again and again, without the sense that they'd have real-world applicability."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's interesting how Rand's Objectivist philosophy combines the most controversial liberal and conservative ideas and ties the whole thing together. No wonder why so many people hate her. Liberals for being pro-business, conservatives for being atheist, and moderates for being absolutist. And yet, her masterpiece is the second-most influential book, just after the Bible.I personally very much enjoyed Atlas Shrugged. I think that it was well worth losing sleep at night, trying to finish the 1000+ pages before I had to return the book. However, it is not targeted at &quot;just anybody.&quot; This is not remotely tolerant, &quot;people-friendly,&quot; or objective. It is very subjective, contains large quantites of philosophy, and it certainly doesn't give a damn about what the masses think. For anyone willing to take this book on, whether you love it or hate it, Atlas Shrugged is a ride worth taking."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Whether one is conservative, liberal, socialist, fascist or libertarian, reading this book helps one understand where libertarians are coming from. Libertarians have beliefs that can't be explained away as hate or racism and such name calling is the last resort of those who have no substantive arguments to make.My professors should have assigned this book as part of my poly sci degree, though they had me read Adam Smith, Mao and Marx."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged when I was 22. An old man spied the book with me and asked me \\"Who is John Galt\\". What makes this amazing that it happened in a sleepy and dusty Indian town. I was surprised at the reach of this book across age and location. The book gave me a philosophy for life. The idea that money represents human effort and hence is the only potent force is an absolutely revelation. Even though the idea repeats itself and some times the narration becomes incoherent, it is absolutely necessary for youngsters to read the book. It will definitely give a new perspective in life as it has given me."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"As the author ofPhilosophy: What It Is and Why We Need It, I know quite a bit about Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and its expression through her novels. If you take the time to read this 1,000+ page masterpiece, you are in for the ride of your life. The characters are beautiful images of moral idealism concretized through words and deeds. The villains are ugly, wretched depictions of human weakness. The central conflict in the story, however, is not between heroes and villains but between two different groups of heroes. One group of heroes believes that the world should be saved from evil. The other group believes that the world is too evil to be worth saving. If you are the average reader, your gut reaction will probably be to side with the saviors. However, the beauty of this novel and all of Rand's writings is that they constantly cause you to question your own presuppositions. Are Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden truly living a virtuous life? Or are they unwittingly practicing the very vices which they despise in others? Read this book and start thinking for yourself about the deepest questions of human existence."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You cannot add much more about this book with the number of reviews here. Ayn Rand has taken her philosophical system she called Objectivism and presented it though a fictional story. For a work of literary fiction at 1,088 pages (mass market edition) , it was not an \\"easy\\" read, but once you got into the \\"flow\\" of the story you can see why this was a bestseller at the end of the 1950's and went on to become a modern classic. I first read this book as a work of science fiction; you do not see the elments of science fiction until you get towards the end of the book at the \\"hideaway\\".Yes, this book in some respects is controversial and subject of much debate. Some see that we are heading towards a dystopian United States similar to the setting in this plot and think this book reflects the reasons for it. Rand's main point stated In simple terms - Capitalism good - Socialism bad! In some respects, the story may be somewhat dated because of the 1950's industrial settings, but that does not affect the overall plot and thesis. You can understand the various points she is trying to make throughout the book applied in different situations. If you have read Hazlitt's \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" which was written in the same era, he uses the same approach as Rand. He repeats his theme over and over in various situations until you understand what he trying to get across.This book is required reading for all \\"Libertarians\\". However, I recommend it for all readers who want to expand their intellectual understanding of other philosophical & economical viewpoints and reasoning."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I found it remarkable how Ayn Rand understood the intent of the different types of people and how accurate she characterized them.

I have applied many of these principles in my role as manager - respect your co-workers as valuable in and of themselves; treat people like they can produce to their highest level; expect greatness from everyone - and my office is exploding! This is the second most positive self-help book ever written (\\"The Fountainhead\\" is the first, since it focuses on the individual.) I so prefer listening to books on CD rather than the \\"morning zoo\\" or \\"afternoon drive time\\" radio."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is a remarkable book; in it Ayn Rand pours out her deepest convictions on life. It is first and foremost a treatise on her objectivist philosophy and devotes hundreds of pages to comments and explanations of objectivism and their ramifications on living.My edition of the book, the 35th Anniversary Edition, First Dutton Printing 1992, has 1,168 pages which leave plenty of pages for action and adventure and there is plenty to go around.I first read the book in 1971 and found it interesting and provocative but not threatening; my recent re-reading of the book has left me with greater concerns as I see many of the symptoms of deterioration of a society described in the book taking place in real life. That is unsettling to say the least as I am inclined to agree with the projected outcomes described in the book.A quote attributed to Margaret Thatcher: \\"The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money [to spend]\\" summarizes the problem every nation that has toyed with socialism has been compelled to face. Our nation today has attempted to circumvent this problem by simply creating money out of thin air. All this does is briefly delay the contraction that must inevitably follow.Although the book shows its age, a reminder of just how far things have changed since 1957, it is in many regards as up-to-date as today's headlines. It is disturbing to hear pundits on the TV using the same phrases ascribed to their counterparts in the book. We are not yet to the point in our economic and social disintegration where the book starts but we seen to be closing in on it with increasing speed.I can agree with Ayn Rand in her economic philosophy and am personally convinced that capitalism is the most effective creator of wealth. I can also agree with her concepts of personal responsibility but must disagree with her conclusions on the source of the problem.On page 745, the John Galt character when asked what made him quit says, \\"My refusal to be born with any original sin.\\" I can only wonder how that statement is understood by most readers; to those of us with knowledge of the Bible it is very clear what is being denounced. The Bible, in both the Old and New Testaments affirms that in Adam all men died spiritually when Adam disobeyed God and thereby were separated from God. This is the \\"original sin\\" referenced here to the best of my understanding; this is what Ayn Rand rejected as a reality for her life.Happily the Bible goes on to reveal God's solution to man's problem in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior who died for the sins of the world.The ramifications of failure to acknowledge original sin are far reaching. Secular humanism, by not recognizing mankind's problem, is always doomed to failure as it expects an ability to perform which does not exist in fallen man. Karl Marx in his 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program, wrote \\"from each according to his ability to each according to his need.\\" This utopian slogan was demonstrably a failure in the Soviet Union as the need far outstripped the ability and has never had any greater success in any other socialist experiment.Ayn Rand's yearning for an ideal man is touching and sad as she is looking in the wrong place. God provided the ideal man in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Only Christ can successfully deal with the problem of original sin; only Christ can effectively restore mankind to fellowship with God.Ayn Rand is very bitter against religion; this is demonstrated many times in the book. It is vitally important to recognize there is more often than not a vast difference between religion and Biblical Christianity. In too many cases religion has embraced the values of secular humanism. It is good to remind oneself that it was the religious leaders of his day who were instrumental in crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ.It is evident that during her life Ayn Rand was often questioned about the very existence of the type of man she wrote about. The book is dedicated to her husband, Frank O'Connor and she writes \\"My other acknowledgment is on the dedication page of this novel. I knew what values of character I wanted to find in a man. I met such a man--and we have been married for twenty-eight years. His name is Frank O'Connor.\\" \\"I trust that no one will tell me that men such as I write about don't exist. That this book has been written-and published-is my proof that they do.\\"There is no question that notable giants of business and industry have lived and contributed to life; it seems, however, that the children and grandchildren of these giants were more often similar to James Taggert than Dagny Taggert.In summary the book is still timely and interesting especially in light of the direction our nation is taking. I recommend the book with my above observations in mind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I almost ordered the much cheaper paperback edition, but so many reviewers said that the print was \\"microscopic\\", that I knew I'd have to go with the Centennial Hardcover edition.

Ms. Rand shares that belief as well and tells a wonderful story about it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"There's a reason Ayn Rand has been on the top seller's list for multiple decades."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's quite the book.This, at least, is something many, if not all, readers of this seminal novel can agree on. Rand intended to encompass the application of her philosophy within her fiction writing, and while it's easy to become caught up in her romanticization of the capitalistic ideal, those unconvinced by her enthusiastic offering are often stunned by the negative response they get from believers in Rand's message.I say \\"believers\\", and it makes sense. This is because Rand presents a vision of the ideal. While she purports to have worked it all out logically, there is a measure of clarity missing in her attempt. It is peculiar and highly unlikely, even in a more utopian, ideal society, that those most successful will always react in the pathetically cold way that they do. This is positively alien to many, including some who value competent work and excellence in their actions. Sometimes the logical solution is to work toward the middle and cooperate with others to increase one's profit overall. Perhaps the appropriate response is that one who would make such a claim is weak, and does not have the individual power to create beyond the means of a messy bureaucracy. But such a dialogue requires less stipulation and more evidence, and it should make any philosopher a little queasy to accept the claim a priori that this is how we should live. Rand ends up being more of a rationalist in her fiction than an empiricist, where one can deduce even from a person's appearance their attitude toward life. Shall we, then, deduce from Rand's own appearance that she was a dependent old hag? Descartes claims we can deduce God rationally. Shall we just do so, then? Kant claims we can deduce the realm of the noumena a priori. Shall we just do that? It seems best instead to observe the world we are in, observe our own character, determine our strengths, weaknesses, and values, and live by those, rather than adhere to this ideology because Rand says we can deduce virtuous selfishness from the nature of logic.Purely transactional, individualist economies could work, in a society where everyone is committed to them. But Ayn Rand herself showed that they did not, at least in her own case. Her own inner circle was nicknamed \\"The Collective\\" jokingly. However, it became more than a laughing matter when she began expunging her cohorts, often for irrational causes more related to her personal life than related to the public movement. She in effect excommunicated those she found lacking, including the Brandens. Nathaniel Branden had been sleeping with Rand, and when she found out he was also sleeping with someone else, she abruptly disinherited her intellectual heir in favor of a less able individual (Peikoff).In Atlas Shrugged, ultimately, the creative protagonists force their own system on a society inhabited by a lot of people who disagree with it. Is it okay because it's \\"right\\"? I don't know. Perhaps it is. It's certainly not democracy, though. And that's not meant to be a condemnation of their system. It has a lot going for it. But would I appreciate a novel that welcomes reasoned disagreement more, rather than a polemic that characterizes two already opposing sides? Yes. Three stars for shaking the liberal establishment up and fueling a conservative revolution. Two stars off for fueling a polemic cultlike movement on the side.I recommendThe Ayn Rand Cultfor a study in contradiction between her philosophy and her life, including a chapter on the ineptness of Alan Greenspan, no more a guru than Rand herself.(I'm not affiliated with Walker or their company. I just found it informative.)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand has an interesting view of the world, and I think it is one worth sharing...I agree with some aspects of Objectivism, however, Ms. Rand seems to ignore some of the most basic variables in human existence (mainly limited resources, social solidarity, and environmental concerns)...however, her work is unique enough to be considered a \\"classic\\" and although she could have managed to get her point across in 1/4 of the book, I still think it is worth reading..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Although I wouldn't rank Rand's work as literary masterpieces, it's interesting and viable philosophy. I won't debate the current political divide - socialism/liberalism verses capitalism/conservatism, or my evolved position of libertarianism (tongue and cheek intended), but it fascinates me how many liberal voices, seemingly and obviously intelligent people, can be such sheep. And, yes I'm digressing beyond the book itself here. We've seem though out history the making of a great orator and how the masses, so wanting a \\"better\\" way have worshiped this one individual's pronouncement: \\"I will lead you to the promised land...\\" You'd think we'd learn by now. Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Castro, Osama. All extremely charismatic, all promise, and all delivered what. The founding fathers of this country had a plan, and yes all less a few were what we would call racists by todays standard - this was the ignorance and accepted reality of the time...today's founding father would have a profoundly different heartfelt viewpoint. Back to our point...They had a detailed plan, an extremely thoughtful and insightful collaboration, based on what they understood works and doesn't work. And today, minus the corruption in both business and govt, it still stands as the formula for the creation of a higher standard of living for all. No, let me restate this. Despite the corruption of both business and govt, it still allows a higher standard of living for all. Imagine what would happen if the people in Washington had the same character and honor as just some of the founding fathers. Which leads me back to great oratory. Obama. I've searched, I've listened. His talk and example parallels, and by this I mean by promises only and not his intention as an evil doer, Stalin, Hitler, and the like. Obama is an empty suit. What does he bring to the table except good oratory. He's not pro American in terms of values. He's a socialist. Period. And, at this he's just a talker. Why do we in this day and age still have so many intelligent sheep? \\"Yeah if we only got tune ups and filled our tires...then we solve the gas price issue..\\" Obama is either badly misinformed or a stooge."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm currently slogging through this book. Rand has quite a talent for writing, but the book could have been half as long and still drilled home the points she wants to make. I'm half way through, on approximately page 500 or so. It's definitely not a stay up all night, page turner. I've picked it up and down for periodic readings over the last year and a half. My biggest problem with the book is her extreme, one-dimensional characters depictions. Every self-made person, no matter how self-involved or selfish, are treated as Gods. Any person who feels the least bit of compassion for the needy are classified as dumb, unreasonable and the cause of society's downfall. This theme makes it into every page of the book. Even the physical characteristics of the characters follow this theme. Self-made factory owners are intelligent, strong, and slim. The liberal enemy is an overweight baffoon that seems to lack any modicum of public policy acumen or self-awareness. My husband encouraged me to read the book, and is still encouraging me to read it (I'll finish it honey, I promise). His business life (as well as his familly life to an extent) shared many commonalities with the \\" Reardon\\" character. Having traveled down the corporate road with him as he built his first business, even my liberal heart has to admit that Rand has a strong point to make. There are those who create, innovate, and move the world, and there are certainly those who are all too willing to ride the coat tails of these people. But life is certainly not as black and white as Rand would have us believe. Without the efforts of the great majority of people who live within her extremes, the economy, the comforts of a mixed capitalistic society, and life as we know it would not exist. May my liberal heart find the strength and toleration to get through the last 500 pages"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"you may look no further than her book, Atlas Shrugged. Rand goes into great detail, vis-a-vis a speech integrated within the storyline, of her thoughts and ideas on objectivism and its applications to society.While I found the book more difficult to read than The Fountainhead [as her philosophical theory and application were more textbook], it was a book worth reading. If you are interested in her philosophy but would like a lighter version, I would suggest reading The Fountainhead first. Then, if you would like to know more, you can read her manifesto, but brace yourself for the strong opinions.Ironically enough, her novel is a redemptive story despite the fact she is a self-proclaimed atheist. Her characters are well-developed. In fact, you will find that she so well defines the characters' nature in this book, you'll point at Hank Rearden and say: Well, he is just like John, my partner, or Cheryl Brooks, is like my starry-eyed administrative assistant. The plot is well-crafted, but sluggish in some places due to her mini-lectures. It is also the source for many notable quotes, the best quote being: Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think you are facing a contradiction, check your premises. You will find one of them is wrong.Although I disagree with her philosophy, she does hit on some high points that have caused some difficulties in free enterprise in this country, namely entitlements, governmental controls and sanctions that affect grassroots industrial and manufacturing concerns. Her solution, which I will not divulge, while interesting in theory, is not facing the reality of the world and is a bit self-endulgent.Only undertake this mega-novel when you have your thinking cap set straight, have patience to withstand a few lectures scattered about that seem to be overly repetitious, and the fact that it is an ambitious 1,150 pages."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Of course it's dated; yes, it's hyperbolic and over dramatic. But Rand makes her point so deliciously! Her characters are almost overdeveloped and perhaps stereotyped, but I found that this gave her message a seriousness that was impossible to ignore. Freedom rules. Libertarian ideas are the kindest and fairest. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" makes a magnificent example of this creed. It's a fun book and you'll never forget its message."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shurgged and Objectivism have, I think, many major flaws, and I'll get to these later. But the simple fact is I loved this book way too much to give it anything other than five stars.Atlas was originally titled The Strike, and that is essentially what this story is about: what happens when the most important producers of the world go on strike. It takes places in sometime around the mid 20th century in a world where collectivist ideologies are gradually taking over the world.Rand wrote that her aim in writing Atlas Shrugged was to portray man \\"as he might and ought to be\\" (not an exact quote). She wanted to create her \\"ideal man.\\" And she also clearly wanted to question the ethics she saw as pervasive throughout the world.And it is in the ethics of her philosophy that the beauty of Objectivism and Atlas Shrugged lies. Her core idea is that every man's only moral duty is his own happiness (forgive my characterizing it as only one gender, but that is certainly how she would have written it). Objectivism is, however, nothing close to hedonism because it demands applying reason to everything--not acting on what your impulse says will make you happy but on what will actually bring you the greatest pleasure.As far as the other parts of Rand's philosophy go, I don't really understand her epistemology (which basically means her theory about how people acquire knowledge) at all, and i think that is partially because she never really explained it fully. I totally disagree with her metaphyhsical principle that, essentially, things are what they are, regardless of observation. How does she square this with the findings of quantum mechanics? I do, however, agree with her that people often use this idea that things aren't necessarily what they seem to escape responsibility. Also, I strongly disagree that reason and faith in God or something spiritual are mutually exclusive. Finally, she ignores the fact that people can give something to another out of compassion and have that be the most pleasurable experience they can have.For the actual novel, which is actually what I'm supposed to be reviewing, it has problems of its own. Because she set out to create \\"ideal men,\\" her characters seem unrealistic. But it usually not even her \\"ideal men\\" that are the hardest to believe--they have strong convictions but they are conflicted and have internal struggle. The characters that strike me as the most false are their enemies. People like James Taggart and Weseley Mouch don't seem to have a decent bone in their bodies; they seem to be wholly evil with little to no conflict about it. There was originally supposed to be a priest character in Atlas, a man who believed in the \\"looters'\\" philosophy, but actually had good intentions. However, Rand decided not to put him in the book because \\"it was impossible to make such a character believable.\\" In reality, it is quite the opposite--it is impossible to make these completely evil characters believable.Still, if you're interested in Objectivism as a philosophy, I would suggest you read Rand's interview in Playboy. That, I think, is her at her most rational and most reasonable, and her explaining her philosophy the most clearly. You can find a transcript just by running a Google search.Buy Atlas Shrugged, read it, love Objectivism, love how full of life it is in this form, but always read with a critical eye because if you don't become a dogmatic Objectivist, there will almost certainly be some part of Rand's ideas that you won't buy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Of all Ayn Rand's fiction, this fictional presentation of her fully fledged philosophy has probably the most limited audience. It will be enjoyed by already-admirers, or by those newbies ready to appreciate capitalistic heroes engaged in philosophical battles.ATLAS SHRUGGED's good points include its plot (the heroine's discovery of her ideal man who has called for a strike -- of the capitalists!), the philosophy lessons embedded in the narrative, and the grandeur of it all.Detractors have rightfully complained of the intransigent tone of the novel. Like so many systemizers, Ayn Rand thought she constructed a perfect philosophical edifice and refused to contemplate flaws in it. So the novel (like Ayn Rand herself, and her numerous admirers) casts a harsh glare at mortals who don't toe the line, regardless of the width of the gap.If you're new to Ayn Rand, try another novel first. I'd recommend them in chronological order:ANTHEM,WE THE LIVING,THE FOUNTAINHEAD. Then you will know if you want to plunge into this, her ultimate opus, ATLAS SHRUGGED."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's philosophy, objectivism, is impossible to refute scientifically; just as religions, falling in love, the quality of art and so on are all impossible to refute. Why is this? It is because her writings come across as thousands of pages of ranting without real foundations or concrete definitions. I suppose a philosophy is just that: a method of perception and not a provable truth. However, Rand screams about the applicability of her ideas, even going so far as to say hers is the only method of individual lifestyle and societal management that will work. Thus, absolute claims require absolute proof. Blanket statements based on assumed truths accompanied by arbitrary value judgments masquerading as facts (do all humans share Rand's materialistic definitions of quality of life?) and angry accusation of the underclass, as well as railing against generosity and selflessness require great proof to even consider, let alone to accept. A story that takes up over 1000 pages while constantly repeating the same assertions without real development of the ideas within will not convince a true rationalist of the validity of those assertions. Quantity does not equal quality (unless of course, hehe, you're an objectivist).On a side note: It is quite disturbing that defenders of her philosophy and writings seem to have a tendency toward condescending attitudes and insults against the intelligence of others who criticize her thinking. Perhaps it is because the entire nature of her heroes was that they have no obligation to anyone or anything. The notion that you are either an objectivist or a collectivist is one I challenge for real proof. I for one will deny myself no weapon in the arsenal of man, neither my own strength and ability to aid myself and others, nor the strength I find in those important people in my life. One is not required to agree or disagree with Rand, since her assertions are not provable without further definition of the foundation truths and despite the \\"me against the world\\" attitude of the objectivist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you are going to read only one 1000 page book in your lifetime, I suggest this be the one.

But it isn't. It's about Dagney Taggaret, a woman who runs a transcontinental railroad company and is caught in a losing battle between creators such as herself and parasitic money looters. The man who invents the metal is just one of Dagney's heroic admirers.It's unusual to find a book with a female protagonist that is not about the rip-ability of bodices or some cozy view of being a mom. Atlas Shrugged is worth the reading just for that fact.Ayn Rand created a philosophy that had a basis in reality. Her observations about \\"secondhanders\\" and \\"looters\\" ring true for our society today. But she also required a world of cold intellect in which people do things solely to benefit themselves. It takes twisting sometimes for her to get her philosophy to fit the novel's developments.And it's worth looking at Ayn Rand's life. She truly walked her talk and her philosophical movement ended catastrophically when her best pupil decided that he'd rather be happy with a happy woman than continue to have a sexual relationship with the much older creator of Objectivisim (Ayn Rand herself). So if you read Rand's fiction, take some time to read her biography and the autobiographies written by her movement's adherents.Altogether Rand's work, fiction, and life make an illustrative tale."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Simply superb.

Not everyone is born an Einstein, or with the means to better their lives to any extent, something Rand fails to acknowlege. &quot;Am I my brother's keeper?&quot; is a point to which I heard from Rand a resounding &quot;No&quot;, a response which I remember left me cold. I would not waste my time to read again.

I've read Fountainhead and own almost all of her works. She is an inspiration to the freemarketer and the person who craves justice in a putrid mess of a world. But I will admit some stuff to the people who hate this book. Ayn Rand isn't that great a literay novelist. While her books are inspirational and such, they are way too drawn out and half the book (at least) could have been cut out and nothing taken away from the book itself. She needed to listen to her editor a little more, although from her character of Howard Roard I doubt she ever did.... Oh well. Ayn socialist, I'd dare you to read it and see the bankrupting principles of your moral system. Oh and one last thing, I am one of those evil mystics she rants about- a Christian. While I struggle with my belief in God, I believe she was irrational for her disbelieve in God.

She's someone who said &quot;bollocks to y'all&quot; (in more than that many words) to the cult of caring means sharing and cheerful servitude. She is a consummate intellectual elitest, who cares not for the week minded subsentient, but rather opens her womb to the towering staff of human intellect, so that it can also penetrate the dark chasms of altruism and depravity.

Having been brought up in an Italian, Catholic and Democrat family, I was brought up with all of the misconceptions about wealth and money.&quot;Money is the root of all evil.&quot; My parents would say. But funny how tightly they held on to it! Even as a child I felt that something was wrong. The first reference I got was from our Priest who clarified that terrible misquote from the Bible and said &quot;the love of money is the root of all evil.&quot;None the less Rands book seemed too capitalistic to a smalltown boy like me. I was introduced to this book in high school and had a hard time accepting it's contents.In fact, I had to read it several times to understand it so deep were the roots of democrat, small town thinking.Even though Atlas shrugged is a novel, I am continually impressed by the quality of people that I have met who have achieved high levels of wealth and recommend this book.It is a bit of a hard slog, read a few pages per day. Evenif it takes several weeks. It will be worth it. As an aside, I also recommend the tapes to play in your car.

OK,so you don't agree with it, so what? It's still a well written suspensful novel, that keeps your interest at a high level. I also found Upton Sinclair's The Jungle to be a well written novel, and I completely disagreed with the philosophy of that novel, but I would give the book five stars anyway. Regarding Rand's philosophy, what she is attempting to do is simply astounding. She is trying to come up with a moral defense of capitalism, which has rarely been done before. Are her ideas sound? They are certainly thought provoking. Should we have a government with less laws, less control over business affairs? Why is it that the Democrats believer in personal liberties, but want to exert so much control over businesses? Why do Republicans seek less controls for businesses, but try so hard to control our personal life decisions. Rand offers a third, libertarian point of view,of economic conservatism and social liberalism. I think these ideas are important and worth consideration.

The conclusion will be yours to draw. We can help you learn it, but not to accept it.\\"\\"This sight, the knowledge, and the acceptance, must be yours.\\"Ayn Rand from Atlas ShruggedAnd I couldn't agree more with Ayn Rand"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book in 1985, and found that it had an enormous influence on my thinking for a long time. As a result, I snapped up all her works that came to the Indian book shops. Ms. Ayn Rand was a staunch believer in individual freedom, and an enlightened capitalism. She opposed, in principle, that one man be expected to serve another, either through private charity or through enforced socialism. However, as I grew up, I found that this philosophy had a limited relevance to one's life.The novel, nevertheless, is extremely well-written and has a very unique plot. It traces the lives of individual entrepreneurs in the land of freedom, who are being held back by laws and people who want them to serve others instead. Ayn Rand uses the characters to make long, powerful, speeches about her philosophy. She also weaves this in very deftly with the lives of the heroes, and shows what can happen when we put creative, dynamic people in bondage. There is a pleasant, surprising ending, which affects you like a fresh dawnAs fiction, the book suffers from these long speeches. As a book on Ayn Rand's philosophy, the story helps us understand her philosophy better. Her skill is such that each is meaningless without the other. Therefore, if you just read the story, skipping the speeches, you will miss most of the flavour. And if you read some of her other works, without having read this novel, you will find it very difficult to visualise the implications of her complex arguments.While I am sort of glad today that I found a more, multi-faceted, multi-hued approach to life (than what Ms. Rand offered), I do envy you, if you haven't read this book so far. If you buy this book, you are sure to be in for a treat.And later, even if you move on, some of her philosophy will perhaps always remain with you. And you will find yourself to be richer for it.You may also find some of her other works interesting. I particularly recommend (The Fountainhead,Anthem, andThe Virtue of Selfishness."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is impossible to review Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged without critiquing the underlying philosophical principle of Objectivism. Now, before you misunderstand me, there are some principles of Objectivism I believe strongly in. Some people can be and are heroic figures. Facts do outweigh fantasy. Reason does trump faith and religion. I also agree with some of the sexual tenets of Objectivism. (As an aside, and to give her credit, Rand often gets a bad rap on homosexuality. Though she found their behavior personally disgusting she supported their ineluctable right to practice their lifestyle.) But even as far as the sexual elements go Rand is far too timid to bring the male-female dynamic to its inevitable conclusion re: Objectivism in Atlas Shrugged. She stands on the edge of the chasm, but she never has the courage to leap.But the novel really begins with Rand's mistaken conceit. She writes in the forward she believes she is doing something new, in a new way, through the publication of this novel. Uh, no. You see, Rand knows nothing about science fiction, and there are a lot of SFnal elements in Atlas Shrugged from the super-strong lightweight Rearden Metal to the eponymous science fiction motor that draws static electricity from the atmosphere and converts it to kinetic energy. No matter how she tries to spin it, presenting sharply drawn philosophical concepts in literary form is not \\"ground-breaking.\\" Ask Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley if you doubt my word.Atlas Shrugged is filled with heroic men, and women, who are always described as \\"severe,\\" \\"austere,\\" \\"hard,\\" or \\"lonely.\\" But what kind of people are they, really? Well, she says, they are human beings with free will. Rand believes every man has the potential to be good or evil. He must decide which he shall be and the decision will affect only him.This is where Rand shows the depth of her naivete. It is, in essence, a total repudiation not only of human history but of human emotion.But what kind of people are these heroic figures? They are by and large powerful industrialists who don't give a hoot about the public. Rand believed people like this were the pinnacle of humanity. But her slavish devotion to their unchecked power, her unabashed admiration of their \\"greed is good\\" philosophy does cause her to kneel (whether she wants to admit it or not, and despite the anti-spiritual principles of Objectivism) before an altar. The altar of the Dollar Sign.Rand also believed that altruism in all its forms was a sin. She would not have supported nor understood on any human fundamental level why Milton Hershey provided his employees with free medical care and paid off the mortgage of every church in town during the Depression. But is she aware that altruism also manifests itself in the action of a mother throwing her body in front of a bus to save her child? Rand does not think on this intimately human level. As one of her characters remarks in the novel, \\"The public be damned!\\"That means you and me. And whether Rand realizes it or not, it means her, too.There are other, more stupefying passages that in today's world seem not just old-fashioned but dangerously simplistic. In one passage the two lovers, Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggert, are driving through unblemished, untouched Nature. Rearden remarks, \\"What I'd like to see is a billboard.\\"Finally, on the last page of this 1200+ page novel, her eponymous hero, John Galt, draws a dollar sign in the air.Now, okay. There's nothing inherently wrong with any of this. But it goes on for 1200 pages! People sit around and tell each other what they already know, what they already believe, what they've already done and why they did it. Rand sets up strawmen so her heroes can knock them down. Again, nothing wrong. That's what these kind of philosophical novels do and if you approach it from that viewpoint then Atlas Shrugged works admirably.So how is the writing? Well, it's clunky at times, and at other times it's awkward. There's a lot of empty spaces being described and little humans who are dwarfed by towering skyscrapers or standing around in awe of huge roaring machines. But Rand is a complete marvel when it comes to delineating human gesture and movement. Her metier, despite the grand philosophical themes she plays with here, are the descriptive passages that hang with you. She paints with pinpoint precision, using words to emote truth and power about people, and that's a beauty -- and a pleasure -- to read.However, aside from all that? Well, aside from the preachiness and the naive (I would argue dangerously simplistic) way Rand views the world, the biggest flaw of the novel is its inability to uphold the suspension of disbelief. --And, no, I'm not talking about her motor that defies the Second Law of Thermodynamics, either.Remember, the CEOs and industrialists and powerful businessmen who look only upon profit as the single necessary human motive are her heroes. When laws and other governmental obstacles get in their way of making a profit they go into hiding to teach the world a lesson. To teach humanity that we can't get along without them.All right. To be fair to Rand this was written pre-Enron and pre-multi-million dollar gold parachute and 300-million dollar severance packages for CEOs. But, c'mon, get real. Do you really want to argue the world wouldn't have stood up and cheered if Ken Lay was taken out in shackles? Is Rand so jaw-dropping naive she thinks the world would really stop spinning on its axis if every executive who lives for nothing but profit were to go into hiding? To teach us a lesson?Again, I must stress this, Rand sets up her heroes to be a different kind of men than money-grubbing soul-destroying monsters. Except, when everything is all said and done, they're not. One of her Oil Executives sets fire to his wells before going into hiding, leaving behind a note saying the public can have them back the way he found them. But he didn't find these oil wells on fire. He did that out of a sense of pique, like a spoiled brat. And it's really difficult, no matter what your political or social demographic, to get past the \\"damn the public, love the dollar\\" philosophy that runs rampant throughout this novel.So. Having said all that. Should you read Atlas Shrugged?Yes. Absolutely. And here's why. Despite being flawed this is an important novel. There are themes which do resonate, like the theme of standing up for yourself and for what you believe in. Like the fact reason is more important than the unsupportable nonsense of religion. Like the fact science is more grounded in reality than faith.Atlas Shrugged is a strange, at times unbelievable, novel. It's one of those books I'm not necessarily happy to have read, but it was necessary to read. I guess it's hard to explain. I can neither recommend nor dismiss this work of art (and it is art, no question) created by Ayn Rand.You, like everyone else, will simply have to read the novel and make your own judgment. In the end, that's what Rand want us to do anyway with every aspect of our life. And within that very narrow framework she succeeds admirably in getting that sense of dignity across in Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read this about a decade ago. Coming from a persistently anti-intellectual rural American public school, I absolutely loved it. At last, something that validated excellence and reason and thought! Even at the time I recognized that the characters were wooden and I thought her economic theory was oversimplified, but those seemed to me minor flaws next to a philosophy that gave me justification in being smart and using reason rather than emotion. I'd venture to guess that something like this is the root of Rand's ideas among adolescents, especially since teenagers haven't really necessarily lived enough to experience the limits of that philosophy when you try to live it.So, yeah, I loved the book. It really did change my life at a time I needed that justification. And it's clearly affected a lot of people quite strongly, not just me.But I just tried reading it again and could hardly get through it a second time. The flaws I dismissed as minor before now seem overwhelming. For one thing, her economic and political theory is completely inapplicable to the real world, in which political and business leaders (to make the most profit) would be rationally best served by completely screwing over their workers and 95% of people on earth. I've spent a fair amount of time in some of the poorest countries in the world, and the unadulterated capitalism you see trying to grow there is much more in line with Rand's philosophies than the guided and regulated capitalism that serves us so well in America (or even to some extent in Europe). Her philosophy was obviously formed by her past growing up in Russia, but though there are some obvious flaws with extreme communism, it does not at all follow logically that the other extreme is the best alternative.From a more literary perspective, her characters are uncompelling and unbelievable -- not just in their ability (you expect that in some novels, and part of the point is that they're geniuses) -- but in their utter certainty about everything and their utter *sameness* to each other. In my experience, one of the marks of independent thought and rational thinking is when you see people disagree, but that certainly doesn't happen among any of her heroes except when they misunderstood each other. It would have been a far, far more interesting book if the characters had had more depth and questioning and sense of being torn between different values, the way real people are.That said, the book still has a very interesting premise. And while lots of the writing (especially the monologues) is clunky and wooden, some of it (particularly the descriptions of the cities and the mills and the railroads) is quite evocative. The sex and the relationships are cringe-inducing, but I quite enjoyed some of the microscopic interactions, particularly those involving Francisco - one of the more interesting of a set of fairly uninteresting characters.And, really, it should be read, for a similar reason that I think the Bible and the Quran (and, heck, even the Left Behind series and the Lord of the Rings) should be read. Believe it or not, like it or not, it's formed the basis of a lot of people's thinking on an array of issues that are very relevant to the world we live in."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I love this book.

But what it has the potential to do, if you let it, is to take those things about you which are valuable and worthy and show you their beauty. It will empower you.

Here are my thoughts:The good: Though VERY long, this book is a page turner. The characters Rand introduces to us are rich (no pun intended) and well thought out. We come to feel greatly for several of them, even those who are not introduced until later in the book. Rand makes the case for her economic and cultural philosophy through parable, which in my opinion is the best way to reach the masses. The story is clearly meant for discussion and Rand makes her point clearly.The not so good: As mentioned above, the book is long. The same story could have been presented in maybe half the pages. The speech toward the end which takes up 60 pages is too verbose and could have been said in maybe 10 pages or even less. I found myself scanning through this part. I would have preferred some of the \\"villains\\" in the story to be less of a caricature of the socialist tendencies in our society, though it may have been necessary for them to be this way for the book to be as satirical as it is. Somewhere around the middle of the book, the story strays from the realistic to the realm of science fiction. I found myself liking the first half better.In short, this is a book everyone should read, even if for the entertainment value. I don't agree 100% with all of Rand's \\"Objectivism\\" philosophy, most notably on the concept of charitable giving, but as an economic screed there is quite a bit of wisdom in it. There are some important lessons to learn from Atlas Shrugged and the world would be a better place if we learned them."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The appearance and physical quality of the book is wonderful.

I guess I must be an exception then, because I neither loved nor hated it.This book does have a philosophical message, and it is obvious that the book wasn't written just for entertainment or literary reasons. So how do you judge a fiction book like this? Do you judge it based on if you like or agree with the philosophy espoused in the book, or do you judge it by the literary value of the writing regardless of the philosophical message? I guess, a review of this book should have at least some critique of both.I don't consider myself an Objectivist, and actually HAVE read most of Ayn Rand's and Leanord Peikoff's writings (unlike most people who aren't Objectivists yet attack Objectivist thought). The philosophy behind this book is a simple one; it basically is a story that tells a tale of why a laisezz-faire, free-market capitalist society is the best and most moral of all systems. Also, this book can be viewed as a critique of socialist and communist systems. Because this is a fiction book, you shouldn't expect to see too comprehensive an argument for the philosophy Rand advocates. Therefore, I think it might be a little too wrong of someone to attack this book JUST because they didn't agree with Rand's philosophy.Ayn Rand's philosophical writings are famous for painting obvious exaggerations of arguments she doesn't agree with, and then quickly dismissing these arguments with such little care that one wonders if Rand is actually being serious, or just playing a joke on her readers (this is the philosopher who openly attacks John Rawls (Theory of Justice) with some of the most emotionally based arguments you'll ever read by a philosopher, and doing so while admitting that she never read the book she is critiquing of his, nor does she ever plan to). Atlas Shrugged's characters follow in typical Randian fashion; they are exaggerations of exaggerations of what we usually call 'humanitarians'. These 'humanitarians' are those people that tell us we should all sacrifice for the common good. They are altruists that believe that a person is being moral when they give up something of their liking to help someone else. Some of the things uttered by some of the 'bad guys' in this book are so off the wall that no rational person could ever believe they are actually the mind or thoughts of any important thinkers of our time (yet you can tell Rand hopes you think that they are). For example, one of the 'bad guys' of the book actually advocates that no new scientific/technological advances should be allowed to occur because they would upset the current order of the system, and give one man (the one with the new tech.) an unfair advantage when competing with the rest of the people in his field. So, if I were to judge Atlas Shrugged on its philosophy, I'd have to say that it is a very poor book. You can't learn much about a certain ideology without the author giving SERIOUS arguments from the other side, and then giving thoughtful critiques of those arguments. Rand presents a straw man argument of her opponents so that her ideology looks like the most wonderful think man has ever thought up when compared to the ideologies of the 'bad guys' in the book. It annoys me when I see writers doing this, and I find that to be the work of a weak thinker.Now, let me review this book based on its literary value:I am not one of those people that likes plot lines that deal with the archetypal 'bad guys always wear black, good guys always wear white'. I find it boring to read books that reiterate the same obvious struggle btw good and evil, and where it is all too obvious what is good, and what is evil. I don't think reality is really like this (though I'm sure most of the Objectivists will disagree with me here), and it doesn't appeal to me when reading stories that are shaped in this fashion. Atlas Shrugged is shaped in this very fashion, so this is probably the main reason why I didn't like it. I tend to like plots that make you think a little more when dealing with the good and evil elements in society.I also don't like books that have the characters of the book representing ideals, instead of them being like real-life people. The characters in Atlass Shrugged are obviously exaggerations, and when reading this book, they really didn't come off as being real people to me. They seemed so fake, and flat. I like stories where the characters are more real and dynamic.So, why give this book 3 stars instead of 1?Because it is an interesting story. It is truly unique. and THAT, I like. Plus, even though I attacked the presentation of Rand's philosophy in Atlass Shrugged, and admitted I'm not an Objectivist (Rand's philosophy), I still think that this book has some important messages to it. Some of the arguments presented by the 'bad guys' of this book I HAVE seen presented by many of the talking heads on TV and heard them slipped into many political discussions. I am against the idea that the means of production should rest with the workers, and I felt that Rand did a pretty good job attacking this idea. Also, I do consider myself an advocate of capitalism, and though I am not for the laisezz-faire capitalism that Rand advocates, I still find this book to be a good defense of capitalism, and a decent explanation of just what the hell capitalism is (since it seems that many people are clueless as to just what it is). If you want to know anything about capitalism, this is a perfect book to read because you'll the basic ideas of capitalism without having to read some dry academic text."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A lot of reviewers are telling you not to read this book because its themes are &quot;obvious to anyone,&quot; and that the only point is that &quot;government is bad.&quot; Niether of these points are true.

Just imagine reading a thought provoking Tom Clancy without missles.I say the book is thought provoking not because it will necessarily give you new ideas to ponder, but will touch on topics and ideas you have been thinking about all yor life and bring them together into a nice coherent set of thoughts.Finally, if you're reading this, it means you're thinkging about reading the book and will probably end up reading it no matter what I or the others say. I just wrote this because I was upset at how the people who panned this novel can complain about reading the whole thing and still not understand how significant a book this is. Despite the huge scope of the book, its ideas are presented in a form that could be eaasily understood by most high school age kids and probably man junior high kids, so don't feel that this will be a boring and confusing work becasue it is not. It is also not childish literature, but suitable for readers of all age to enjoy. This book WILL positively affect your life, unless all you do is skim the back cover like all those poor saps who gave this less than five stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A hundred years from now people will still be talking and writing about Ayn Rand's work. It will be a measuring stick against which other works will be compared. If you wish to know the modern Prometheus - it is here, in these pages. Rest assured Rand was no communist. Anyone who would claim such is an ignorant fool. Nor was she devoid of qualities that would make her less than human - being human, being a rational, thinking, living human was the concern. Assuming you are capable of such use of your mind - the moment that you read this you will understand. And John Galt will be nothing to fear."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The most influential book, and the most important book that I have ever read. It gave life to the ideas that will save the world."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is far and away the best book I have ever read. It changed my life and it will change yours when you buy it. Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism is brilliant in its own right, but the way she is able to weave, construct, illustrate, and prove it through Atlas Shrugged, while simultaneously creating an extremely entertaining novel is truly miraculous. This novel challenges the fundamental flaws in the way people have been trained to think. I buy this book for everyone I meet. After you read it, you will too."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has been named the second most influential book in the US by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month club.Yet a large number of reviewers blast it. How come?It's simple. If you identify with the heroes, John Galt, Hank Rearden, Dagny Taggart, and Francisco D'Anconia, you will love the book, because it agrees with your idea of morality, and your sense of life. If you like your thoughts clear and focused, and think that a concept must be consistent with itself to the root, you will love this piece of work.If you think the heroes are insensitive, evil egoists, with no appreciation for art, or for other people's needs, then you may identify more with Dagny's brother and his friends. (On the other hand, I don't think anybody could be that evil)If your philosophy of life agrees more with a subjective sense of good and evil; if you think that the limits between good and evil are fuzzy, and that sacrifice is the leading value in life, you will hate this book, and blast its author.After reading this book, I realized that this work is a test of moral character. (Within reason). If you like this book, you are probably a self driven, self motivated person, who holds his own values above everything else. You are self assured and derive your self esteem from your own perception of yourself. If you hate this book, you thrive on relationships, you are sensitive to other's perception of yourself, and seek to influence others. Your self esteem also derives from how you are perceived.I gave the book five stars, because I can't give it six.Enough said."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read this book when I was 23 yrs of age, and I'm 41 now. It made a huge impact on how I've lived my life, and like other reviewers, I revisit this book each year or two to gain inspiration, and confidence that I'm doing okay.How scarey is it that so many of the looters and moochers attitudes and spiels are now being reported on in society. How comforting is it that I KNOW that I am capable of existing without any help from any person. How comfortable is it to be serene in life, knowing that I take full responsibility for my every action and word ( and in doing so have had incredible rewards for that), and give nothing unearned to anyone, ESPECIALLY to those who say the world owes them a living! or a benefit, or a stipend of some description.I work in a large organisation, and watch in fascination the basics of Atlas Shrugged's story taking place around me every day which serves to entrench my adoration of this book even further.I give thanks that I met this book, and that I have had it's solace and benefits to accompany me through the last 18 years. I am about to order my third copy, as I've worn out the last two.I recommend this book to everyone, and, whilst the monologues are sometimes hard to concentrate on, you should take them slowly, and not be too impatient to move on. There are lessons that everyone can use here, and, even if you don't get them the first time, you will increase your appreciation and understanding as you revisit with these characters again &amp; again.Do yourself a huge favour, and take this book and it's message on board, at the very least, learn to depend on no man but yourself, and learn to take pride that no matter how humble your efforts may be, if they are not ransomed at someone else's expense, then you are truly a winner."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read this book over and over and have to say I agree with many of the thing Ayn Rand is trying to say. If you're one of those people who is very religous and firmly believes everyone is equal, I'd have to say this book is definitely not for you. I'm amazed that the author can prove her point so well, for I've read books by many who don't. It's almost impossible to disagree after you've read this. I've decided that the reason I love this book so much is because it gave me something to believe in. Because I know what Dagny feels like when she discovered the nature of the world! I think the people who would enjoy this book most are those who, like me, can't imagine why anyone would WANT to be normal! For all my 13 year life, people have teased me about how I'm &quot;too smart&quot; and always try (imagine that!) to stick out. The scariest thing in the world for me is the thought that I might become normal like everyone else. A lot of people who read this propably think I'm nuts, but I don't really care what they think. If you're one of them, this book is NOT for you. But if you know exactly what I'm talking about, read it! You'll love it like I did!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It is a tribute to the power and influence of this book that it has generated so many reviews - and that the reviews look like a particularly vicious USENet thread. This is not to say that the nastiness becomes the book, but it points eloquently to the book's importance.There are perhaps five books I feel compelled to read again and again, every couple of years regardless of whatever else I'm doing. Atlas Shrugged is one such book. Reading it never fails to remind me of the potency of a single individual - in that way it's better than any drug. Further, detractors aside, there's something new in it every time. As each phase of my life passes on to the next, the themes explored in the book gain new relevance and poignancy.Granted the book is too long. Rand's chief fault as a novelist is that she often goes on making her case long after the point is clear. But this amounts to a quibble beside the sheer magnificence of the epic she's constructed.Whether or likes Rand or not one cannot ignore her, as the review thread makes clear. Her admirers need no persuasion - but her detractors must find a way to get 'round what she has to say. It's a pity most choose merely to hurl insults instead of engaging the text. Perhaps it strikes to close to home. It certainly does for me: One of the reasons I keep re-reading it is to improve my ability to live up to it, a difficult task indeed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK THAT IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY AND WHERE THIS COUNTRY IS HEADED! A LONG READ, BUT ONE WHICH IS HARD TO PUT DOWN. THE FACT MS RAND COULD BE SO RELEVANT IN TODAY'S WORLD IS FRIGHTENING BUT SHOULD BE A WAKE-UP CALL!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"STOP! This is a novel with a bad plot, bad writing, horrible dialogue/monologue, and the hero gets the girl (who just happens to Rand's written self-portrait. I've seen better conceived soap-operas. Her heroes are stereotypes of how she saw herself and her loves . . . Greek gods and goddesses, perfect in thought, beyond intelligent, and a market capatilist's dream. Her antagonists are caricatures of inept, small-minded, lazy, and physically unattractive. This is a comic universe with poorly drawn comics. She should've let Marvel run with this story. I give her 2-stars because I'll give her credit for using a novel to give voice to her philosophy. Her philosophy, though, is misguided as it's a reaction to communism and her poor concept of Christianity. She also uses her philosophy as a blunt instrument. She bludgeons the reader with it, hitting the reader over-and-over-and-over. 60 pages for one monologue?? And then to claim she lived her life entirely by her philosophy is beyond arrogant. Read a bio on her and you'll realize she didn't even come close to living by her own philosophy."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First read this when I was 17, before liberal academia could corrupt me. 52 now, and I still go back and re-read portions as I do with one other book: The Bible. While Objectivism may be able to stand without God, haven \\"gotten it\\" (the message of The Bible) at age 35, I've not been able to reconcile why Rand excluded western civilization religious morale code from Atlas Shrugged as it seems foundational to the arguement. But almost inarguably, the morale code of this book is the Constitution, and one could argue the Constitution is built on the religous morale code of western civilization. A terrific book that has held a center position on my bookshelf for 39 years."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book has influenced me far beyond my expectations. It is one of those timeless works which can change your whole perspective on life. It is wonderfully written, too, with an engaging story which made 1200 pages seem to fly by in all-too-fleeting an instant. You MUST purchase this novel, it is essential for, well, anyone!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've read a bunch of bad reviews on this book, and I don't think any of them actually read the book. They just want to take a stab at her beliefs. I even read that the characters are completely one-dimensional. Not even close. It's an excellent book, one that will probably leave you mor einterested in Rand's other stuff too. A lot of the other reviews mention corporations and their &quot;inherent evil,&quot; and it is as if the individual working in the corporation does not exist. This book shows that the individual does exist, and is the primary concern. We don't blame white america for John Gacy, why blame corporate america for kenneth lay? The only thng I did not like about this is that it is loooong. Some of the parts seem irrelevant too, but it isn't a sleeper by any means."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It appears that the proper way to review this book is to first evaluate one's own opnions on objectivism/libertarianism. If you agree with Rand, then it's the greatest book ever. If you disagree, it's not worth the (many) pages it's printed on.Unfortunately, there's too little assessment of the book as a novel. Personally, I feel that objecto-libertarianism is a political philosophy that is as likely to succeed as Marxism because it attempts to reduce everything in the world to simple economic terms while relying too heavily on a specific characteristic of mankind (altrisum for Marxism, selfishness for Randism). That, admittedly will color my assessment of the book.So, take a grain of salt with my opinion. At least, I'm up front about that.This book is pretty bad.There's the cardboard characters, for one. The bad guys are all ugly and they even have names that sound like they're losers. (Wesley Mouch? Come on.) All the arch-capitalists are attractive superhumans, everyone else deserves to die. There's the crazy sci-fi aspect, which I won't reveal in case you actually care who John Galt is, but the idea that the ubercapitalists remain undetected and prosperous due to their supercool technology is too farfetched for my tastes. And, of course, there's the lengthy philosophical screed. Much has been written about that before.One would think that there are far more subtle ways to sway one to a certain point of view, but I'm just not convinced that Rand has that level of literary talent. The plot is very engaging when the paper-thin villians and obvious holes are ignored (why are all these arch-capitalists so chummy anyway?) which is why it merits two stars. But overall, it's just not that good of a book. Of course, how could I understand? I don't agree with Rand, so therefore I'm just not at that intellectual level."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"So, for 20 years, I postponed reading the grand manifesto and cult classic known as \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" written by author and Objectivism pioneer, Ayn Rand.I'm sure many sensible people would detest communism had they lived through the Bolshevik Revolution, along with its aftermath. However, coming to America and projecting her hatred toward communism by promoting unfettered capitalism is just plain twisted. In \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" one of Rand's fiction works, characters are outcasts who challenge society and march to the beat of their own drums. Yet, I did not find Rand's characters inspiring, compelling or better yet - believable.At the risk of exposing a little of my contrariety, I should mention that I grew up idolizing the band Rush - a group whose lyrics and themes were inspired by Ayn Rand on a handful of their early albums. Rush's drummer/lyricist/author Neil Peart - whose books I still read today, is largely responsible for Rush's adaptation and expression of Rand's philosophy. In my teens, I didn't really understand the complete message that Rush was conveying on Rand-influenced albums such as \\"2112\\" and \\"Hemispheres.\\" I gleaned the rebellious sentiment from these albums, but failed to recognize any connection with Ayn Rand or libertarianism. I'm glad it worked out that way because I loved (and still do) their music. And to be fair, Peart has backed off from the libertarian dogma, and has distanced himself from Rand over the years.While working for the government and facing layoffs during an economic crisis, I found myself at odds with a handful of coworker friends who supported libertarian philosophies. Not surprisingly, the same co-workers denounced the union. While we shared a common thread of being Rush fans, we were on opposite sides when it came to crucial labor issues. The libertarian contingent did not want to give up a minute fraction of their salaries or benefits, which would have saved the jobs of many hardworking business and I.T. people. They also failed to recognize that the union had fought long and hard over the past two decades to procure their generous benefits and salaries. Because of tenure, a bunch of us were safe from layoffs, yet the libertarian contingent voted in favor of the layoffs. In debates, they would actually quote Ayn Rand. Yet, in 2011, they sounded more like Marie Antoinette - just before the French Revolution.Back to the book. Needlessly long - especially for me, considering I didn't buy into the plot from the get-go. Maybe I would have appreciated this book back in college when it was first pressed on me. However, having just lived through the Great Recession, I didn't find myself on board with two capitalists saving the world's economy in the face of an oppressive American government, when in fact, so far during the 21st and 20th centuries, one could argue that it's really been the other way around! I was absolutely amazed at one strange excerpt (forgive me for forgetting the page & chapter) in which all passengers on a train are killed by gaseous fumes. Rand points to the passengers' altruistic professions and tendencies as reasons why they deserved to die.On a more positive note, I'll concede that I found the characters Dagny Taggart and John Galt to be somewhat intriguing through parts of this long read. Still, I'd argue that the most interesting and borderline magnetic character is Dagny's shadowy brother, James Taggart. While I appreciated a few Randian characters, and found no fault with Rand's writing, which was just strong enough to keep me reading (considered bailing during 2nd half of book) through the 1000+ page journey, I simply never really liked the broader picture she painted in \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" And I can see why 'Atlas' made its mark as a controversial novel, but I still can't see why so many find this long story all that interesting."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I think the best advertisement for Atlas Shrugged would be simply \\"if you feel like everyone around you is crazy, read this book, it WILL explain it.\\" I wish I'd read it sooner and if it had been promoted to me on that basis I would have.i never could reach a conclusion on whether people are \\"basically good\\" or not but after reading this book I firmly believe man's rational capacity ensures moral fortitude unless it falls prey to the corruptive anti-rational practices of society, which it seems unfortunately everyone does to some extent because we're so often put into situations that require it, being taught from childhood to unquestioningly obey authority and follow rules, with fear used as motivation.\\"It is not your obedience that we seek to win, but your rational conviction\\" pg 674. Wouldn't the world be a much better place if everyone operated by that principle?the book is evenly divided into a great first half and a terrible second half though. i highly recommend reading the first 600ish pages, but even more highly recommend putting the book down at that point.the most significant blemish on the first half of the book is Dagny's penchant for ridiculing the misguided characters with derisive laughter.the third quarter is just mind-numbingly dull. no new concepts and no plot progress. it's impossible to sympathize with Dagny's difficulty to commit to staying in the \\"Atlantis\\" and annoying to have to trudge through page after page of repetitive arguments on why she should stay. it's like it's been identified as the right choice 100 pages ago so just have her make the decision already, gawd.and the last quarter reads like it was written in a fit of rage. Rand must use the word \\"evil\\" like 100 times and talks about the righteous characters understanding what makes a man want to kill."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"When one judges a book of this nature, one has to realize the impact that the ideas imprints on one's mind. How lasting? How relevant 50 years later? How thought provoking? Are values challenged? Are you changed after reading? This book exceeds in all of these areas, with accessible styling, and believable examples that are explicitly detailed in her novel.The story occurs something in the 20th century America set in a parallel universe where the history of the world reflects a diversion from our history occurring sometime after American was formed. Perhaps one major event occurred such as Germany winning WWI, or a great communist revolution swept the world. Anyhow, the end result is a race to equality is allowed to proceed by the ones in charge, and what happens when the producers of the mind decide to remove there efforts, all brought about by a secret incident that occurred in a small town in Wisconsin. The story follows important industrialists, politicians, media, common folk, in fact, an entire nation's actions and how they can all interrelate and unknowingly greatly affect one-another. This is a novel about a quest, values, morality, truth, economics, sex, motivation, evil, utopia, philosophy etc. As a reader in a voyeuristic sense gets to imagine an alternative world and what happens to the characters in detail when they get what they ask for.The biggest complaint is that the work is very verbose. It could take one 100-500 pages before really becoming involved with the story as long speeches are commonplace.Agree or disagree you will be challenged on many levels and forced to comfort issues in your life on a much deeper level. You will be forced to use reason to your limits to work through the issues presented, which in the end all Rand asks you to do. Right or wrong, mission accomplished 5 stars."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In case no one has noticed, Ayn Rand didn't write this book to tell a beautiful story, to develop likeable, well-rounded characters, or to create an accurate depiction of America.She wrote this book as a vehicle for her political, economic, and social philosophies.I'll admit, the first hundred pages are unbearably boring...but around the 250th page, you WILL be sucked in. There's a reason this book is a best seller. There's a reason it's the most influential novel of all time. Because it's amazing, and it will change your life, if you let it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I found Atlas Shrugged a thoroughly egaging and enjoyable, though somewhat disturbing book. I thought it is well paced and well written however, I assign it no more significance than a well written soap opera. Ms. Rand would have us believe that it is a commendable act to, like Nero, sit back while Rome burns and all the while pat youself on the back for doing so. Ms. Rand's hero is none other than John Gault, a man with a Messianic complex so towering that, I find it laughable that anyone could take seriously the ramblings given him by the author. He seems to revel in the fact that the fictional world Ms. Rand has envisioned will collapse without the miracle working capabilities of him, his deciples, and his own Mary Magdalin in the form of Miss Dagney Taggert. Ms. Rand's heroes are void of any compassion for anyone save themselves; it is unfortunate that the author apparently wishes the real world were like the one she created In Atlas Shrugged. If anything, Ms. Rand's philosophy is better catagorized as &quot;egoism&quot;, nothing less and certainly nothing more. To give the book anymore importance than just a great read is a mistake."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First time since I owned the Kindles (years) that I have to go to the library.

Of course this is only speculative, but I didn't find her previous writings to be of such a deep-vained negative nature. Hey, we are only human; brilliantly talented philosophers included. Overall, I still believe that she was one of the most important authors of this century and it's worth reading her works."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Wow. What utter, utter rubbish. I honestly tried to finish this book but after 250 pages I could take no more, it is staggeringly bad.I picked it up without knowing too much about it or about Ayn Rand, but I had heard it mentioned by several sources as a highly influential book. Good grief. The book is full of ham fisted allegory, clumsy metaphor, and completely unsympathetic characters. The heroes and villians are ridiculous one dimensional cut outs that Rand bandies about to explain her overly simplistic philosophy with all the subtlety of a diesel train crashing into an ore refinery. Mercy. The prose is dire, and the dialogue appalling - If I had to endure one more 'mocking grin' I could have killed someone. Her heroes are sociopathic rapists, and her villians are fat, useless, lazy freeloaders. At least in that respect, she succeeds - I couldn't stand James Taggart and his cronies. Unfortunately, I positively loathed Hank Rearden, Dagny Taggart, Ellis Wyatt, and Francisco d'Anconio, who I suspect I was supposed to view as noble, oppressed heroes. Instead they come across as selfish, soulless, emotionally reppressed monsters. I realise that these are all virtuous qualities in Rand's individualist, capitalist utopia, but if the model objectivist is essentially a sociopath, then thanks, but no thanks, I brought some squash cos I find kool-aid a bit sweet.After 250 pages I didn't care who John Galt was, I just wanted the ordeal to be over. I give it one star, partly because the story was vaguely engaging at times, but mostly because I can't give it a rating of zero."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I don't get it - if Anne Rant wanted people to buy her &quot;philosophy&quot; of irrational selfishism, why didn't she give it a more marketable title than objectionablism?

Isn't this racism? And what about the cold and scornful persona we associate with such racism? We find it here in this book. This book is a perfect reflection of the character of this so-called chosen race.Who composed this book? People forget Alan Greenspan had his hand in it.What does the book say? It's theme is about the rich robbing the poor and giving to the rich. And it is coldly atheistic. It glorifies the so-called rational man who covets only his own self-interest.Rich industrialists are praised for their ruthless determination, especially when it jeopardizes the livlihood of someone else. It is the equivalent of an LA gang member being praised and glorified for murdering innocent people. Greenspan and Rand praise and glorify those who destroy the microeconomy of the working man. This book is an indictment of the \\"chosen people.\\" It makes me especially ill when Rand or Greenspan made statements bemoaning the holocaust while they praise the rich industrialist who destroys other races.This book reflects the mentality today of those \\"chosen people\\" who arbitrarily increase our economic burden by getting us into wars that only benefit them. We borrow money from them to pay for the war and give money to Israel and the American taxpayer is left paying the interest on that borrowed money (hence, the national debt). They increase taxes, utility prices (heats, lights and gas), increase oil prices, and the encourage the federal government to pay farmers to not grow crops and to throw out milk so that they can keep the food prices up. Lou Dobbs is almost correct when he says that our own government is actively promoting a war against the interest of the American people. However, he leaves out the key players, the jews."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is one of the most vile, uninteresting books you'll ever read. There wasn't one likeable character in the book! And that is saying a lot, considering it is a huge bricks of lumber. Seriously, was this woman kidding when she wrote these? Absolute garbage. There is no warmth or humour or real emotion throughout. Very robotic and mechanical in its knowledge of humanity. And so people say it is a philosophy. Her philosophy of \\"selfishness as a virtue\\" or so-called \\"Objectivism\\" is not grounded in reality. Perhaps it is for the disillusioned Republicans or Captialists. You get an image of some smug capitalistic egoist saying to themselves after reading these, \\"see, I can do anything I want because it is human nature to do so..and the world is better off because of it\\". Reaganites, Bush2, Thatcherites, Tom Delay and those type of thinkers (note- the story of Enron comes to mind). We now know that Karl Marx's philosophy was very flawed in its realization. Yet we fail to realize that Adam Smith's philosophy was also flawed. There is no 'Invisible Hand'. Nor can there ever be. We do not live in a vacuum. Yet Ayn Rand thinks we do.Another thing. Perhaps most important and above everything else when you are looking for a book, whether you are reading the book, or have completed a book you might wonder is this authour likeable or not. And for that one simple thing, this book is dead last on my list of books I've read. This is the coldest, elitist, most self-centred, boring, and unrealistic authour I've ever read. Bar none.sidenote - I guarantee she has never been to Cheyenne, Wyoming.sidenote2- I would have given it a zero star rating but the computer wouldn't accept it. Therefore I had to give it a 1.

This book may be the most simplistic take on humanity ever written and thus does appeal to the masses as \\"philosophy\\". Utter garbage, but it is the tome that many doomsday right wingers are quoting so it is worth reading to understand their paranoia.Do everyone a favor, go read Adam Smith if you really want an education on capitalism. Mr. Smith would probably laugh at Rand's foolish take on his ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Begging the pardon of Miss Dagny Taggart, but - railroad magnate or no - she is quite incorrect.Miss Rand did indeed believe in a 'higher power'. More precisely, she believed in two of them: the 'benevolent universe' ('existence', the 'facts of reality') and the human being (including and especially herself).In her attempted rejection of G-d she merely parcelled out the Divine attributes between these two 'higher powers' (for example, 'existence' is eternal, and 'man' is self-creating). I object to the foundations of her 'philosophy' not because she failed to believe in any 'higher power' but because she believed in the wrong one(s).Miss Taggart's own Member Page includes the following remark: 'My whole life is a contradiction'. Indeed, so was Miss Rand's - though I hardly think she would approve of her ATLAS SHRUGGED protagonist's namesake thus acquiescing to irrationality!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not an easy book to review. There are multiple aspects to review--the first is whether or not you agree with the message. The second is the quality of the story and writing.For the most part, I was already a believer in the same school of thought Rand teaches in this book. Whether it is practical to the degree outlined in the book is irrelevant. It is easier to teach extremes, and even if those are not practical, doesn't mean the theory is not valuable. That said, you do not need to agree to get value from the book. In fact, everyone who wants informed opinions on politics, economics, and philosophy, must add this to their reading list.On the one hand, this book is a work of art. Rand has articulated a complex message better than I've ever heard before. The depth of thinking into various human psyches is incredible. In this book, Rand has demonstrated she understands human behavior and can articulate it to a degree few, if anyone else has.What I found most interesting in this book were all the characters and their unique motivations behind their choices. It is impossible to read this and not identify with and recognize most of the characters. The characters who are portrayed as the \\"bad guys\\" are so dead on accurate. If you read this and do not agree, you are young, naive, or have never been around government or large bureaucratic organizations. This book will help you understand the many complex driving forces behind irrational decisions people make. If you like the study of human behavior, you will enjoy this book.Now for the novel. Rand did a decent job using story to teach, however, it could have been better. The story is fairly interesting and will keep a motivated reader moving forward. That said, there were so many characters with limited depth that it was hard to keep them straight. I was not clear until almost the end who was the main character and what was the primary conflict she was trying to overcome. There were so many characters and so many issues that it was hard to care enough about any one to keep you going.This is a very important book, but unfortunately, most wont read it because of it's size. The same message could have been said with far fewer words and it would reached larger audience. The story was incredibly repetitive especially with many of the characters' long winded speeches that keep repeating same thing in different ways. If the book had been edited much tighter the book would have received 5 stars. An abridge version would be worth considering.Even with the minor criticism of the novel, this is an important book that any informed person should read. If you haven't read it, you opinion on government and economics is severely lacking ."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is as eye-opening a read today as it was 50 years ago. While the book may seem daunting in its sheer size and weight, once you are engaged in the story, you will wish the book was even longer. What's impressive about the novel is that Ayn Rand successfully paints a portrait of what the world will be like if certain policies are followed. By depicting the results of an attack on capitalism scene by scene, the reader can comprehend the logic and truth of her words and ideas. The parallels to today's world are frightening as the truth rings loud and clear. Atlas Shrugged inspired me to change my life when I read it in my early twenties and its message is just as powerful today. I heartily recommend this book to college students, college graduates, and those wishing to understand why capitalism benefits man and the American dream. Rand debunks the notion that success is evil. You will never think the same about your world or your beliefs. Take a chance and read this book. Persevere past the first 50 to 100 pages which can go slow as Rand creates the necessary backstory for the novel. Once you get caught up in the story, you will not be able to put it down. Rand is a master at characterization and plotting and is a philosopher as well. Get ready to think as she will challenge many beliefs you may hold dear. You might enjoy reading The Fountainhead as well or some of the biographies about Ayn Rand such as the one by Nathaniel Brandon."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand is a superb writer with amazing talent. Unfortunately she belabors her point, again and again and again. She could have covered the same in four hundred pages rather than eleven hundred pages."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is my first re-read in 20 years. I love the introduction piece that gave insights into Ayn Rand's philosophy of writing and her explanation of why she used fiction to colorize, give depth and a real life feel into a fundamental philosophy that could be codified in a more traditional text book form. I have several other works of Ayn Rand. One of those is not \\"of her\\", but more truly about her. It is a collection of her letters.Many liberals today will confess that they've read or are familiar with Rand's work and her philosophy. They invariably give away their position when they add comments and clarifications about having some degree of knowledge. Usually they add that they read \\"it\\" in college with the clear inference that it was in their immature years and therefore an immature work only worthy of immature thinking. They also frequently comment about the length of Atlas Shrugged being completely unnecessary. When you think in sound bites, that fits. There are other negative comments that vary, but the one that never does is the one about how the \\"selfish\\" worshiping of self is the biggest evil in Rand's works. As members of the \\"collective\\" themselves, the BORG liberal/progressive mind seems to feel obligated to point out the \\"self\\" or \\"individual\\" focus as being at the root of the Rand wrong. They missed the point entirely.These confessions of the liberal mind are telling and so much a reflection of what Ayn Rand's points were all about. I have heard it said that Atlas Shrugged is the most widely read work, other than the Bible, of any written story on the planet. I have not taken the time to substantiate this assertion as fact, but I find it believable. Having it on my Kindle is incredible. This re-read has reopened my mind to just how great a story teller Rand was. Her imagery is next to none. Her characters are rich although somewhat exaggerated for literary reasons consistent with the purpose of the book.Lastly, the only reason for not giving the book on Kindle a 5 star instead of a 4.5 star is that the audio feature on this version is very mechanical sounding. The assumption I am making is that the computerized text to voice is both cheaper to do and much more economical in terms of space needed to store the entire book. I listened to several chapters while driving from Salina, Kansas back to Colorado where I live in retirement. The flow and the pronunciation problems in the mechanized translation to voice is problematic. Other than that one issue, this would have been a 5 star rating.an Ayn Rand FAN for life,Ron"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I first read Atlas Shrugged in college and was impressed then with Ayn Rand's view of the destructive potential of social policies taken to extremes. Over forty years later on a Kindle instead of a huge paperback, this book still has a powerful impact.Since her own family was victimized by Russian Communism, she had a justifiable fear of government grabbing power from people in the name of social welfare. In Atlas Shrugged she creates a divided America where, for her \\"heroes\\", neither marriage nor family is as important as integrity and excellence in one's profession, but for her villains, greed, envy, manipulation, and power hunger drive all their actions. Rand creates enemies to her beliefs who are seemingly incapable of understanding their self-destructive behavior will have consequences. Considering the extremes that the characters run to, it's a relief to believe that Dagny, Franscisco, Hank, and of course John Gault have the sense to \\"throw in the towel\\" and head for the mountains.I thoroughly enjoyed the love stories, as idealized as they are, and salute Rand for making Dagny the protagonist. Wisely, Rand does not provide children to the dysfunctional marriages, so the partners are torturing only other adults.The 4 instead of 5 star rating is because of the sixty pages of philosophy Rand forces Gault to expound as an explanation to the world of why everything is falling apart. Without doubt, however, this book is an important contribution to understanding the potential for abusing the philosophy that underlies much of the foundation of American democratic government. She delineates the major forces that create the dynamic tension of our country."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The prescience of Ayn Rand makes this book a must read for those who are interested and engaged in the politics, and psychology of our world today. This story has great insight into the dangers of socialism and communism as well as the pitfalls that come with the belief that the good of society outweighs the good of the individual. However, Ayn Rand often gets bogged down in her narrative by repeating her philosophies over and over again, just using different words and multiple examples of the same. The speech by John Galt is, at times, rambling, and goes off on many tangents. But as a whole, it is both entertainig and thought provoking. Be prepared to dedicate a great deal of time and thought to this book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Can't put it down, even though it's my second time around with Atlas Shrugged. It's that good . . . rich and sumptuous, as a powerful work of literature is supposed to be. So much of what passes for public compassion and institutionalized good intentions today was exposed as claptrap more than 50 years ago by this wunderkind of philosophy and literature. A powerful commentary on the spirit of man standing against the levelers and merely mediocre, who cloak their mediocrity in the robes of the \\"public good,\\" believing that it shields them from legitimate criticism. But Rand exposes motive-driven ideologies as the scams they are, and she issues a powerful clarion call for individual economic freedom. One that should be heeded. Two thumbs up, and Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Before reading Atlas Shrugged, my favorite American novel was To Kill a Mockingbird. Miss Lee's great work is now relegated to second place by Ayn Rand's amazing effort. Wake up America, we are living Atlas Shrugged!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I heard of this book a long time ago and finally decided to make the plunge. It is long and wordy but extremely well done. Though published over 50 years ago, it is very telling as to what this country, and the world faces today brought on by massive government intrusion into our everyday lives. Ayn Rand, originally from Russia saw the fall and collapse of her country due to communism, socialism and liberal attitudes. She tried to warn us. Alas, no one apparently listened.This novel should be on everyone's \\"Bucket List\\"."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand's writing is a picture into what we are facing in 2012. I'm not sure if she was a visionary or if in relative terms things back in 1957 where much the same (and screwed up) as they are today. If you work hard and believe you earned your way (and your money) you need to read this book. The writing is complex and it can be a slow read but stay with it to the end. Your reward is in the journey."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book exemplifies the propaganda that the wealthy use to justify their excesses. The most productive members of society are in fact the common laborers who make up about 90% of society. They are your factory workers, your Wal-Mart associates, the people who grow the food and who actually build things. They are the people who make $10 per hour so that CEOs and socialites can sit around and count their millions-billions. This book constitutes a threat by the elites to go on strike and stop spending money if the government attempts to interfere to improve the lot of the majority. People are interested in this book because American society is struggling with this problem at present. This is a perfect time for government to begin to set some rules to level the playing field (for example by taxing all accumulated wealth instead of workers' hard-earned income) and to fire up the printing presses to help working citizens. These people will spend the money that they receive instead of hoarding it like the banks are currently doing. Ultimately, the massive government spending of WWII killed the depression and there is no reason to think that it can't get us out of a relatively small recession."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Written by an atheist, this is one of the most insidious and diabolically anti-Christian book ever written.

It's just what's need, along with Howard Dean, to save this country. I hope that when Ayn Rand writes her next novel, she tones it down a bit and shows some compassion. Hey Ayn, it would also be nice to include God and family in your next novel. Duh!Go Howard Dean!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is an amazing book.

Ayn Rand certainly captures the true essence of capitalism, the true meaning of it, and why we so much embrace it!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am enjoying the book and getting much more out of it then when I was forced to read it for a class. I love the speedy service I get when ordering things from Amazon. The \\"one click to buy\\" is great."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book isn't for the meek. It's long, involved, philosophical and parts can be a total beating. I won't go into the philosophy - everyone else has in their \\"reviews\\". The writing style is old, over descriptive but, I found, engaging. The character's story lines interweave in predictable ways but also in very unpredictable ways. Some of the monologues are a total beating - to be frank, I skipped through most of them. As a sidebar, it's an interesting look into technology of the time - long distance calling is mentioned several times like it's a big deal. Probably was in the '50s.The social commentary is interesting as well. Incentive and motivation are taken away stifling productivity, creativity, invention, etc. The average person suffers. However, the decision makers, sycophants, and sanctioned thugs have everything they need to live in luxury. All one has to do is look at the Soviet Union to see how prophetic the plot of Ms. Rand's book is.\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" should be read. By everyone. Don't expect to get through it quickly.

Probably was edited by Balph Eubank"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Most of the people who review the book focus on the philosophy of the writer, which I too agree with and the author makes a compelling case for her point of view on the world. That and the story itself gives it a 4-star review. There are 2 small problems with this book. First, the characters in the book fall into two camps and there are no shades of grey. While I know it is to drive the point of the philosophy, the characters are over-simplified. Second, it is a small but annoying aspect of the Kindle version that there are multiple spelling and punctuation errors in the book. While I'm happy to overlook it, it is distracting. The word \\"I\\" is sometimes converted to \\"1\\". John Galt is sometimes referred to as John Gait. Don't is often converted to Don.'t. Clearly the Kindle version was scanned in and the scanning led to some errors. I just wish that a book of this magnitude was scrubbed of these errors that appear throughout the book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I just re-read Atlas Shrugged, which gets better each time, and can say with certainty that it is the greatest achievement in history, in part because it provides the fullest identification of what makes all the others possible. It is a hymn to unfettered human intelligence.It is also the most spiritually rich work of literature I have ever read. A lot of people are turning to it now because of its prescience, but its description of political control and economic collapse are not what's most important (Rand herself, far from aiming at being a prophetess, regarded as one of the novel's strengths the fact that it wasn't even particularly realistic but rather her most fully Romantic work). In an interview with the author of one of the recent biographies of Ayn Rand, Jon Stewart winkingly referred to her novels being filled with lots of \\"dirty, dirty sex.\\" Those are, in fact, the best scenes. Francisco and Dagny learning together about the wonderful pleasure their bodies can give them the summer after she begins her first job on the railroad as night operator of the Rockdale station; her affair with Rearden beginning at Ellis Wyatt's house after their first run on the John Galt line; and, of course, the encounter in the underground tunnels of the Taggart terminal...it simply doesn't get any better than that. Sure, Rand was prescient---because she identified clearly what certain principles would mean in practice, principles which are now being implemented. But she was much more concerned with what might be and ought to be."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is one audio-book that had a huge impact on my way of thinking. I listened to it twice, and bought the hardcover. I think it should be required reading in high school. A bit long winded sometimes, but you can put it \\"down\\" and come back to it. I have never been so inspired to think like a philosopher. Looking forward to reading more philisophical books."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Quite possibly the most influential book ive ever read. Ayn Rand uses a fantastic storyline to spread her message of Objectivism. yes there are many jokes said about ayn rand, her philosophy and her books, but truthfully, the ideas put forth in atlas shrugged are so pertinent to our world today and make so much sense it is impossible not to agree with her in some respects."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The greatest book ive ever read. Helped explain why i demand so much of myself, figured out the purpose of life. and rationalized the importance of the mind over emotions."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I was reading the latest entry and then I saw the reviewer who was able to categorize all of the negative reviewers. First off the latest review definitely does not fit into the 7th category. This reviewer is so intent on criticizing literature that they forget what a paragraph and a spell check are.I would also like to add one more category to the list, Self Righteous philosopher. This new category and literary critic definitely cover this latest reviewer. I suppose that person is quite qualified to rate down the book that is considered to be the most influential piece of written work outside of religious texts.Quite simply this is a great book. Their is no doubt about it. If you want to read a book that beautifully integrates philosophy with a great story then you have it here. Atlas Shrugged is the story of the pillars of society deciding they are not going to sit back and be criticized and be taken advantage of anymore.It is artwork in the form of literature and philosophy. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have had trouble trying to read Rand's books in the past. I pick them up, read a few pages, put it down, and a few months later the whole process starts again. However, I did not go through this process with Atlas Shrugged. In fact, I finished it in about three days, and was absolutely mesmorized by it. For starters, the main characters are likeable. (I had the problem of hating all of the characters in The Fountainhead.) When you start reading, you feel like they are people you want to be associated with and deal with on a daily-basis: focused, goal-oriented, hard-working people. The only part of the book where my eyes started to glaze over was near the end when Ayn Rand's ideology was stated in a 50-page long speech, but if you don't know her philosophical/political views, then don't skim this over too much... her views are actually pretty interesting, although not to pc. For today's reader, you can really see what happens to a world when political correctness gets out of hand, and it is interesting to think that this woman who grew up in Russia felt this way about Communism and the way people interact."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You don't have to agree with every aspect of Rand's thinking to appreciate this masterpiece of a book. The format and theme (about entrepreneurs going on strike and bringing the economy to a dead halt) were intended only to get certain ideas across; but in the case of Communism, to everyone's surprise, this actually came true, without an organized &quot;strike.&quot;I was reading a book about Marx recently that pointed out a glaring omission from his theory, namely the crucial role of the entrepreneur in economic growth. The computer industry amply illustrates this: Hewlett &amp; Packard; the &quot;two Steves&quot; of Apple Computer; Bill Gates; and many others. Communism fell precisely because it lacked this vital input (except, of course, in the black market).One other noteworthy thing about ATLAS SHRUGGED that Rand said without actually saying it: the opposition to capitalism does not come only from bureaucrats. A good part of it comes from the guilt-ridden children of the capitalists themselves, who can't live with the fact that they have so much inherited (and therefore unearned) wealth, so they seek to atone by embracing ideologies that promise economic redistribution. You might call this moral money-laundering. It was no coincidence that ALL THREE of Old Man Starnes' children (the 20th Century Motor Co.) were socialists. Rand must have noticed this sort of thing in real life, or she would not have written it that way. And real life is chock-full of such examples, like multimillionaire Ted Turner, who recently admitted to being &quot;a socialist at heart&quot; (he inherited his family's business at the age of 24).There's a good book on the Amazon site (GUILT, BLAME, AND POLITICS) that explores precisely this phenomenon--the guilt of the affluent and the educated leading to a predilection for socialism and Marxism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have heard of this book since I was in college, but am just now getting around to reading it. Even though this book is fictional and published in the 40's, it is an amazingly accurate portrayal of how socialism/progressivism affects society. It is a MUST read for EVERYONE!!! Be prepared to NOT be able to put down one of the longest books you will ever read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Not just an important message but a compelling story with crisp, exciting writing. I used to think the hippie spirit was independent and individualistic, \\"free\\", but now I realize that collectivism is at the core of hippie thought. I should've realized it with the \\"communes\\" and all, silly me. The current Democratic administration wants people dependent, equalized and regulated to the hilt. And when all else fails, shame opponents by calling them \\"selfish\\". It's almost as bad as religion resorting to telling opponents they'll go to hell, sort of a last ditch effort to discredit. Anyway, I highly recommend this book - it's long, but I read it in 3 days, couldn't put it down. A book hasn't sparked my imagination and interest like this since Daniel Quinn's Ishmael series. I want my son to read this when he's of age - he'll probably learn more from it than an entire year in a public school that teaches him nothing that he will use to actually become a productive member of society. Kudos to Ayn Rand for this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book is a modern-day classic on par with George Orwell's \\"1984.\\" It is an absolute must-read and is at least as timely today as when it was written.This is obviously a VERY long novel (nearly 1200 pages), and yes, it does have quite a bit of dialog (including several rather long monologues). With that said, this book is a real page-turner that only rarely drags. It really doesn't seem long, and I had a hard time putting it down.Some have criticized this book for being \\"too unrealistic\\" or having characters that are \\"one-dimensional.\\" Yes, many of the characters are larger than life; they're supposed to be. This is not a book about ordinary people in ordinary circumstances; one of the main purposes of this book was to show the result of various philosophies, so this book shows the end point of these philosophies. Rand is critiquing opposing philosophies by asking two questions: first, what would happen if these opponents really became fully consistently with their presuppositions? Second, what if their victims refused to help them do so? (One of her arguments in the book is that the \\"looters\\" need what she calls the \\"sanction of the victim\\" - i.e. the willingness of victims to suffer for doing good).If you're interested in either economics or philosophy, this is a great book to read. Even if you're not interested in these topics (maybe I should say \\"especially if\\"), this is still a great book to read. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand demonstrates what can happen to a world bent on mediocrity, a world self-satisfied to sit back and allow a few creative, hard-working individuals be the vanguards of industrial production. Interestingly, her 1950s world is very reminiscent of today's liberals moving toward big government versus conservatives hoping to return to rugged individualism. Plus, it a terrific read--both insightful and exciting."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"All the Ayn Rand fans are going to ding me for this, but I have to be honest - this novel didn't survive my \\"100 page rule\\" (translation: if you're not hooked by page 101, don't bother finishing the book, there are too many other novels to consider instead). Believe me, I wanted to read and love this book. I've heard nothing but rave reviews about Rand and picked this novel up with much anticipation. But the novel is over 1000 pages and after cracking 10%, I knew there was no way I was going to force myself to plow through it to the end. If you're like me and thinking to buy this because so many others have told you about it, please consider - this book is categorized as fiction but it reads too much like a textbook to just kick back and enjoy. The characters (at least as far as I got) are very one dimensional. Perhaps they get better and I missed out. I admit this \\"classic\\" did have an interesting plot and I'm sure it has many fine points & hidden meanings if the reader is into such topics. The tone of this novel was much like some L. Ron Hubbard fiction I've read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is only a review of the Kindle version of this book, and not the actual material. The amount of typos in this book is pretty ridiculous. It looks like it is clearly a result of the scanning, but it would have only taken one quick read through to get rid of most of the errors. If I had gotten this book free or had only paid a couple of dollars for it, I wouldn't complain too much, but at the price of a new release hardback book, that is crazy. I got so annoyed that I started bookmarking all of the errors I found. I gave up after I went through about two fifths of the book because I decided it was distracting me too much; however, I noted at least 130 errors. Two of the most annoying errors that were repeated numerous times were changing \\"Galt\\" to \\"Gait\\" and adding a random period in front of quotation marks. They way overcharged for this Kindle book.

The book provides the reader purpose, ambition and hope via the shining light of reason based on objective reality.

Collectivism which is practiced eagerly by the republican and democratic collectivist gangs of looters and perpetrators of oppression we have running our affairs today.(...)This book has aged extremely well.

I've read this book twice now, as well as The Fountainhead, Night of January 16th, Anthem, and many of Ayn Rand's other philosophical books. This book has changed the way I look at the world. Ayn Rand had the ability to weave philosophy into a story line to create a masterpiece. When you read some philosophies, you feel as if you are preached at. Ayn Rand backs-up every point no matter how minute with concrete evidence. She gives many examples of what happens when a person deliberately refuses to listen to reason.Since writing this novel, many of the laws that were writen in the book to demonstrated what would happen if unnecessary laws, taxes, etc.. are actually in effect!

Rand's philosophy intrigued me and I was told that this was the best of her four novels if one wanted to learn about Objectivism. The book was very good, the plot was always twisting to reveal more players, more connections, more motives, more everything, it isn't until near the end when you finally get the whole picture. I love the characters, especially Dagny, she is a role model now to me. The only things I didn't like:There are parts of the novel where the story seems to be stuck. Times like one characters sixty page radio speech were excruciating to get through, I know that she couldn't have gotten rid of them (they're essential, sorry), but geez . . . sixty page speech?Also, many of the characters are very similar, almost too similar. Rearden, Galt, d'Anconia, Ragner . . . all essentially the same man, with Dagny close to them except in a skirt.All in all, the book is worth reading, if only to shake up your views. It IS NOT Captain Nemo (in response to another review), nor is Rand promoting anti-family values (just anti-moochers, one of her characters talks about her job as a mother), the book just throws out into the world a view that some will embrace and others will snub. I plan to buy my own copy soon (I got the one I read from the library) and mark quotes in it, both of Rand's novels that I've read have had beautiful quotes to use, I quote her frequently now.

I have wanted to read Atlas for years, but with three jobs and a four year old, I don't have time for the book. I got the CD set and it's very nice work. The performance of the reader is wonderful. At first, as many characters are introduced, I wondered if I'd be able to keep everyone straight. Within the first disk or two, the accents and different voices used by Herrmann had drawn me in and I was carried along by the story.Whether the book is a favorite or you've never found the time for such a long read, the audio version is a great and convenient choice."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"While I'm tempted to drop a star for the staggering length of the book (over 1000 pages total...a 100 page speech at the end...whew), I must remember the impact that this book had on me. Guaranteed to change any young socialist's mind about what morality is proper. A decent personal story, full of heroes who face odds and overcome them, and relentless villains who may unfortunately be your boss or your wife. Collectivism is exposed on every page as the morality of people who only wish to live so long as someone else is helping them do so. It is her philosphy in novel form.A young woman rairoad magnate and a steel producer attempt to swim the tide of rising collectivism by refusing to share gratis the discovery of a new type of steel that will save the railroad. Other steel producers and the railroad woman's own brother attempt to sell them out to government regulation so that everyone can have what they created. The heroes begin to realize that successful businesses are crumbling all around them, and cannot figure out why. Well, it's because an inventor has convinced the producers of the world to leave it temporarily, as the rest of humanity does not respect their work. The engines of humanity exhausted, what the collectivists have created comes to fruition-poverty and repression, as they know only how to coerce, not create. Thats the basic gist."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"if a bit redundant and slightly melodramatic. I adored this book and couldn't put it down from the moment I picked it up, and later I did suffer the morning-after syndrome, but when all's said and done I find Atlas Shrugged to be a vital addition to my collection. Rand's characters are a bit monotonous- all the heroes cut from the same noble, superior-race cloth; all the baddies from the same two strains of either spineless quasi-villains or emotionless instruments of evil. The flaws in Hank Reardon's character are probably what make him the most believable, and that's still not very. Being unrealistic didn't detract from my admiration of them, though, and I did thoroughly enjoy their valor in their struggles.The book is intriguing from the first chapter, and Dagny Taggart is a wonderful heroine (until the latter part of the story). Her history with Francisco D'Anconia, her work behind the scenes at her brother's company, and her developing relationship with Hank Reardon- all kept me captivated. However, towards the end it seemed that Dagny lost her purpose, her direction, and began to drift aimlessly. She didn't really accomplish anything, and I got the feeling that Rand put her in that position solely for the sake of the ending, which also felt rushed and a bit out of place. There were other bits and pieces that I felt were thrown in unnecessarily, such as the whole bit with James Taggart's courtship and marriage and subsequent widowhood with his randomly created wife. However, the evolving relationship between Reardon and the Wet Nurse was wonderfully evocative, particularly at the culmination. It takes a lot of patience and dedication to dig your way through Rand's inspired 60-page monologues on her concepts of Ego and Objectivism, but they happen infrequently, and don't interfere with the story too much, if you remember where you left off with the plot when the monologue struck. I have to admit that it was the romance in the story that delighted me as much as all the noble concepts of individualism and the struggles of good and evil.This novel introduces some ideas of self-sacrifice and selfishness. While it may not change your life, it might very well open your eyes to a new perspective of charity. Anyway, even disregarding all the abounding philosophy, it's a fascinating story with enough realism, romance, and fantasy to make it unforgettable."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This novel is imprtant. Important if you accept much of Miss. Rand's Objectivism, more important if you don't. If you do support Objectivism this book provides great insight as to how it would work in actual practice. If you don't than with luck it will convince you, if not you will at least have gained a truer understanding of it than you would by the misrepresentations it is given by oponents.Many People seem to understand only half this book. For example I see comments on &quot;selfishness good?&quot; I say yes, but you must understand selfishness. Selfishness isn't the cry of &quot;mine&quot; from a small child when told to hand over a toy that belongs to someone else. Selfishism is being primarily concerned with your own happiness. If all people worked form this perspective altruism would not only be unnecessary(as it allready is) but seem unthinkable. For example, my happiness is predicated on many things. It does not make me happy to see a man hurt due to factors outside his control, so I try to help. This includes such activites as helping organizations that help AIDS sufferers. Why do I do this? Not out of some fuzzy spirit of altruism, but because it gives me pleasure to help people who want to be alive, and be productive. I do NOT help with Habitat for Humanity, an orginization that seeks to give unearned property to people. It does not make me happy to help those attain what I have, without having to produce for it. Many people seem to think this means venerating a man who owns a business while hating those who work for him. Not so. If a man works his hardest and produces, as a sweeper, an industrialist, a business owner, a novelist, or anything he is a good moral man nad to be admired. The man who takes welfare and refuses a job at McDonalds becaus ehe feels it, beneath him, he is to be despised, not pitied, but despised. I am not a wealthy industrialist. I have a small theatrical production company. Does it support me? No, but I don't take pride in being a starving artist, I work. I work for money forty hours a week, and I work to make my company a sucess. A friend asked if I wanted to form a non-profit theatre company. NO some day my company will be sucessfull and I will make money from it. How do I know this, because I want it, and I will work for it. That's all we need to know. Who is John Galt?

Dagny Taggart, capable bearer of the legacy of her name- put down because she does not have the right &quot;connections&quot;, only the mind and the initiative. Francisco, the playboy billionaire- or is he? And, of course, John Galt- who is he, and why is everyone invoking is name?America's best and brightest are disappearing... government is responding to the problem (causing it...) by promoting brotherhood and socialism, ie successful, hard-working people should give to the lazy and the incompetent. Well I say HELL NO, and so does Ayn Rand.A bit trite and the end, and a bit tiresome throughout- nevertheless, Atlas Shrugged will alternately enrapture you with the highest levels of joy and leave you screaming in frustration, slamming the book on the ground, and crying for the plight of the virtuous protagonists.A must-read for every competent, intelligent, ambitious person."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Some people choose to anathematize Ayn Rand for not believing in a higher power. If you look at that guy Mordechi's page, you will see nothing but Ayn Rand books with poor ratings. I really don't care.

Now pay attention, dudes and dudettes -- you might learn something. First off, just because the heroes and heroines of the book are really good-looking, glamorous people who essentially say to the world, \\"You're all lame, and we're dropping out! C'ya!\\", a sentiment that all young people can relate to, doesn't mean that these are interesting characters. OK? Now -- next. For a writer that wrote a 1000+ page novel about capitalists, Ayn Rand doesn't know a lot about how capitalism works. Her heroine, Dagny Taggart, runs her own private transcontinental railroad: did you know that, minus one very short-lived exception (The Great Northern Line), all transcontinental railroads were subsidized by the Federal Gov't? (Read the history and weep, Vanderbilt worshippers!) Referring back to my statement about Rand's complete misunderstanding of capitalism, two words come to mind: ADAM SMITH. Adam Smith, kids, was an 18th-Century economist who basically laid down the principles of economic science as we understand and practice them today. Now this Smith guy talked a lot about \\"cooperation\\" in trade -- indeed, without cooperation, there can, of course, BE no trade! The very word \\"trade\\" implies cooperation. No duh, right? But why do Rand's predatory capitalist heroes keep saying (over and over and over) that they will not do anything for the sake of another human being? If one wishes to facilitate trade, and gradually accumulate capital, one needs to cooperate -- indeed, give up something to get something -- with a trading partner. A selfish capitalist that burns all his bridges soon finds himself out in the cold. And the capitalist who takes selfishness to the extreme by ripping people off will be shunned and shamed (cf. ENRON, to cite a recent example). This guy Smith talked about this concept, as well as a bunch of other stuff about the \\"flow\\" of economic trade, hundreds of years ago. Most of his writings were an attempt to clarify existing trade practices, with an eye toward improving the morality AND profitable application of those principles (not mutually exclusive things!). But you'll read him soon in your next Economics class. Finally, one word about this \\"Objectivism\\" stuff. Another reason why teenagers like you enjoy this book is because the main characters do not have any KIDS -- i.e., they don't have too many more responsibilities than you guys got right now. Again, this makes them easy to identify with. But ask any parent, and they'll tell you that the LAST thing they're \\"objective\\" about are their children. Rand's stupid \\"philosophy\\" can't permit her characters to raise a family, take care of elderly parents, etc. etc. Why? Well, having a family implies a certain level of involvement with your community, a concept Rand (endlessly) claims is a hateful, despicable thing. I mean, you be the judge, dude. Oh, and don't be too impressed with her adherence to Aristotle's formulas: it's a cheap trick of hers to gain intellectual \\"legitimacy\\" for her sophomorisms. And why do all her characters look and sound exactly the same? The villains are all Nordic heroes who say the same things; the villains are beetle-browed totalitarians who say the opposite things of what the heroes say. Rather contradictory for a novelist who claims that individualism is the greatest thing since sliced bread. (So much for non-contradiction!) So, guys, listen up: you'll grow out of your current Rand infatuation sooner than you think, once you're exposed to more life-experience. Trust me. Still unsure? Ask any respected thinker from the Right, Left, or In-Between about Ayn Rand, and you'll soon find that no one takes her seriously. And if you think she's a good writer, well, what do you know --? You've watched MTV all your life. *Atlas Shrugged* is bad prose and half-baked philosophy. Be warned. And grow up, while you're at it -- why wait?

We get it capitalism is good communism is bad, you couldn't wrap it up a couple of hundred pages ago? A perfect example of this is the speech John Gault gives about three-quarters of the way through the book. He drones on and on but what he's saying doesn't add to the story at all. Also along those lines the book is so straight forward it could have ridden on the rails of Taggart Transcontinental. This company failed, this train line broke, and this person ran away. Where are the twists and turns? Where is something I couldn't roll my eyes at? Finally the characters are SO absolute that they're not realistic. On the bad guy side there are the law makers who have no idea what they are doing but are never opposed. Are there no elections in this new America? The \\"good\\" guys remind me of Scrooge.

I finally got around to it this year. When I finished it, I sat back with a glow of satisfaction. Of all the superstitions/religions, philosophies, and other belief systems I have encountered in some form or other, Rand has come the closest to the way I think and believe. I have yet to systematically record my ideas, and I'm glad I got Rand under my belt before I did. Objectivism is a good philosophy, and Rand is a great writer and thinker. Not perfect, though. Her complete rejection of any determinism is faulty, but she didn't have the benefit of the past 20 years of scientific genetic research. Her rejection of all things supernatural is faulty, though her rejection of a sentient deity is spot on. My experiences have shown me supernatural presence, though not necessarily able to influence the material world in any meaningful way. While she touts objectivity as the standard, she fails to understand that almost all human interaction has a subjective quality to it; not noticing it even while she was writing about Dagny and Henry, etc. Ironically, the political correctness advocates who recoil at Rand's ideas are the chief propagandists for turning human interactions into Rand's objective ideal. Finally, for those who think Rand is right, if you feel the need to defend Objectivism from attack, you don't understand Objectivism. Re-read Atlas Shrugged and Rand's other books. Hear the message she gives you, &quot;It doesn't matter what they believe; only that you have used your reason to determine what is right, free of dogmatic expressions of faith in anything.&quot; To which I add, even free of dogmatic expressions of Objectivism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read this book when I was in my late 20's and have never been able to enjoy another book as much since.

Her personal philosophy was so moral, in an age of what she described as &quot;moral grayness&quot; that it led to the beginnings of a large cultural revolution in America.

If you do not want to be lead to question the very fabric of western thinking, you will not like this book. For me, it was like the first water in the desert of confusion- for others it will be an attacking blade, and for those I have true pity.I was raised in a rural area by a small-business owner and from the beginning I was taught to value my labor and time and ingenuity. I was also taught Christian ideals, and as I grew up and saw that the goals of life and the goals of Christianity didn't seem to mesh I decided to go with the less hopeless of the two. Later in life I began embracing some socialist and some communist ideals- hoping that humanity would reach a point where we could all work for the human good by supporting each other. And I put in my all to support those around me. My return on that is a large portion of debt that others helped to generate and will never pay for. They fed off my productiveness and when I had nothing more to give and had to find a way to start over, they found others to feed on.Whatever philosophy of life you prescribe to, I will forever be thankful to Ayn Rand for so clearly and articulately explaining her viewpoint and for building a story that shows how her views play out in the world. People tend to not be as black/white, good/evil, left/right as the characters in her story- we tend toward a grey area of viewpoints. But the reality is, people act based on what they believe and anyone who believes that they have a right to anything they have not earned will behave that way. This book shows a way of thinking that leads to people who generate life, who produce not only their own lives, but jobs for others. It shows what can be done when people understand the value of their ideas, the value of their soul."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book. It is over 1,000 pages and I finished it in just under a week. Could not put it down. Ms. Rand writes very well. The story she tells is very intriguing and is an excellent method to communicate her philosophy; \\"I will earn my own way, I will not ask you to serve me and you need to stop taking from me.\\"This book should be required reading in high school but it will be hard to hold a young person's attention for the time required to read the book (not sure they can stop text messaging long enough for one chapter).

But it is also the most profound philosophical fiction you will ever read. It is the story that conveys the meaning--the heroes just make it explicit.Rand is uniquely unique and has about as much in common with Verne as Shakespeare does with Harry Potter, as much in common with earlier &quot;right-wing&quot; novelists as she does with Horatio Alger stories, and even Nietzsche didn't come very close to her profoundly revolutionary ethics.It's both delicious and nutritious, but be ready for an emotional and intellectual bunker-buster!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Main complaints of those who gave the book 1-2 stars:1. Ayn Rand isn't a philosopher, she has to create a world2. The book is long, I couldn't even finish it3.

Her characters are all the same \\"beautiful, hyper-intellectual, rich, and super-moral according to their own standards\\"5. She hates childrendenouncing these claims:1. Ayn Rand is a philosopher. She wrote nonfiction works AS WELL as her fiction to describe her philosophy. Quoting Merriam Webster Online, fiction is \\"something invented by the imagination or feigned\\" like her world. Her fictional world is meant to show an example. Read her nonfiction for true philosophy.2. The book is long...ungodly long (go figure, she's an atheist)and one would think she was paid by the word, especially when reading John Galt's speech. However, if you did not finish this book, you wasted however many weeks because the VERY best part of any book ever lies at the end of Atlas Shrugged. Don't want to spoil it, but Pirate Fight. And it takes the first 1100 pages to develop the strong ties to the heroes that make the end SOOO worth it.3. Dagny and Hank...they trade when it helps them4. Howard Roark (granted, he wasn't in this book) also Eddie Willers, Eddie Willers, John Galt (produced much, made VERY little money) also Howard Roark, and so what, that's a GOOD thing5. Her characters were not ready to have children in the book. Hank and Lillian could've, but they didn't- OH well. They were responsible enough to realize they shouldn't bring others into the world when they weren't ready. Besides, she has one woman in each book. She doesn't preach against family.One thing I think people miss with Objectivism is that you CAN help people- and you should- in the same way as \\"give a man a fish and he eats for a day. teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime.\\" The fewer people in poverty, on the streets, etc. the better for the rest of us, so it is beneficial to help people, just not for their own sake- for yours.I'll probably read this again, if you want to argue, I'll be glad.

Socialists destroyed her dad's business. So Rand's views are a mix of a hostile reaction to the ideas of socialists + other influences ( Friedrich Nietzsche, Nikolay Chernyshevsky).Her views were not born by analysis of how the Western society works. They were formed already in Russia. Her bashing of humanism is the reaction to the pain which \\"humanistic\\" socialists brought to her and her family. Her logic was: socialists were extreme humanists, they fought for justice for all and what happened? They did a damage to me and my family. Hence humanism is evil. In fact, Marxism-Leninism basically lacked humanism accepting violence in order to achieve goals and was based on philosophical speculation ( communism was inevitable according to their \\"class conflict\\" theory).Logical chain: socialists are bad and they claim to be humanists -> hence humanism is evil -> if humanism is evil then it's opposite - egoism should be a solution->simple egoism is too mainstream ( boring!) hence it should be rational egoism, egoism par excellence->humanism is based on metaphysical matters, it smells idealism, hence objectivism aka materialism and atheism is a way to go.In fact in real life egoists are always materialists. You don't have to be a philosopher to find this connection. So nothing special in such observations.So why Rand's not so special ideas became so popular? The reason is that these simple cynical ideas were brought at the right time ( a fear of Communist threat) in the right place ( in the USA). At another time and in another place they would seem too primitive and obvious. But in the right circumstances they were given a green light.If you want to research the roots of aesthetics of Rand's writings you should read Chernyshevsky's \\"What is to be done?\\". In this novel you will also find a lot of common ideas with Rand's works, for example an idea of rational egoism is exploited there.Another famous Russian-American writer Vladimir Nabokov destroyed Chernyshevsky in his brilliant novel \\"The Gift\\". Nabokov destroys Ayn Rand as well because Rand and Chernyshevsky share the same viewpoints and aesthetics which were despised by him. Rand called Nabokov evil and said that she only read one and a half of his books. Which is a sign of big disrespect to Nabokov who was absolutely adored by Russian intellectuals outside Russia at that time.Nabokov was a tremendous individualist and elitist who cruelly bashed mediocrity. Nabokov was also a product of English influence ( Western civilization) who learned to read first in English and only then in Russian. His first nun was an English woman. It's amusing to see that Nabokov couldn't stand Rand who was a messiah of talent and individualism. According to Nabokov's standpoint Ayn Rand's novels are not Literature. They are an ideological junk.Ayn Rand is practically unknown in Russia. Only recently her novels have been published there. She is going to be perceived as an American author and she will unlikely be accepted favorably. Boring and outdated Chernyshevsky is enough for this kind of \\"literature\\" there."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"For those that have never read Atlas Shrugged, I highly recommend this book even though it isn't an easy read.

As you read this book, it will make you stop and think of what is going on in America today--how the entrepreneurial spirit is being crushed, big government take over, the rise of serfdom, etc. I am glad I finally made the time to read this book and I strongly recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Exaggerated but not by much. \\"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\\" speeds up yet still impressively gets its arms around the struggle between America's productive class and political class. The film zeroes in on the most vexing issue for Western economies - business leaders breaking off from production to injure competitors through the political game. Teachers of business ethics would do well to show this movie to their students.\\"Atlas Shrugged: Part I\\" is based upon Ayn Rand's novel and made with the permission of her estate. The Ayn Rand Institute consulted on the film but did not produce it. The result is the ideological edge of the book is put to good use but not quite the way Rand drew it. The movie realistically shows the most compelling reason for capitalism's survival - its call to peaceful collaboration and cooperation - and avoids \\"the super CEO\\" mantra that is pure fiction to everyone except the majority of business news reporters.The lack of children and steel entrepreneur Henry Rearden's remark about his only interest being making money might make you think the movie is based on some vain, sterile, pecuniary premise. You'll be jolted from this if you listen carefully to one of Henry's conversations at the anniversary party.Henry's wife represents the contemptuous, free-loading envy of the political class. Their waning marriage is a perfect metaphor for the current situation in American society that's heading for a massive debt bomb explosion and future shock. What's missing from the film is a public servant that recognizes this and is trying to defuse the bomb. Not all in government are interested only in power and making pompous pontifical pronouncements.John Galt, the hero of Rand's novel, is in the film's shadows, speeding up the coming of future shock. Dagny Taggart's naming the speed train line after John Galt is fitting although she doesn't realize just how much.The choice of a bullet train is helpful in teaching an economics lesson. High-speed rail is assumed today to be only possible through government subsidies. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" the movie reminds us that the world is not static and railroads could become a haven for private capital again if conditions warranted. Nobel laureate James Buchanan has lamented the loss of wisdom regarding the benefits of laissez-faire. Our film builds an elegant rail bridge over this gap. Rand did this some years before when she called capitalism the system of the future, a confident prediction that statism would destroy itself.Irony emerges when one considers the market for libertarian ideas using the film's limited distribution as measuring stick. Specifically, the movie industry is one of the least regulated yet a libertarian film project can't get wide theater play. This shows that merit is not a big element in market economics. It also demonstrates the interconnectedness of markets as conceptualized by the great Leon Walras. Democrats and Republicans, despite their own massive failures, have convinced most of the voting public that libertarianism is not a viable political philosophy. Major party statists (utilizing war and crisis in sowing fear and dependency) have used the elections arena to dull demand for libertarian art and literary projects. Go to your local library and see what I mean.Yet the dream survives. Consider, as per Say's Law, that government creates its own demand. The lesser known aspect of the principle is that demand for other things is created, too. Thus government's growth ensures demand for liberty. With American statists showing no signs of repentance, the market for \\"Atlas Shrugged, Part I\\" and the coming Part II will, like Rand's compelling book, grow greater and truer over time. Seen in light of Rand's staying power nearly 30 years after her death, this should come as no shock."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have owned this book for 10 years now and must say , it is one terrific read !

After all, there are already over 1,800 reviews on Amazon.The real reason I'm writing this is just to mention that Ayn Rand way preceded Eli Goldratt of \\"The Goal\\" in marketing philosophy as a novel. And of course that was preceded by The Emperor's New Clothes and whatever else.The book is a slog, but it's an intriguing slog and I'm guessing it took maybe 30 hours to read including a really boring philosophical monologue that took over an hour and a half to wade through. But it's also thought provoking...really thought provoking. If you haven't experienced ALL of the characters in real life,...well, I don't know whether to be sorry for you or happy for you.You can argue that this is good literature, but I won't, but it is \\"successful\\" by definition because it's survived and I suspect a hundred years from now people will still be reading it.Other reviewers describe it as prophetic; I'd describe it as descriptive of every age.Ayn Rand's \\"objectivism\\" is so black and white that even she had to modify it a bit near the end of the book. But you don't have to share her view of life to find the book thought provoking. I'm guessing the reason this book has legs is not so much what it says, but it challenges the reader to think about their own approach to secular life.I wonder whether you should be old (experienced) to appreciate this book, or whether it would be better to read it when you're young and find it hard to believe, then recognize what happens around you as conforming to the book as you grow older.I regret not reading it when my boss gave it to me; it's the only book she's ever given me and she knew better than I did at the time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand was a prophet. Not in the biblical sense but in the sense of being able to see the dire effects of government control over private sector business. Written in 1957, which was about when I first read it (I was in high school), like most others, I was captivated by it. Set in the future, Rand is able to see down the corridors of time to an America that is decaying because of socialist policies. Heroes emerge to fight these strictures, and they are writ large, having become almost household names by now: Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggart. We want those heroes today, even with their humanist flaws.What sets this book apart as I read it anew is how much of Rand's prophecies have actually come to pass and how much work it is going to take to get America back on track again, freed up to unleash the creativity of man (and woman). For every government regulation, an idea dies. For every punishment of individual pursuit, prosperity suffers.Rand understood the dangers of overweening government, just as our Founding Fathers did. It will take you about 200 pages to get into the plot after the characters are drawn, so stick with it for a can't-put-it-down ride.But there's a downside to this classic: Read it and weep because she was right."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"... the world would be a better place.This is a book for people inpired by socialistic ideas thinking that they are philantrophic: Vampirizing the productive part of a society in order to \\"help\\" the needing part without getting anything in return dooms any society.I loved this book and the brilliant philosophy of Ayn Rand. She is one of the most important authors on this globe and Altas Shrugged her masterpiece. Her philosophy should be tought at school and before getting the right to vote any citizen should learn about the vertues that make a valuable human being in a society.The economic genius Milton Friedman said that the most important duty of any business is to be profitable. He would turn around in his grave seeing what is happening today in the so called civilized countries: They do not only \\"democratically\\" steal enormeous amounts of money of the producing part of the society but also of the futur generations of producers to give it away for the sake of human equalization which is an impossible aim.

It will make you question what you believe in."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's amazing that, even though it was written in the 50's, people are still saying and doing things that it warns of (in the earlier parts of the book). Especially in this economic climate in which the government has taken unprecedented control over companies and the individuals that run them, Rand's words of caution ring as true as ever. Although the idea of a business utopian society described leaves a lot of practical questions unanswered as far as large scale adoption, the ideas about individualism and property rights are very close to my heart. I was inspired by some of the characters in this book. Although I didn't agree with every sentiment, I think that there is a lot more that's right in this book than not. Despite a lengthy monologue near the end, it reads really fast too."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book will give you perspective on why we are seeing today the enervation of our society and the sacrificing of those who contribute the most to make it flourish. Atlas Shrugged is a novel that presents with precision the events of today by someone who predicted our current malaise over 50 years ago. There are ideas that lead to desired conclusions and those that don't. Some people really do understand and appreciate cause and effect. And Ayn Rand was one of them.One of the essential differences between those who like this book and those who don't is their ability or inability to check their premises. I mean this in the same sense that Rand herself used this expression often.If you are having trouble with the concretes and abstractions presented in this novel, the key thing to remember is that, unlike most writers, Rand evolved her plots and characters from her basic premises. Her novels are a full system of thought, from epistemology to esthetics presented in a fictional form. Her unique style was to weave an internally consistent philosophical position into the concrete events, speeches and dramatic intrigue of her story.Some have criticized Rand for any number of stylistic, moral and esthetic gaffs. Whatever their seeming merit, they have missed the forest entirely. The projection of what is possible in life and the values and principals needed to get there are a far more beneficent gift than any the supposed shortcomings could provide.Those who have problems with the depictions of this philosophy will have considerably less trouble identifying the points of their departure than with nearly any novel they have ever read. Rand is a paragon in her ability to present her case clearly. What is left to her readers who have any trouble with this is the challenge to check their premises. As an example of this the most fundamental of these choices would be the distinction between the primacy of consciousness and the primacy of existence. Which side of your skull is the universe on?If you are willing to examine any of your own premises, you will have no problem discovering your point of divergence from hers. How many writers can you think of who can give you that kind of clarity? If you're only willing to meet her half way.And not everyone can."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Review title says it all..."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I ordered this book in early september.. it was charged right away..... but my son still has not received the book..... this was my first experience with an amazon \\"purveyor,\\" I guess you'd call it..... and i think it will be my last...

If you are open-minded you will enjoy reading this book, but if you are narrow-minded and too conservative(not saying Conservatives are bad), you will NOT enjoy this book. This book is an excellent peace of literature and makes you think. There are some things I don't like about this book. For example, some of these peoples' personalities you will never see in anyone and they are too unintelligent and one-dimensional. But, I do agree that you cannot show too much sympathy, even to family, or you will not succeed in the business world. As a 14 year old, I found this book to be well-written, and it truly does make you think.

This book tries to justify selfishness, greed and megalomania. You can't both believe in the selfishness this book pushes AND be a Christian. The two do not mesh. I understand that Paul Ryan requires those who work for him to read this book. I guess that explains some things about him. The really sickening thing to me, is that after she pushed this evil agenda of self dependance and hate for welfare programs, she, herself used them in the last years of her life.

I was introduced to the book by a drug dealer who had Rand's \\"sayings\\" printed on all his apartmernt walls. He had bought several hundred copies to hand out to everyone! I got hypnotized. After graduating college, I read it again and wondered why it was so impossible to actually live up to Rand's grand standards. I then found out Rand was an atheist. This affected my opinion of her. Later I discovered the real way to live on [...]. The Foundation of Human Understanding enabled me to live my beliefs without hypocrisy by guiding me to the Creator. Rand turns out to have been a waste of time. A wrong road taken. Brandon and alot of other intellectual types were misled by her.

Dear readers, do you think that Ayn Rand would classify any of you as a Hank Rearden or a Dagny Taggart, or even less, as an Ayn Rand? I frankly found the book hard to read with her pessimistic and whining tone. I wonder what made her so angry."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The book came quickly, was packaged nicely, and was reasonably priced."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I completely disagree with the premise of the book. Clearly it is written by a sociopath for sociopaths. If you believe that you are not your brother's keeper, this is the book for you. It is decently written and at times overly descriptive (which is typical of Ayn Rand.) The book has an astonishing way of making caring human beings into annoying piss ants and sex sound like rape play. With Ayn Rand up is down and black is white and the clever way she glorifies this mentality is worth the price of the book. Read this book if you want to know the mindset of those who seek to enrich themselves while simultaneously destroying the world that they \\"built.\\" Read this book if you want to understand those who are convinced to stand against their own economic, social and moral interests. Who is John Galt? Why he is Satan himself."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"...it should be thrown with great force.\\" That is, if it didn't weigh a 1100 pounds.Other reviewers have pointed out the terrible characterization, the rote repetition, the need for an editor, the condescending, arrogant, hateful sanctimony of the book (for someone who \\"figured out life\\" Ayn Rand did not seem to be a happy, or even nice, person; hmmmmmm...), the absurd 60-page hokum speech, the irrational claims of originality (I am only indebted to Aristotle, and but a little; never mind plagiarizing Nietzsche), dear me, I'll stop now, don't want to go writing 1100 pages of the same thing already said, now do I?But I am thankful that Rand was an Objectivist for one reason; she never had any children. And where are the children in her novels? How does Dagny sleep with men (is it possible 'Ayn Rand' was merely the pen name for L. Ron Hubbards harlequin romances?)at every turn of the page and yet never becomes impregnated? What if she became with child? Would she have any responsibility for another life she created out of her actions? What are the moral implications of Objectivism for a baby, an infant, a toddler, a child, an adolescent, a teenager, a person? Not all that is going to be rational, or congruent with self-interests; in fact it would seem quite the opposite. And quite convenient Rand didn't address what could have been a compelling drama and storyline (and very real) in her novel. Instead of repeating herself ad infinitum maybe she should have taken at least one risk like that.Why do people like this book, though, and why is it still relevant? I've heard some dubious remarks concerning the influence and merit of this novel. The most trumpeted is that it is the most \\"influential\\" book behind the Bible, or the best English-language novel of the 20th century (according to ballot-stuffing propagandists). My, my, the most influential book behind the Bible? A quick look at Amazons website for the UK and France shows that there have been 58 and 4 reviews (as opposed to 1700 in the States) for Atlas. The simple fact is that the book isn't that heralded, read or even known about outside our little microcosm of the universe, the U.S.What about those astute social-commentators that see parallels between Rands \\"prophetic\\" book and the financial straits of contemporary society (Stephen Moore, you stilted hack, I'm looking at you)? Rand was right all along, her book is coming true! Thus the renewed interest in the novel. However it would seem the titan-of-industry hucksters, the one's who flee society and responsibility with millions to some utopia like France (i.e. where Rand isn't read), have more to do with Rands ideas and her mouthpieces (infallible characters) than the other way around. Yes, government is doing, I think, too much stimulating and bailing out. But that's just food-for-thought, just like thinking about John Galt out there toiling in the soil, cooking his food, unclogging his toilet, building his house, paving roads, curing his diseases; oh, wait, I forgot, he invented a magical machine that ran on air and generated energy and wiped his bottom and sucked his thumb and purified his water and breathed for him while everyone in elitist Objectivist community takes the same side on everything yet don't stagnate with their ideas, give up the women they love because passion and wanting to love someone else is unbecoming a true, rational Objectivist...I need to stop ranting, my eye has begun to twitch.I remember reading this book when I was 18. I thought, Wow, that was pretty good. You see, at 18 I knew everything. But as I've gotten older (no thanks to you, Socrates!) I've begun losing my knowledge. For instance, I wasn't yet 20 when I went through the trouble of bringing 'Atlas Shrugged' on an annual camping trip, chucking it into the bonfire, waking up the next morning and urinating on the ashes. How uncouth!I guess I should try and put something encouraging about the book, so I note that it's been a perennial best-seller and sold millions of copies; Rand would appreciate my differentiating between quantity and quality."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Possibly the most relevant and timely narrative of the century. It's as pertinent today as it was when it was written. A must read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You would swear this book was written today. Rand weaves a wonderful addictive plot that takes place in a dystopia with philosophy of capitalism, welfare state, and moral ethics. Today's health care, destructive welfare culture, fiscal cliff, the 1%, corporate bail-outs, government industrial subsidies are all in this book. I understand why this book has become &#34;cult-like&#34; to Rand fans. More current than some of today's political pundit books and it has a great story."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After years of feeling somewhat estranged in modern liberal society, the book helped me to realize that I was right all along, that A=A and that 1+1 =2, not what other people desired it to be. For example, in the recent gun control controversy liberals are ignoring or even criticizing the protection of schools with armed guards, yet the President has just signed an executive order extending the secret service protection of himself and his family for life. Gun control advocates like Governor Cuomo are surrounded by armed guards all the time. Yet, they are not good enough for our children? A only equals A when they \\"feel\\" it does. Otherwise, it equals B or anything else to further their ideology."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I didn't expect to like this book. I knew it was long. I'd been told it was preachy - that there's a speech that lasts sixty pages. Worse - that it preached \\"selfishness.\\" That is anti-religious (I'm Catholic). That it is pseudo-philosophy.I was wrong - I loved this book. Yes, there is some truth to all of its criticisms but it's an extremely compelling read. It BETTER be compelling - if you are not compelled, you are going to give up after the first couple of hundred pages.There is a popular cliche about this book that people repeat in order to sound intellectual. \\"People discover Atlas Shrugged around the same time they discover Middle-Earth, and they discard them both just as quickly.\\" I first came across this in The New Yorker magazine. Paul Krugman wrote a variation on it and called it his own. Even the president has copped to some version of it. The reason its detractors dismiss the novel out-of-hand (this year's presidential endorsement decried the \\"\`Atlas Shrugged' fantasy of entrepreneurs\\") is that it seems so accurately to describe the economic predicament that the country is in. In the novel, the economy is collapsing because of over-regulation, crony-capitalism, big government, and sheer incompetence. Of course, the government calls for even bigger government, more regulation, and seizing the property of the wealthy.In the middle of all of this, poor Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden try to run their businesses against mounting odds in a society that values good intentions over actual competence. Meanwhile, a \\"destroyer\\" seems to be kidnapping all the competent people in America, leaving the rest to ask: \\"Who is John Galt?\\"But I'm still not an Objectivist. There's a difference between pointing out the inefficiencies of government and giving over completely to Rand's philosophy. And she's not subtle about her \\"philosophy\\" - she hits you over the head with it. (It was a mistake for her to spend the rest of her life writing about Objectivism - she should've let the novel speak for itself.) I will say the doctrine of \\"selfishness\\" (or enlightened self-interest) is not what pop-culture makes it out to be - Rand is actually advocating living a MORAL life. The problem is (and the problem that one occasionally has when talking with Objectivists) is that John Galt states that unless you agree with EVERYTHING in his 60-page speech, you are being irrational and not thinking. The quickest way to get someone to follow you blindly is saying it is by saying it is the only way to think for yourself.But one does not have to be an Objectivist to love Atlas Shrugged. It is a timely book. Read it if you are curiously about why it is so anxiously decried in the New Yorker."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Unfortunately, a this is very believable and gripping story line about big governemnt gone amok.

The society the Rand envisioned over fifty years ago bears a frighteningly striking resemblance to the society in which we now find ourselves living. Even before I heard of this book, I found myself wishing there was some place those of us who are producers could go to get away from the leaches of the federal government. But I fear the &#34;last, best hope for freedom&#34; may not be that much longer, and there is really no where else to go. If those of sound reason do not get involved and enact change soon, we will find ourselves living in a society where &#34;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&#34; will be the law of the land.

I realize that all the characters are simple cardboard cut-outs for the purpose of illustration, however the length of the novel and its continuous ranting make, these one dimensional puppets, very tiresome. If one adds - lack of plot development along with poor dialogue (characters simply talk at each other, ranting on and on) one gets Atlas Shrugged.Although I do have to take off my hat to Miss Rand's ability to turn things upside down. The description of almost every negative business character and practice in the book is reminiscent of corporate CEO culture propelled by greed - the very thing Ann Rand argues is good. Another example is her complete misunderstanding and misrepresentation of anti dog-eat-dog contract.The philosophy of self fulfillment through greed and gain, presented in the book, negates the principles of equality of opportunity. Rand's focus on \\"here and now\\" combined with selfishness, greed and complete disregard for social awareness invites short term mentality with harmful and even destructive long term effects. I find this kind of point of view not only unattractive but simply absurd. A glaring example of failure of Rand's principles can be seen in Prisoner's Dilemma that has been applied to politics as well as economics with catastrophic results. In my opinion we function in zero-sum reality where any action/gain leads to an equal opposite reaction/loss which taken to extreme leads to self destruction like a self eating snake.The book also contains veiled support for monopoly (Dagny Taggart's exchange with Dan Conway). Rand quickly retreats this potentially dangerous assumption but nevertheless the secretive craving for monopoly is obvious in \\"protagonists\\" aspirations of self fulfillment. It is ironic since monopoly tends to stagnate the progress. In terms of philosophical architecture of Rand's principles the only way I can make sense of it is the continuous cycle of rebuilding and self destruction. This is rather a status quo than progressive mentality.In general I find this book amusing yet absurd. Not worth the time and patience."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If this is a philosophical novel, why does it take Rand over 1,000 pages to make her point?

I've reread it recently in the hopes that I could find something nice to say when acquaintances mention fervently that this is their favorite book ever. Sigh. I can only pat myself on the back for being such a smart kid... This is the kind of book that helps you define those who are 'your kind' of people, and who aren't. Do you like mayonnaise, or Miracle Whip? Do you think Atlas Shrugged is the Best Book Ever, or Pure Drivel? Count me in with the mayonnaise eating, Pure Drivel crowd. Bleahhh!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I understand that when Ayn Rand died, she was in the process of writing a long overdue update of Charles Dickens' book, \\"A CHRISTMAS CAROL\\". She would have put things to right and made Scrouge the hero that he was, standing up to the likes of that dirty socialist, good for nothing Bob Cratchet and his worthless, dirty family of Commies led by that little retch Tiny Tim. But have no fear. If you read this book you will realize who the real hero was (Scrouge, until he was turned into a Commie himself)."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"To begin with, I should say that I only read the first 200 or so pages of this book, before being forced to put it down. At the time, I had several friends who had taken up the objectivist philosophy, and I was very interested in it. While reading this book, I became so disgusted with the ideas behind it--as my personal philosophy differs so greatly--that I didn't bother to finish. That being said, this book is excellently well written, and is certainly Ayn Rand's magnum opus. It outlines her philosophical principles in a very literate, intelligent way, and is in it's own way, very gripping. If not for my own great philosophical differences, this book would earn five stars. It just can't be recommended to everyone."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I got a book all right. I received an actual ATLAS. An actual book of maps. Is this a joke?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It started for me with the Fountainhead. I read it when I was 23. When I read it I held a mixture of New Left, Greening of America, hippie and mystical ideas. I was a mess. My so-called ideals left me unfit for living. I was washed into a rehab program. It was there that I found this book on the shelf and read it. It totally opened my eyes to a very very different way of seeing the world and oneself. Soon thereafter I found Atlas Shrugged and read it cover to cover. Then read it again more slowly. Then I read all of her non-fiction. I owe here a tremendous debt.I only wish I read this book at 16. It would have saved me from so many mistakes. I don't see why this isn't required reading in American Literature. It sure has a lot more relevance than many of the works common in that course. And it is very distinctly *American* literature."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"No matter what you have ever heard about Ayn Rand, good or bad, you must read this book and experience it for yourself. Do not believe what anyone tells you. Even if they mean well they simply cannot know how you will respond to the story. Not everyone is going to be won over to Rand's 'Objectivism', even if they love the story and the characters. But you do yourself a disservice if you do not give her a full and fair hearing. Keep in mind that 'the powers that be' find Rand's thoughts extremely dangerous as they represent a form of anti-government libertarianism. If you are to go through life accepting that the powers that be are legitimate sources of authority, or that those in your life who seek to control you (parents, professors, bosses, spouses, etc) should be allowed to do so, you must first read this book and refute its core tenets. Of course, if you do find yourself won over--taking the red rather than blue pill so to speak--well then you are going to embark on a life adventure that will surprise you. This book changes lives, for better or worse. Really.As a fan of Rand, it is difficult for me to be critical of Atlas Shrugged. I would merely point out the occasional inconsistency or incompleteness of certain ethical and political themes presented. To a certain extent these may simply reflect that Rand's Objectivism was naturally a work in progress that continued to evolve through her life. (Please name one philosopher who ever stopped changing their mind about some aspect of their work). Those critical of Rand will see these as fundamental flaws in Objectivism, rather than ideas in progress. I challenge the reader to locate these for themselves, consider whether they undermine Objectivism or not, and draw their own conclusions. Rand herself would not have it any other way. As a believer in unfettered competition in all aspects of life, naturally she would welcome any and all intelligent, informed debate about this book.John Butler, author of The Golden Revolution (John Wiley and Sons, 2012)"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"After hearing talk of this book for several years, I decided it was time to find out what all the fuss was about. What I discovered is that Atlas Shrugged is an affirmation of my basic beliefs regarding the individual and the role of government. For a book published 54 years ago, the parallels with our current version of the Federal government are chilling. The Bureaus and Agency's issuing edicts and regulations having the force of law cannot be ignored. For those of you who feel that bigger government exercising increased control over the individual and those who provide goods and services, Atlas Shrugged should be required reading. While the government depicted in the book is of necessity an extreme example, you cannot help but see the inexorable movement of our present day government in the same direction: exercising increasing control and greater centralization while making it more and more difficult for businesses to compete. The short-term \\"nationalization\\" of General Motors and Chrysler is ample evidence that the Government has both the capability and the willingness to take over an industry.Be afraid America.
